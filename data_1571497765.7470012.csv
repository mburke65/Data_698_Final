Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (D-VT) on Thursday, saying they do not “represent the Democratic Party.”

Neil Bluhm, a billionaire casino magnate and former Obama bundler, made the comment during a ritzy fundraiser hosted on Biden’s behalf at his Chicago, Illinois home. The former vice president did not correct Bluhm, according to The Chicago Sun Times, choosing instead to deliver a standard stump speech about Americans needing to be more optimistic.

Shortly after Bluhm’s comments broke on social media, the Sanders campaign responded by rebuking the billionaire donor and, in effect, Biden as well.

“Mr. Bluhm is right — the Democratic Party I represent is the party of the working class, not billionaires. That’s why we’re going to win,” the Sanders campaign said in a statement.

Bluhm’s criticism and the response it triggered underscores the internal divisions plaguing the Democratic Party ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Biden, despite having one of the most left-wing platforms of any Democrat frontrunner, is considered a moderate in comparison to the rest of the field. The image stems from the triangulation Biden has done over the span of his more than 40-year political career, especially on issues important to progressives like race, financial deregulation, and criminal justice.

The former vice president has also done little to appease the increasingly powerful left-wing of his party by aligning himself with the establishment in opposition to radical proposals like Medicare for All. Even Biden’s attempts to find common ground with progressives on climate change — by calling for an outright ban on coal — has been met with derision for not going far enough.

Sanders and Warren, on the other hand, are seen as progressive firebrands pushing the Democratic Party away from the Neoliberal policies of Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and towards the more centralized economies of Northern Europe. Along those lines, Warren and Sanders have championed a series of policies — ranging from free higher education, increased Wall Street regulation, and higher taxes on the wealthy, among others — to remake the American economy.

The divergence between the former vice president and Sanders and Warren has been no clearer than on the issue of Medicare for All. Biden has consistently attacked the universal healthcare plan, which is authored by Sanders, as overly ambitious and impossible to implement. The former vice president, who is trumpeting his own healthcare proposal centered on strengthening Obamacare and providing a public health insurance option, has also lambasted the proposal’s backers for not being upfront about its costs and consequences.

“Bernie’s been very honest about it. He said you’re going to have to raise taxes on the middle class. He said it’s going to end all private insurance. I mean, he’s been straightforward about it. And he’s making his case,” Biden told CNN in July, adding other Democrats have not been as transparent.

Sanders, Warren, and their allies have responded to such criticisms by accusing Biden of parroting Republican talking points on Medicare for All.

“The charge that he’s making is exactly what the Republicans are saying,” Sanders told the New York Times in July while excoriating Biden for siding with “insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industries” on the issue.

Many, however, have noted that the battle for Medicare for All is really just a proxy battle between the establishment, which is averse to change, and the grassroots. Biden, himself, seemed to hint at this when he promised at a June fundraiser that “nothing would fundamentally change” if he was elected president."

Tim Ryan (D-OH) suggested that the government needs to play a role in addressing overpopulation in the form of “family planning” during MSNBC’s climate change forum at Georgetown University on Thursday.

Ryan participated in the forum Thursday, where he was asked about “overpopulation” and its role in climate change.

“What effect do you feel that overpopulation has with global warming and should we be doing anything to combat this?” a student asked.

Ryan was perceptive to the premise of the question – that population control needs to be part of the climate change conversation.

“It’s about resources, so yeah,” Ryan said. “I mean, I think we should be active again with international agencies within the State Department.”

“Now the president wants once to cut the State Department budget dramatically,” he continued, adding that the U.S. needs to “be involved in the United Nations family planning efforts around the world.”

“I think we need to continue to do that. It’s an important approach that we need to continue to make,” he added.

Ryan’s remarks echo the call Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) made during CNN’s 7-hour climate change town hall this month. The socialist senator floated global population control during the forum after a woman asked if he would be “courageous enough to discuss this issue [population control] and make it a key feature of a plan to address climate catastrophe.”

“The answer is yes,” Sanders said, articulating his support of population control in the form of contraceptives and worldwide abortions.

“And the Mexico City agreement, which denies American aid to those organizations around the world that are – that allow women to have abortions or even get involved in birth control is totally absurd,” he continued.

“So I think especially in poor countries around the world, where women do not necessarily want to have large numbers of babies and where they can have the opportunity to birth control to control the number of kids they have is something I very, very strongly support,” he added.

Activists across the globe are taking part in a worldwide strike to protest climate change on Friday. Clips show thousands of people gathering in cities across the globe to stand against the “looming threat.” Protesters in the nation’s capital could be heard shouting, “Hey hey, ho ho. Climate change has got to go” and “Don’t eat cows, eat the rich.” Some activists took their positions a step further, telling Breitbart News that socialism and climate change activism go hand in hand."

* New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ended his Democratic presidential campaign this morning, explaining on MSNBC, “I feel like I have contributed all I can to this primary election. It’s clearly not my time.” There are still 19 candidates vying for the party’s nomination.

* Joe Biden’s presidential campaign picked up three notable congressional endorsements yesterday, receiving support from Reps. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.), G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.), and Charlie Crist (D-Fla.). Both Cleaver and Butterfield have served as chairs of the Congressional Black Caucus.

* Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign announced an impressive milestone yesterday: the Vermont senator became the first 2020 candidate to reach 1 million individual donors. Then-candidate Barack Obama also topped the million-donor mark in his 2008 race, but Sanders reached the threshold even faster.

* There’s been increased speculation in recent weeks about whether Rep. Lucy McBath (D) would run in one of Georgia’s two U.S. Senate races next year, but the first-term lawmaker announced yesterday that she would instead run for re-election to her U.S. House seat.

* The latest Monmouth University poll in New Jersey shows Sen. Cory Booker (D) popular in his home state, but that’s not translating into strong support for his presidential campaign. Biden leads the Democratic field in the Garden State with 26%, followed by Elizabeth Warren at 20%, and Sanders at 18%. Booker is fourth in New Jersey with 9%.

* A notable tidbit from this week’s Fox News poll: it not only shows Donald Trump trailing each of the top Democratic contenders in hypothetical general election match-ups, it also shows Democrats with an enthusiasm edge over Republicans.

* And in New Hampshire, where Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s former campaign manager, appears to be gearing up for a U.S. Senate race, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) announced yesterday that he’s supporting former state House Speaker Bill O’Brien for the GOP nomination. Sen.

Vincent Vernuccio is a senior fellow at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, which describes itself as an advocate for free markets and limited government and is a research and educational institute located in Midland, Michigan. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

After a recent corruption scandal and a failed organizing attempt, the United Auto Workers union is trying to flex its muscle with its strike against General Motors. But, by doing so, it risks further alienating the very members it aims to serve.

The labor union's show of strength so far has amounted to nearly 50,000 autoworkers indefinitely on strike with the promise of being compensated only $250 per week.

The strike comes at a great time for the scandal-ridden union. It offers the UAW the opportunity to restore its tarnished reputation with workers after several UAW officials were implicated in a federal probe last week concerning embezzled member dues. Expenses were reported for luxury items such as golf outings, expensive cigars and extended stays in private villas among other things, according to a federal criminal complaint. The union issued this statement in response to the probe: ""While these allegations are very concerning, we strongly believe that the government has misconstrued any number of facts and emphasize that these are merely allegations, not proof of wrongdoing.""

It makes you question whose best interest the UAW has in mind. On Sunday they rejected a contract offer from GM that met several of the union's demands and could have avoided a strike altogether. Instead, both workers and the company will experience losses while the UAW tries to play hard ball.

Surely, the UAW wants GM to experience some pain in order to demonstrate its value. But how long are they willing to wait it out when autoworkers' livelihoods are on the line, especially when a reasonable deal seems obtainable."

The US Chamber of Commerce's Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness released a new report detailing how financial transaction taxes would hurt US taxpayers, investors, and consumers.

Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and others have proposed taxing trades to raise revenue for various plans.

But there's debate over how much the taxes would actually raise, and what costs investors would pay.

Countries that do have successful financial transaction taxes largely include exemptions for market makers and high frequency traders, which US plans aim to curb.

Read more on Markets Insider.

The US Chamber of Commerce's Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness has released a new report detailing how a financial transaction tax would hurt US taxpayers, investors, and consumers. Such taxes have been proposed and highly touted by Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris.

""Main street will pay for the tax, not Wall Street,"" wrote the report's author, James Angel, an associate professor of finance at Georgetown University.

""It won't punish bad actors or prevent the next financial crisis, or even tame market volatility,"" he continued. ""Instead, it will punish all Americans through depressed asset values, making saving enough for retirement even harder.""

Angel also said it could result in higher consumer prices, fewer jobs, and damaged financial markets.

While Sanders has proposed a financial transaction tax to pay for his ""College for all and cancel all student debt"" plan, Harris has designs on it funding her ""Medicare for all"" proposal.

Beyond the 2020 campaign trail, a few key pieces of legislation have been proposed in that call for a tax on trades — The Wall Street Tax Act by Senator Brian Schatz and Representative Peter DeFazio, and the Inclusive Prosperity Act of 2019, introduced in May by Sanders and Representative Barbara Lee to ""curb Wall Street greed.""

The Inclusive Prosperity Act outlines a tax of 0.5% for stocks, 0.1% for bonds, and 0.005% for derivatives — similar to Sanders' ""College for all"" plan. This is the structure most organizations use to model the impact of a tax on trades.

Here are some arguments cited in the Chamber of Commerce's study:

Some experts think average Americans will incur additional costs

The US Chamber of Commerce report argues that, over a lifetime, Sanders' plan would create a ""serious dent"" in retirement portfolios to the tune of a roughly 8.5% drop in accumulation.

Here's how it shakes out: A worker who saved $1,500 each year for 46 years in a fund earning 5% annually would see an approximately $20,000 drop in average lifetime retirement savings from the tax, according to Angel's math.

A recent study by the Modern Markets Initiative also detailed how much a tax on trades would cost retirement savers, as well as pension funds, 529 college savings plans, and university endowments — and didn't paint a particularly rosy picture.

The taxes likely wouldn't raise the money they claim they would

Sanders claims his plan will raise roughly $2.2 trillion over a 10-year period, which would be used to service the $1.6 trillion of outstanding student loan debt held by 45 million Americans.

But Angel says it's unlikely the plan would raise that much.

""FTTs rarely raise the desired net revenue because of their imact on trading volume along with the damage to other tax revenue through decreased capital gains and lower economic activity,"" he wrote.

Meanwhile, it's worth noting that when Sanders proposed a similar plan in 2016, the Tax Policy Center concluded that the plan would generate $400 billion over a decade — not $3 trillion as he claimed.

This was attributed to the idea that a tax on trades would discourage trading, hence bringing in less revenue through the tax.

""An FTT has merits,"" wrote Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. ""But its ability to raise revenue is limited because trading will decline and perhaps migrate to markets not subject to the tax.""

The proposed plans don't look like ones in other countries

Financial transaction taxes do exist in other countries, with various degrees of success. In the US, most plans propose a tax as a way to curb high-frequency trading and rein in Wall Street in addition to raising revenue.

But Angel argues that not all high-frequency trading is bad.

""HFTs such as market makers are not screwing regular people,"" Angel wrote. ""They are providing beneficial services to investors when they want to buy or sell stocks.""

In other countries that tax trading, there are exemptions for market makers who are seen doing beneficial work. The UK, France, and Italy all exempt market makers from financial transaction taxes, Angel wrote.

That's something not included in the current versions of US proposals. Dean Baker, the co-director for the Center for Economic and Policy Research, said he recommends market makers pay the tax and then apply for a refund later for trades conducted to make the market.

""I think it would be desirable to put that exemption in,"" Baker told Markets Insider. ""They do play a useful role. The point is to distinguish between when they're making the market and when they're trading on their own behalf.""

There is also debate over how much of a tax is appropriate to bring in revenue and not slow markets too much.

""The Sanders plan is higher than I would go,"" Baker said.

His worry is that at a higher tax rate, investors may be incentivized to avoid the tax by hiding trades. He says that a 0.2% tax on stock trades might be a better balance.

""There would be much less gaming"" at that level, he said. ""You can't with a straight face say it would bring the markets crashing down."""

“Throughout the campaign, Sanders has stood on multiple picket lines with workers and has used his email and text lists to urge his supporters to stand with striking workers across the country,” his campaign stated.

“In August, he released his Workplace Democracy Plan, which would double union membership during his term and give workers unprecedented protections in the workplace,” it continued.

However, one of Sanders’ visits will occur Wednesday, days after presidential rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) visit with the striking auto workers. She is expected to join the United Auto Workers “on the picket line outside GM’s Detroit-Hamtramck plant on Sunday,” according to Reuters.

Sanders, for his part, has told GM to “end the greed, sit down with the UAW and work out an agreement that treats your workers with the respect and the dignity they deserve,” Reuters reports.

Warren and Sanders have been attempting to assert themselves as the most pro-worker candidates. Both contenders have made time for protesting workers on the campaign trail, joining food workers in a minimum wage protest at Reagan National Airport over the summer:

However, the Sanders campaign was livid, with members of his campaign calling the report “100 percent wrong” and “bullshit”:

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) responded to a letter on Thursday, which accused some of his supporters of making “hateful, violent and racist threats” toward people associated with the Working Families Party, which endorsed his rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).

Black leaders – including Black Lives Matter leaders, like co-founder Patrisse Cullors – signed a letter, which condemned the “hateful, violent, and racist threats” from people who identify as Sanders supporters. A draft of the letter, obtained by Splinter News, claimed that Sanders supporters have called black leaders “Uncle Tom,” “Slave,” and “Cunt.” The alleged threats followed Sanders’ loss of the WFP endorsement, according to the letter.

The letter, via Splinter, reads in part:

The WFP made a decision, with its members and supporters and staff, and there is now conflict over the substance of that decision. But let’s also be clear — the WFP is under new leadership. For the first time in its history, Maurice Mitchell, a Black man with decades of experience building movements and strengthening our democracy, alongside Nelini Stamp, a working class, woman of color and a gifted organizer with a long list of accomplishments, are now at the helm of the Party, where they should be. And apparently, some folks aren’t happy about it. These incredible leaders who led an organization to take a risk by lifting up the leadership of Black, Latinx, Asian and Pacific Islander and white communities in coalescing around a candidate with enough time to engage their communities deeply ahead of the 2020 election, are being threatened on a daily basis, by self-identified Sanders supporters, with hateful, violent and racist threats. “Uncle Tom.” “Slave.” “Cunt.” These kinds of threats have no place in our movements, and are reminiscent of the threats Black people would receive when daring to vote even though the white supremacists would try and discourage Black people from doing so. The virulent, racist attacks on these leaders are unacceptable and dangerous. What do we do when racism and sexism is present in progressive movements? What is the prospect of strengthening democracy when old habits just won’t die? Many of us, the undersigned, are no stranger to these kinds of attacks—too many of us receive threats like these ones every day because we dare to organize our people towards freedom. But if we hope to take back this democracy, if we dare to struggle for electoral justice, if we really want a world where Black lives do in fact matter, all of us must take a stand against these real and persistent threats. … We refuse to concede to white terror from the Left as well as the Right. We can argue about the differences between Sanders and Warren, but not if we can’t be distinguished from our real opposition.

The leaders continued, demanding the Sanders campaign “unequivocally denounce the racism in its ranks, and issue a public statement separating themselves from these abhorrent attacks.” They also urged Democrats across the board – both Sanders supporters and Warren supporters – to come together to “defeat one of the most serious threats to peace and justice in our lifetimes.”

“We cannot wait to make justice real amongst the resisters — our lives literally depend on each other,” the leaders added in the letter.

In a tweet on Thursday afternoon, Sanders seemingly responded to the letter’s call for swift condemnation.

“This campaign condemns racist bullying and harassment of any kind, in any space,” Sanders tweeted. “We are building a multiracial movement for justice — that’s how we win the White House”:

National co-chair for the Sanders campaign, Nina Turner, also condemned the alleged threats outlined in the letter.

“Anyone directing racist, sexist &otherwise personally derogatory tweets/messages towards @MauriceWFP or anyone on his team @WorkingFamilies is a coward and is not in alignment w/ @BernieSanders or our collective mission,” she wrote:

The Sanders campaign signaled concern after losing the WFP endorsement to Warren, shaking up campaign staff in both New Hampshire and Iowa.

“Senator Warren strikes fear into the hearts of the robber barons who rigged the system, and offers hope to millions of working people who have been shut out of our democracy and economy,” WFP’s National Party Director Maurice Mitchell said of the Massachusetts senator following the coveted endorsement."

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) on Saturday officially unveiled his plan to eliminate $81 billion of medical debt, detailing the proposal on his website.

Sanders, who has promised to overhaul the healthcare system by abolishing private insurance and implementing Medicare for All, released his official plan in a tweet linking to his website Saturday, writing, “79 million Americans are burdened by medical debt for the ‘crime’ of getting sick. We’re going to eliminate all past-due medical debt”:

79 million Americans are burdened by medical debt for the “crime” of getting sick. We’re going to eliminate all past-due medical debt. #EliminateMedicalDebt https://t.co/J8vjSLbTQ0 — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 21, 2019

He states on his website:

“It is immoral and unconscionable that families across the country are being evicted, having their heat disconnected, or having their already-inadequate wages garnished because of crippling medical debt while the health care industry made more than $100 billion in profits last year.

Sanders’ plan would erase $81 billion in medical debt via negotiations between the federal government and “collections that have been reported to credit agencies.” However, he does not explicitly detail how he will pay for the expensive proposal.

“We’re addressing it on both ends.” Sanders said of his healthcare overhaul, according to the New York Times.“We’re addressing it now by trying to help the people who have past-due medical bills.”

“And we’re addressing it by finally creating a healthcare system that guarantees coverage to people without any premiums, without any deductibles, without any out-of-pocket expenses,” he added.

Another big piece of his proposal involves reforming the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, which Sanders calls a “disastrous piece of legislation that benefited Wall Street and the credit card companies while causing severe economic pain and financial distress for ordinary Americans throughout the country”:

The bankruptcy bill reinforced and strengthened a rigged financial system that disproportionately harms African American borrowers and makes debt relief and forgiveness harder to obtain. Not only must we eliminate past-due medical debt, we must also reform our corrupt bankruptcy system to make it easier to discharge medical bills put on credit cards and other forms of payment, and ensure this debt does not follow patients going forward.

The plan also calls to “end abusive and harassing debt collection practices,” which he will do, in part, by limiting both the contact attempts between debt collectors and individuals and “assets that can be seized and the wages that can be garnished.”

Sanders also proposes to reform the current lending system — specifically “for-profit credit registries” like Equifax:

Credit scores also systematically perpetuate gaps in wealth and inequality between white and minority consumers. For millions of Americans, one unforeseen medical emergency or illness could send a family into financial destitution or a spiraling debt trap. We must and we will remove the profit motive from assessing the creditworthiness of American consumers. We will establish a public registry that will end racial biases in credit scores and ensure those with medical debt are not penalized for the “crime” of getting sick.

The socialist senator previewed his overhaul in a tweet last month, signaling his intention to “cancel all $81 billion in existing past-due medical debt”:

It is nothing less than barbaric that the leading cause of bankruptcy in America is medical debt. These people didn't spend all their money on luxury items. Their crime was that they got sick. We are going to cancel all $81 billion in existing past-due medical debt. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) August 31, 2019

The announcement follows Sanders’ proposal to erase $1.6 trillion in student loan debt."

“In America today, it is unacceptable that one out of every six Americans have past-due medical bills on their credit report, totaling $81 billion,” Sen. Sanders, I-Vt., said in a statement, adding: ""It is immoral and unconscionable that families across the country are being evicted, having their heat disconnected, or having their already-inadequate wages garnished because of crippling medical debt while the health care industry made more than $100 billion in profits last year.""

SUPREME COURT COULD HEAR GROUNDBREAKING CASE THAT CHALLENGES UN IMMUNITY

Under his plan, Sanders said, the federal government would step in for the individual to negotiate and pay off past-due medical bills in collections reported to credit agencies.

Sanders also vowed to create a public credit registry to replace the three for-profit credit reporting agencies in order to, as he put it: “remove the profit motive from assessing the creditworthiness of American consumers.” He said the registry would use ""public, transparent algorithm to determine creditworthiness that eliminates racial biases in credit scores.""

The self-described democratic socialist added that he would exclude medical debt from credit reports and end credit checking for rental housing, employment, insurance and other non-lending practices.

BIDEN GOES ON THE ATTACK OVER UKRAINE CONTROVERSY, PLEDGES TO BEAT TRUMP 'LIKE A DRUM'

Sanders made no mention in the proposal of how he planned to cover the $81 billion cost. According to Reuters, the Sanders campaign has said they would pay for the debt elimination proposal through a tax on corporations based on their pay for chief executives. The details of that proposal have not been released.

During an interview with Fox News Sept. 3, Sanders acknowledged that $81 billion is ""a lot of money,"" but he added, ""Compared to what? Compared to the $1.5 trillion that Trump gave in tax breaks to the one percent and large corporations. Compared to the billions of dollars that we spent bailing out the crooks on Wall Street 11 years ago. It is a lot of money but I think it’s the right thing to do.”

Sanders was one of the earliest supporters of “Medicare-for-All,” which would replace job-based and individual health insurance with a government-run plan. Other top Democratic rivals have expressed interest in a toned-down version of Medicare-for-All. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. has endorsed Sanders' plan but said there may be different ways to achieve coverage for all. Former Vice President Joe Biden has called to extend the Affordable Care Act by adding a public option.

Sanders has also released a plan to eliminate $1.6 trillion in student loan debt while also making public college tuition-free.

As for where he draws the line in wiping out debt, Sanders in his Sept. 3 interview said ""there's a difference"" between wiping out medical debt and credit card debt. ""I don't believe we wipe out credit card debt. You want something, you pay for it.,"" he said. ""If you want to go out and buy a fancy house, you want to go out and buy a yacht, and you go in debt, hey that’s your decision…But I do believe we have to make a distinction. Getting cancer is not your decision. And I think we have a moral obligation to do everything we can to cancel that debt.”"

“Guaranteed housing, add that to the list of socialist agenda items that sound good to some, but in reality, are just big government solutions that move our nation away from freedom and closer to socialism,” said Lahren on Fox Nation’s “Final Thoughts.”

TRUMP SAYS CALIFORNIA CITIES 'DESTROY THEMSELVES' WITH HOMELESSNESS

On Wednesday, Sanders unveiled his “Housing for All” plan. The progressive senator said there’s a shortage of 7.4 million affordable homes for the lowest-income renters. And he stressed that more than 18 million families across the country are paying more than half of their limited incomes on housing and utilities.

A spokesman for President Trump's reelection campaign called it ""yet another pie-in-the-sky, big government socialist promise by the Bernie camp.""

Lahren panned the plan as “another giant, expensive federal program” and blasted Sanders’ plan to pay for it all.

“How does he plan to pay for it? The way all these Democrats plan to pay for their radical proposals, taxation. Bernie claims a wealth tax on the top 1/10 of 1 percent of Americans will fund his initiative.”

She continued, “Well, folks, he and others in his party already plan to dump the burden of Medicare-for-all, free college, medical debt cancellation, and the Green New Deal on the backs of the wealthy. Do they really think the top 1 percent can afford to fund the entire nation? Total income confiscation wouldn’t pay for all those programs!”

Lahren argued that increasing taxes on the wealthy encourages them to move, leaving the middle class to foot the bill.

“Here’s the thing about wealth, Bernie, it’s MOBILE. Meaning the wealthiest Americans are not going to sit idly by as their incomes are confiscated to fund your big government pie-in-the-sky plans,” Lahren said.

She continued, “Then what? What happens when the richest Americans take their money elsewhere? Who pays for these quasi-socialist plans? Answer, we do. The middle class, the average American.”

The concern that the wealthy may move to avoid paying taxes is not a hypothetical, according to Lahren. She said that is exactly what has happened in her state.

“That’s why the middle class has been driven out of places like California, for cryin’ out loud. It’s only affordable for the exorbitantly wealthy and the homeless!”

LAHREN ON AMERICAN UNITY AFTER 9/11: 'WE HAVE JUST LOST IT SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY'

Finally, Lahren said that Sanders’ proposal would not decrease homelessness.

“I live in California, the state that is comprised of 47 percent of all unsheltered people in the nation. Yet what do we do here in California? We add more taxes, more regulations, more control on top of already cash-strapped residents and families. Here’s what else I know, throwing more government and more taxpayer dollars at the problem does not solve the problem. If it did we wouldn’t be in this predicament right here in California.”

Lahren concluded, “When will these socialist wannabes figure it out? Throwing taxpayer dollars, big government and entitlement at the problem does not solve the problem. It just moves our nation one dangerous step closer to socialism. Maybe that’s what people like Bernie want but it’s up to us to stand in his way.”

It’s no exaggeration, I promise.

Progressive political elites have decided that in order to save the environment, ordinary citizens must submit to radical lifestyle changes (while those same elites fly around the world on private jets and enrich themselves from trade with China, the world’s biggest polluter).

The reality may even be worse than the headline. Not only have progressive environmentalists suggested that we all switch to a diet of bugs instead of meat (especially steak, because cow farts produce carbon dontcha know), one Swedish scientist even suggested we devour the flesh of deceased humans to cut greenhouse emissions.

This followed an article published by Newsweek in which two psychologists mused on the human taboo against cannibalism, noting that “philosophers have argued that burying the dead could be wasteful in the context of the fight against world hunger.”

Cannibalism for the climate — that’s how far they’ve gone!

Population control is another solution embraced by geniuses on the left. This dystopian idea attracted attention recently after Bernie Sanders brought it up at the last Democrat presidential debate, saying people need to be educated on the “need to curb population growth.”

But Sanders was merely popularizing an idea that’s long been the dream of progressive environmentalists. A 2009 study estimated that every human child will produce, on average, 9,441 metric tons of carbon dioxide. As such, climate scientists were agitating for global population control long before Bernie made his comments.

Looks like China, despite its pollution, does have something to offer the environmental movement — the one-child policy!

Absent from Bernie’s argument in favor of curbing the population was an acknowledgment of what it’ll do to the economy and public services, two things that the socialist senator allegedly cares about. An aging populace with fewer young people producing tax revenue means a crisis for public services and a shrinking economy. Of course, progressives believe in opening the west’s borders to admit millions of working-age people from foreign countries, so maybe that’s their solution.

Don’t forget that we all have to stop driving if we want to save the climate, which means we all have to pack ourselves into dense, unaffordable cities instead of living in the suburbs. As left-wing environmentalists remind us, “suburban sprawl” also “contributes significantly to deforestation.”

But are there enough affordable homes in the cities?

Well, that depends on how you define “a home.” Is a recycled sewer pipe a home? The OPod Tube House is the latest “solution” imagined for young people who can’t afford a real house or apartment in the city. These “homes” are constructed from recycled industrial piping, and are designed to be stacked on top of each other.

If that isn’t enough of a dystopian cyberpunk nightmare for you, consider “parasite pods” — small homes designed to be attached to larger structures like skyscrapers and bridges. They’re “parasitic” — and we must credit the architectural students who came up with the concept for their refreshingly honest choice of name — because they cling to larger structures. Are you ready to be a parasite, for the environment?

Fried insects for lunch, in your parasite pod, single-occupancy of course. Cycle everywhere, unless you want to face crippling carbon taxes. Drink your iced latte with a paper straw, don’t have kids, and when you die, remember to donate your human flesh to a local restaurant.

Meanwhile, our ruling class continues to fly to climate change summits on private jets, own multiple CO2-emitting homes, and advocate for unrestricted trade with pollution world champ China. Do globalist progressive elites really not know why so many ordinary people hate them?

In a wide-ranging interview with HuffPost, the Democratic presidential hopeful said he once shared progressives’ skepticism of nuclear power but became convinced that reaching net-zero emissions from the utility sector by 2030 was impossible without the source that generates more power than all forms of renewables combined. … “As much as we say the Republicans when it comes to climate change must listen to science, our party has the same obligation to listen to scientists,” Booker said. “The data speaks for itself.” … “If we had a president who was going to pull us out of nuclear, we’d be more reliant on fossil fuels,” Booker said. “It’s as simple as that.”

As Breitbart News reported, Booker told the CNN town hall that “people who think we can get” to zero emissions by 2030 “without nuclear being part of the blend just aren’t looking at the facts.”

Of the frontrunners for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, only former vice president Joe Biden has not ruled out nuclear energy. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) both reject it. Businessman Andrew Yang is the only other Democratic candidate, aside from Booker, who has fully embraced nuclear energy.

Mason, who works at one of the sharpest sportsbooks (perhaps with the exception of New England Patriots lines), on Thursday tweeted a screenshot of his shop’s odds and said that it is “interesting” that Yang “has the best chance of beating” Trump if Yang somehow gets his party’s nomination.

Interesting… According to the odds, @AndrewYang has the best chance of beating @realDonaldTrump. Head-to-head matchups: pic.twitter.com/7tBtkipJSv — Dave Mason (@DaveMasonBOL) September 19, 2019

Trump is the biggest underdog (+150) when matched up against Yang, and the president is actually the biggest favorite (-200) against former Vice President Joe Biden, according to Betonline’s odds. Trump is a slight underdog against Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and a potential race between Trump and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is essentially a tossup (-120).

Yang, who has called himself Trump’s “kryptonite,” has been making the case on the stump that he actually gives Democrats obsessed with ousting the president the best chance of defeating Trump because, in addition to progressives, Yang also brings in disaffected Trump voters and some libertarians into the fold as well.

As Breitbart News has noted, Trump revealed at a campaign rally that the “only thing” the president worries “about is that some total unknown that nobody’s ever heard of comes along” and gets the nomination. Yang and his allies believe Yang is that non-establishment politician who can give the Trump campaign the most trouble.

Forbes has also speculated that Yang “just might be that unknown” Trump fears because the entrepreneur “seems to be the only Democratic candidate thus far that understands the psychology of persuasion.”

After a recent Emerson New Hampshire poll found that only Biden did better against Trump in a potential general election battle in the Granite State (Yang beat Trump by eight percentage points in the poll), the hashtag “#YangBeatsTrump” trended for days.

Yang is in sixth place in polling average, but he is still well behind Biden, Sanders, and Warren in every state and national poll."

Tim Ryan (D-OH) suggested that the government needs to play a role in addressing overpopulation in the form of “family planning” during MSNBC’s climate change forum at Georgetown University on Thursday.

Ryan participated in the forum Thursday, where he was asked about “overpopulation” and its role in climate change.

“What effect do you feel that overpopulation has with global warming and should we be doing anything to combat this?” a student asked.

Ryan was perceptive to the premise of the question – that population control needs to be part of the climate change conversation.

“It’s about resources, so yeah,” Ryan said. “I mean, I think we should be active again with international agencies within the State Department.”

“Now the president wants once to cut the State Department budget dramatically,” he continued, adding that the U.S. needs to “be involved in the United Nations family planning efforts around the world.”

“I think we need to continue to do that. It’s an important approach that we need to continue to make,” he added.

Ryan’s remarks echo the call Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) made during CNN’s 7-hour climate change town hall this month. The socialist senator floated global population control during the forum after a woman asked if he would be “courageous enough to discuss this issue [population control] and make it a key feature of a plan to address climate catastrophe.”

“The answer is yes,” Sanders said, articulating his support of population control in the form of contraceptives and worldwide abortions.

“And the Mexico City agreement, which denies American aid to those organizations around the world that are – that allow women to have abortions or even get involved in birth control is totally absurd,” he continued.

“So I think especially in poor countries around the world, where women do not necessarily want to have large numbers of babies and where they can have the opportunity to birth control to control the number of kids they have is something I very, very strongly support,” he added.

Activists across the globe are taking part in a worldwide strike to protest climate change on Friday. Clips show thousands of people gathering in cities across the globe to stand against the “looming threat.” Protesters in the nation’s capital could be heard shouting, “Hey hey, ho ho. Climate change has got to go” and “Don’t eat cows, eat the rich.” Some activists took their positions a step further, telling Breitbart News that socialism and climate change activism go hand in hand."

Fellow presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) not only praised the march but pointed to Amazon Employees For Climate Justice, a group of Amazon employees who say it is their “responsibility to ensure our business models don’t contribute to the climate crisis,” as a model for how large corporations can help combat so-called global warming.

“Climate change is an existential threat—and we are already facing the effects. The youth-led #ClimateStrike and the solidarity strikes from groups like @AMZNforClimate show that our country is ready to fight for the big, structural change we’ll need to tackle the climate crisis,” tweeted Warren.

Tens of thousands of people around the world skipped school Friday as part of a coordinated global strike, one of the largest environmental protests in history.

More than 2,500 strikes and other activities are planned in 156 countries for Friday and September 27th as part of the Global Climate Strike — a show of opposition toward what organizers say is government inaction in fighting climate change.

Major American cities including Washington, D.C., Boston, Seattle, Minneapolis, Miami, Los Angeles, and Denver will hold events — but the largest is expected to take place in New York City, where the United Nations Climate Action Summit is set for Monday. The high-level summit will evaluate plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris climate agreement.

An estimated 1.1 million students were allowed to skip school after the city announced they wouldn’t be penalized for missing school if they attended the strike.

The strikes are an offshoot of the Fridays for the Future movement, which was started by now-famous 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. Students worldwide participated in strikes from school every Friday to demand their governments solve the climate crisis.

Greta sailed to the United States on a racing sailboat. She and other young activists will speak at 12 p.m. EDT Friday. Thunberg is also scheduled to speak at the U.N. summit Monday.

She testified in Congress earlier this week and will lead a demonstration at New York City’s Foley Square on Friday afternoon before attending Monday’s climate summit.

“I don’t want you to listen to me. I want you to listen to the scientists and I want you to unite behind the science,” she told lawmakers Wednesday at a joint session of the House climate crisis committee and House foreign affairs subcommittee. “And then I want you to take real action.”

BOOKER VOICES CONCERNS OVER BIDEN'S ABILITY 'TO CARRY THE BALL'

The existence of the memo was first reported Saturday morning by NBC News, with Fox News confirming the news with multiple sources.

Two sources, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely, said it was no accident that the memo was leaked, and described it as an effort to spark a surge in fundraising over the next 10 days.

And a campaign memo sent to political reporters Saturday morning said: “This isn't an end-of-quarter stunt or another one of those memos from a campaign trying to spin the press. This is a real, unvarnished look under the hood of our operation at a level of transparency unprecedented in modern presidential campaigns.”

Booker, who declared his candidacy for the White House in early February, quickly built a formidable operation in the early voting primary and caucus states. The large staff on the ground in Iowa, New Hampshire, and other early voting states is expensive to maintain. Demissie warned that while the campaign can continue at its current size and strength, it needs more funding if it wants to expand.

Demissie explained in his memo ""If our campaign is not in a financial position to grow, he’s not going to continue to consume resources and attention that can be used to focus on beating Donald Trump, which needs to be everyone's first priority.”

While Booker qualified for the third and fourth round Democratic presidential primary debates, he’s struggled in polling, averaging in the low to mid-single digits, far behind top-tier contenders former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

Alek Skarlatos, who was one of three Americans who stopped an attempted terrorist attack while in France, implored attendees to stand up for liberty.

“I think that socialism is leading us in the absolutely wrong direction for this country. I think that everyone in this country has a right to defend themselves. And I mean, I carry a gun on me everyday,” said Skarlatos, who served in the Army National Guard and is now running for Congress in Oregon’s 4th Congressional District.

“This next election is going to be incredibly important, to take a stand against socialism simply because the Democrats have gotten increasingly more socialist. Even if you just look at the presidential candidates, you have Beto O’Rourke saying, ‘We’re going to come take your AR-15s, your AK-47s.’ That’s something that not even Democrats — just going back to last cycle — would never admit publicly. Now we know what their true agenda is,” he said.

“It’s all about personal liberty, and not using our taxpayer dollars to pay for other people’s lives,” he argued.

“How can the richest country in South America become the poorest in South America?” he asked. “There is only one word: Socialism.”

Morgan Zegars, founder of Young Americans Against Socialism, spoke about the spread of socialism among young Americans.

“My generation was raised on participation trophies. So we lack those values of hard work. We went through the education system where we weren’t really taught about the dangers of socialism and communism,” she said.

“It’s official. There are polls that will say that a majority of young Americans, my generation, would choose socialism over capitalism. It’s official. So we’ve got to do something about it,” she said.

“Politicians are training my generation to accept the idea of wealth distribution by saying, ‘You have a lot of debt, these evil rich people, the one percent, the millionaires and billionaires,’ as Bernie likes to say, they have all the money and we’re going to give it to you because you deserve it, you just have to give us power,” she added.

He warned that socialists were trying to take away Americans’ power by allowing non-citizens voting rights.

“Socialism is an anathema to freedom and liberty. It is an anathema to free enterprise. And it guarantees one thing — that’s economic failure and poverty,” he said.

Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ), another member of the House Freedom Caucus, spoke at the rally. “You see all the Democratic nominees for president running right now. They want to take from you, to redistribute wealth, we should never stand for that.”

“The spirit of the Constitution lives on in our hearts. It’s made a difference in who we elect. And for many of us it makes a big difference — all the difference — in how we vote,” he said.

“Socialism, my friends, is not compatible with the U.S. Constitution. It doesn’t belong on U.S. soil, let’s keep it out,” he added.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) delivered an impassioned rebuke of Democrat candidates’ economic plans, which he said would raise taxes for Americans.

“You see them embracing positions as they gallop to the left, further and further and further left, every one of them is saying we’re going to raise your taxes. Every one of them is saying we are going to triple the price of gas at the gas pump,” he said.

“Every one of them is supporting open borders. And not only that, they’re saying we got to provide free taxpayer health care for every illegal alien in America,” he said. “You want to know what those Democrats are all about, they’re all about socialism.”

Cruz, whose father was born in Cuba, urged Americans to look at how socialism worked in other countries:

Look at Venezuela. Look at Cuba. Look at Nicaragua. Did you know that in 1950 Venezuela was the fourth wealthiest country on the face of the earth? … Today people are literally starving in the streets, they’re eating from trashcans. And what are the people’s nationalist Democrats who are running now say, ‘Let’s bring more of that here.’

Conservative host and author Mark Levin also spoke to the crowd. (Credit: Matt Perdie / Breitbart News)

“The greatest enemy poverty has ever seen in the history of humanity is the American free enterprise system,” he added.

Jennifer Zeng, who escaped socialist China and is a member of the Falun Gong, a group persecuted in China, shared a gripping story of being arrested four times in China, imprisoned in a labor camp, and tortured.

She said labor camp prisoners were forced to squat outside in the hot sun with their hands behind their head. If any fainted, they would be prodded with an electric rod so they would regain consciousness and continue squatting, she said. She said they were also forced into slave labor for products that would be exported, including to the U.S.

“I never wanted to live in any sort of socialism again. But here in the U.S. I’m starting to feel that it has followed me…the majority of young Americans are attracted by it,” she said, adding:

The [Chinese Communist Party] controls everything…it can make all the rules, it can take away people’s liberty, property, and dignity, and persecute them at will,” she said. “Socialists promise heaven on earth but always end up giving you a one-way ticket to hell.”

Mark Levin, a popular conservative personality and author, fired up the crowd towards the end of the rally.

“We are here today because we believe in one word. Liberty. Socialism is the opposite of liberty. Under socialism you surrender your heart, your soul, and your mind to Elizabeth Warren, to Bernie Sanders, and Corey Booker, and the rest of them,” he said. He continued:

When I hear them pushing their leftwing progressive agenda…telling us this country was founded in slavery, they’re very confused, they must be talking about Red China, they must be talking about the Red Soviet Union and Russia, they must be talking about modern day Iran and North Korea. Look around you, this is liberty. You’re free to move. Mobility! You’re free to speak! You’re free to start your own press enterprise! You are free people! In the vast majority of the world, people are not free, they’re starving, they don’t have a roof over their head. They have nothing and not one damn one of those countries is capitalist. That’s what the framers of the Constitution gave us — life, liberty, happiness and prosperity, and I’ll be damned if we’re going to swap Elizabeth Warren for James Madison, and I’ll be damned if we’re going to swap Bernie Sanders for George Washington, and I’ll be damned if we’re going to swap any one of them for any of our founders and framers of the Constitution.

Levin also blasted the mainstream media, arguing that they are doing more harm to a free press than the government could ever do.

“We don’t have a free press. We have a modern mass media filled with progressives and ideologues and Democrats and social activists who have done more to destroy freedom of the press more than any government to do,” he said.

“We, average Americans, we live better than any human beings lived on the planet before,” he said. “This election is a choice between … capitalism and socialism. It’s a choice between liberty and tyranny.”

“This can be lost. And in most societies it is lost. … that is left to us,” he warned. “We are here to tell the press and the Congress that we are not going anywhere.”

He finished with a message to President Trump: “Stand strong, keep in the fight, we back you. Because you stand between us and them.”

Elizabeth Warren to historical icon Frederick Douglass -- over the way they posed for photos.

WaPo reporter Hannah Natanson began her piece by pointing out that 19th century abolitionist Douglass (1818-1895) ""appears alone in almost every photograph, staring down the camera in isolated, thoughtful splendor,"" while Warren ""features today in countless iPhone photos and Instagram feeds, her arm around voter after voter, always bearing the same wide grin.""

""The two are separated by race, gender and more than 100 years of history that forged an America that would probably be unrecognizable to Douglass,"" Nathanson wrote. ""Still, experts say, their use of photography collapses the distance: Douglass sat for scores of pictures to normalize the idea of black excellence and equality, and Warren’s thousands of selfies with supporters could do the same for a female president.""

WARREN GETS STUMPED BY COLBERT WHEN PRESSED ON MIDDLE-CLASS TAX HIKES TO FUND MEDICARE-FOR-ALL

The piece goes on to cite professors who support the comparison presented by Natanson that both Warren and Douglass were ""smashing stereotypes.""

“She’s presenting a public image of herself as somebody who is presidential,” Columbia University professor Alexander Alberro said. “What Douglass tried to do was to create a public persona in the face of the negative type of image of African Americans at the time … so I think the comparison is really good.”

Louisiana State University professor Nichole Bauer suggested that even if Warren goes on to defeat in 2020, her ""million selfies are just a little bit more of a crack in that glass ceiling.”

Still, the comparison raised many eyebrows on social media.

Journalist Jordan Chariton went even further, accusing The Washington Post of ""propping up"" Warren and ""defeating"" her progressive opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.

Members of the Hawkeye Marching Band allege that they were subjected to racial slurs and other verbal abuse, and sexual harassment before, during and after the game. Two band members told the Cedar Rapids Gazette that a third band member, a woman was hospitalized with fractured ribs.

Administrators at the two schools announced earlier in the week that they had looked into the allegations, but they didn't say whether anyone would face punishment. Iowa's athletic director, Gary Barta, and his Iowa State counterpart, Jamie Pollard, released a joint statement saying members of both schools' bands had been subjected to ""rude, vulgar, and in some cases violent"" conduct at football games in recent years, and urging fans to stop the behavior.

FOOTBALL FAN WHO REQUESTED BEER MONEY ON TV REVEALS HE'S RAISED $820G FOR CHILDREN'S CHARITY

In response, 21-year-old Corey Knopp, who plays tenor sax for the Iowa Marching Band, posted his account of the abuse following the game, which Iowa won 18-17.

""People were physically assaulted,"" Knopp said. ""We expect to get booed and cussed at. But never for violence to take place...Put yourself in our shoes. Kids. Marching in formation back to our busses after a long day. Getting shoved and having beer cans shaken and sprayed at our feet. Getting slapped because of the words on our uniform (IOWA). Getting pushed so hard that someone’s (not going to name this person) ribs are broken. That is completely unacceptable.""

BERNIE SANDERS' IOWA POLITICAL DIRECTOR HAS LEFT CAMPAIGN, REPORTS SAY

Knopp also detailed to the Gazette how an Iowa State fan shoved him as they were marching back to the team buses.

""He decided to cut through the band and shoved me out of his way. I yelled, ‘Do not put your hands on me sir,’ and he yelled back, ‘F--k you.’”

Nathan Topping, a 19-year-old trumpet player, told the Gazette a full beer bottle was thrown at him, causing what he described as a ""nasty bruise.""

""It was the fans,"" said Paige Pearson, 20, who plays trumpet in the Iowa band. ""The Iowa State band has been nothing but kind. They've reached out to us and said sorry this happened. It was not even the students, but adult fans.""

University of Iowa spokeswoman Jeneane Beck said Friday that the social media posts made it clear that the university hadn’t adequately conveyed to its students what it had done to address the band members’ concerns, the Gazette reported.

“Student safety is our number one priority and we are committed to ensuring a safe experience on game day for our students,” Beck said. “Additionally we are continuing our investigation to ensure all of our students have the ability to share their experiences with the appropriate authorities.”

The 40-year-old actress, who is dating 2020 presidential hopeful Sen. Cory Booker, shared her thoughts in an article for The Daily Beast in which she pulled no punches speaking about the Trump administration's rhetoric on immigration, directly linking it to the Aug. 3 shooting in Texas.

“The story that the current administration repeats ad nauseam is about a “violent invasion” of immigrant hordes — the exact same words used by the gunman who targeted our Latino community and shot down 22 innocent people in El Paso last month,” she wrote. “This last week’s denial of refugees from the Bahamas fleeing the destruction of Hurricane Dorian because they could be “very bad gang members” saw thousands of climate refugees abandoned to squalid conditions.”

The star highlighted the importance of telling positive stories about immigrants in the U.S. as well as the consequences of misrepresenting them.

“ICE raids and hate crimes don’t happen in a vacuum. They operate as part of a larger white nationalist narrative, a continuation of manifest destiny-thinking remixed for the age of Twitter,” she wrote.

WHY ROSARIO DAWSON REPORTEDLY DIDN'T ATTEND BOYFRIEND CORY BOOKER'S DEBATE NIGHT

Dawson continued: “The truth is, this thinking is symptomatic of an old and still very much alive colonial disease. If we want to heal this country’s deep scars on these issues, we need to look at the root causes and treat them at the source. When it comes to immigration, this is more than just a political crisis—we’re suffering a crisis of our very humanity. And one way to change the debate in Washington is by changing the stories we produce and consume in our own lives.”

Dawson pointed to a new web series that she helped make and co-stars in titled “The North Pole” as an example of something telling worthwhile stories about immigrants. The series is set in Oakland, Calif., and follows four young people as they deal with issues such as immigration struggles, wildfires, racial tensions and much more.

The actress, who fans may know from roles in films like “Rent,” “Men in Black II” and “He’s Got Game,” is also known for her political activism. She backed Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 campaign for president and then endorsed Green Party candidate Jill Stein once Hillary Clinton defeated him. She’s also the co-founder of Voto Latino, a nonpartisan group that encourages young Latinos to register to vote and become more politically active.

Carlson pointed out how the environment has not improved since the rise of the climate change alarmism movement and suggest there was an ulterior motive.

According to the Fox News host, the aim is to obtain more power.

Transcript as follows:

TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Millions of schoolchildren across America and in fact, around the world, skipped school today. They weren’t playing hooky. They were instead participating in a coordinated left-wing political protest. It was called Climate Strike. So naturally, MSNBC was there to cheer them on.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: New York City is the home base for these protests. School officials, public school officials are allowing nearly one million students to cut classes.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Some of the signs by the way that I’ve seen so far for this rally was absolutely fantastic.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look, I am not in favor of encouraging people to skip class, but if there is a cause that is important, this is it, so good on you for going out there and telling people what really matters. Congratulations to you and those like you around the world.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: Congratulations on skipping school. Throughout the day news anchors assured their viewers that the strike was, in fact, being led by the kids. They were lying, of course. Like all activist movements, the climate strike was organized by cynical adults — adults hoping to exploit children for political purposes, obviously.

The other lie you heard today is that the strike was about the environment. It was not about the environment. The main goal of the protesters in this country, for example, was to implement Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal.

You’ll remember from just a few months ago that the Green New Deal is not about the environment. In fact, Ocasio-Cortez’s Chief of Staff conceded as much, we’re quoting now, “We really think of it as a how-do-you-change-the- entire-economy thing,” end quote, but that shouldn’t surprise you.

The environmental movement itself has all but given up on the environment. Don’t believe it? Look around. Is our country cleaner than it was? No. It’s dirtier, and it’s more crowded, and it gets more of both of those things every year. The left doesn’t care. They’re cheering it on. Why? Because they want power.

And in climate change, they found an emergency big enough to justify grabbing more power, in fact, taking control of everything. Don’t believe it? Check out the manifesto of Youth Climate Strike. That’s one of the group’s leading today’s strike.

The document calls for, among other things, state-owned banks, single-payer healthcare, affordable housing, expanded rights for sexual minorities, et cetera. Now, you may agree with those political goals, or you may disagree. But what do they have to do with the environment? Obviously, nothing. But whatever. Full speed ahead.

Bernie Sanders, among others, is now demanding that the United States begin admitting what he calls climate refugees into our country, maybe in your neighborhood. That would include everyone south of Miami, or north of Buenos Aires, all of now have a right to move because climate.

So what are the chances of something like that passing Congress, you ask, well, right around zero. Congress will never pass a law allowing that. And so that means in order to get what they want, progressives will have to bypass Congress, not to mention voters themselves. And they’d like to do that.

Watch as Colorado Senator Michael Bennet explains that the main thing in the way of his climate agenda, is yes, democracy.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEN. MICHAEL BENNET (D-CO), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think this is a test that’s not well understood by some of the candidates in the race and not — it has not been well debated. Is our democracy up to this task? And that is a really non-trivial question. Because —

CHRIS HAYES, MSNBC HOST: I mean, it clearly isn’t right now.

BENNET: So far, we have not. We haven’t been, and when you lose a national races as we did in ’16 to a climate denier that creates a real concern.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: Is our democracy up to the task? If you’re even asking that question, you’re missing the point because democracy is the point. But damn democracy says the left. It is standing in the way of us getting control of every detail of your life. We’ll have to do something about that. That is their position.

In the meantime, though, the left has a backup plan. It’s the same as it always has been — propaganda.

Another demand of the youth climate Strike Group is what they’re calling quote, “comprehensive climate change education.” They want it for children aged five to 14. Five years old? Why so young? Well, because — and again, we’re quoting here, ” … impressionability is high during that developmental stage,” end quote.

In other words, brainwashing is easier when they’re little. And there you have the modern left’s climate agenda: no drinking straws, no automobiles, no airplanes, no meat, no democracy. In their place, endless propaganda and a parade of 15-year-old Red Guards yelling at you to stay in line. That’s what they’re promising.

All of a sudden, the future really does that bleak, and it has nothing to do with rising temperatures.

Biden, his two leading competitors in the Democratic presidential primaries and President Trump are all in their 70s. The oldest is Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 78, followed by Biden at 76, Trump at 73, and Sen. Elizabeth of Warren of Massachusetts at 70.

Are all four too old for what is probably one of the most intellectually challenging jobs in the world, with enormous power over our lives and the future of the planet?

FOX NEWS POLL: BIDEN AT NEW LOW IN DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY RACE

Biden, Sanders, Warren and Trump all keep demanding and high-pressure schedules, traveling frequently, often getting little sleep, and speaking on an almost daily basis in front of TV cameras to answer questions from reporters and to address audiences large and small. That takes stamina and a quick mind.

But because they speak in public so often and most of what they say is recorded, each of them sometimes generates news stories when saying the wrong thing at the wrong time.

Biden, however, seems to exceed the average for the number of these gaffes. And because the former vice president’s frequent gaffes have now become an issue raising questions about his fitness to serve as president, they are getting outsized attention in the media and from his opponents.

Still, at this early stage in the 2020 presidential race Biden remains the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. A Fox News poll that came out this week shows Biden has the support of 29 percent of likely Democratic primary voters, compared with 18 percent for Sanders and 16 percent for Warren. However, Biden’s solid lead was down by two points since August and six points since May.

Biden has almost universal name recognition among voters from his eight years as President Barack Obama’s vice president and 36 years in the Senate before that. A centrist who doesn’t embrace the more far-left policies of Sanders and Warren, Biden has strong appeal for many voters because of his more moderate positions and because they believe he can make Trump a one-term president.

But what about all the Biden gaffes? His critics are raising questions about his mental fitness and whether he could be suffering from the early stages of dementia that could grow markedly worse at the end of a potential two terms in the White House.

So far the Democratic presidential candidate going after Trump most directly on the mental fitness issue is former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, who aggressively attacked Biden in the last presidential debate, accusing Biden of forgetting a comment he had made just minutes earlier.

But it turns out that Castro was the one who forgot what Biden said. Does the fact that Castro got mixed up mean he is suffering from dementia?

Look, dementia isn’t diagnosed by watching someone on a podium at a televised debate, where candidates are required to instantly respond to questions and sum up complex issues in a minute or less.

And once in office, presidents have advisers and briefings and time to learn and think about issues. No one is ever going to say to a president: Sir (or someday Madam), tell me in 60 seconds how to end terrorism, or end poverty, or improve our educational system, or balance the federal budget.

And when we look at Biden’s gaffes and question if he is possibly “losing it” or if he’s fit for office, we shouldn’t forget that President Trump certainly has made quite a few gaffes of his own.

More importantly, according to The Washington Post’s Fact Checker database, as of Aug. 5 Trump “had made 12,019 false or misleading claims.”

“President Trump’s proclivity for spouting exaggerated numbers, unwarranted boasts and outright falsehoods has continued at a remarkable pace,” a Post article reported.

Of course, the president and his supporters strongly dispute the Post tally, and the president regularly denounces the newspaper as biased against him and as purveying “fake news.”

But if voters are concerned about instances where Biden gets a bit confused at times and inadvertently says the wrong thing, they should be even more concerned about Trump’s “false and misleading claims.”

We all accidentally say the wrong thing sometimes and forget things or remember past events incorrectly. Those are innocent mistakes.

And we all age differently. Some people are past their peak mental performance in their 60s and some even have dementia at that age. Others are just fine mentally in their 80s and even beyond.

Space doesn’t permit a listing of all Biden’s gaffes, simply because there are so many. But importantly, he’s been making these gaffes for decades, going back to when he was a young man and in middle age. That hasn’t prevented him from devoting a lifetime to public service and accomplishing a great deal for the American people.

But let’s look at just a few of Biden’s gaffes.

Recently Biden has urged parents to keep “record players” on to improve the vocabulary of their

children. He said he was in Vermont when he was really in New Hampshire.

Biden said in August that he was still vice president at the time of the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Feb.14, 2018 – when he had been out of office for more than a year. An official with Biden’s campaign later said Biden had meant to refer to the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, which occurred in December 2012.

And one of Biden’s gaffes, which was a favorite for many and quite funny, came during CNN’s July 31 presidential debate, when he asked voters to “go to Joe 30330.” He said later he meant to say “text.” “I was so focused on making the case for Joe, I said ‘Joe’ and I gave the number,” he said.

According to the Alzheimer’s Association: “There is no one test to determine if someone has dementia. Doctors diagnose Alzheimer’s and other types of dementia based on a careful medical history, a physical examination, laboratory tests, and the characteristic changes in thinking, day-to-day function and behavior associated with each type.”

I’m not a doctor and I certainly can’t diagnose Biden’s mental abilities. But you would think if he really was slipping mentally his own doctors, his wife, other family members and the people who work with him every day would notice something was seriously wrong.

And you would think Biden himself would notice and conclude for his own health and for the good of the country he deeply loves that he should withdraw from the presidential race – or resign from the presidency, should he become president and be stricken with dementia.

The bottom line is that opponents attack each other in campaigns. This has begun happening in the 2020 presidential race and is going to get a lot worse. As the Democratic front-runner, Biden is a magnet for attacks – as always happens with front-runners.

My best advice to Biden is to focus on trying to reduce the number of gaffes he makes, working with his top advisers. He has an outstanding record in government and shouldn’t be pushed out of the race for slips of the tongue, as long as they don’t indicate he has more serious problems that make him unfit to be our next president.

As Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., put it: ""Every one of my colleagues on this stage believes in universal health care.""

Booker’s statement prompts this question: Why should government get involved in health care for Americans who do not require government assistance?

Most Americans believe the government should provide a ""safety net"" for the poor. It does this with assistance such as food stamps. However, you do not hear anyone calling for an expansion of food stamps to cover all Americans regardless of whether they are rich or poor. So why is that the case with health care?

HOW MUCH WOULD 'MEDICARE FOR ALL' COST? DEMOCRATS' HEALTH CARE PLAN EXPLAINED

The federal government, through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) – more commonly known as food stamps – provides assistance to low-income people. The government does not make the food or control the price of food. It does not dictate what foods people should buy. And the government provides absolutely no food assistance to the majority of American households.

This is a ""safety net."" It is designed to make sure the poorest among us have food on their table.

There seems to be broad agreement that food stamps are a good way to address the nutritional needs of our poor. In health care, we have something similar. It is called Medicaid. It provides funding for medical services for low-income and disabled people.

We also have Medicare, which provides health insurance coverage for older Americans. So the government already has programs in place to take care of the health of our poor and elderly.

Until President Obama came along, there seemed to be rough consensus that this was the right way to ensure America took care of its poor and elderly.

Most Americans were, presumably, in a position to take care of their own health care. Most accomplished this by working in job that provided health benefits, buying their own insurance, or relying on a parent or spouse's health insurance plan. Others chose not to buy insurance and to pay for care as they received it.

Obama and his fellow Democrats insisted that every American have government health care or private insurance, and thus devised ObamaCare, which expanded Medicaid to cover more Americans.

In order to cover everyone else, for the first time in our nation’s history the federal government made it illegal not to purchase a particular product: in this case, health insurance. Yes, even if you paid tens of thousands of dollars for your child to become a doctor who could take care of you for free, you still were legally obligated to buy health insurance.

Now health care is again front and center for Democrats. They say ObamaCare is not enough. They insist America must provide free health care for every single American, old and young, rich and poor.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., criticized former Vice President Joe Biden’s plan in the last debate because it only covered 97 percent of Americans! For his part, Biden proudly announced that under his plan the government will tell drug companies what they can charge for drugs.

With government now involved in everyone’s health care, we are seeing the adverse effects. Everyone is now on government health care or mandatory insurance, and insurance premiums cost the same regardless of a person’s heath, destroying much of the free market in health care.

Where are the menus of services with prices at the doctor’s office? They are not there because people do not care what the cost is because they don’t pay it!

The government and insurance companies are in the middle, determining what and how much to pay, but never sure about what services the doctor or hospital actually provided. Fraud, therefore, runs rampant. Patients have no incentive to shop for better pricing, and doctors have no incentive to provide it. Patients similarly have no financial incentive to avoid doctor visits by maintaining a proper diet and exercise.

As a result, we have runaway increases in the costs of health care. The Democratic solution? For Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and others on the stage, it is to put the final bullet in what is left of the free market in health care. Progressivism has taken over the Democratic Party. It no longer believes in free markets.

History shows that if government would get out of the way and allow the free market to do its thing, there is no telling what solutions would emerge for health care. New technologies utilizing the Internet, cell phones, Skype, and artificial intelligence would be fully exploited. Competition would bring down prices, as we have seen in areas of medical care not covered by the government or insurance companies.

Sanders complains that America is ""the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people."" America also is the richest country on Earth. Has he ever considered that the two may be related? It is precisely because America does not hand over control of large sectors of its economy to the government that we have had such economic success.

Why is a safety net insufficient for Democrats? Is it about control? Is it about destroying free-market capitalism wherever they can? Is it in pursuit of a liberal utopia where everyone is treated the same?

We do not know. The question was never asked.

No sooner had The New York Times published a new, unsubstantiated allegation of sexual misconduct… [+4591 chars]",Democrats should not want voters to be thinking about Kavanaugh or liberal court packing when they cast their ballots in 2020.,2019-09-20,Fox News,"Marc Thiessen: Impeach Kavanaugh? Democrats, I say go for it",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/marc-thiessen-impeach-kavanaugh,"The latest smear on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh is a disaster for Democrats, and everyone seems to know it except the party's presidential candidates.

No sooner had The New York Times published a new, unsubstantiated allegation of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh, then most of the candidates demanded Kavanaugh's impeachment.

""These newest revelations are disturbing,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote on Twitter, adding ""Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached.""

RUSH LIMBAUGH: TREATMENT OF TRUMP BY DEMOCRATS, MEDIA HAS AMERICANS 'QUIETLY SEETHING'

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., declared Kavanaugh's ""place on the court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice. He must be impeached.""

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Obama housing secretary Julián Castro and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke joined in with impeachment calls of their own.

Even former Vice President Joe Biden demanded Congress open an investigation and ""follow the evidence to wherever it leads."" That was considered the restrained response in the Democratic field.

Never mind that the supposed victim has told friends she has no recollection of the alleged incident; facts have never stood in the Democrats' way when it comes to Kavanaugh before. If the Democratic presidential contenders want to see Kavanaugh impeached, I say go for it. Open the investigation Biden has demanded. Start impeachment hearings. And broadcast it for all of America to see.

Let's remind voters of the disgraceful confirmation process Kavanaugh faced. Let's relive how Democrats accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting a teenage girl, exposing himself to a college classmate and participating in gang rapes at high school parties -- all without a shred of corroborating evidence.

Let's rehash Christine Blasey Ford's allegations, but this time with the knowledge that the principal witness Ford named to her alleged assault, Leland Keyser, is now on record saying she does not believe Ford. Let's remind Americans how Senate Democrats denied Kavanaugh the presumption of innocence and insisted that the burden was on him to prove he was not a sexual predator.

That sure worked out well for Democrats last time around. In 2018, the Kavanaugh debacle may have cost Democrats control of the Senate. Sens. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., and Claire McCaskill, D.-Mo., lost their seats thanks to voters disgusted by their party's campaign of character assassination against Kavanaugh, while Democrats blew a chance to pick up GOP seats in Tennessee and Texas.

As Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said at the time, the Kavanaugh hearings were ""like an adrenaline shot"" for the Republican base. Now, Democrats want to bring out the hypodermic needle for the 2020 elections. Sounds good to me.

On Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders know this a path to disaster. In a stunning rebuke of the party's presidential contenders, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told those calling for Kavanaugh's impeachment to ""get real."" ""We've got to get beyond this 'impeachment is the answer to every problem,'"" Durbin said. ""It's become a knee-jerk reaction among many Democrats that if you're unhappy with President Trump or some of his appointments, impeachment is a recourse. ... If that's how we are identified ... we run the risk that people will feel we're ignoring the issues that mean a lot to them as families.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was even more succinct. Asked if the House was going to investigate the new allegation, she said ""no.""

Durbin and Pelosi understand that the threats to impeach Kavanaugh are a godsend for Trump. And they come in the wake of Senate Democrats issuing an unprecedented threat to the other Supreme Court justices. In a brief, they warned that if the high court does not rule as Democrats wish in a gun case, they could ""restructure"" the court when they take power in the 2020 elections -- packing it with liberal justices, flipping a 5-to-4 conservative majority to a liberal majority.

Democrats do not seem to realize that when they make threats like these, they are not hurting Kavanaugh or Trump, they are hurting themselves. In 2016, 26 percent of Trump voters said Supreme Court nominees were the most important issue to them, while only 18 percent of Hillary Clinton's voters mirrored the sentiment. As we have seen in the past two elections, when the Supreme Court is on the ballot, Democrats lose.

In other words, Democrats should not want voters to be thinking about Kavanaugh or liberal court-packing when they cast their ballots in 2020. Republicans should. So, let the impeachment proceedings begin.

The problem is plastic straws it’s corporate greed #globalclimatestrike — Emily Ratajkowski (@emrata) September 20, 2019

For example, check out this braggadocious Instagram post.

Additionally, the she’s is a huge proponent of JetSmarter, which has been dubbed the “Uber of air travel.” It’s the “first global digital marketplace for private aviation” which makes booking flights on private jets a breeze for carbon footprint producing celebrities like Ratajkowski.

Ratajkowski’s private jet usage — while decrying the use of plastic straws and “corporate greed” — is not an isolated phenomenon. Over the summer, celebrates and elites, who say they are committed to fighting climate change, flew across the globe to attend a “Google Summer Camp” to discuss climate change.

As Breitbart News reported:

Traditionally held every year at the end of July, the famed Verdura Resort hosts the top-secret gathering, with the three-day summer camp costing the tech giant some $20 million, sources told the Post. Many of the guests, including Obama and DiCaprio — who has his own climate change foundation — have described global warming as the biggest threat to future generations. Forbes reports numerous yachts are currently moored off the beach at Verdura Resort having discharged their passengers; German pharmaceutical titan Udo J. Vetter’s sailing yacht Aquarius, Barry Diller and Diane Von Furstenberg’s sailing yacht EOS, Graeme Hart’s yacht Ulysses with others en route including David Geffen’s yacht Rising Sun, Google’s Eric Schmidt’s yacht Infinity and its support vessel Intrepid, among them. According to Italian press reports, the attendees were also expected to show up in 114 private jets, of which 40 had arrived by Sunday.

They are not the only notable figures who have demonstrated a seeming disregard for the looming planetary “crisis” by using private air travel, with Joe Biden (D) spending $256,000 on private plane travel from the start of his presidential bid through July and the Sanders campaign spending $297,685.50 on private air travel over the span of nine days, it was reported last year.

Ratajkowski’s rant comes on the same day that students around the country are skipping school to join in on the global climate strike. What’s more? More than 90 percent of the planet’s plastic waste comes Asia and Africa. Straws in the United States account for about 0.03 percent of global plastic pollution."

Instead of trying to cover up Harris’s obvious frustration with her position in the presidential race, her campaign decided to expand on her salty quote, with her communications director Lily Adams promoting a shirt quoting her boss:

The Harris campaign sent out a fundraising email with the subject “‘I’m f**king moving to Iowa’ – Kamala Harris,” according to the Washington Examiner.

“She cut to the chase!” the body of the email stated, according to the Examiner. “We’re doubling our organizers on the ground in Iowa and Kamala is ramping up her time on the trail there, beginning today in Cedar Rapids.”

Despite the campaign’s attempts to add an element of levity to Harris’s remarks, she confirmed to reporters that she is, in fact, torn and frustrated.

“I cannot only be in Iowa, because South Carolina is also a state that is very important, that I care about,” she said.

“Until we have campaign finance reform, I need to fundraise,” she continued. “So it can be frustrating, frankly, to have to make these decisions that feel like a trade-off, but I plan to spend as much time as I can.”

Harris’s remarks follow weeks of a downward trend in the polls, both nationally and in key primary states. An Iowa poll released Wednesday showed Harris dropping to sixth place in the Hawkeye State, having just five percent support:

Former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is no longer scheduled to participate in a three-day festival hosted by The Atlantic next week, the publication said Friday.

Several liberal groups are claiming victory, saying they pressured Nielsen to back out of the event.

“We previously announced that we would be interviewing former DHS Sec. Kirstjen Nielsen at @TheAtlanticFest next week. Nielsen's team has let us know that she is no longer able to participate in the interview,” The Atlantic Communications tweeted Friday afternoon.

KIRSTJEN NIELSEN MAKES FIRST PUBLIC COMMENTS AFTER RESIGNATION AS DHS BOSS

The magazine maintains Nielsen was the one to cancel the scheduled appearance.

""I wanted to let everyone know that Kirstjen Nielsen's team has let us know that she is no longer able to participate in TAF [The Atlantic Festival],"" Margaret Low, president of AtlanticLive, wrote in an email to staff obtained by The Hill.



Two sources familiar with the matter told The Hill that several Atlantic staffers protested the decision to include Nielsen in the festival, but a magazine spokesperson said Nielsen’s “invitation was not rescinded, so that is 100 percent inaccurate.""

Liberals take credit

But liberal organizations took credit and also criticized The Atlantic for initially including the former Trump administration immigration official on the festival's set list.

The announcement came following backlash from a progressive grassroots group called CREDO Action, which claimed ""Public pressure from thousands of CREDO members and grassroots activists forced Kirstjen Nielsen to withdraw from the Atlantic Fest, which is a huge victory and should set a precedent for not putting profits over morals when it comes to Trump administration alumni.""

Credo Action campaign director Nicole Regalado, told The Hill ""No one from Trump's administration should get a soft landing to sanitize their actions while supporting and pushing forward a white nationalist, fascist agenda.""

'Public backlash' threatened

The group also threatened that the media and corporations should think twice before giving a platform to “people who worked hand-in-hand with Trump to separate families, lock babies up in cages, and terrorize communities of color.""



""Public backlash will be swift and powerful for anyone who tries to help rehabilitate the reputations of Trump's top henchmen,"" CREDO Action said in a statement, according to Common Dreams.

""Public backlash will be swift and powerful for anyone who tries to help rehabilitate the reputations of Trump's top henchmen."" — CREDO Action statement

The Atlantic had announced earlier this week that Nielsen would be interviewed during the three-day The Atlantic Festival on “the Trump administration’s immigration policy, which she implemented as Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.”

The Atlantic’s Tuesday news release also said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, and Disney CEO Bob Iger would be interviewed onstage during the festival, set to be held in Washington, Tuesday through Thursday.

Other current and former Trump administration officials remain on the guest list. Jim Mattis, who served a tumultuous two years as Trump's defense secretary before he was fired, is scheduled to speak, as is current Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II.



Liberal groups on Twitter also took aim at The Atlantic and pointed to Nielsen’s record of perceived offenses against immigrants.



""Kirstjen Nielsen, you don't get to separate families, cause long-lasting trauma to our kids, and think you can walk away scot-free,"" Vote Latino, a voter advocacy group, said on Twitter. ""We will not forget the harm you've caused to our community. You don't get to rehabilitate your image.""

""Good—but she never should have been invited in the first place,"" daily kos author Gabe Ortiz said. ""Nielsen's role in implementing the administration's inhumane family separation policy will be remembered as one of the darkest times in modern U.S. history.""





""Glad she's not getting this platform to rehabilitate her image, but she shouldn't have ever been invited,"" Bend the Arc: Jewish Action also tweeted.

Past confrontations

Before she left the Trump administration in April, Nielsen was the target of several public confrontations waged by critics of President Trump's immigration policies.

In June 2018, an angry mob of socialists heckled Nielsen at a restaurant in Washington, forcing her to leave.

That same month, another group of protesters gathered outside Nielsen's home.

Other Republicans who have been confronted in public include former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders and Senate Majority Mitch McConnell and his wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.



Also on the guest list at The Atlantic Festival: former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice; former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger; YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki; NBA Commissioner Adam Silver; Michele Roberts, executive director of the National Basketball Players Association; CEO and executive editor of Rappler Maria Ressa; and ""Tonight Show"" musician Questlove."

THE SHADOW OF CORRUPTION

How corrupt do you think your government is?



According to Transparency International, which has been ranking countries on its 1-100 scale for 25 years, the United States is not very corrupt at all.



The most recent rankings, built through a survey of experts and businesspeople, ranks the U.S. as 22nd cleanest in the 180 nations of the world. We run in a pack with other mostly Western liberal democracies like Australia, Britain and France just behind the squeaky clean Scandinavian nations and, of course, Canada.



We are far removed from the rampant corruption under which most of the rest of the world is forced to live. Russia, China, India and Brazil are all bad news when it comes to basic principles of fairness. All of Africa except for Botswana and every Asian nation except Japan are considered substantially corrupt.



So your government, on an empirical basis, is pretty much on the level.



But that’s not the important question. What matters is how corrupt do you think your government is. And on that score, the news is bad.



In our most recent Fox News poll, we asked respondents “How many people in the government do you think are corrupt -- almost all, many, some, or almost none?” The results should be sobering for everyone concerned about the current trajectory of politics.



About one in five said that almost all of the people in government are corrupt. An amazing 43 percent said that “many” are crooked. Just 31 percent got closer to reality saying that “some” in the government are corrupt. A sad 2 percent said “almost none.”



As with all reputational goods, like a nation’s currency, the perception of value is far more important than the actual value itself. If a government is perceived as corrupt it’s almost as bad as the real thing, and will eventually result in real corruption anyway.



If you think the game is rigged, you’re far more likely to be willing to cheat yourself.



The 64 percent of Americans who believe their government is rotten with corruption don’t belong to any particular demographic or political group, either. Women are a little more distrustful than men and white people are more dubious than other ethnic groups, whites without college degrees most of all.



But religious faith, political proclivities, education and income all had relatively little bearing on the overall perception that corruption is a major problem in our government.



It’s no wonder, given what both political parties are selling these days. It would be one thing if the response was really about “draining the swamp” and some sustained effort for reforms that might bring public perception back into alignment with reality. But what tends to happen is that politicians exploit such perceptions to create lower expectations for good government and accountability once they are in power.



If the whole system is rigged, why should our side have to play by the rules? After all they’re the real crooks



That’s how the false perception of rampant corruption makes way for the real thing.



THE RULEBOOK: THERE’S A DIFFERENCE

“It is, that in a democracy, the people meet and exercise the government in person; in a republic, they assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents. A democracy, consequently, will be confined to a small spot. A republic may be extended over a large region.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 14



TIME OUT: SOUNDS LIKE AMERICA

Gun&Garden: “When Ken Burns decides to cover a topic, set aside some time to dig in. Best known for his epics, including his Civil War documentary, which aired on PBS over five nights in 1990 to an audience of 40 million people, the filmmaker is now readying for the premiere his latest deep-dive, Country Music. The eight-part, sixteen-hour film takes a magnifying glass to the forces that shaped this distinctly American sound. ‘I’m looking for stories, and I’m looking for stories that are firing on all cylinders,’ Burns tells Garden & Gun. … The film runs chronologically, tracing the many influences that shaped country music, from enslaved people bringing the banjo across the Atlantic from Africa all the way to the heyday of pop-country in the mid-1990s. The genre, Burns reveals, is less a set of rules and boundaries than it is a spectrum—one that trades on universal truths and bridges cultural, racial, and economic divides.”

BIDEN RACKS UP KEY ENDORSEMENTS

AP: “Joe Biden sought to demonstrate a broad appeal to Democrats on Thursday with new endorsements from leading African American lawmakers and a former governor of a pivotal swing state. The backing from Reps. G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina, Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri and Charlie Crist of Florida reflects Biden’s play both for the party establishment and for minority voters who are critical in the early stages of the primary. Butterfield and Cleaver are former chairmen of the Congressional Black Caucus, and Crist was the governor of Florida before he entered Congress. The moves are the latest example of Biden’s durability as an early Democratic front-runner. So far, he’s successfully threaded different wings of the party despite skepticism from progressives and questions about whether, at 76, he’s too old for the presidency. … [T]he support of Butterfield and Cleaver in particular is a potential blow to Sen. Kamala Harris [and] Sen. Cory Booker…”



Younger black voters try to pry their parents from Biden - NYT: “If Mr. Biden, 76, is going to win the Democratic nomination, it is likely to be because of the support of older black voters… But if he is to be overtaken by one of his more progressive rivals, the most powerful tool against him may not be opposition research or negative advertisements. Instead, it may be an organic effort by younger black voters — concerned about Mr. Biden’s age and more moderate ideology — to sway their older family members. Mr. Biden seems aware of this dynamic. In interviews, he has both acknowledged the generational gap among his black supporters and downplayed its importance, arguing that the support of older, more moderate black voters would be enough to give him an electoral advantage. Still, Mr. Biden, by his own admission, would be unwise to underestimate the lobbying efforts of those who are young and politically engaged.”



Harris takes aim at Warren - WSJ: “Ka­mala Har­ris, now a dis­tant fourth in the De­mo­c­ra­tic pres­i­den­tial race, took aim at poll-climber Eliz­a­beth War­ren for do­ing big-money events. In re­sponse to a ques­tion about War­ren, Har­ris said at a closed-door fundraiser it was hyp­o­crit­i­cal for her ri­val to claim she wasn’t tak­ing money from large donors when War­ren trans­ferred around $10 mil­lion from her Sen­ate funds be­fore de­nounc­ing big money do­na­tions. Har­ris moved $1.2 mil­lion into her pres­i­den­tial fund. Har­ris lamented that she now needs to be in places like New York to keep the cam­paign fi­nan­cially afloat but prefers to spend time in early vot­ing states. On a later press call, Har­ris’s cam­paign didn’t name War­ren di­rectly but noted re­peat­edly that Har­ris came into the cam­paign with less than other can­di­dates be­cause ‘we spent 2018 rais­ing for other can­di­dates.’”



And same with Buttigieg - AP: “Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg is accusing his 2020 rival Elizabeth Warren of being ‘extremely evasive’ when it comes to explaining how she'd finance a universal health care plan. Speaking on CNN on Thursday, Buttigieg issued his most pointed attack yet on the Massachusetts senator, saying she ‘was extremely evasive when asked that question, and we've seen that repeatedly.’ The sharpened critique comes as the fall campaign kicks into high gear with Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses scheduled in February. Warren has assembled a well-organized campaign there and leads Buttigieg in Iowa, where the South Bend, Indiana, mayor's longshot presidential campaign is competing heavily and trying to break through.”



Yang plays Perot for a new generation - Atlantic: “To understand why [Andrew Yang is hanging on in the polls], it’s worth looking at how he responded earlier this month when Shane Gillis, a comedian for Saturday Night Live, referred to him using a racial slur. Yang urged that Gillis not be fired. … But more revealing was Yang’s explanation for why Gillis deserved forgiveness. Gillis, Yang tweeted, ‘does not strike me as malignant or evil. He strikes me as a still-forming comedian from central Pennsylvania.’ What does central Pennsylvania have to do with it? For Andrew Yang and his supporters, everything. It’s code for economic distress—which Yang believes fuels racism and most of the other problems that menace America. … Over the past quarter century, two presidential candidates have mobilized these economics-first, culture-war-indifferent voters into a potent force. The first was Ross Perot. The second is Andrew Yang.”



De Blasiout - Fox News: “New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Friday he is dropping out of the 2020 Democratic primary, ending his campaign after struggling to gain traction in the race. ‘I feel like I contributed all I can to this primary election and it’s clearly not my time,’ he said during an appearance on MSNBC’s ‘Morning Joe.’ ‘So I’m going to end my presidential campaign, continue my work as mayor of New York City and I’m going to keep speaking up for working people.’ De Blasio entered the presidential race in May, running as a proud progressive. But his campaign never caught fire: He qualified for the first two rounds of Democratic presidential debates but has failed to make the cut for the others.”



Booker hides from past alliance with DeVos - WaPo: “Cory Booker was a little-known member of the Newark City Council 19 years ago when he received an extraordinary invitation from a Michigan group connected to Betsy DeVos, now the U.S. Secretary of Education. DeVos and her husband, Dick, were leading Republican proponents of a state ballot initiative that would allow taxpayer-financed vouchers to pay for private schools. … Booker accepted. … But as Booker runs for president, his relationship with DeVos, his previous support of vouchers and his continuing praise for charter schools present potential roadblocks. Vouchers and charters schools are anathema to many powerful teachers unions, who have outsize power in Democratic primaries, and some candidates in the party strongly oppose them on the grounds that they weaken traditional public schools.”



UKRAINE AT CENTER OF FIGHT OVER ALLEGED TRUMP PROMISE

Fox News: “The developing controversy over a mysterious phone conversation President Trump had with a foreign leader apparently centers on Ukraine, as the president and his allies fight back and claim the uproar is just another ‘partisan’ plot against him. What touched off the controversy is a secret whistleblower complaint that the director of national intelligence has kept from Congress, reportedly involving a ‘promise’ Trump made to an unnamed foreign leader. In the latest development, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Thursday that the complaint relates to Ukraine. Fox News has not confirmed the reports. Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, seemed to acknowledge some effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate potential corruption related to the Biden family, though he gave conflicting answers on the matter in a CNN interview overnight. It remains unclear what the supposed ‘promise’ from Trump entailed. The president, however, maintained he said nothing improper, tearing into those pushing the allegations Friday.”



Giuliani inconsistent - WaPo: “Rudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, contradicted himself when asked whether he personally asked Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, ranted about media bias and defended Trump amid new reports about an intelligence official’s whistleblower complaint, during a chaotic and fiery CNN interview Thursday night. Immediately after anchor Chris Cuomo introduced him and summarized the latest news out of the whistleblower story, which had only broken about an hour prior, Giuliani went into attack mode. … Giuliani spent the first half of the interview repeating the claim that Biden in 2016 pressured Ukraine to drop its top prosecutor, which at the time was also investigating a natural gas company where Biden’s son Hunter was on the board. …There’s been no evidence found that Biden was trying to help out his son.”



TRUMP RALLIES WITH MODI IN OUTREACH TO KEY VOTER BLOC

WaPo: “President Trump heads to Harris County, Texas this weekend to a major rally ahead of next week's United Nations General Assembly — for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The website for the ‘Howdy, Modi’ rally boasts that the ‘live audience will be the largest gathering for an invited foreign leader visiting the United States other than the Pope’: Some 50,000 people, many from Houston's large Indian diaspora, are expected to turn out. It's eye-popping that leaders of the world's two biggest democracies are appearing together at such an event — let alone that this particular American president will be holding court in the epicenter of Texas's blue wave and the most diverse city in America. You're not wrong if you think that doesn't sound like friendly territory for Trump. But that's a strong political reason for him to go: Democrats are making a big play for Texas in 2020 and Republicans are growing concerned. The rally for Modi, who is hugely popular in India, provides Trump with access to a potential pool of Indian American voters that could turn out to be critical in next year's presidential elections.”



SENATE DEMS NEED BIG WINS IN THE SUN BELT

Politico: “To take back the White House, Democrats only need to win back three key Rust Belt states. But if they want to move a president’s agenda through the Senate, they have to flip the Sun Belt. From Arizona to North Carolina to a pair of seats in Georgia, Democrats have to clean up in that stretch of the country to have any chance of taking the chamber. President Donald Trump carried each of those states in 2016, and in an era of polarized politics when Senate races are increasingly nationalized, Democrats need at least strong performances by the party's presidential nominee in the Sun Belt states — if not victories — to have a shot at flipping their Senate seats. So while some Democrats are laser-focused on winning back the Rust Belt, Democrats across the Southern half of the country are urging their party to invest heavily in their states — not just as a way to flip the Senate, but as part of the path to 270 Electoral College votes.”



Kemp frustrates GOP with cattle call for Senate appointment - AJC: “Within hours of Gov. Brian Kemp’s unusual decision to invite the public to apply to succeed U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, his office was blitzed with resumes — some serious and some silly — from wannabe Washingtonians.Lawyers. Doctors. Local government officials. Serial jokesters. IT specialists. A well-known pundit. As of Wednesday evening, 158 people had applied — and many, many more are expected to join in. … Welcome to the next phase of the race for the U.S. Senate in Georgia. Chances are, Kemp and his advisers already have whittled a list of top contenders for Isakson’s seat down to a handful — and that the online application process unveiled late Tuesday will be largely for show. But encouraging would-be U.S. senators to publicly declare their ambition might just expand the scope of his search even as it forces some tough decisions on potential contenders.”

YOU STAY CLASSY, CALEB BENNETT

WFTS: “A freak boating accident left a 14-year-old Manatee County boy with an anchor lodged in his skull, and doctors call his survival story ‘one in a million.’ ‘I can’t believe I had an anchor in my head. Like, that’s pretty crazy,’ Caleb Bennett said. ‘My friends now call me the ‘Anchorman’ so that’s kind of cool. I’m kind of a big deal around here.’ Caleb and his family love to fish on the Manatee River, and that's exactly what the teenager was doing when the accident happened. His parents, Kelli and Rick Bennett, were in the Bahamas celebrating their wedding anniversary when they got the call. … Caleb told the Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital he remembered feeling the anchor and thinking he just needed to stay calm. … Caleb was flown to Johns Hopkins in St. Petersburg where he immediately underwent brain surgery. … [Luis Rodriguez, M.D., a pediatric neurological surgeon at Johns Hopkins] told the family how lucky it was that the anchor didn't touch any of the blood vessels in Caleb's brain.

(CNN) Donald Trump has every reason to be concerned about taking on former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 election, especially given that a Fox News poll released this week found him trailing Biden by a whopping 14 points if the election were held now. But Trump's greatest threat may in fact come from Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who leads Trump by six points in the poll.

Per a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll released Saturday, Warren has for the first time taken the lead among likely caucusgoers in that key first primary state, climbing seven points since June. And Warren appears poised to rise further if other Democrats drop out or falter in the race, given that the poll finds she's the top second choice among all other Democratic candidates. Twenty percent would choose Warren as a second choice while Biden and Bernie Sanders are each only the second choice of 10%

Dean Obeidallah

Biden still currently leads Warren in the Real Clear Politics average of polls on a national level by a little over ten points . But Warren has been slowly building support in a way that may not only lead her to win the nomination, but to win the White House come 2020.

Why? It's simple: Warren is increasingly exciting people about her candidacy. This is backed by a new NBC/WSJ poll released Sunday which finds that among all the 2020 Democratic candidates, she is now the top-tier candidate who the largest amount of registered voters (17%) are "" enthusiastic "" about. While that number has grown from just 8 percent in March, the percentage of voters who are enthusiastic about Trump has remained the same at 26%. Biden, however, has seen the opposite trend. In March, 17% of voters were enthusiastic about him, but now the former VP has slipped to 12%. That's not good. Enthusiasm should only be growing the more people see a candidate in debates and on the campaign trail.

True, enthusiasm is an intangible factor that can come and go, often quickly. But it's enthusiasm that inspires people to not just vote, but to get friends to vote. It's that passion that animates people to knock on doors for a candidate, make phone calls, give money and attend events."

That's a problem for Bernie Sanders.,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/22/politics/union-health-care-medicare-for-all/index.html,"(CNN) Health care benefits are really important to many union workers -- important enough to give up pay raises or even to walk off the job to keep the coverage they've negotiated.

Now the future of those benefits is at the heart of an emerging split among 2020 Democratic candidates over how to remake American health care. Former Vice President Joe Biden says union members shouldn't have to give up their employer plans if they like them, while Sen. Bernie Sanders is arguing that union workers would still come out ahead under ""Medicare for All,"" which would shift all Americans into a government-run plan.

The fight puts Sanders, a declared democratic socialist, at odds with some in the labor movement, where many union workers already have insurance with pretty good benefits. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is also seeking the nomination, is in a similar situation because of her support for both Medicare for All and organized labor.

Already, there's a growing divide among unions as to whether to back Sanders' universal coverage proposal. National Nurses United, the largest union of registered nurses, are very vocal supporters of Medicare for All. But the International Association of Fire Fighters opposes eliminating employer-based coverage

Still other unions, such as the Service Employees International Union, say they support all efforts to expand coverage to more people.

Roughly 10.5% of workers -- or 14.7 million people -- were union members in 2018, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's about half the share that were unionized 35 years earlier.

Some 95% of union workers had access to employer medical benefits in 2019, compared to 68% of non-union workers, according to the bureau's data. And they were more likely to participate in the plans, with 84% of union staffers signing up, compared to 54% of their non-union counterparts.

""Bargaining for health benefits is a distinguishing characteristic that labor unions hold out as an important variable as to why you would want to be a union member,"" said David Brenner, national director of multi-employer consulting at Segal Consulting, a leader in the field.

The quality of their health plans varies widely, experts said. Unions that cover a lot of lower-wage employees, such as custodians or nurse's aides, may have more basic benefits and have to pay more for them. But other unions, including those in the construction, auto industry and some hotel trades, have more generous policies -- with low premiums, deductibles and co-pays. A few have even set up their own health clinics for members to get care.

Many health packages are so comprehensive that unions feared getting hit with the Affordable Care Act's Cadillac tax, which would have slapped a levy on the value of employer-provided coverage above a certain threshold. Companies and unions quickly banded together to fight it, fearing they'd have to curtail workers' health benefits. The implementation date has been delayed twice, and the House recently voted to repeal the provision

The United Auto Workers, who are currently striking against General Motors, are among the unions with high-quality plans. Members pay only about 3% of the total cost of their health care, while salaried staffers have to cover about one-third, according to GM.

Until recently, the automaker had been seeking to shift more of the bill to the UAW workforce. But GM has dropped its request for major changes in the health care plan. Talks are now hung up on other issues, including pay, the use of temporary workers and a union demand to shift work from Mexico to facilities slated to close in the US.

However, GM has also stopped paying for health insurance for the striking workers, who will have to sign up for COBRA. The UAW's strike fund is picking up the cost. Sanders took the opportunity earlier this week to note that union members wouldn't have to fear losing their benefits during strikes under Medicare for All.

Medical benefits is a central component of most contract negotiations. Health care is a major expense for most companies, and they have been pushing more of the cost onto non-union employees for years. They want organized labor to contribute more too.

But union workers are willing to make sacrifices to shield their health care coverage, including curtailing raises or other benefits.

""In an awful lot of cases, workers are forgoing any increase in wages in order to keep their deductibles from going even higher,"" said Tom Leibfried, legislative representative for the AFL-CIO, a federation of 55 national and international labor unions that represent 12.5 million people.

There's also a growing trend of contract talks breaking down in part over health benefits, said Alex Colvin, dean of Cornell University's ILR School, formerly known as the School of Industrial and Labor Relations. Health coverage was among the issues in United Steelworkers' strike against National Grid in Massachusetts and the teachers' strike in West Virginia last year.

""There's a lot more labor unrest and the cost of health care is one of the drivers of that,"" Brenner said.

Health care is important to union workers for several reasons, said Shaun Richman, program director at the SUNY Empire State College's School of Labor Studies who also was a deputy director of organizing for the American Federation of Teachers.

""You can take a higher raise to the bank, but when your kid gets sick, the peace of mind of good health insurance is important,"" Richman said. Also, ""it's a badge of honor of maintaining the health insurance and not taking concessions on it.""

Recognizing that he needs unions' support, Sanders issued a Workplace Democracy plan last month that would require companies to pass along savings resulting from Medicare for All to workers in the form of raises or other benefits. Unions would be allowed to maintain their clinics and provide supplemental coverage, as long as it doesn't duplicate the benefits available under Medicare for All.

A Warren aide told CNN recently that the campaign is talking with labor leaders about how unions with negotiated health care plans will be guaranteed a chance to rework their agreements during a Medicare for All transition.

That may not be enough for some unions, though.

""There has to be a role for the hard-fought, high-quality plans that we've negotiated,"" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told Fox News earlier this month. ""If there isn't some way for us to have our plans integrated into the system, then we would have a hard time supporting it."""

Follow here for live analysis.,2019-09-22,CNN,CNN's latest Iowa poll: Live analysis,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/cnn-iowa-poll-09-22-2019/index.html,"One of the things I have tried to stress during the course of this campaign is that no candidate has anywhere close to a greater than 50% chance of winning either the Iowa caucuses or the Democratic primary overall. That remains true today.

What I've done is gathered Iowa caucuses' polls taken closest to this point in non-incumbent nomination processes since 1980. I then ran a simple model that controlled how high the best polling candidate was and figured out how often a candidate should win given where they were polling at this point. Keep in mind, these are rough odds.

What we see is that if history holds, someone in Warren's polling position should win about 30% of the time. That means, there's something like a 70% chance someone other than Warren wins the Iowa caucuses.

Someone in Biden's polling position should win about 25% of the time.

Someone at around 10%, like Buttigieg and Sanders, have about a 10% chance of winning.

Everyone else has less than a 10% chance of winning. Even Harris, who is at 6% in our poll, has something like a 7% chance of winning.

If you add up the top 5, their cumulative chance of winning is only between 80% and 85%. That means, there's still a 15% to 20% chance that someone not in the top 5 wins Iowa.

In other words, this race isn't over by any stretch."

Every Sunday, I will outline the 5 BIG storylines you need to know to understand the upcoming week on the campaign trail.

5. The race to make the next debate: The October 1 deadline to qualify for the fourth Democratic debate -- set for October 15 and sponsored by CNN and The New York Times -- is rapidly approaching, and with it the last chance, seemingly, for any lower-tier candidates to make the case that they shouldn't be counted out just yet. (Missing one debate is bad enough. Missing two is a political death sentence.)

At the moment, the field is at 11, with wealthy businessman Tom Steyer making the October debate after narrowly missing the September set-to. The only other candidate who appears to be on the cusp of qualification is Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who, with the CNN-Des Moines Register Iowa poll released over the weekend, now has three of the four polls that she needs showing her at 2% or higher. (Gabbard has already met the fundraising threshold with 130,000 unique donors.)

Spiritual guru Marianne Williamson has met the fundraising qualification but has only a single poll that shows her at 2%. (She didn't even rate 1% in the CNN-DMR poll .)

The largest the debate field will grow then, realistically, is 12. Which means that eight candidates currently running won't be on the debate stage for the second straight month. Which should tell them all something.

4. Can Kamala come back?: Amid a series of terrible polling results reflective of her summer struggles, California Sen. Kamala Harris is going all in on Iowa to save herself. ""We want to make sure we have a strong top three finish,"" Amid a series of terrible polling results reflective of her summer struggles, California Sen. Kamala Harris is going all in on Iowa to save herself. ""We want to make sure we have a strong top three finish,"" said her campaign manager, Juan Rodriguez.

So, will it work? Harris has her work cut out for her, according to the new CNN-Des Moines Register Iowa poll. She's at 6%, good for 5th place, at the moment but that is largely stagnant from where she's been in the state since December 2018. (She was at 5% then.)

Harris is generally well-liked in the state -- 63% favorable/24% unfavorable -- but her unfavorables have tripled since March and her favorables have only bumped up marginally (58% in March). And those who feel strongly favorable toward Harris (26%) -- usually a good measure of energy behind a candidate -- runs behind her main rivals like Elizabeth Warren (44%), Pete Buttigieg (33%), Joe Biden (29%) and Bernie Sanders (26%).

Harris does have time, as there are still 134 days before the February 3, 2020 caucuses. But she has been stuck in the same place in Iowa for months. Which means she needs a jump-start. And soon.

3. Booker over and out?: Cory Booker may be the next high-profile candidate out of the 2020 race, according to a memo from his campaign manager first reported by NBC. The memo suggested that unless the New Jersey senator can raise $1.7 million in the next 10 days, he will run out of money and be forced from the race.

The campaign insisted the move was not a fundraising ploy, but it worked either way! As of Sunday morning, Booker had raised just over $300,000 in the first 24 hours of the fundraising push. Of course, $300K -- while good! -- is not $1.7 million. And you can't just keep warning that you are going to drop out of the race unless people give you more money for the remainder of the contest. The sky can only be falling once (or maybe twice!)

""I don't believe people should stay in this just to stay in it,"" Booker said in Iowa on Saturday. ""You either have a trajectory to win or not. And right now, we don't raise $1.7 million, we won't be able to make the investments necessary.""

Booker may get his $1.7 million this time. But without significant poll improvements, it's hard to see how he can keep raising the money he is going to need to compete with the big girls and boys. He will, for sure, stay in the race until the next debate -- October 15 in Ohio and sponsored by CNN. But is there a path beyond that?

2. Elizabeth Warren, Iowa front-runner: Warren has been the hottest candidate in the 2020 race for the past few months now. And it's showing up not just in national polling but now also in the crucial state of Iowa.

The Des Moines Register/CNN/MediaCom Iowa poll released Saturday night showed Warren at 22% and at the top of the pack although followed closely by Joe Biden at 20%. No one else in the field was terribly close to the top two, with Bernie Sanders at 11% in third place and Pete Buttigieg in fourth with 9%.

While the topline numbers are good for Warren, the trend lines are even better. She gained 7 points from the June DMR/CNN poll and has almost tripled her support in the state from a December 2018 poll. Biden, meanwhile, has lost support in each of the four DMR/CNN polls between December 2018 and now. And Sanders dropped 5 points from just June until now.

Warren's favorable numbers in the poll also make clear how much energy and passion is beyond her candidacy presently. Three-quarters of those polled had a favorable view of her, including a whopping 44% who had a ""very favorable"" opinion. That compares very favorably to the 29% who view Biden very favorably and the 26% who feel that same way about Sanders.

Couple all of those data points with the fact that Warren has, by far, the best ground organization in Iowa, and you have to make her the favorite in the Hawkeye State today.

1. Trump vs. Biden vs. Ukraine: It's only September, but we're already getting a look at what a general election fight between Trump and Biden would look like. Faced with a whistleblower complaint from the intelligence community about a series of interactions between himself and the Ukrainians, Trump is trying to push the attention to Biden and his son, Hunter, vis a vis Ukraine.

Fact checkers have already debunked Trump's claims about there being something nefarious in Biden's trip to the Ukraine in 2016 and his son's work for a natural gas company in the country, and there is no evidence of wrongdoing by either. Biden has pushed back aggressively. ""Every single outlet that's looked at this said there's nothing there there,"" he told the Iowa Starting Line . ""And me, nor anyone in my family did anything inappropriate. And every major outlet has acknowledged that. I just find it very Trump-like.""

It is very ""Trump-like!"" Because, facts be damned, Trump has and will continue to use his media megaphone -- press gaggles + Twitter -- to push the idea that something was going on in Ukraine with the two Bidens. And if past is prologue, he won't stop -- no matter what fact-checkers or his advisers tell him.

On the one hand, this fight is good for Biden. Electability is his strongest argument to Democratic voters -- and the more Trump hits Biden, the more the former vice president can seek to bypass the primary and begin running the general election. On the other, it's reminder that whether Biden or some other Democrat is the nominee, we can expect Trump to say and do literally anything in pursuit of a second term."

""Main street will pay for the tax, not Wall Street,"" wrote the report's author, James Angel, an associate professor of finance at Georgetown University.

""It won't punish bad actors or prevent the next financial crisis, or even tame market volatility,"" he continued. ""Instead, it will punish all Americans through depressed asset values, making saving enough for retirement even harder.""

Angel also said it could result in higher consumer prices, fewer jobs, and damaged financial markets.

While Sanders has proposed a financial transaction tax to pay for his ""College for all and cancel all student debt"" plan, Harris has designs on it funding her ""Medicare for all"" proposal.

Beyond the 2020 campaign trail, a few key pieces of legislation have been proposed in that call for a tax on trades — The Wall Street Tax Act by Senator Brian Schatz and Representative Peter DeFazio, and the Inclusive Prosperity Act of 2019, introduced in May by Sanders and Representative Barbara Lee to ""curb Wall Street greed.""

The Inclusive Prosperity Act outlines a tax of 0.5% for stocks, 0.1% for bonds, and 0.005% for derivatives — similar to Sanders' ""College for all"" plan. This is the structure most organizations use to model the impact of a tax on trades.

Here are some arguments cited in the Chamber of Commerce's study:

Some experts think average Americans will incur additional costs

The US Chamber of Commerce report argues that, over a lifetime, Sanders' plan would create a ""serious dent"" in retirement portfolios to the tune of a roughly 8.5% drop in accumulation.

Here's how it shakes out: A worker who saved $1,500 each year for 46 years in a fund earning 5% annually would see an approximately $20,000 drop in average lifetime retirement savings from the tax, according to Angel's math.

A recent study by the Modern Markets Initiative also detailed how much a tax on trades would cost retirement savers, as well as pension funds, 529 college savings plans, and university endowments — and didn't paint a particularly rosy picture.

The taxes likely wouldn't raise the money they claim they would

Sanders claims his plan will raise roughly $2.2 trillion over a 10-year period, which would be used to service the $1.6 trillion of outstanding student loan debt held by 45 million Americans.

But Angel says it's unlikely the plan would raise that much.

""FTTs rarely raise the desired net revenue because of their imact on trading volume along with the damage to other tax revenue through decreased capital gains and lower economic activity,"" he wrote.

Meanwhile, it's worth noting that when Sanders proposed a similar plan in 2016, the Tax Policy Center concluded that the plan would generate $400 billion over a decade — not $3 trillion as he claimed.

This was attributed to the idea that a tax on trades would discourage trading, hence bringing in less revenue through the tax.

""An FTT has merits,"" wrote Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. ""But its ability to raise revenue is limited because trading will decline and perhaps migrate to markets not subject to the tax.""

The proposed plans don't look like ones in other countries

Financial transaction taxes do exist in other countries, with various degrees of success. In the US, most plans propose a tax as a way to curb high-frequency trading and rein in Wall Street in addition to raising revenue.

But Angel argues that not all high-frequency trading is bad.

""HFTs such as market makers are not screwing regular people,"" Angel wrote. ""They are providing beneficial services to investors when they want to buy or sell stocks.""

In other countries that tax trading, there are exemptions for market makers who are seen doing beneficial work. The UK, France, and Italy all exempt market makers from financial transaction taxes, Angel wrote.

That's something not included in the current versions of US proposals. Dean Baker, the co-director for the Center for Economic and Policy Research, said he recommends market makers pay the tax and then apply for a refund later for trades conducted to make the market.

""I think it would be desirable to put that exemption in,"" Baker told Markets Insider. ""They do play a useful role. The point is to distinguish between when they're making the market and when they're trading on their own behalf.""

There is also debate over how much of a tax is appropriate to bring in revenue and not slow markets too much.

""The Sanders plan is higher than I would go,"" Baker said.

His worry is that at a higher tax rate, investors may be incentivized to avoid the tax by hiding trades. He says that a 0.2% tax on stock trades might be a better balance.

""There would be much less gaming"" at that level, he said. ""You can't with a straight face say it would bring the markets crashing down."""

New: The @BernieSanders campaign announces he will join striking @UAW workers at GM's Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Plant next Wednesday. — Adam Kelsey (@adamkelsey) September 20, 2019

“Throughout the campaign, Sanders has stood on multiple picket lines with workers and has used his email and text lists to urge his supporters to stand with striking workers across the country,” his campaign stated.

“In August, he released his Workplace Democracy Plan, which would double union membership during his term and give workers unprecedented protections in the workplace,” it continued.

However, one of Sanders’ visits will occur Wednesday, days after presidential rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) visit with the striking auto workers. She is expected to join the United Auto Workers “on the picket line outside GM’s Detroit-Hamtramck plant on Sunday,” according to Reuters.

Sanders, for his part, has told GM to “end the greed, sit down with the UAW and work out an agreement that treats your workers with the respect and the dignity they deserve,” Reuters reports.

Warren and Sanders have been attempting to assert themselves as the most pro-worker candidates. Both contenders have made time for protesting workers on the campaign trail, joining food workers in a minimum wage protest at Reagan National Airport over the summer:

Warren delivered a strong pro-union message on Labor Day, declaring that unions will “rebuild the middle class.”

“Unions built the middle class—and unions will rebuild the middle class,” Warren wrote. “If we want more good American jobs, then we need stronger unions and more power in the hands of the people”:

Sanders faced a stumbling block last month after proclaiming that his Medicare for All plan would “absolutely” erase union-negotiated health benefits:

The Washington Post followed up with a piece indicating that the Sanders campaign modified positions by noting that unions would continue to hold some capacity of negotiating powers via the National Labor Relations Board. However, the Sanders campaign was livid, with members of his campaign calling the report “100 percent wrong” and “bullshit”:

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) on Saturday officially unveiled his plan to eliminate $81 billion of medical debt, detailing the proposal on his website.

Sanders, who has promised to overhaul the healthcare system by abolishing private insurance and implementing Medicare for All, released his official plan in a tweet linking to his website Saturday, writing, “79 million Americans are burdened by medical debt for the ‘crime’ of getting sick. We’re going to eliminate all past-due medical debt”:

He states on his website:

“It is immoral and unconscionable that families across the country are being evicted, having their heat disconnected, or having their already-inadequate wages garnished because of crippling medical debt while the health care industry made more than $100 billion in profits last year.

Sanders’ plan would erase $81 billion in medical debt via negotiations between the federal government and “collections that have been reported to credit agencies.” However, he does not explicitly detail how he will pay for the expensive proposal.

“We’re addressing it on both ends.” Sanders said of his healthcare overhaul, according to the New York Times.“We’re addressing it now by trying to help the people who have past-due medical bills.”

“And we’re addressing it by finally creating a healthcare system that guarantees coverage to people without any premiums, without any deductibles, without any out-of-pocket expenses,” he added.

Another big piece of his proposal involves reforming the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, which Sanders calls a “disastrous piece of legislation that benefited Wall Street and the credit card companies while causing severe economic pain and financial distress for ordinary Americans throughout the country”:

The bankruptcy bill reinforced and strengthened a rigged financial system that disproportionately harms African American borrowers and makes debt relief and forgiveness harder to obtain. Not only must we eliminate past-due medical debt, we must also reform our corrupt bankruptcy system to make it easier to discharge medical bills put on credit cards and other forms of payment, and ensure this debt does not follow patients going forward.

The plan also calls to “end abusive and harassing debt collection practices,” which he will do, in part, by limiting both the contact attempts between debt collectors and individuals and “assets that can be seized and the wages that can be garnished.”

Sanders also proposes to reform the current lending system — specifically “for-profit credit registries” like Equifax:

Credit scores also systematically perpetuate gaps in wealth and inequality between white and minority consumers. For millions of Americans, one unforeseen medical emergency or illness could send a family into financial destitution or a spiraling debt trap. We must and we will remove the profit motive from assessing the creditworthiness of American consumers. We will establish a public registry that will end racial biases in credit scores and ensure those with medical debt are not penalized for the “crime” of getting sick.

The socialist senator previewed his overhaul in a tweet last month, signaling his intention to “cancel all $81 billion in existing past-due medical debt”:

It is nothing less than barbaric that the leading cause of bankruptcy in America is medical debt. These people didn't spend all their money on luxury items. Their crime was that they got sick. We are going to cancel all $81 billion in existing past-due medical debt. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) August 31, 2019

“I mean, yeah,” Woodley said when asked if she was still a supporter of Sen. Sanders. “Look, I’m not going to get behind any particular candidate right now — it’s just too early — but where Bernie lies, and his values and his standards and his policies, I’m very much in alignment with.”

“At the end of the day, we just need to fucking get a good person in office,” she continued. “So, I’m putting a lot of my energy towards Bernie Sanders’ campaign—not so much for Bernie Sanders at this moment but for politics in general, and just trying to get people passionate and excited for the 2020 election.”

She added that she will “forever” be an “I Love Bernie” person because of what Sanders “has done for our country and our world,” although she did not cite any specific accomplishments.

The actress did note, however, Sanders’ attempts to switch the “GPS of the Democratic Party.”

“He put in new coordinates,” she observed.

Woodley also talked about voter suppression, arguing that several polling stations on Election Day are “not accessible to all communities.”

“It’s very real that for marginalized communities, polling locations are very inaccessible. So for me, the empowerment and the encouragement and the mobilization comes from a place of community,” she explained.

Woodley added that she has noticed a “spark in a revolution of self-identity, and self-identification, and true self-worth” in women this year, “which is really what we need because that’s where true equality will come into play.”

The self-described democratic socialist added that he would exclude medical debt from credit reports and end credit checking for rental housing, employment, insurance and other non-lending practices.

BIDEN GOES ON THE ATTACK OVER UKRAINE CONTROVERSY, PLEDGES TO BEAT TRUMP 'LIKE A DRUM'

Sanders made no mention in the proposal of how he planned to cover the $81 billion cost. According to Reuters, the Sanders campaign has said they would pay for the debt elimination proposal through a tax on corporations based on their pay for chief executives. The details of that proposal have not been released.

During an interview with Fox News Sept. 3, Sanders acknowledged that $81 billion is ""a lot of money,"" but he added, ""Compared to what? Compared to the $1.5 trillion that Trump gave in tax breaks to the one percent and large corporations. Compared to the billions of dollars that we spent bailing out the crooks on Wall Street 11 years ago. It is a lot of money but I think it’s the right thing to do.”

Sanders was one of the earliest supporters of “Medicare-for-All,” which would replace job-based and individual health insurance with a government-run plan. Other top Democratic rivals have expressed interest in a toned-down version of Medicare-for-All. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. has endorsed Sanders' plan but said there may be different ways to achieve coverage for all. Former Vice President Joe Biden has called to extend the Affordable Care Act by adding a public option.

Sanders has also released a plan to eliminate $1.6 trillion in student loan debt while also making public college tuition-free.

As for where he draws the line in wiping out debt, Sanders in his Sept. 3 interview said ""there's a difference"" between wiping out medical debt and credit card debt. ""I don't believe we wipe out credit card debt. You want something, you pay for it.,"" he said. ""If you want to go out and buy a fancy house, you want to go out and buy a yacht, and you go in debt, hey that’s your decision…But I do believe we have to make a distinction.

Sanders was in third place with 11 percent support, a five percentage-point drop from the Register's June poll. No other candidate cracked 10 percent of the first-choice vote, with Buttigieg garnering nine percent. That also represents a five percentage-point drop from June.

Warren also had the highest percentage of poll respondents (20 percent) who said she was their second choice in the February caucus. By contrast, Biden and Sanders each garnered 10 percent of the second-choice vote. Warren also had the highest favorability rating of any candidate, with 75 percent of respondents saying they had a very or mostly favorable view of her compared to 66 percent for Biden and 58 percent for Sanders.

It’s no exaggeration, I promise.

Progressive political elites have decided that in order to save the environment, ordinary citizens must submit to radical lifestyle changes (while those same elites fly around the world on private jets and enrich themselves from trade with China, the world’s biggest polluter).

The reality may even be worse than the headline. Not only have progressive environmentalists suggested that we all switch to a diet of bugs instead of meat (especially steak, because cow farts produce carbon dontcha know), one Swedish scientist even suggested we devour the flesh of deceased humans to cut greenhouse emissions.

This followed an article published by Newsweek in which two psychologists mused on the human taboo against cannibalism, noting that “philosophers have argued that burying the dead could be wasteful in the context of the fight against world hunger.”

Cannibalism for the climate — that’s how far they’ve gone!

Population control is another solution embraced by geniuses on the left. This dystopian idea attracted attention recently after Bernie Sanders brought it up at the last Democrat presidential debate, saying people need to be educated on the “need to curb population growth.”

But Sanders was merely popularizing an idea that’s long been the dream of progressive environmentalists. A 2009 study estimated that every human child will produce, on average, 9,441 metric tons of carbon dioxide. As such, climate scientists were agitating for global population control long before Bernie made his comments.

Looks like China, despite its pollution, does have something to offer the environmental movement — the one-child policy!

Absent from Bernie’s argument in favor of curbing the population was an acknowledgment of what it’ll do to the economy and public services, two things that the socialist senator allegedly cares about. An aging populace with fewer young people producing tax revenue means a crisis for public services and a shrinking economy. Of course, progressives believe in opening the west’s borders to admit millions of working-age people from foreign countries, so maybe that’s their solution.

Don’t forget that we all have to stop driving if we want to save the climate, which means we all have to pack ourselves into dense, unaffordable cities instead of living in the suburbs. As left-wing environmentalists remind us, “suburban sprawl” also “contributes significantly to deforestation.”

But are there enough affordable homes in the cities?

Well, that depends on how you define “a home.” Is a recycled sewer pipe a home? The OPod Tube House is the latest “solution” imagined for young people who can’t afford a real house or apartment in the city. These “homes” are constructed from recycled industrial piping, and are designed to be stacked on top of each other.

If that isn’t enough of a dystopian cyberpunk nightmare for you, consider “parasite pods” — small homes designed to be attached to larger structures like skyscrapers and bridges. They’re “parasitic” — and we must credit the architectural students who came up with the concept for their refreshingly honest choice of name — because they cling to larger structures. Are you ready to be a parasite, for the environment?

Fried insects for lunch, in your parasite pod, single-occupancy of course. Cycle everywhere, unless you want to face crippling carbon taxes. Drink your iced latte with a paper straw, don’t have kids, and when you die, remember to donate your human flesh to a local restaurant.

Meanwhile, our ruling class continues to fly to climate change summits on private jets, own multiple CO2-emitting homes, and advocate for unrestricted trade with pollution world champ China. Do globalist progressive elites really not know why so many ordinary people hate them?

Their participation follows weeks of climate change alarmism from presidential candidates and activists across the globe. Several of the presidential hopefuls have floated limiting beef consumption – particularly, in recent weeks.

Yang told the audience at CNN’s 7-hour climate change town hall this month that “it’s good for the environment, it’s good for your health if you eat less meat.”

“I think it would be healthy on both an individual and a societal level for us to move in that direction,” he said.

Klobuchar also signaled support of reshaping dietary guidelines to reduce beef consumption, as did Harris, who said the government should find the balance between creating incentives and banning “certain behaviors.”

As Breitbart News reported:

Harris said she would support changing the government dietary guidelines and the food pyramid to reduce the amount of red meat in American diets. She also supported the idea of putting climate impact labels on food. “I’ve always believed that we should, you know, expand what’s on those cans of those things you buy in the grocery store,” she said. “We should expand the list. And included in that should be a measure of the impact on the environment.” Mayor Pete Buttigieg called for more “balance” in American meat production but was careful to say he was not in favor of abolishing the cow. He argued that government intervention like a carbon tax would encourage Americans have “more balanced diet” and a “more balanced footprint.” … O’Rourke cited a similar solution, arguing that a carbon tax would balance out the carbon emissions by the meat industry. “I think we just have to be more responsible in the way that we do it and the best way to do that is to allow the markets to respond by setting a price on carbon in every single part of our economy, every facet of American life,” he said.

In August, Sanders signaled that he would consider a “meat tax” in order to help combat climate change.

“Germany has imposed a meat tax in hopes of limiting this consumption,” a woman at a Q&A session at a town hall event in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, said.

“What are your plans to stop these large corporations from further usurping natural resources and polluting the planet?” she asked.

“Thank you for the question, and it’s a good question. All I can say is if we believe, as I do and you do, that climate change is real, we’re gonna have to tackle it in every area, including agriculture,” Sanders said.

Their participation in the Steak Fry comes one day after Friday’s global climate strike, which several of the candidates adamantly praised:

Cory Booker’s presidential campaign manager is warning in a memo to staff that the Democratic senator from New Jersey must raise an additional $1.7 million by the end of the third quarter of fundraising – just 10 days away – or the campaign will not have a “legitimate long-term path forward.”

In the memo, campaign manager Addisu Demissie warned that following a weaker than expected cash haul during the early part of September, “the next 10 days will determine whether Cory Booker can stay in this race.""

BOOKER VOICES CONCERNS OVER BIDEN'S ABILITY 'TO CARRY THE BALL'

The existence of the memo was first reported Saturday morning by NBC News, with Fox News confirming the news with multiple sources.

Two sources, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely, said it was no accident that the memo was leaked, and described it as an effort to spark a surge in fundraising over the next 10 days.

And a campaign memo sent to political reporters Saturday morning said: “This isn't an end-of-quarter stunt or another one of those memos from a campaign trying to spin the press. This is a real, unvarnished look under the hood of our operation at a level of transparency unprecedented in modern presidential campaigns.”

Booker, who declared his candidacy for the White House in early February, quickly built a formidable operation in the early voting primary and caucus states. The large staff on the ground in Iowa, New Hampshire, and other early voting states is expensive to maintain. Demissie warned that while the campaign can continue at its current size and strength, it needs more funding if it wants to expand.

WHERE BOOKER STANDS IN THE LATEST FOX NEWS 2020 POLL

Demissie explained in his memo ""If our campaign is not in a financial position to grow, he’s not going to continue to consume resources and attention that can be used to focus on beating Donald Trump, which needs to be everyone's first priority.”

While Booker qualified for the third and fourth round Democratic presidential primary debates, he’s struggled in polling, averaging in the low to mid-single digits, far behind top-tier contenders former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

WaPo reporter Hannah Natanson began her piece by pointing out that 19th century abolitionist Douglass (1818-1895) ""appears alone in almost every photograph, staring down the camera in isolated, thoughtful splendor,"" while Warren ""features today in countless iPhone photos and Instagram feeds, her arm around voter after voter, always bearing the same wide grin.""

""The two are separated by race, gender and more than 100 years of history that forged an America that would probably be unrecognizable to Douglass,"" Nathanson wrote. ""Still, experts say, their use of photography collapses the distance: Douglass sat for scores of pictures to normalize the idea of black excellence and equality, and Warren’s thousands of selfies with supporters could do the same for a female president.""

WARREN GETS STUMPED BY COLBERT WHEN PRESSED ON MIDDLE-CLASS TAX HIKES TO FUND MEDICARE-FOR-ALL

The piece goes on to cite professors who support the comparison presented by Natanson that both Warren and Douglass were ""smashing stereotypes.""

“She’s presenting a public image of herself as somebody who is presidential,” Columbia University professor Alexander Alberro said. “What Douglass tried to do was to create a public persona in the face of the negative type of image of African Americans at the time … so I think the comparison is really good.”

Louisiana State University professor Nichole Bauer suggested that even if Warren goes on to defeat in 2020, her ""million selfies are just a little bit more of a crack in that glass ceiling.”

Still, the comparison raised many eyebrows on social media.

Not so long ago, a United Auto Workers strike against General Motors was a big deal. Of course, not so long ago, General Motors was a big company—in fact, the biggest company in not only the U.S., but in the whole wide world.

Times change, and now the GM strike, which began on September 15, is just a footnote in the news. Or, actually, we should say, it was just small beer, until both Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders announced that they would visit the Michigan picket line. Maybe soon, another dozen or so Democrat presidential candidates will show up, too, along with the usual traveling circus of roving reporters, talking heads, and publicity-seeking celebrities.

Yes, times change—and they never stop changing.

Yet even if the GM strike is now firmly in the news, the fact remains that GM today is just a shadow of what it once was. It’s only the 13th-largest company in the U.S. by revenues and the 32nd-largest in the world. And if one measures GM by market capitalization—that is, the total value of its stock—it’s even further back in the pack; its market cap is $54 billion, whereas top-ranked Microsoft is worth $1.06 trillion, or 20 times as much.

For its part, the UAW, too, has shrunk dramatically; its membership has declined by nearly three-fourths over the last four decades, from 1.5 million in 1979 to 400,000 today.

By now, these sorts of statistics—the rise of tech, the decline of manufacturing, including manufacturing employment—have become familiar. Yet still, as a nation, we haven’t yet figured out how to make sure workers get a fair piece of the pie. How are people—with or without unions—going to make a living in the 21st century?

Perhaps we can gain perspective on this question by learning more about how leaders thought about jobs and economic justice in the 20th century. Yes, times and technology have changed, and yet human beings are still human beings. And as American citizens, they have political rights and legitimate needs—and these, as we shall see, have been sorely neglected in recent decades.

When Workers Were Strong—Maybe Too Strong

Let’s go back to November 21, 1945, when the UAW struck GM. That strike was a front-page big deal, with vast national repercussions. For context, we can recall that this strike came just three months after the end of World War II; in the new post-war era, both business and labor, unleashed from most wartime controls, were eager to get back to peacetime manufacturing and working.

So if GM wanted to sell more cars, its workers wanted more pay; specifically, the union wanted a 30 percent raise. GM said “no,” and the strike was on; some 320,000 employees hit the picket lines. (We might note that in those days, the GM strikers represented .56 percent of the nation’s total employment. We can pause to observe that more than half of one percent for just one firm is a lot; by comparison in 2019, the GM strike involves only 48,000 workers, or .003 percent—less than a thirtieth of one percent—of America’s employed today.)

In March 1946, four months after the labor action began, the two sides reached a settlement; GM workers got a 17.5 percent raise.

Yet the GM strike was just an overture; 1945-46 saw a nationwide wave of strikes as electrical workers, meatpackers, steel workers, oil workers, railroad engineers, theatrical craftsmen—4.3 million workers total—went off the job. That was roughly eight percent of the workforce.

Needless to say, all these strikes put a burden on the economy, as well as on the social order. In particular, in those days, as the first chill winds of the Cold War were being felt, J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI had well-founded concerns about communist influence—even outright pro-Soviet activity—within some unions. In the meantime, in addition, evidence abounded of mob influence and hooliganism within some unions.

So the challenge to the nation was serious—that is, balancing the rights of workers alongside the overall public interest in law-abiding prosperity.

This need to find the proper balance meant re-examining a key piece of legislation that had been passed in the New Deal decade of the 1930s, namely, the National Labor Relations Act, better known as the Wagner Act.

The Wagner Act was called the “Magna Carta for labor” for a reason; just as the Magna Carta (Great Charter) back in 1215 had guaranteed rights for Englishman, so, too, did the Wagner Act guarantee rights for labor, including:

The exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other mutual aid or protection.

That is, collective bargaining. Unions.

It’s interesting to recall the breadth of support for the Wagner Act at the time of its passage; back in ’35, in the middle of the Depression, majorities in both parties agreed that something had to be done to empower workers. Thus the U.S. Senate approved the measure by a vote of 63 to 12, with a dozen Republicans joining in support, while the House passed the bill without even bothering with a recorded vote. On July 5, 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed it into law, describing it “to be necessary as an act of both common justice and economic advance.”

The Wagner Act was broadly popular because it was based on an obvious point: To achieve a fair bargain, both sides in a negotiation need to have bargaining power.

To put that another way, if Big Business was the new economic reality, then labor needed to be big, too. After all, if labor wasn’t strong enough to stand up to business, then business would rule, perhaps in the manner of European fascism.

In other words, as is the risk with any one-sided regime, a lopsided power equation in favor of business could lead to tyranny. And that, in turn, could produce a backlash, some sort of violent revolt. Indeed, it’s worth recalling that in 1935, the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia was a recent memory; no right-thinking American wanted to see the red tide coming here.

So the Wagner Act was, in reality, a moderate compromise, aimed at fending off radicalism from either the right or the left. Indeed, it echoed the checks and balances written into the Constitution; the whole idea was to guarantee that business would have to bargain with labor. The economist John Kenneth Galbraith would later describe the system as the interplay of “countervailing forces”: Big Business checked by Big Labor—and vice versa.

Harry Truman Confronts the Labor Crisis

As a senator in 1935, Harry Truman had voted for the Wagner Act, and yet now, as president in 1945, he saw that the reform needed reform; labor’s Magna Carta had given the unions too free a rein—and so it was time to rein them in.

In Year of Decisions, the first volume of his memoirs, Truman wrote, “By the autumn of 1945, the labor situation was assuming serious proportions … The increasing labor difficulties of the postwar period were the subject of many discussions with the Cabinet in meetings in October and November.”

This labor unrest was ironic, because, of course, Truman and the Democrats in charge of Congress were generally pro-labor. And yet as we all have discovered, even a good thing is often in need of tinkering—and if necessary, a full overhauling.

Being the energetic man that he was, Truman took action; he invited the leaders of labor and management—including the heads of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the American Federation of Labor, and the Congress of Industrial Organizations—to meet with him in Washington to “work out a new approach to toward solving the industrial crisis.”

We might pause over those last two words, “industrial crisis.” As Truman further wrote, “The country needed a national wage policy, effective mediation machinery, and other remedial legislation which would protect the rightful interests of labor, of management, and of the public.”

Mindful of these goals, Truman began to formulate a series of reforms to the Wagner Act, such as mandatory cooling off periods and a ban on secondary strikes. He was even willing, if need to be, to send in federal troops to operate trains and mines; Truman was pro-labor, yes, but he was pro-public interest, first.

On November 5, 1945, Truman addressed the assembled leaders of business and labor in the Labor Department’s main auditorium—a bit of signaling there. Yet still, in his speech, the president spoke bluntly to both sides: “Failure to produce any workable recommendations on how to avoid work stoppages would mean legislation by Congress.” In other words, if you guys in the private sector can’t figure this out, elected officials will have to step in.

Unfortunately, the negotiations proved to be just more confrontations; even as they were sitting in the same room together, under the watchful eye of Team Truman, business and labor leaders couldn’t agree on anything important.

Indeed, to Truman’s dismay, the single most difficult figure proved to be a labor man, John L. Lewis, president of the mighty United Mine Workers. In that period, Truman summoned Lewis to the White House on no less than six occasions, warning him that “precipitous strikes” could lead the opposition congressional Republicans pushing “punitive measures against labor.” Indeed, when the mine workers defied a federal court’s back-to-work order, Truman’s Justice Department hauled Lewis himself into court, finding him guilty of civil and criminal contempt.

Beyond his exasperation with Lewis, Truman was concerned that if he and his fellow Democrats couldn’t take labor to the higher ground of constructive compromise, the Republicans would take labor to the abyss of annihilation. That is, whereas Democrats wanted to reform the Wagner Act, many Republicans, grown more militant since the ’30s, were now seeking its outright repeal.

Truman was nothing if not vivid in a letter he wrote to another labor leader on December 11, 1945: “I am going to need all the help and cooperation I can possibly get to keep labor from getting its throat slit in this Congress.” [emphasis added]

Yet in the end, Truman’s mediation efforts, valiant as they were, were not successful. The gap between Big Business and Big Labor was simply too wide to be easily or quickly bridged.

As a result, in November 1946, the opposition Republicans, surfing a wave of outrage against the antics of Lewis and other labor barons, won a smashing victory in the midterm elections. For the first time since 1930, the GOP had control of both chambers of Congress; indeed, it seemed that Truman himself would be a dead duck in the 1948 election.

The centerpiece of the Republican agenda for the 80th Congress, convening in January 1947, was braking, or even breaking, the power of labor.

Thus the Taft-Hartley Act was passed in June 1947; Truman vetoed the legislation, and his veto was overridden, with many Democrats joining in the overriding.

Yet soon after its enactment, Taft-Hartley began causing regrets. If the Wagner Act was seen as too pro-labor, Taft-Hartley was seen as too anti-labor. Seizing on this revised sentiment, and preparing for his own campaign to win a second term in the White House, Truman set about rallying labor and the party of labor, the Democrats, against the anti-labor Republicans. Prominent in the Democrat Party’s 1948 platform: “We advocate the repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act.”

Truman had gauged the shifting public sentiment correctly; the Missourian won a smashing comeback victory in 1948. In fact, not only was he victorious, but Democrats also recaptured the House and the Senate. So we can see: The “loyal opposition” in Congress had badly overplayed its hand; the country wanted the New Deal to be reformed, not repealed. (Here at Breitbart News earlier this year, I detailed Truman’s big win, considering ways in which Donald Trump could apply the same sort of anti-“loyal opposition” strategy in 2020.)

The following year, 1949, good to his word, Truman sought the repeal of Taft-Hartley. And yet he failed in his effort, largely because Southern Democrats, representing states where unions were weak, were figuring out that they could gain economically by attracting factories from the unionized North. (Taft-Hartley gave each state the option of being either a “union shop” state, or a “right to work”—that is, anti-union—state.)

Today, the “right to work” movement has spread widely; 27 states—including, amazingly enough, Michigan—have “right to work” laws on their books.

In Truman’s time, the Democrat Party was split between its Northern and Southern wings. And so, thus divided, the House of Labor started to crumble. It’s fair to say that Taft-Hartley doomed mass unionization in the U.S.

When Workers Are Weak—Labor’s Long Slide

So if we’ve seen unions when they were at their peak of optimism—critics would say arrogance—now, we can look at unions in their valley of doubt.

As we have seen, the basic idea behind labor unions is bargaining power—the power of collective bargaining.

Since the Taft-Hartley legislation of 1947, workers and their unions have always had to confront the reality that if they bargain too hard, the company can simply move to a less-expensive right-to-work state. It took a few decades before the full effect of this dynamic became obvious, but by the ’60s and ’70s, it was obvious to all.

Indeed, the percentage of private-sectors workers in unions has fallen from more than a third in the 1950s to less than seven percent today. (And free trade agreements, making it easy for companies relocate out of the U.S. altogether, have only exacerbated this trend.)

As a result, workers are in a weaker position today; they have lost their bargaining power. To be sure, there are plenty of laws on the books concerning working conditions—and plenty of trial lawyers eager to sue over some breach, real or imagined—and yet for most jobs, statutes concerning actual wages that must be paid are scant and inadequate. And that’s why there are so few strikes in the private sector; workers have learned, the hard way, that they must take what the bosses are offering.

Some Painful Numbers for Working People

Moreover, that’s why, according to the Pew Research Center, real wages (that is, adjusted for inflation) for most Americans have stagnated for the last half-century. Yes, it’s true that in many ways, the standard of living is vastly higher than it was in the 1960s, as new inventions have flooded the market, making goods both better and cheaper.

Yet still, some key variables, such as the cost of college and the cost of housing, have skyrocketed, leaving many workers today demonstrably worse off than their predecessors. And in any case, there’s nothing like a big fat paycheck.

The pro-labor Economic Policy Institute (EPI) makes a further point, focusing on the hurtful impact that ebbing bargaining power has had on workers, even as the overall economy has sailed along. According to EPI data, from 1948 to 1979, increases in wages and increases in productivity closely paralleled one another: In those three decades, productivity rose 108 percent, while compensation rose 93 percent. That wasn’t a perfect one-to-one ratio, but it was close enough. And it seemed only fair: If workers were working better, they should be sharing in the gains. And unions were there to make sure that the sharing occurred.

Yet since 1979, according to EPI, productivity and compensation have gone their separate ways: Productivity has risen 69 percent, while compensation has risen just 11 percent. To put it another way, productivity went up more than six times faster than compensation. EPI’s message is clear: In the absence of unions, the gain-sharing imperative on business was also absent.

So where did the added value of those productivity increases go, if not to workers? Short answer: Much of the added value went to corporate investors; that’s one reason why the Dow Jones average sits above 27,000. Indeed, over the last four decades, the stock market is up more than 3,200 percent; by contrast, the federal minimum wage is up 250 percent.

Furthermore, a close look at data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve provides an even more startling look at labor’s long slide. In 1947, the year Taft-Hartley passed, compensation (defined as wages and salary accruals) accounted for 49.4 percent of GDP; that is, workers got a smidge less than half of the national output. Interestingly, the workers’ share of GDP rattled around in a narrow three-point band for the next two decades, never going below 48.8 percent and peaking, in 1969, at 51.6 percent.

Yet then came that long slide in labor incomes. Taft-Hartley obviously played a role, but so, too, did other forces, such as globalization, outsourcing, and mass immigration. By 2011, during the Obama administration, worker compensation as a percentage of GDP had fallen to 42 percent; in the last seven years, it has ticked up slightly, to 43 percent.

Hmm. From 51.6 percent of GDP in 1969 to 43 percent in 2018. Over time, ordinary folks must have noticed that fall in their share of the nation’s wealth. Indeed, now we can start to see why economic populists in decades past—Dick Gephardt in the ’80s, Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan in the ’90s—found such resonance, even if they never reached the White House. It was not until Trump that anyone could put it all together, although the anger had long been smoldering.

So again, who got those shifting 8.6 percentage points of the national wealth? They went to many places, including government, private investment, and the trade deficit. And oh yes, during the same half century, corporate profits rose from about five percent of GDP to ten percent. Yes, you read that right: Much of the change in the national share going to compensation has simply been a shift from workers to corporations—workers down more than eight points and corporate profits up five points. (Of course, it’s also true that wealth to corporations is wealth to shareholders, and many workers are shareholders, either through direct investments, or indirectly, through pension funds. But still, few workers think of themselves as investors; that’s why they call themselves workers—because they can’t rely on their capital to live, and so they have to rely, instead, on their labor.)

If we step back and consider the fate of workers’ wages over the last five decades, 1969 to 2018, we see that the change has been profound; it explains, for example, why the financiers of Manhattan are so rich and the workers of Milwaukee are so hard-pressed. After all, that decline in compensation—again, from the high of 51.6 percent down to 43 percent—amounts to a decline of 8.6 percentage points. For the U.S. economy, that’s more than one dollar in 12.

To put that 8.6-point number another way, since U.S. GDP is $21.3 trillion, 8.6 percent of that is more than $1.8 trillion. So now maybe we can better see why workers have been angry for so long: They’ve been on the losing end of that long slide—in effect, a $1.8 trillion pay cut, just in 2018.

Of course, during this long slide, most Republicans have typically cheered; they might not have even realized the income shift, but they certainly noticed the partisan shift. After all, Big Labor was once the mainstay of the Democrat Party, and so the shrinking of labor has shrunk the Democrats; the party of Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson is no longer winning giant landslides in the way that the party of Franklin D. Roosevelt did in the ’30s and ’40s, or that of Lyndon Johnson did in 1964. (Of course, it’s also no longer the party of Jefferson and Jackson—or, for that matter, of FDR and LBJ.)

On the other hand, the new Democrat Party is hardly a weakling; it has won the presidency in four of the last seven elections—and won the national popular vote in six of the last seven. So while it’s true that the Democrats aren’t winning giant landslides anymore, they have proven themselves capable of winning decent-sized landslides. In 1992, for example, Bill Clinton won 370 electoral votes, and in 1996, he won 379. In 2008, Barack Obama won 365, and in 2012, he won 365. In the meantime, no Republican—including Trump—has scored more than any of those electoral-vote totals since 1988.

Moreover, in lesser elections, the Democrats are doing well enough. They boast 54 percent of seats in the House of Representatives, possess 47 percent of seats in the U.S. Senate, and hold 46 percent of governorships—and own as well nearly 100 percent of big-city mayorships.

Yet ominously for the nation, the new Democrat Party has changed: It seems that even Harry Truman-type Democrats have gone away. Truman’s old Senate seat is now held by a Republican, Josh Hawley.

Today’s Democrat Party is mostly free of the influence of industrial union halls, which were once themselves thick with American flags and military veterans.

Instead, today’s Democrats are more in the mold of either Hillary Clinton or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; that is, they are oriented toward de luxe financialism or relentless radicalism—and often embrace both views at the same time.

Indeed, as their center of gravity has shifted from union halls to university campuses, today’s Democrats are ever more likely to delve into exotic isms, going even further afield from lunch-bucket and kitchen-table concerns. (Although, of course, there are plenty of self-declared socialists in the Democrat Party today; so it’s hardly the case that economic concerns have disappeared, even if most Americans rightfully fear a Hugo Chavez-like policy agenda. Socialism, of course, makes Truman-style populism look pretty darn good.)

Still, the leftward ideological transformation of the Democrat Party might be helping the Republicans in some places—it’s getting easier to portray Democrats as “loony left”—and yet it also means that there will be hell to pay when the Democrats next win.

The Party That Works for Workers Will Win with Workers

Of course, in the short run, there’s not much to be done about these changes. What matters more for the right is getting its own house in order, and that requires a franker understanding of who, exactly, is voting Republican these days.

To that end, more Republicans might take a close look at the 2014 manifesto that helped inspire Donald Trump to run for president: Rick Santorum’s Blue Collar Conservatives: Recommitting to an America That Works.

In addition, majority-minded Republicans might study The Republican Workers Party: How the Trump Victory Drove Everyone Crazy, and Why It Was Just What We Needed, published last year by F. H. Buckley. That phrase, Republican Workers Party, is a keeper.

In this vein of Main Street Republicanism, it was heartening to see the September 17 headline in Politico: “White House intervenes in General Motors strike: The effort would effectively put the White House on the side of the United Auto Workers.” (Yes, the formal UAW structure is still strongly aligned with the Democrats, but as Breitbart News has noted, in 2017 and again in 2019, the actual auto workers are now mostly Republican—although, of course, it’s always possible to make them more Republican.)

Yet of course, if the Democrats, starting with Sanders and Warren, choose, once again, to worry about auto workers and the working class in general—and if they can demonstrate that they’re truly sincere and not just using workers for props—well, who knows what will happen in 2020, and beyond.

In addition, over the long run, if we’re feeling philosophical, we might give ourselves time to think about how America would be different today if labor unions hadn’t been so profoundly sundered by Taft-Hartley, way back in the fateful decade of the ’40s.

That is, what if the Democrats were still following practical-minded middle-of-the-roaders, such as Harry Truman? As we have seen, back in the ’40s, Truman did not succeed in saving the unions from the start of their long slide—but at least he gave it his best shot.

Harry Truman, Meet Your Senatorial Successor, Josh Hawley

And as we think back on Truman, we might also think ahead. We might look, for instance, to the man now sitting in Truman’s Senate seat, Josh Hawley. Just on September 18, in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, Hawley outlined his vision of standing up for ordinary folks: “If the conservative movement wants to have a future, it’s going to have to commit itself to being the movement of working people. If we do that, if conservatives do that, if there’s a core group that will do that, then the rest of D.C., the lobbyists, they will follow along. It’s going to have to be people-driven change.”

So what, exactly, does Hawley have in mind? How, precisely, is he going to seek to raise the standard of living in Missouri—and everywhere else? Hawley hasn’t yet fleshed out the details, but hey, let’s give him space; he’s only been in the Senate for nine months, and he’s spent most of that time on a worthy mission, namely, taking on Big Tech—and on that subject, he’s provided plenty of details.

Yet even so, he had more to say to Breitbart News, and what he said is encouraging:

We have to stay focused on the issues that actually matter to real people and have to challenge the leadership class. So, as the Democrats turn towards socialism, is that a problem? Yeah, it is, but it just goes to show you that they have no idea how to respond to the needs of working people. We can’t just reject their crazy ideas. We also have to push forward with an agenda that actually benefits what I call the “American middle,” which is the middle of our society, people that really sustain our society. So it’s going to be a pro-worker agenda, it has to get wages up, we have to get manufacturing going again, we have to get healthcare costs down, to get folks new opportunities to get skills and jobs training, break up the monopoly of higher education, and take on the monopolists in the economy and their sweetheart deals with government.

Hawley has his own ideas, and yet we can recognize some Trumanesque themes.

And Truman, let’s not forget, spent nearly eight years in the White House."

Members of the Hawkeye Marching Band allege that they were subjected to racial slurs and other verbal abuse, and sexual harassment before, during and after the game. Two band members told the Cedar Rapids Gazette that a third band member, a woman was hospitalized with fractured ribs.

Administrators at the two schools announced earlier in the week that they had looked into the allegations, but they didn't say whether anyone would face punishment. Iowa's athletic director, Gary Barta, and his Iowa State counterpart, Jamie Pollard, released a joint statement saying members of both schools' bands had been subjected to ""rude, vulgar, and in some cases violent"" conduct at football games in recent years, and urging fans to stop the behavior.

FOOTBALL FAN WHO REQUESTED BEER MONEY ON TV REVEALS HE'S RAISED $820G FOR CHILDREN'S CHARITY

In response, 21-year-old Corey Knopp, who plays tenor sax for the Iowa Marching Band, posted his account of the abuse following the game, which Iowa won 18-17.

""People were physically assaulted,"" Knopp said. ""We expect to get booed and cussed at. But never for violence to take place...Put yourself in our shoes. Kids. Marching in formation back to our busses after a long day. Getting shoved and having beer cans shaken and sprayed at our feet. Getting slapped because of the words on our uniform (IOWA). Getting pushed so hard that someone’s (not going to name this person) ribs are broken. That is completely unacceptable.""

BERNIE SANDERS' IOWA POLITICAL DIRECTOR HAS LEFT CAMPAIGN, REPORTS SAY

Knopp also detailed to the Gazette how an Iowa State fan shoved him as they were marching back to the team buses.

""He decided to cut through the band and shoved me out of his way. I yelled, ‘Do not put your hands on me sir,’ and he yelled back, ‘F--k you.’”

Nathan Topping, a 19-year-old trumpet player, told the Gazette a full beer bottle was thrown at him, causing what he described as a ""nasty bruise.""

""It was the fans,"" said Paige Pearson, 20, who plays trumpet in the Iowa band. ""The Iowa State band has been nothing but kind. They've reached out to us and said sorry this happened. It was not even the students, but adult fans.""

University of Iowa spokeswoman Jeneane Beck said Friday that the social media posts made it clear that the university hadn’t adequately conveyed to its students what it had done to address the band members’ concerns, the Gazette reported.

“Student safety is our number one priority and we are committed to ensuring a safe experience on game day for our students,” Beck said. “Additionally we are continuing our investigation to ensure all of our students have the ability to share their experiences with the appropriate authorities.”

Transcript as follows:

TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Millions of schoolchildren across America and in fact, around the world, skipped school today. They weren’t playing hooky. They were instead participating in a coordinated left-wing political protest. It was called Climate Strike. So naturally, MSNBC was there to cheer them on.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: New York City is the home base for these protests. School officials, public school officials are allowing nearly one million students to cut classes.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Some of the signs by the way that I’ve seen so far for this rally was absolutely fantastic.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look, I am not in favor of encouraging people to skip class, but if there is a cause that is important, this is it, so good on you for going out there and telling people what really matters. Congratulations to you and those like you around the world.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: Congratulations on skipping school. Throughout the day news anchors assured their viewers that the strike was, in fact, being led by the kids. They were lying, of course. Like all activist movements, the climate strike was organized by cynical adults — adults hoping to exploit children for political purposes, obviously.

The other lie you heard today is that the strike was about the environment. It was not about the environment. The main goal of the protesters in this country, for example, was to implement Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal.

You’ll remember from just a few months ago that the Green New Deal is not about the environment. In fact, Ocasio-Cortez’s Chief of Staff conceded as much, we’re quoting now, “We really think of it as a how-do-you-change-the- entire-economy thing,” end quote, but that shouldn’t surprise you.

The environmental movement itself has all but given up on the environment. Don’t believe it? Look around. Is our country cleaner than it was? No. It’s dirtier, and it’s more crowded, and it gets more of both of those things every year. The left doesn’t care. They’re cheering it on. Why? Because they want power.

And in climate change, they found an emergency big enough to justify grabbing more power, in fact, taking control of everything. Don’t believe it? Check out the manifesto of Youth Climate Strike. That’s one of the group’s leading today’s strike.

The document calls for, among other things, state-owned banks, single-payer healthcare, affordable housing, expanded rights for sexual minorities, et cetera. Now, you may agree with those political goals, or you may disagree. But what do they have to do with the environment? Obviously, nothing. But whatever. Full speed ahead.

Bernie Sanders, among others, is now demanding that the United States begin admitting what he calls climate refugees into our country, maybe in your neighborhood. That would include everyone south of Miami, or north of Buenos Aires, all of now have a right to move because climate.

So what are the chances of something like that passing Congress, you ask, well, right around zero. Congress will never pass a law allowing that. And so that means in order to get what they want, progressives will have to bypass Congress, not to mention voters themselves. And they’d like to do that.

Watch as Colorado Senator Michael Bennet explains that the main thing in the way of his climate agenda, is yes, democracy.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEN. MICHAEL BENNET (D-CO), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think this is a test that’s not well understood by some of the candidates in the race and not — it has not been well debated. Is our democracy up to this task? And that is a really non-trivial question. Because —

CHRIS HAYES, MSNBC HOST: I mean, it clearly isn’t right now.

BENNET: So far, we have not. We haven’t been, and when you lose a national races as we did in ’16 to a climate denier that creates a real concern.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: Is our democracy up to the task? If you’re even asking that question, you’re missing the point because democracy is the point. But damn democracy says the left. It is standing in the way of us getting control of every detail of your life. We’ll have to do something about that. That is their position.

In the meantime, though, the left has a backup plan. It’s the same as it always has been — propaganda.

Another demand of the youth climate Strike Group is what they’re calling quote, “comprehensive climate change education.” They want it for children aged five to 14. Five years old? Why so young? Well, because — and again, we’re quoting here, ” … impressionability is high during that developmental stage,” end quote.

In other words, brainwashing is easier when they’re little. And there you have the modern left’s climate agenda: no drinking straws, no automobiles, no airplanes, no meat, no democracy. In their place, endless propaganda and a parade of 15-year-old Red Guards yelling at you to stay in line. That’s what they’re promising.

All of a sudden, the future really does that bleak, and it has nothing to do with rising temperatures.

FOX NEWS POLL: BIDEN AT NEW LOW IN DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY RACE

Biden, Sanders, Warren and Trump all keep demanding and high-pressure schedules, traveling frequently, often getting little sleep, and speaking on an almost daily basis in front of TV cameras to answer questions from reporters and to address audiences large and small. That takes stamina and a quick mind.

But because they speak in public so often and most of what they say is recorded, each of them sometimes generates news stories when saying the wrong thing at the wrong time.

Biden, however, seems to exceed the average for the number of these gaffes. And because the former vice president’s frequent gaffes have now become an issue raising questions about his fitness to serve as president, they are getting outsized attention in the media and from his opponents.

Still, at this early stage in the 2020 presidential race Biden remains the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. A Fox News poll that came out this week shows Biden has the support of 29 percent of likely Democratic primary voters, compared with 18 percent for Sanders and 16 percent for Warren. However, Biden’s solid lead was down by two points since August and six points since May.

Biden has almost universal name recognition among voters from his eight years as President Barack Obama’s vice president and 36 years in the Senate before that. A centrist who doesn’t embrace the more far-left policies of Sanders and Warren, Biden has strong appeal for many voters because of his more moderate positions and because they believe he can make Trump a one-term president.

But what about all the Biden gaffes? His critics are raising questions about his mental fitness and whether he could be suffering from the early stages of dementia that could grow markedly worse at the end of a potential two terms in the White House.

So far the Democratic presidential candidate going after Trump most directly on the mental fitness issue is former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, who aggressively attacked Biden in the last presidential debate, accusing Biden of forgetting a comment he had made just minutes earlier.

But it turns out that Castro was the one who forgot what Biden said. Does the fact that Castro got mixed up mean he is suffering from dementia?

Look, dementia isn’t diagnosed by watching someone on a podium at a televised debate, where candidates are required to instantly respond to questions and sum up complex issues in a minute or less.

And once in office, presidents have advisers and briefings and time to learn and think about issues. No one is ever going to say to a president: Sir (or someday Madam), tell me in 60 seconds how to end terrorism, or end poverty, or improve our educational system, or balance the federal budget.

And when we look at Biden’s gaffes and question if he is possibly “losing it” or if he’s fit for office, we shouldn’t forget that President Trump certainly has made quite a few gaffes of his own.

More importantly, according to The Washington Post’s Fact Checker database, as of Aug. 5 Trump “had made 12,019 false or misleading claims.”

“President Trump’s proclivity for spouting exaggerated numbers, unwarranted boasts and outright falsehoods has continued at a remarkable pace,” a Post article reported.

Of course, the president and his supporters strongly dispute the Post tally, and the president regularly denounces the newspaper as biased against him and as purveying “fake news.”

But if voters are concerned about instances where Biden gets a bit confused at times and inadvertently says the wrong thing, they should be even more concerned about Trump’s “false and misleading claims.”

We all accidentally say the wrong thing sometimes and forget things or remember past events incorrectly. Those are innocent mistakes.

And we all age differently. Some people are past their peak mental performance in their 60s and some even have dementia at that age. Others are just fine mentally in their 80s and even beyond.

Space doesn’t permit a listing of all Biden’s gaffes, simply because there are so many. But importantly, he’s been making these gaffes for decades, going back to when he was a young man and in middle age. That hasn’t prevented him from devoting a lifetime to public service and accomplishing a great deal for the American people.

But let’s look at just a few of Biden’s gaffes.

Recently Biden has urged parents to keep “record players” on to improve the vocabulary of their

children. He said he was in Vermont when he was really in New Hampshire.

Biden said in August that he was still vice president at the time of the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Feb.14, 2018 – when he had been out of office for more than a year. An official with Biden’s campaign later said Biden had meant to refer to the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, which occurred in December 2012.

And one of Biden’s gaffes, which was a favorite for many and quite funny, came during CNN’s July 31 presidential debate, when he asked voters to “go to Joe 30330.” He said later he meant to say “text.” “I was so focused on making the case for Joe, I said ‘Joe’ and I gave the number,” he said.

According to the Alzheimer’s Association: “There is no one test to determine if someone has dementia. Doctors diagnose Alzheimer’s and other types of dementia based on a careful medical history, a physical examination, laboratory tests, and the characteristic changes in thinking, day-to-day function and behavior associated with each type.”

I’m not a doctor and I certainly can’t diagnose Biden’s mental abilities. But you would think if he really was slipping mentally his own doctors, his wife, other family members and the people who work with him every day would notice something was seriously wrong.

And you would think Biden himself would notice and conclude for his own health and for the good of the country he deeply loves that he should withdraw from the presidential race – or resign from the presidency, should he become president and be stricken with dementia.

The bottom line is that opponents attack each other in campaigns. This has begun happening in the 2020 presidential race and is going to get a lot worse. As the Democratic front-runner, Biden is a magnet for attacks – as always happens with front-runners.

My best advice to Biden is to focus on trying to reduce the number of gaffes he makes, working with his top advisers. He has an outstanding record in government and shouldn’t be pushed out of the race for slips of the tongue, as long as they don’t indicate he has more serious problems that make him unfit to be our next president.

Former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is no longer scheduled to participate in a three-day festival hosted by The Atlantic next week, the publication said Friday.

Several liberal groups are claiming victory, saying they pressured Nielsen to back out of the event.

“We previously announced that we would be interviewing former DHS Sec. Kirstjen Nielsen at @TheAtlanticFest next week. Nielsen's team has let us know that she is no longer able to participate in the interview,” The Atlantic Communications tweeted Friday afternoon.

KIRSTJEN NIELSEN MAKES FIRST PUBLIC COMMENTS AFTER RESIGNATION AS DHS BOSS

The magazine maintains Nielsen was the one to cancel the scheduled appearance.

""I wanted to let everyone know that Kirstjen Nielsen's team has let us know that she is no longer able to participate in TAF [The Atlantic Festival],"" Margaret Low, president of AtlanticLive, wrote in an email to staff obtained by The Hill.



Two sources familiar with the matter told The Hill that several Atlantic staffers protested the decision to include Nielsen in the festival, but a magazine spokesperson said Nielsen’s “invitation was not rescinded, so that is 100 percent inaccurate.""

Liberals take credit

But liberal organizations took credit and also criticized The Atlantic for initially including the former Trump administration immigration official on the festival's set list.

The announcement came following backlash from a progressive grassroots group called CREDO Action, which claimed ""Public pressure from thousands of CREDO members and grassroots activists forced Kirstjen Nielsen to withdraw from the Atlantic Fest, which is a huge victory and should set a precedent for not putting profits over morals when it comes to Trump administration alumni.""

Credo Action campaign director Nicole Regalado, told The Hill ""No one from Trump's administration should get a soft landing to sanitize their actions while supporting and pushing forward a white nationalist, fascist agenda.""

'Public backlash' threatened

The group also threatened that the media and corporations should think twice before giving a platform to “people who worked hand-in-hand with Trump to separate families, lock babies up in cages, and terrorize communities of color.""



""Public backlash will be swift and powerful for anyone who tries to help rehabilitate the reputations of Trump's top henchmen,"" CREDO Action said in a statement, according to Common Dreams.

The Atlantic had announced earlier this week that Nielsen would be interviewed during the three-day The Atlantic Festival on “the Trump administration’s immigration policy, which she implemented as Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.”

The Atlantic’s Tuesday news release also said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, and Disney CEO Bob Iger would be interviewed onstage during the festival, set to be held in Washington, Tuesday through Thursday.

Other current and former Trump administration officials remain on the guest list. Jim Mattis, who served a tumultuous two years as Trump's defense secretary before he was fired, is scheduled to speak, as is current Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II.



Liberal groups on Twitter also took aim at The Atlantic and pointed to Nielsen’s record of perceived offenses against immigrants.



""Kirstjen Nielsen, you don't get to separate families, cause long-lasting trauma to our kids, and think you can walk away scot-free,"" Vote Latino, a voter advocacy group, said on Twitter. ""We will not forget the harm you've caused to our community. You don't get to rehabilitate your image.""

""Good—but she never should have been invited in the first place,"" daily kos author Gabe Ortiz said. ""Nielsen's role in implementing the administration's inhumane family separation policy will be remembered as one of the darkest times in modern U.S. history.""





""Glad she's not getting this platform to rehabilitate her image, but she shouldn't have ever been invited,"" Bend the Arc: Jewish Action also tweeted.

Past confrontations

Before she left the Trump administration in April, Nielsen was the target of several public confrontations waged by critics of President Trump's immigration policies.

In June 2018, an angry mob of socialists heckled Nielsen at a restaurant in Washington, forcing her to leave.

That same month, another group of protesters gathered outside Nielsen's home.

Other Republicans who have been confronted in public include former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders and Senate Majority Mitch McConnell and his wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.



Also on the guest list at The Atlantic Festival: former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice; former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger; YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki; NBA Commissioner Adam Silver; Michele Roberts, executive director of the National Basketball Players Association; CEO and executive editor of Rappler Maria Ressa; and ""Tonight Show"" musician Questlove."

(CNN) Donald Trump has every reason to be concerned about taking on former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 election, especially given that a Fox News poll released this week found him trailing Biden by a whopping 14 points if the election were held now. But Trump's greatest threat may in fact come from Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who leads Trump by six points in the poll.

Per a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll released Saturday, Warren has for the first time taken the lead among likely caucusgoers in that key first primary state, climbing seven points since June. And Warren appears poised to rise further if other Democrats drop out or falter in the race, given that the poll finds she's the top second choice among all other Democratic candidates. Twenty percent would choose Warren as a second choice while Biden and Bernie Sanders are each only the second choice of 10%

Dean Obeidallah

Biden still currently leads Warren in the Real Clear Politics average of polls on a national level by a little over ten points . But Warren has been slowly building support in a way that may not only lead her to win the nomination, but to win the White House come 2020.

Why? It's simple: Warren is increasingly exciting people about her candidacy. This is backed by a new NBC/WSJ poll released Sunday which finds that among all the 2020 Democratic candidates, she is now the top-tier candidate who the largest amount of registered voters (17%) are "" enthusiastic "" about. While that number has grown from just 8 percent in March, the percentage of voters who are enthusiastic about Trump has remained the same at 26%. Biden, however, has seen the opposite trend. In March, 17% of voters were enthusiastic about him, but now the former VP has slipped to 12%. That's not good. Enthusiasm should only be growing the more people see a candidate in debates and on the campaign trail.

True, enthusiasm is an intangible factor that can come and go, often quickly. But it's enthusiasm that inspires people to not just vote, but to get friends to vote. It's that passion that animates people to knock on doors for a candidate, make phone calls, give money and attend events."

That's a problem for Bernie Sanders.,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/22/politics/union-health-care-medicare-for-all/index.html,"(CNN) Health care benefits are really important to many union workers -- important enough to give up pay raises or even to walk off the job to keep the coverage they've negotiated.

Now the future of those benefits is at the heart of an emerging split among 2020 Democratic candidates over how to remake American health care. Former Vice President Joe Biden says union members shouldn't have to give up their employer plans if they like them, while Sen. Bernie Sanders is arguing that union workers would still come out ahead under ""Medicare for All,"" which would shift all Americans into a government-run plan.

The fight puts Sanders, a declared democratic socialist, at odds with some in the labor movement, where many union workers already have insurance with pretty good benefits. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is also seeking the nomination, is in a similar situation because of her support for both Medicare for All and organized labor.

Already, there's a growing divide among unions as to whether to back Sanders' universal coverage proposal. National Nurses United, the largest union of registered nurses, are very vocal supporters of Medicare for All. But the International Association of Fire Fighters opposes eliminating employer-based coverage

Still other unions, such as the Service Employees International Union, say they support all efforts to expand coverage to more people.

Roughly 10.5% of workers -- or 14.7 million people -- were union members in 2018, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's about half the share that were unionized 35 years earlier.

Some 95% of union workers had access to employer medical benefits in 2019, compared to 68% of non-union workers, according to the bureau's data. And they were more likely to participate in the plans, with 84% of union staffers signing up, compared to 54% of their non-union counterparts.

""Bargaining for health benefits is a distinguishing characteristic that labor unions hold out as an important variable as to why you would want to be a union member,"" said David Brenner, national director of multi-employer consulting at Segal Consulting, a leader in the field.

The quality of their health plans varies widely, experts said. Unions that cover a lot of lower-wage employees, such as custodians or nurse's aides, may have more basic benefits and have to pay more for them. But other unions, including those in the construction, auto industry and some hotel trades, have more generous policies -- with low premiums, deductibles and co-pays. A few have even set up their own health clinics for members to get care.

Many health packages are so comprehensive that unions feared getting hit with the Affordable Care Act's Cadillac tax, which would have slapped a levy on the value of employer-provided coverage above a certain threshold. Companies and unions quickly banded together to fight it, fearing they'd have to curtail workers' health benefits. The implementation date has been delayed twice, and the House recently voted to repeal the provision

The United Auto Workers, who are currently striking against General Motors, are among the unions with high-quality plans. Members pay only about 3% of the total cost of their health care, while salaried staffers have to cover about one-third, according to GM.

Until recently, the automaker had been seeking to shift more of the bill to the UAW workforce. But GM has dropped its request for major changes in the health care plan. Talks are now hung up on other issues, including pay, the use of temporary workers and a union demand to shift work from Mexico to facilities slated to close in the US.

However, GM has also stopped paying for health insurance for the striking workers, who will have to sign up for COBRA. The UAW's strike fund is picking up the cost. Sanders took the opportunity earlier this week to note that union members wouldn't have to fear losing their benefits during strikes under Medicare for All.

Medical benefits is a central component of most contract negotiations. Health care is a major expense for most companies, and they have been pushing more of the cost onto non-union employees for years. They want organized labor to contribute more too.

But union workers are willing to make sacrifices to shield their health care coverage, including curtailing raises or other benefits.

""In an awful lot of cases, workers are forgoing any increase in wages in order to keep their deductibles from going even higher,"" said Tom Leibfried, legislative representative for the AFL-CIO, a federation of 55 national and international labor unions that represent 12.5 million people.

There's also a growing trend of contract talks breaking down in part over health benefits, said Alex Colvin, dean of Cornell University's ILR School, formerly known as the School of Industrial and Labor Relations. Health coverage was among the issues in United Steelworkers' strike against National Grid in Massachusetts and the teachers' strike in West Virginia last year.

""There's a lot more labor unrest and the cost of health care is one of the drivers of that,"" Brenner said.

Health care is important to union workers for several reasons, said Shaun Richman, program director at the SUNY Empire State College's School of Labor Studies who also was a deputy director of organizing for the American Federation of Teachers.

""You can take a higher raise to the bank, but when your kid gets sick, the peace of mind of good health insurance is important,"" Richman said. Also, ""it's a badge of honor of maintaining the health insurance and not taking concessions on it.""

Recognizing that he needs unions' support, Sanders issued a Workplace Democracy plan last month that would require companies to pass along savings resulting from Medicare for All to workers in the form of raises or other benefits. Unions would be allowed to maintain their clinics and provide supplemental coverage, as long as it doesn't duplicate the benefits available under Medicare for All.

A Warren aide told CNN recently that the campaign is talking with labor leaders about how unions with negotiated health care plans will be guaranteed a chance to rework their agreements during a Medicare for All transition.

That may not be enough for some unions, though.

""There has to be a role for the hard-fought, high-quality plans that we've negotiated,"" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told Fox News earlier this month. ""If there isn't some way for us to have our plans integrated into the system, then we would have a hard time supporting it."""

Follow here for live analysis.,2019-09-22,CNN,CNN's latest Iowa poll: Live analysis,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/cnn-iowa-poll-09-22-2019/index.html,"One of the things I have tried to stress during the course of this campaign is that no candidate has anywhere close to a greater than 50% chance of winning either the Iowa caucuses or the Democratic primary overall. That remains true today.

What I've done is gathered Iowa caucuses' polls taken closest to this point in non-incumbent nomination processes since 1980. I then ran a simple model that controlled how high the best polling candidate was and figured out how often a candidate should win given where they were polling at this point. Keep in mind, these are rough odds.

What we see is that if history holds, someone in Warren's polling position should win about 30% of the time. That means, there's something like a 70% chance someone other than Warren wins the Iowa caucuses.

Someone in Biden's polling position should win about 25% of the time.

Someone at around 10%, like Buttigieg and Sanders, have about a 10% chance of winning.

Everyone else has less than a 10% chance of winning. Even Harris, who is at 6% in our poll, has something like a 7% chance of winning.

If you add up the top 5, their cumulative chance of winning is only between 80% and 85%. That means, there's still a 15% to 20% chance that someone not in the top 5 wins Iowa.

In other words, this race isn't over by any stretch."

Every Sunday, I will outline the 5 BIG storylines you need to know to understand the upcoming week on the campaign trail. And they're ranked -- so the No. 1 story is the most important of the coming week.

5. The race to make the next debate: The October 1 deadline to qualify for the fourth Democratic debate -- set for October 15 and sponsored by CNN and The New York Times -- is rapidly approaching, and with it the last chance, seemingly, for any lower-tier candidates to make the case that they shouldn't be counted out just yet. (Missing one debate is bad enough. Missing two is a political death sentence.)

At the moment, the field is at 11, with wealthy businessman Tom Steyer making the October debate after narrowly missing the September set-to. The only other candidate who appears to be on the cusp of qualification is Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who, with the CNN-Des Moines Register Iowa poll released over the weekend, now has three of the four polls that she needs showing her at 2% or higher. (Gabbard has already met the fundraising threshold with 130,000 unique donors.)

Spiritual guru Marianne Williamson has met the fundraising qualification but has only a single poll that shows her at 2%. (She didn't even rate 1% in the CNN-DMR poll .)

The largest the debate field will grow then, realistically, is 12. Which means that eight candidates currently running won't be on the debate stage for the second straight month. Which should tell them all something.

4. Can Kamala come back?: Amid a series of terrible polling results reflective of her summer struggles, California Sen. Kamala Harris is going all in on Iowa to save herself. ""We want to make sure we have a strong top three finish,"" Amid a series of terrible polling results reflective of her summer struggles, California Sen. Kamala Harris is going all in on Iowa to save herself. ""We want to make sure we have a strong top three finish,"" said her campaign manager, Juan Rodriguez.

So, will it work? Harris has her work cut out for her, according to the new CNN-Des Moines Register Iowa poll. She's at 6%, good for 5th place, at the moment but that is largely stagnant from where she's been in the state since December 2018. (She was at 5% then.)

Harris is generally well-liked in the state -- 63% favorable/24% unfavorable -- but her unfavorables have tripled since March and her favorables have only bumped up marginally (58% in March). And those who feel strongly favorable toward Harris (26%) -- usually a good measure of energy behind a candidate -- runs behind her main rivals like Elizabeth Warren (44%), Pete Buttigieg (33%), Joe Biden (29%) and Bernie Sanders (26%).

Harris does have time, as there are still 134 days before the February 3, 2020 caucuses. But she has been stuck in the same place in Iowa for months. Which means she needs a jump-start. And soon.

3. Booker over and out?: Cory Booker may be the next high-profile candidate out of the 2020 race, according to a memo from his campaign manager first reported by NBC. The memo suggested that unless the New Jersey senator can raise $1.7 million in the next 10 days, he will run out of money and be forced from the race.

The campaign insisted the move was not a fundraising ploy, but it worked either way! As of Sunday morning, Booker had raised just over $300,000 in the first 24 hours of the fundraising push. Of course, $300K -- while good! -- is not $1.7 million. And you can't just keep warning that you are going to drop out of the race unless people give you more money for the remainder of the contest. The sky can only be falling once (or maybe twice!)

""I don't believe people should stay in this just to stay in it,"" Booker said in Iowa on Saturday. ""You either have a trajectory to win or not. And right now, we don't raise $1.7 million, we won't be able to make the investments necessary.""

Booker may get his $1.7 million this time. But without significant poll improvements, it's hard to see how he can keep raising the money he is going to need to compete with the big girls and boys. He will, for sure, stay in the race until the next debate -- October 15 in Ohio and sponsored by CNN. But is there a path beyond that?

2. Elizabeth Warren, Iowa front-runner: Warren has been the hottest candidate in the 2020 race for the past few months now. And it's showing up not just in national polling but now also in the crucial state of Iowa.

The Des Moines Register/CNN/MediaCom Iowa poll released Saturday night showed Warren at 22% and at the top of the pack although followed closely by Joe Biden at 20%. No one else in the field was terribly close to the top two, with Bernie Sanders at 11% in third place and Pete Buttigieg in fourth with 9%.

While the topline numbers are good for Warren, the trend lines are even better. She gained 7 points from the June DMR/CNN poll and has almost tripled her support in the state from a December 2018 poll. Biden, meanwhile, has lost support in each of the four DMR/CNN polls between December 2018 and now. And Sanders dropped 5 points from just June until now.

Warren's favorable numbers in the poll also make clear how much energy and passion is beyond her candidacy presently. Three-quarters of those polled had a favorable view of her, including a whopping 44% who had a ""very favorable"" opinion. That compares very favorably to the 29% who view Biden very favorably and the 26% who feel that same way about Sanders.

Couple all of those data points with the fact that Warren has, by far, the best ground organization in Iowa, and you have to make her the favorite in the Hawkeye State today.

1. Trump vs. Biden vs. Ukraine: It's only September, but we're already getting a look at what a general election fight between Trump and Biden would look like. Faced with a whistleblower complaint from the intelligence community about a series of interactions between himself and the Ukrainians, Trump is trying to push the attention to Biden and his son, Hunter, vis a vis Ukraine.

Fact checkers have already debunked Trump's claims about there being something nefarious in Biden's trip to the Ukraine in 2016 and his son's work for a natural gas company in the country, and there is no evidence of wrongdoing by either. Biden has pushed back aggressively. ""Every single outlet that's looked at this said there's nothing there there,"" he told the Iowa Starting Line . ""And me, nor anyone in my family did anything inappropriate. And every major outlet has acknowledged that. I just find it very Trump-like.""

It is very ""Trump-like!"" Because, facts be damned, Trump has and will continue to use his media megaphone -- press gaggles + Twitter -- to push the idea that something was going on in Ukraine with the two Bidens. And if past is prologue, he won't stop -- no matter what fact-checkers or his advisers tell him.

On the one hand, this fight is good for Biden. Electability is his strongest argument to Democratic voters -- and the more Trump hits Biden, the more the former vice president can seek to bypass the primary and begin running the general election. On the other, it's reminder that whether Biden or some other Democrat is the nominee, we can expect Trump to say and do literally anything in pursuit of a second term."

* The latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll – the most closely watched of all Iowa polls – found Elizabeth Warren taking the lead in the first Democratic nominating contest with 22%, followed by Joe Biden at 20%. Bernie Sanders was third with 11%, followed closely by Pete Buttigieg at 9%. Kamala Harris rounded out the top five with 6% support. (Of the top five candidates, Warren was the only candidate to see her support grow since June.)

* On a related note, it’s worth noting that in the same Iowa poll, local Democrats were asked for their first and second choices, which matter a great deal given the way the state’s caucus system is structured. When first- and second-choice preferences are combined, Warren’s advantage over Biden is even more striking: 42% to 30%. Sanders is further back at 21%, followed by Buttigieg’s 18%.

* Staff shake-ups on Bernie Sanders’ team continue, with the Vermont senator parting ways with one of his Iowa deputy field directors. Kevin Lata had previously worked on Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign, as well as Hillary Clinton’s 2016 team.

* In keeping with the recent trend, the Alaska Republican Party became the latest state GOP to officially cancel its Republican presidential primary, which had been scheduled for April. Several state parties have taken similar steps to protect Donald Trump from possible embarrassment against his primary rivals.

* As the General Motors strike continues, several Democratic presidential candidates have visited picket lines to show support for members of the United Auto Workers.

* With some evidence of Texas becoming more competitive, Republican officials are making it easier for Green Party candidates to qualify for the ballot, with the obvious hope that the move will undermine Democratic support.

* Though it’s difficult to know if this is a stunt, Cory Booker’s campaign manager wrote in a new memo to staff and supporters that the New Jersey senator’s presidential campaign may come to an end without another $1.7 million before the end of the quarter. (The third quarter ends a week from today.)

* As expected, Rep. Joe Kennedy (D) officially kicked off a primary campaign in Massachusetts against incumbent Sen. Ed Markey (D) over the weekend.

* And following their recent Twitter argument over which one of them is more closely aligned with Trump’s foreign policy, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is reportedly taking steps to undermine Rep. Liz Cheney’s (R-Wyo.) prospective U.S. Senate campaign."

As summer turns to fall, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden have separated themselves from the pack. The gold standard poll in Iowa showed Warren with 22% support and Biden with 20% of likely Democratic caucus-goers.

The new reality left more than a dozen other Democrats scrambling to keep the primary from turning into a two-person race -- with New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker offering an extraordinary admission that he might have no path forward.

Their weekend of retail politicking took place amid a national firestorm over reports that President Donald Trump had pressed the Ukrainian president to investigate the business dealings of Biden's son, Hunter Biden, in the country.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

Warren arrived in Iowa newly at war with Democratic leaders in Congress. She declared -- first in a fundraising email, then in her speech in front of 12,000 Democrats at the Polk County Steak Fry on Saturday -- that "" Congress is complicit "" in Trump's actions because the Democratic-led House has failed to begin impeachment proceedings.

""What the President has now demonstrated is that he thinks it's pretty clear he doesn't have to follow the law, and in fact can continue to commit high crimes and misdemeanors,"" Warren told reporters in Cedar Rapids. ""He can go back to the well on exactly what he did before. And that is invite and profit from foreign interference in our election. It's time for Congress to step up and begin serious impeachment proceedings against this man.""

Biden, meanwhile, was at times testy with reporters over the news. It's the sort of clash that Biden has relished -- one that gave him the opportunity to go toe-to-toe with Trump as if the general election had already arrived.

But Biden was also insistent that the focus should remain on Trump improperly inviting foreign interference in a US election -- not on Biden and his son.

""Trump did a terrible thing,"" he said Sunday in Kansas City, Kansas -- his first stop after two days in Iowa. ""Focus on the violation of the Constitution this President has engaged in.""

But as he campaigned in Iowa -- a climate change speech and an LGBTQ forum in Cedar Rapids on Friday, then a Steak Fry appearance Saturday -- there were signs of trouble, including a poll that showed Warren as the second choice of 20% of Democrats surveyed to Biden's 10% -- a potentially important factor given Iowa's unique caucus rules that will force those backing candidates with less than 15% support to move on to their second choices.

He also faced criticism over his response to the moderator at the LGBTQ forum.

Lyz Lenz, an Iowa-based journalist and author, had asked Biden a pointed question about his voting record and his reference to Vice President Mike Pence as a ""decent guy.""

Biden paused and responded: ""You're a lovely person."" Then, on the way off the stage, Lenz tweeted, Biden ""said to me dryly, 'You're a real sweetheart.' ""

""It's 2019 -- we shouldn't be calling professional women sweethearts,"" Lenz told CNN backstage.

In Iowa, Warren and Biden appear to be the dominant forces a little more than four months from the Democratic caucuses. But there remains room for movement.

The poll found that just 20% of likely caucus-goers have a first-choice candidate and say they are unlikely to be persuaded to support someone else.

That reality was underscored at the Polk County Steak Fry on Saturday: While many of the 12,000 tickets organizers said they sold to the event were purchased by campaigns that brought their own supporters in, many attendees who had purchased their own tickets or gotten them from their local Democratic parties said in interviews that they were still considering multiple candidates.

Harper Folsom, a 23-year-old student from Manchester, Iowa, said her top two candidates are Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro -- but she also likes Biden, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and Booker.

""I think it's important to have the most diverse amount of voices that we can,"" she said.

Still, many of the Steak Fry attendees said they are ready for the field to winnow -- and the CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll found evidence of who voters have already broadly dropped from the lists of candidates they are considering.

Only eight candidates are even viewed favorably by a clear majority of likely Democratic caucusgoers: Warren and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have by far the highest net favorability rating, followed by California Sen. Kamala Harris, Booker, Biden, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, O'Rourke and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Entrepreneur Andrew Yang is viewed favorably by just four percentage points more of those polled than see him unfavorably. And the rest of the field -- including Castro, billionaire investor Tom Steyer and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, all of whom might qualify for the party's October presidential debate -- is viewed unfavorably by a majority of likely Democratic caucusgoers.

Some candidates seeking a way out of the low single digits are turning to desperate measures.

Booker campaign manager Addisu Demissie started Saturday morning with a memo featuring an unusual and startling admission : If Booker couldn't raise $1.7 million by the end of the month, he'd have no path forward and would need to exit the race.

The tactic appeared to work, at least initially. Demissie tweeted Sunday morning that Saturday had been Booker's biggest online fundraising day of the campaign, hauling in $300,000.

Other candidates were looking for a break-out at the Steak Fry in front of a crowd so large that it would have accounted for 5% of the total turnout in Iowa's record-breaking 2008 Democratic caucuses.

As Warren lingered at the Steak Fry for hours to greet and take pictures with attendees, Castro jumped into the line, and the two had a warm exchange.

Harris' campaign has mastered the art of the entrance . She walked into the Steak Fry dancing alongside a marching drumline.

O'Rourke had one of the day's most memorable moments when he repeated his call for mandatory assault-style rifle buy-backs. He also took a jab at Democratic leaders in Washington, saying they should not ""live in fear"" of Trump and the National Rifle Association, days after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, had said no other members of the party agree with O'Rourke's position.

""This is how we free ourselves from fear. We decide what we believe in and we fight like hell to achieve it -- and we don't let anyone, whether it's the NRA, the corporations, or the political action committees, or even our fellow Democrats tell us what is possible and what is not possible,"" O'Rourke said. ""We the people decide what is possible in this country.""

""I thought Beto really got people motivated,"" said Ray Johnson, a 67-year-old consumer protection worker in West Des Moines.

He and his wife said they were also considering backing O'Rourke, as well as Warren and Buttigieg, and said they were most concerned with who will defeat Trump. Johnson said he likes Biden, but thinks Democrats need someone younger who can excite voters.

Buttigieg, meanwhile, is seeking to leverage the eye-popping $25 million he raised in the last fundraising quarter in Iowa, where he is already on the air with television ads.

His campaign bought the second-most tickets to the Steak Fry after Biden, and turned in the day's most raucous appearance as a light rain fell in Des Moines.

Then, Buttigieg started a four-day bus tour of Iowa -- with reporters in tow and allowed to ask the candidate questions at any point.

At the Steak Fry, Nikki Lunden, a 41-year-old warehouse worker from Iowa City, said Buttigieg is her favorite candidate -- but most importantly, she wants to support ""who's going to win it.""

Robert Hein, who had driven from Minnesota -- a Super Tuesday state -- with his wife Amy, said he was ""thinking maybe somebody young might be the better choice"" after hearing former President Jimmy Carter say there should be an ""age limit"" for the presidency that would exclude Biden. He said he was already impressed by Buttigieg and left even more so.

He said Biden represents ""a guarantee that we can get Trump out of there.""

""But the more I listen to these folks, I think there are a good number of them who have a good shot at beating him in November,"" he said."

Written and directed by Ava DuVernay , the four-part drama tells the true story of the Central Park Five -- Korey Wise, Antron McCray, Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson and Yusef Salaam -- who were pressured into falsely confessing to the brutal attack and rape of Trisha Meili in 1989.

Jerome's riveting performance as Wise -- who was then the oldest of the accused at 16 years old, and thus served his 14 years as an adult in the corrections system -- earned him critical praise. He was the only one of the five main actors to play his role as a teen and as an adult.

After thanking his parents, the 21-year-old named the five men who sat alongside veteran actors and Oscar-winners in the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles.

As they stood up and applauded him, a visibly emotional Jerome said: ""I felt like I was in a championship game, and we went through our final hurrah,"" he said. ""Thirty years ago they were sitting in a prison cell, falsely incarcerated, and today they're in suits styled by designers for the Emmys.""

Instead he jokingly remarking on the president’s hair before eventually giving him props for his notoriously early mornings, but not before blasting him as a racist, sexist, homophobe, xenophobe, and religious bigot.

Sanders spoke at the event in Des Moines, Iowa, on Sunday and took a question from an attendee, who asked the socialist senator to name a “genuine thing” he admires about Trump.

“Politics has become so divisive that it’s often difficult to see members of the opposing party as human. If you could say one genuine thing you admire about President Donald Trump, what would it be?” the attendee asked.

“His hair, I’m really impressed by the color of his hair,” Sanders initially said to a few chuckles:

﻿

“Look, let me answer your question in a non-facetious way,” Sanders continued, urging the audience to “look at recent history” and blaming the Republican Party for going too far to the right:

I think the answer is – you may not be happy with this answer – but I think if you look at it you will find that there was once –I don’t know, I don’t know – 20, 30 years ago where you had a Republican Party which is what we would call a center-right party, conservative party. Center-right. You had a president called Dwight D. Eisenhower was president in this country who was probably … his politics today would be a moderate Democrat actually. But for a variety of reasons over the years – before Trump – the party moved very very far to the right, and that is where it is right now. And it gives me no pleasure, I mean it really does not. I have Republican colleagues who I respect I like –they differ with me.

Sanders added he has colleagues he disagrees with politically, telling the crowd, “You know you’d be shocked to know people sit down, they have lunch together they don’t hate each other,” but followed up by calling Trump a racist, sexist, homophobe, xenophobe, and religious bigot.

“In this president, you have somebody who is a racist – in my view – who is a sexist, who is a homophobe, was a xenophobe, and there’s a religious bigot, and you have to speak that out,” Sanders said.

“I have to do everything I can to take that type of behavior on. That’s what I gotta do,” Sanders added.

“Is there a single thing about the president that you can say you admire? Single thing?” the attendee followed up.

Sanders conceded, giving the president props for waking up early, albeit a bit sarcastically.

“He gets up at 3 o’clock in the morning to tweet, so I’m impressed by people who get up at 3 o’clock in the morning,” Sanders said."

The actor-activist hosted the LGBTQ presidential forum in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Friday, which featured all of the Democrat presidential candidates except Sanders.

The 38-year-old star spoke to the Guardian following the forum and criticized Sanders for skipping the event.

“I was disappointed to not see all of the candidates here. I was further disappointed to hear this was not the only LGBTQ event Bernie was making other commitments for,” Ross said. “You don’t show up for both of our LGBTQ events? That’s obviously telling us all we need to know.”

The Pose actor claimed access to inside information, which purportedly revealed that Sanders’ prior commitments included visiting historically black colleges and universities as well as an “old black barbershop”:

I’m going to risk being super real here for a second. When you’re on the campaign trail, what’s happening a lot – and what a lot of these candidates have to avoid – is being seen as looking for a photo op. To be seen in certain communities and spaces. I heard that he was not only visiting the [Historically Black Colleges and Universities] but also visiting an old black barbershop.

“Found out Bernie has a prior commitments to visit HBCUs in North Carolina and Prestige Barber College (a black barbershop) and will be touring the civil rights museum,” Ross tweeted last week, alongside a sarcastic GIF of The Office’s Michael Scott:

Ross told the Guardian that it is a struggle to “get folks in my own black community to understand that being black and being LGBTQ are not mutally exclusive”:

What I hope Bernie would learn is you don’t have to pander to just one aspect of the black community. If he would have been at the LGBTQ forum tonight, he would have seen we were talking about issues affecting people of color. I think it was a huge misstep on his part. And I’m not here for any of the excuses. I say: ‘Make it up to me. Make it up to us.'”

Several social media users disagreed with the former model’s critique of Sanders.

“To question Bernie Sanders stance on lgbtq rights is the most ridiculous thing ever and shows your bias against him,” one user wrote.

“I don’t think he skipped this forum because he doesn’t believe in equal rights for all,” another said.

“Except you decided to focus on one candidate who has the most robust background on this issue. Also, he was at a HBCU which was already scheduled. To think sanders is weak on LGBTQ is frankly laughable,” another added.

The backlash continued to escalate, leading Ross to announce a break from social media “for a while.”

This would not be the first time Sanders has experienced accusations of harassment and intimidation related to his supporters. Black leaders signed a letter last week, which detailed alleged “hateful, violent, and racist threats” from people who identify as Sanders supporters. The alleged harassment followed the socialist senator’s loss of the Working Families Party (WFP) endorsement.

As Breitbart News reported:

A draft of the letter, obtained by Splinter News, claimed that Sanders supporters have called black leaders “Uncle Tom,” “Slave,” and “Cunt.” The alleged threats followed Sanders’ loss of the WFP endorsement, according to the letter. … The leaders continued, demanding the Sanders campaign “unequivocally denounce the racism in its ranks, and issue a public statement separating themselves from these abhorrent attacks.” They also urged Democrats across the board – both Sanders supporters and Warren supporters – to come together to “defeat one of the most serious threats to peace and justice in our lifetimes.” “We cannot wait to make justice real amongst the resisters — our lives literally depend on each other,” the leaders added in the letter.

Sanders followed up with a tweet, which read, “This campaign condemns racist bullying and harassment of any kind, in any space. We are building a multiracial movement for justice — that’s how we win the White House.”

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) will take his campaign for the 2020 Democrat Presidential nomination on Tuesday to join the strike authorization vote rally of the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU).

Sanders’ campaign issued a press release over the weekend announcing the “Chicago Teachers Union Strike Authorization Rally with Sen. Bernie Sanders” will be held at 7 p.m. at the CTU offices in downtown Chicago:

Throughout the campaign, Sanders has stood on multiple picket lines with workers and has used his email and text lists to urge his supporters to stand with striking workers across the country. In August, he released his Workplace Democracy Plan, which would double union membership during his term and give workers unprecedented protections in the workplace.

The following day, Wednesday, “Sanders will head to Michigan to join United Auto Workers on the picket line in front of General Motors’ Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly,” the press release continued.

“In the midst of heated contract negotiations with Mayor Lori Lightfoot, the Chicago Teachers Union is getting a boost from a major supporter,” the Chicago Sun–Times reported. In addition to presidential candidate Sanders, “Members of several other unions will be there, including support staff at Chicago Public Schools who are represented by Service Employees International Union Local 73.” The more than 7,000 special education classroom assistants, bus aides, security guards and custodians with SEIU Local 73 have already authorized a potential mid-October work stoppage.

Striking General Motors workers with the United Automobile Workers union are also expected to be among those joining the group. The CTU appears delighted with the national attention Sanders’ presence will bring to the strike authorization vote.

Local 943—which, like the CTU and Local 73, are poised to strike their schools, with more labor unions and grassroots community groups joining by the hour.

“Senator Sanders has been a stalwart supporter of union workers and their right to strike when necessary for dignity and decent wages and working conditions. He has also championed quality health care for all, a key issue in bargaining for both the CTU and SEIU Local 73,” the CTU said in a press release announcing Tuesday’s event:

CTU members are voting next week to authorize a strike. Local 73 members have already voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike against CPS. Both unions are demanding that the mayor put her campaign promises for equity and educational justice in writing in an enforceable contract—including living wages for workers at the bottom of CPS salary scales, thousands of whom earn wages so low their children are eligible for free and reduced lunches under federal poverty guidelines. Lori Lightfoot successfully campaigned for mayor on a platform of equity and educational justice that closely mirrors the CTU’s contract demands, but has refused to put those promises in writing in an enforceable contract—the only mechanism workers have to force the 5th floor to keep its promises to students and families.

Sanders is not the only purveyor of a Democrat-Socialist political philosophy who will be coming to town in support of the CTU’s demands.

Rebecca Garelli, the former CTU member who moved to Arizona where she became an early leader of the #RedforEd movement posted on her Facebook page Saturday that she’s coming home for a #RedforEd rally in support of the CTU on Sunday:

In July, a four member delegation from the CTU went to Venezuela to lend their support to the socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro:

A four member delegation from the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), all active supporters of the #RedforEd movement, traveled to Venezuela earlier this month to provide support for the socialist regime of Nicolas Maduro. The delegation consisted of Richard Berg, a former Teamsters Union official who currently works for the CTU, and “rank and file” CTU strike captains Sarah Chambers, Fabiana Mariel, and V Voeta Vargas, according to press reports.

A well-funded and subversive leftist movement of teachers in the United States threatens to tilt the political balance nationwide in the direction of Democrats across the country as Republicans barely hang on in key states that they need to hold for President Donald Trump to win re-election and for Republicans to have a shot at retaking the House and holding onto their Senate majority. This teachers union effort, called #RedforEd, has its roots in the very same socialism that President Trump vowed in his 2019 State of the Union address to stop, and it began in its current form in early 2018 in a far-flung corner of the country before spreading nationally. Its stated goals–higher teacher pay and better education conditions–are overshadowed by a more malevolent political agenda: a leftist Democrat uprising designed to flip purple or red states to blue, using the might of a significant part of the education system as its lever.

Sanders, along with several other Democrat presidential candidates, has been a strong supporter of the #RedforEd movement throughout his campaign."

The Divergent star also said the U.S. needs to “fucking get a good person in office” to replace President Donald Trump, according to her interview with the Daily Beast published Saturday.

The Big Little Lies star — a longtime supporter of socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) — told the outlet that she is still feeling the Bern, even though she has yet to endorse a specific Democrat candidate.

“I mean, yeah,” Woodley said when asked if she was still a supporter of Sen. Sanders. “Look, I’m not going to get behind any particular candidate right now — it’s just too early — but where Bernie lies, and his values and his standards and his policies, I’m very much in alignment with.”

“At the end of the day, we just need to fucking get a good person in office,” she continued. “So, I’m putting a lot of my energy towards Bernie Sanders’ campaign—not so much for Bernie Sanders at this moment but for politics in general, and just trying to get people passionate and excited for the 2020 election.”

She added that she will “forever” be an “I Love Bernie” person because of what Sanders “has done for our country and our world,” although she did not cite any specific accomplishments.

The actress did note, however, Sanders’ attempts to switch the “GPS of the Democratic Party.”

“He put in new coordinates,” she observed.

Woodley also talked about voter suppression, arguing that several polling stations on Election Day are “not accessible to all communities.”

“It’s very real that for marginalized communities, polling locations are very inaccessible. So for me, the empowerment and the encouragement and the mobilization comes from a place of community,” she explained.

Woodley added that she has noticed a “spark in a revolution of self-identity, and self-identification, and true self-worth” in women this year, “which is really what we need because that’s where true equality will come into play.”

This certainly is not the first time the left-wing actress has expressed her political leanings. She made waves in 2016 after protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline, leading to an arrest. She actively stumped for Sanders that same year:"

Trump appeared with Modi over the weekend in Houston, Texas, before 50,000 people at a “Howdy, Modi!” rally, and the Indian American community interrupted Trump’s speech on numerous occasions with roars of approval. Modi, who harnessed the power of social media to succeed in politics before Trump, has been dubbed India’s “first social media politician.”

Khanna, though, said on MSBBC that Trump is “misinformed if he thinks showing up at this rally is somehow going to help him with the Indian American vote.”

Indian American voters could be critical in swing states and help Trump keep a red state like Texas red, but Indian Americans were some of the most vocal critics of Trump after his “go back” tweet that was directed at the freshman “Squad.”

The California Representative said his parents are immigrants and his grandfather spent four years in jail with Gandhi fighting for independence, and he claimed Indian Americans will vote against Trump because of the “Gandhian philosophy of pluralism” that defines his community.

“It’s the Gandhian Philosophy of pluralism, of respect for fellow human beings, of dialogue for peace that define the values of the Indian American community,” Khanna said, adding “that is why 80 percent [of Indian Americans] voted for Hillary Clinton” in 2016."

“Bernie Sanders is punk as fuck, plain and simple,” Sevigny said. “I’m petrified of the U.S. government right now. We need someone radical to take Trump on, and Bernie’s record as a senator speaks for itself.”

“Honestly, at this stage, I’ll campaign for whoever runs as a Democrat,” she continued. “We just have to get out and fight.”

The Boy’s Don’t Cry star also spoke of her insecurities, fearing that people see her as cold and unapproachable.

“I come off cold or unapproachable, when in fact I’m just insecure,” she explained. “I’m hypercritical of how I look, how I act, how I come across in interviews. Every new year I make the same resolution: be kinder to yourself. I try to stay positive, but it never lasts. I’ve been in therapy for a couple of years now, and I don’t look at photos of me, or read what people say.”

The 44-year-old actress is not known as one of Hollywood’s most prominent political activists, although she has previously waded in on the industry’s problem with sexual harassment before the Harvey Weinstein scandal and #MeToo movement even emerged.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., surged ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden in a new poll of likely Iowa Democratic caucus-goers released late Saturday, with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg slipping into a distant third and fourth, respectively.

The Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll showed Warren as the first choice of 22 percent of the voters surveyed, while Biden was the first choice of 20 percent of the voters. By comparison, the Register poll in June showed Biden leading with 24 percent support, nine percentage points clear of Warren and eight points clear of Sanders.

J. Ann Selzer, president of pollster Selzer & Co., told the Register the survey represented ""the first major shakeup” of the Iowa race, because: ""It’s the first time we’ve had someone other than Joe Biden at the top of the leader board.""

BIDEN GOES ON THE ATTACK OVER UKRAINE CONTROVERSY, PLEDGES TO BEAT TRUMP 'LIKE A DRUM'

Sanders was in third place with 11 percent support, a five percentage-point drop from the Register's June poll. No other candidate cracked 10 percent of the first-choice vote, with Buttigieg garnering nine percent. That also represents a five percentage-point drop from June.

Warren also had the highest percentage of poll respondents (20 percent) who said she was their second choice in the February caucus. By contrast, Biden and Sanders each garnered 10 percent of the second-choice vote. Warren also had the highest favorability rating of any candidate, with 75 percent of respondents saying they had a very or mostly favorable view of her compared to 66 percent for Biden and 58 percent for Sanders.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., rounded out the top five, with six percent of voters saying she was their first choice. Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Cory Booker, D-NJ, both received three percent. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, former Congressman Beto O'Rourke, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and hedge fund manager Tom Steyer each received three percent.

The polling shakeup may not be done, as 63 percent of respondents said they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate. Harris, Buttigieg and Booker could still benefit from late deciders, as 39 percent, 37 percent and 35 percent of poll respondents said they were still actively considering those respective candidates.

The poll came from a sample size of 602 likely Democratic caucusgoers with a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points. It was conducted from Sept. 14-18.

The most recent Fox News poll of Democratic primary voters nationwide showed Biden with 29 percent support, down six percentage points from his peak in May. Sanders was in second place at 18 percent, up eight percentage points from the previous month's poll, while Warren was on 16 percent, down four points from August."

According to the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, when all American voters are asked to rank 12 policies from best to worst, a plan to provide taxpayer-funded healthcare to all illegal aliens — endorsed by Democrat front-runners like Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) — ranks as the least popular among the bunch.

The Journal notes:

Of 12 policy ideas tested in the poll, providing government-sponsored health care to undocumented immigrants was the least popular among the broader electorate, with 62% rejecting it. In a June Democratic debate, all 10 candidates on the stage, including Messrs. Biden and Sanders, raised their hands when asked who backed the idea. In the new survey, it was supported by 64% of Democratic primary voters but only 36% of voters overall. [Emphasis added]

As Breitbart News estimated, providing free healthcare to every illegal alien in the U.S. would cost up to $66 billion a year or $660 billion over a decade to American taxpayers. Already, Americans are forced to subsidize illegal aliens’ medical costs to the sum of almost $20 billion a year.

The Urban Institute’s Linda Blumberg, a health insurance expert, told the New York Times that such a policy providing free healthcare for every foreign national who crosses the U.S.-Mexico border or overstays a visa would drive a migration of “people with serious health problems” to the country.

Similar polls conducted in recent months found that American anywhere between 60 to 63 percent of swing voters oppose offering free healthcare to illegal aliens, as well as 55 to 59 percent of all U.S. voters.

The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll of 900 registered voters was conducted between September 13 and 16 with a margin of error of +/- 3.27 percentage points.

“You are failing us,” Thunberg told the politicians and policymakers assembled at U.N. headquarters. “But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal.

“There are few people who fit into the kind of progress that we all want to see in this country,” Omar said in an interview with the Guardian on Saturday. “And I would say he is not one of them.”

“I think it has been very clear to many of the people who have been creating the kind of movement that is exciting generations, that we want somebody who really has a plan that is going to tackle a lot of the systematic challenges that we have, and he doesn’t,” she added.

Omar’s criticism of Biden came after delivering a keynote address at the Iowa People’s Presidential Forum, an event organized by several progressive organizations, in which she argued the United States needs a president who “realizes we are not just fighting for one election; we are fighting for the very soul of our democracy and what society we want to become.”

Several Democrat presidential candidates —including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg — attended the gathering.

The far-left “Squad” member is not the only lawmaker in the four-person clique to raise concerns about Biden’s bid for the White House. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), an author of the Green New Deal, has repeatedly taken aim at Biden’s climate change proposal for fossil fuels to be eliminated by 2050. However, according to the New York Democrat, the former Veep’s plan is too little, too late.

“Scientifically, anything that is less than helping us cut carbon emissions in half by 2030 is going to be too late,” she said. “It’s a start, and I think that what that has shown is a dramatic shift in the right direction, but we need to keep pushing for a plan that is at the scale of the problem.”

Ocasio-Cortez also previously knocked Biden’s performance at the first Democratic presidential debate, saying it “raised questions” about his capacity to be commander-in-chief.

“I think Joe Biden, his performance on the stage, kind of raised some questions in respect to that,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “But I don’t want to say just because someone is 79, they can’t or shouldn’t run for president. I don’t want to… use a number as a proxy for capacity,” she told The New Yorker radio hour in July."

Their participation follows weeks of climate change alarmism from presidential candidates and activists across the globe. Several of the presidential hopefuls have floated limiting beef consumption – particularly, in recent weeks.

Yang told the audience at CNN’s 7-hour climate change town hall this month that “it’s good for the environment, it’s good for your health if you eat less meat.”

“I think it would be healthy on both an individual and a societal level for us to move in that direction,” he said.

Klobuchar also signaled support of reshaping dietary guidelines to reduce beef consumption, as did Harris, who said the government should find the balance between creating incentives and banning “certain behaviors.”

As Breitbart News reported:

Harris said she would support changing the government dietary guidelines and the food pyramid to reduce the amount of red meat in American diets. She also supported the idea of putting climate impact labels on food. “I’ve always believed that we should, you know, expand what’s on those cans of those things you buy in the grocery store,” she said. “We should expand the list. And included in that should be a measure of the impact on the environment.” Mayor Pete Buttigieg called for more “balance” in American meat production but was careful to say he was not in favor of abolishing the cow. He argued that government intervention like a carbon tax would encourage Americans have “more balanced diet” and a “more balanced footprint.” … O’Rourke cited a similar solution, arguing that a carbon tax would balance out the carbon emissions by the meat industry. “I think we just have to be more responsible in the way that we do it and the best way to do that is to allow the markets to respond by setting a price on carbon in every single part of our economy, every facet of American life,” he said.

In August, Sanders signaled that he would consider a “meat tax” in order to help combat climate change.

“Germany has imposed a meat tax in hopes of limiting this consumption,” a woman at a Q&A session at a town hall event in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, said.

“What are your plans to stop these large corporations from further usurping natural resources and polluting the planet?” she asked.

“Thank you for the question, and it’s a good question. All I can say is if we believe, as I do and you do, that climate change is real, we’re gonna have to tackle it in every area, including agriculture,” Sanders said.

Their participation in the Steak Fry comes one day after Friday’s global climate strike, which several of the candidates adamantly praised:

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) declared herself vindicated for being less than two percent Native American, the former Harvard University professor is leading in multiple state and national polls for the 2020 Democrat nomination for president.

In the most recent Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll out of Iowa, Warren took the lead with 22 percent of Democrat primary voters for the first time. Former Vice President Joe Biden, meanwhile, fell to second place with 20 percent, while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) trailed in third with 11 percent.

When Democrat primary voters were asked who their second choice for president would be, Warren gained 20 percent of voters for a combined first and second choice tally of 42 percent. Biden, on the other hand, is only the second choice for about ten percent of voters, while Sanders about doubles his prospects.

Warren had led hugely against her Democrat contenders in an Iowa Starting Line-Change Research poll from August. In that poll, Warren surged past Biden and Sanders by 11 points, earning nearly 30 percent of support overall.

Since the second Democrat presidential primary debate on September 12, Warren’s Real Clear Politics average of Iowa polls leads all other candidates with 23 percent. Biden comes in with 20.3 percent average post-debate in Iowa, while Sanders garners 12 percent.

Warren’s surge in Iowa, though, has been met with confrontation from some farmers in the agricultural state who vehemently oppose the Green New Deal, which she has endorsed. In one conversation, an Iowa farmer confronted Warren over her support for the plan, which he said would cripple his industry because of its goals to eliminate cows.

It’s not just Iowa where Warren is surging. Across the country, Warren has steadily climbed over Biden and Sanders to take the lead.

The latest Civiqs/DataProgress poll conducted this month put Warren at 30 percent with likely Democrat primary voters. Biden fell to second place with 24 percent and Sanders trailed with 14 percent.

In an Economist/YouGov poll taken in the second week of September, Warren tied with Biden nationally with each taking 26 percent of Democrat primary voters. Sanders, at third, came in at 16 percent.

Even in California, where Biden has led the pack in most statewide polls, Warren took the lead in the latest Change Research poll, getting 25 percent compared to Biden’s 23 percent. At stake in California for 2020 Democrats are about 416 delegates.

Warren’s recent taking the lead in key Democrat primary states and polls has come after embarrassing mishaps in which she formally apologized to Native Americans for spending years claiming to be Native American herself. Those critics, though, have been reluctant to accept her apology, as Breitbart News noted.

The flops on the campaign trail are far from being in the past for Warren. Last week, she exaggerated for the third time the size of her campaign rally crowds. After holding a rally in Washington Square in New York City, the Warren campaign claimed 20,000 people were at the event. New York City Parks confirmed that Washington Square can only hold a maximum of 10,000 people.

Similarly, in August, Warren’s campaign claimed that 12,000 people were in attendance at her rally on the campus of Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota. The maximum capacity of the venue, though, is about 3,000 people, and with crowd spillover, there could not have been more than 6,000 attendees.

In New Hampshire, Warren’s campaign claimed there were 700 people in attendance at a rally on a farm. Breitbart News was there and judged the crowd at about “over 300.”

Built mostly on the perception of a grassroots populist campaign, Warren’s run for president has seen her take on multinational corporations for outsourcing American jobs and promising an economic patriotist agenda even while using billionaire donor money and pleasing the donor class by taking a mass illegal and legal immigration position.

Despite her anti-establishment messaging, Warren has reportedly been in talks with Democrat Party establishment figures like failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and has received praise from former Senator Harry Reid. One Democrat strategist told NBC News that Clinton has been impressed with Warren’s campaign thus far.

Delaney said the candidates' platforms are moving too far left and will end up scaring away voters who favor private insurance and economic growth.

""Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are fundamentally running on almost like a government takeover of the private economy of the United States of America,"" he said. ""That's not what the American people want. And Vice President Biden... isn’t putting forth the kind of new ideas that I think the American people are looking for.

""The American people want someone who can tell a story about how we actually can be better and put forth new ideas,"" Delaney continued. ""And I don’t think the American people are seeing that.""

He also said the party should unite in its effort to defeat Trump, and articulate moderate positions to help gain momentum heading into 2020.

The DNC is raising both the fundraising threshold as well as the polling standards, making it even more difficult for presidential hopefuls to lay out their vision on the national debate stage in November. In order to qualify, a candidate will have to report at least 165,000 individual donors, up from 130,000. The DNC is also requiring 600 unique donors in at least 20 states.

Candidates will have two ways to qualify for the debate via polling, either receiving five percent support in two early primary and caucus state polls – which includes Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina – or receiving three percent support in four early primary and caucus state polls or national polls.

While details of the November date are to be determined, any polls released “between Sept. 13 and midnight seven days before the debate” will count, the New York Times added, noting that “at least eight candidates have already met the 165,000-donor threshold.”

Candidates have until October 1 to qualify for next month’s debate at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. In order to qualify, a candidate must garner at least two percent in four DNC-approved polls and report 130,000 individual donors, up from the 65,000 required for the first debate. Eleven candidates have qualified, including Tom Steyer (D). He will be joined by:

Joe Biden (D)

Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ)

Julián Castro (D)

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA)

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN)

Beto O’Rourke (D)

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)

Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D)

Andrew Yang (D)

Both Marianne Williamson (D) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) are still vying to get on the October debate stage, needing three polls and two polls, respectively.

The increased threshold is likely to draw critiques from low-tier candidates, who slammed the DNC’s requirements in the past.

“Here’s the situation: there’s a whole bunch of different polls that have come out. The DNC has only recognized some of them as being qualifying polls for the debate,” Gabbard told Tucker Carlson in August.

“The whole thing gets a little bit confusing. You’ve gotta jump way down into the weeds of the numbers and statistics, but I think the bigger problem is that whole process really lacks transparency,” she added.

“The DNC’s process is stifling debate at a time when we need it most,” Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) declared last month. “And it will NOT help us beat Donald Trump. If we wanted to be the party that excluded people, we’d be Republicans”:

“If the DNC had followed the process they announced in February and kept to the promised 17 [sic] qualifying polls, the lineup of the upcoming third debate might be very different,” Williamson’s communications director Patricia Ewing said prior to the third Democrat debate in Houston, Texas."

That plan is championed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the two progressive standard-bearers in the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL SAYS ABOUT MEDICARE BUY-INS AND MEDICARE FOR ALL

But among all voters, support for such a plan plunges to just 41 percent. About 56 percent of registered voters oppose a ""Medicare-for-all"" plan that replaces private insurance.

The poll, released Sunday, indicates that what two-thirds of all voters do like is allowing a Medicare buy-in for those under 65 years old. That’s in line with the public option being pitched by former Vice President Joe Biden. Currently, the taxpayer-funded program covers Americans 65 and older.

The latest Fox News national poll also points to the popularity of the Medicare buy-in plan, with 83 percent of Democratic primary voters saying they favor the plan, which would allow individuals to buy into the government-run system. Even 51 percent of Republicans agree.

Among all voters, 68 percent support a buy-in system. But support for a ""Medicare-for-all"" plan that replaces private insurance nosedives to 46 percent among all voters in the Fox News poll, which was released last week. Sen. Kamala Harris of California also supports Medicare-for-all, albeit with a role for private insurers.

Health care has been a leading concern among Democratic primary voters, with the issue topping the past two primary debates.

Not so long ago, a United Auto Workers strike against General Motors was a big deal. Of course, not so long ago, General Motors was a big company—in fact, the biggest company in not only the U.S., but in the whole wide world.

Times change, and now the GM strike, which began on September 15, is just a footnote in the news. Or, actually, we should say, it was just small beer, until both Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders announced that they would visit the Michigan picket line. Maybe soon, another dozen or so Democrat presidential candidates will show up, too, along with the usual traveling circus of roving reporters, talking heads, and publicity-seeking celebrities.

Yes, times change—and they never stop changing.

Yet even if the GM strike is now firmly in the news, the fact remains that GM today is just a shadow of what it once was. It’s only the 13th-largest company in the U.S. by revenues and the 32nd-largest in the world. And if one measures GM by market capitalization—that is, the total value of its stock—it’s even further back in the pack; its market cap is $54 billion, whereas top-ranked Microsoft is worth $1.06 trillion, or 20 times as much.

For its part, the UAW, too, has shrunk dramatically; its membership has declined by nearly three-fourths over the last four decades, from 1.5 million in 1979 to 400,000 today.

By now, these sorts of statistics—the rise of tech, the decline of manufacturing, including manufacturing employment—have become familiar. Yet still, as a nation, we haven’t yet figured out how to make sure workers get a fair piece of the pie. How are people—with or without unions—going to make a living in the 21st century?

Perhaps we can gain perspective on this question by learning more about how leaders thought about jobs and economic justice in the 20th century. Yes, times and technology have changed, and yet human beings are still human beings. And as American citizens, they have political rights and legitimate needs—and these, as we shall see, have been sorely neglected in recent decades.

When Workers Were Strong—Maybe Too Strong

Let’s go back to November 21, 1945, when the UAW struck GM. That strike was a front-page big deal, with vast national repercussions. For context, we can recall that this strike came just three months after the end of World War II; in the new post-war era, both business and labor, unleashed from most wartime controls, were eager to get back to peacetime manufacturing and working.

So if GM wanted to sell more cars, its workers wanted more pay; specifically, the union wanted a 30 percent raise. GM said “no,” and the strike was on; some 320,000 employees hit the picket lines. (We might note that in those days, the GM strikers represented .56 percent of the nation’s total employment. We can pause to observe that more than half of one percent for just one firm is a lot; by comparison in 2019, the GM strike involves only 48,000 workers, or .003 percent—less than a thirtieth of one percent—of America’s employed today.)

In March 1946, four months after the labor action began, the two sides reached a settlement; GM workers got a 17.5 percent raise.

Yet the GM strike was just an overture; 1945-46 saw a nationwide wave of strikes as electrical workers, meatpackers, steel workers, oil workers, railroad engineers, theatrical craftsmen—4.3 million workers total—went off the job. That was roughly eight percent of the workforce.

Needless to say, all these strikes put a burden on the economy, as well as on the social order. In particular, in those days, as the first chill winds of the Cold War were being felt, J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI had well-founded concerns about communist influence—even outright pro-Soviet activity—within some unions. In the meantime, in addition, evidence abounded of mob influence and hooliganism within some unions.

So the challenge to the nation was serious—that is, balancing the rights of workers alongside the overall public interest in law-abiding prosperity.

This need to find the proper balance meant re-examining a key piece of legislation that had been passed in the New Deal decade of the 1930s, namely, the National Labor Relations Act, better known as the Wagner Act.

The Wagner Act was called the “Magna Carta for labor” for a reason; just as the Magna Carta (Great Charter) back in 1215 had guaranteed rights for Englishman, so, too, did the Wagner Act guarantee rights for labor, including:

The exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other mutual aid or protection.

That is, collective bargaining. Unions.

It’s interesting to recall the breadth of support for the Wagner Act at the time of its passage; back in ’35, in the middle of the Depression, majorities in both parties agreed that something had to be done to empower workers. Thus the U.S. Senate approved the measure by a vote of 63 to 12, with a dozen Republicans joining in support, while the House passed the bill without even bothering with a recorded vote. On July 5, 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed it into law, describing it “to be necessary as an act of both common justice and economic advance.”

The Wagner Act was broadly popular because it was based on an obvious point: To achieve a fair bargain, both sides in a negotiation need to have bargaining power.

To put that another way, if Big Business was the new economic reality, then labor needed to be big, too. After all, if labor wasn’t strong enough to stand up to business, then business would rule, perhaps in the manner of European fascism.

In other words, as is the risk with any one-sided regime, a lopsided power equation in favor of business could lead to tyranny. And that, in turn, could produce a backlash, some sort of violent revolt. Indeed, it’s worth recalling that in 1935, the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia was a recent memory; no right-thinking American wanted to see the red tide coming here.

So the Wagner Act was, in reality, a moderate compromise, aimed at fending off radicalism from either the right or the left. Indeed, it echoed the checks and balances written into the Constitution; the whole idea was to guarantee that business would have to bargain with labor. The economist John Kenneth Galbraith would later describe the system as the interplay of “countervailing forces”: Big Business checked by Big Labor—and vice versa.

Harry Truman Confronts the Labor Crisis

As a senator in 1935, Harry Truman had voted for the Wagner Act, and yet now, as president in 1945, he saw that the reform needed reform; labor’s Magna Carta had given the unions too free a rein—and so it was time to rein them in.

In Year of Decisions, the first volume of his memoirs, Truman wrote, “By the autumn of 1945, the labor situation was assuming serious proportions … The increasing labor difficulties of the postwar period were the subject of many discussions with the Cabinet in meetings in October and November.”

This labor unrest was ironic, because, of course, Truman and the Democrats in charge of Congress were generally pro-labor. And yet as we all have discovered, even a good thing is often in need of tinkering—and if necessary, a full overhauling.

Being the energetic man that he was, Truman took action; he invited the leaders of labor and management—including the heads of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the American Federation of Labor, and the Congress of Industrial Organizations—to meet with him in Washington to “work out a new approach to toward solving the industrial crisis.”

We might pause over those last two words, “industrial crisis.” As Truman further wrote, “The country needed a national wage policy, effective mediation machinery, and other remedial legislation which would protect the rightful interests of labor, of management, and of the public.”

Mindful of these goals, Truman began to formulate a series of reforms to the Wagner Act, such as mandatory cooling off periods and a ban on secondary strikes. He was even willing, if need to be, to send in federal troops to operate trains and mines; Truman was pro-labor, yes, but he was pro-public interest, first.

On November 5, 1945, Truman addressed the assembled leaders of business and labor in the Labor Department’s main auditorium—a bit of signaling there. Yet still, in his speech, the president spoke bluntly to both sides: “Failure to produce any workable recommendations on how to avoid work stoppages would mean legislation by Congress.” In other words, if you guys in the private sector can’t figure this out, elected officials will have to step in.

Unfortunately, the negotiations proved to be just more confrontations; even as they were sitting in the same room together, under the watchful eye of Team Truman, business and labor leaders couldn’t agree on anything important.

Indeed, to Truman’s dismay, the single most difficult figure proved to be a labor man, John L. Lewis, president of the mighty United Mine Workers. In that period, Truman summoned Lewis to the White House on no less than six occasions, warning him that “precipitous strikes” could lead the opposition congressional Republicans pushing “punitive measures against labor.” Indeed, when the mine workers defied a federal court’s back-to-work order, Truman’s Justice Department hauled Lewis himself into court, finding him guilty of civil and criminal contempt.

Beyond his exasperation with Lewis, Truman was concerned that if he and his fellow Democrats couldn’t take labor to the higher ground of constructive compromise, the Republicans would take labor to the abyss of annihilation. That is, whereas Democrats wanted to reform the Wagner Act, many Republicans, grown more militant since the ’30s, were now seeking its outright repeal.

Truman was nothing if not vivid in a letter he wrote to another labor leader on December 11, 1945: “I am going to need all the help and cooperation I can possibly get to keep labor from getting its throat slit in this Congress.” [emphasis added]

Yet in the end, Truman’s mediation efforts, valiant as they were, were not successful. The gap between Big Business and Big Labor was simply too wide to be easily or quickly bridged.

As a result, in November 1946, the opposition Republicans, surfing a wave of outrage against the antics of Lewis and other labor barons, won a smashing victory in the midterm elections. For the first time since 1930, the GOP had control of both chambers of Congress; indeed, it seemed that Truman himself would be a dead duck in the 1948 election.

The centerpiece of the Republican agenda for the 80th Congress, convening in January 1947, was braking, or even breaking, the power of labor.

Thus the Taft-Hartley Act was passed in June 1947; Truman vetoed the legislation, and his veto was overridden, with many Democrats joining in the overriding.

Yet soon after its enactment, Taft-Hartley began causing regrets. If the Wagner Act was seen as too pro-labor, Taft-Hartley was seen as too anti-labor. Seizing on this revised sentiment, and preparing for his own campaign to win a second term in the White House, Truman set about rallying labor and the party of labor, the Democrats, against the anti-labor Republicans. Prominent in the Democrat Party’s 1948 platform: “We advocate the repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act.”

Truman had gauged the shifting public sentiment correctly; the Missourian won a smashing comeback victory in 1948. In fact, not only was he victorious, but Democrats also recaptured the House and the Senate. So we can see: The “loyal opposition” in Congress had badly overplayed its hand; the country wanted the New Deal to be reformed, not repealed. (Here at Breitbart News earlier this year, I detailed Truman’s big win, considering ways in which Donald Trump could apply the same sort of anti-“loyal opposition” strategy in 2020.)

The following year, 1949, good to his word, Truman sought the repeal of Taft-Hartley. And yet he failed in his effort, largely because Southern Democrats, representing states where unions were weak, were figuring out that they could gain economically by attracting factories from the unionized North. (Taft-Hartley gave each state the option of being either a “union shop” state, or a “right to work”—that is, anti-union—state.)

Today, the “right to work” movement has spread widely; 27 states—including, amazingly enough, Michigan—have “right to work” laws on their books.

In Truman’s time, the Democrat Party was split between its Northern and Southern wings. And so, thus divided, the House of Labor started to crumble. It’s fair to say that Taft-Hartley doomed mass unionization in the U.S.

When Workers Are Weak—Labor’s Long Slide

So if we’ve seen unions when they were at their peak of optimism—critics would say arrogance—now, we can look at unions in their valley of doubt.

As we have seen, the basic idea behind labor unions is bargaining power—the power of collective bargaining.

Since the Taft-Hartley legislation of 1947, workers and their unions have always had to confront the reality that if they bargain too hard, the company can simply move to a less-expensive right-to-work state. It took a few decades before the full effect of this dynamic became obvious, but by the ’60s and ’70s, it was obvious to all.

Indeed, the percentage of private-sectors workers in unions has fallen from more than a third in the 1950s to less than seven percent today. (And free trade agreements, making it easy for companies relocate out of the U.S. altogether, have only exacerbated this trend.)

As a result, workers are in a weaker position today; they have lost their bargaining power. To be sure, there are plenty of laws on the books concerning working conditions—and plenty of trial lawyers eager to sue over some breach, real or imagined—and yet for most jobs, statutes concerning actual wages that must be paid are scant and inadequate. And that’s why there are so few strikes in the private sector; workers have learned, the hard way, that they must take what the bosses are offering.

Some Painful Numbers for Working People

Moreover, that’s why, according to the Pew Research Center, real wages (that is, adjusted for inflation) for most Americans have stagnated for the last half-century. Yes, it’s true that in many ways, the standard of living is vastly higher than it was in the 1960s, as new inventions have flooded the market, making goods both better and cheaper.

Yet still, some key variables, such as the cost of college and the cost of housing, have skyrocketed, leaving many workers today demonstrably worse off than their predecessors. And in any case, there’s nothing like a big fat paycheck.

The pro-labor Economic Policy Institute (EPI) makes a further point, focusing on the hurtful impact that ebbing bargaining power has had on workers, even as the overall economy has sailed along. According to EPI data, from 1948 to 1979, increases in wages and increases in productivity closely paralleled one another: In those three decades, productivity rose 108 percent, while compensation rose 93 percent. That wasn’t a perfect one-to-one ratio, but it was close enough. And it seemed only fair: If workers were working better, they should be sharing in the gains. And unions were there to make sure that the sharing occurred.

Yet since 1979, according to EPI, productivity and compensation have gone their separate ways: Productivity has risen 69 percent, while compensation has risen just 11 percent. To put it another way, productivity went up more than six times faster than compensation. EPI’s message is clear: In the absence of unions, the gain-sharing imperative on business was also absent.

So where did the added value of those productivity increases go, if not to workers? Short answer: Much of the added value went to corporate investors; that’s one reason why the Dow Jones average sits above 27,000. Indeed, over the last four decades, the stock market is up more than 3,200 percent; by contrast, the federal minimum wage is up 250 percent.

Furthermore, a close look at data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve provides an even more startling look at labor’s long slide. In 1947, the year Taft-Hartley passed, compensation (defined as wages and salary accruals) accounted for 49.4 percent of GDP; that is, workers got a smidge less than half of the national output. Interestingly, the workers’ share of GDP rattled around in a narrow three-point band for the next two decades, never going below 48.8 percent and peaking, in 1969, at 51.6 percent.

Yet then came that long slide in labor incomes. Taft-Hartley obviously played a role, but so, too, did other forces, such as globalization, outsourcing, and mass immigration. By 2011, during the Obama administration, worker compensation as a percentage of GDP had fallen to 42 percent; in the last seven years, it has ticked up slightly, to 43 percent.

Hmm. From 51.6 percent of GDP in 1969 to 43 percent in 2018. Over time, ordinary folks must have noticed that fall in their share of the nation’s wealth. Indeed, now we can start to see why economic populists in decades past—Dick Gephardt in the ’80s, Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan in the ’90s—found such resonance, even if they never reached the White House. It was not until Trump that anyone could put it all together, although the anger had long been smoldering.

So again, who got those shifting 8.6 percentage points of the national wealth? They went to many places, including government, private investment, and the trade deficit. And oh yes, during the same half century, corporate profits rose from about five percent of GDP to ten percent. Yes, you read that right: Much of the change in the national share going to compensation has simply been a shift from workers to corporations—workers down more than eight points and corporate profits up five points. (Of course, it’s also true that wealth to corporations is wealth to shareholders, and many workers are shareholders, either through direct investments, or indirectly, through pension funds. But still, few workers think of themselves as investors; that’s why they call themselves workers—because they can’t rely on their capital to live, and so they have to rely, instead, on their labor.)

If we step back and consider the fate of workers’ wages over the last five decades, 1969 to 2018, we see that the change has been profound; it explains, for example, why the financiers of Manhattan are so rich and the workers of Milwaukee are so hard-pressed. After all, that decline in compensation—again, from the high of 51.6 percent down to 43 percent—amounts to a decline of 8.6 percentage points. For the U.S. economy, that’s more than one dollar in 12.

To put that 8.6-point number another way, since U.S. GDP is $21.3 trillion, 8.6 percent of that is more than $1.8 trillion. So now maybe we can better see why workers have been angry for so long: They’ve been on the losing end of that long slide—in effect, a $1.8 trillion pay cut, just in 2018.

Of course, during this long slide, most Republicans have typically cheered; they might not have even realized the income shift, but they certainly noticed the partisan shift. After all, Big Labor was once the mainstay of the Democrat Party, and so the shrinking of labor has shrunk the Democrats; the party of Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson is no longer winning giant landslides in the way that the party of Franklin D. Roosevelt did in the ’30s and ’40s, or that of Lyndon Johnson did in 1964. (Of course, it’s also no longer the party of Jefferson and Jackson—or, for that matter, of FDR and LBJ.)

On the other hand, the new Democrat Party is hardly a weakling; it has won the presidency in four of the last seven elections—and won the national popular vote in six of the last seven. So while it’s true that the Democrats aren’t winning giant landslides anymore, they have proven themselves capable of winning decent-sized landslides. In 1992, for example, Bill Clinton won 370 electoral votes, and in 1996, he won 379. In 2008, Barack Obama won 365, and in 2012, he won 365. In the meantime, no Republican—including Trump—has scored more than any of those electoral-vote totals since 1988.

Moreover, in lesser elections, the Democrats are doing well enough. They boast 54 percent of seats in the House of Representatives, possess 47 percent of seats in the U.S. Senate, and hold 46 percent of governorships—and own as well nearly 100 percent of big-city mayorships.

Yet ominously for the nation, the new Democrat Party has changed: It seems that even Harry Truman-type Democrats have gone away. Truman’s old Senate seat is now held by a Republican, Josh Hawley.

Today’s Democrat Party is mostly free of the influence of industrial union halls, which were once themselves thick with American flags and military veterans.

Instead, today’s Democrats are more in the mold of either Hillary Clinton or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; that is, they are oriented toward de luxe financialism or relentless radicalism—and often embrace both views at the same time.

Indeed, as their center of gravity has shifted from union halls to university campuses, today’s Democrats are ever more likely to delve into exotic isms, going even further afield from lunch-bucket and kitchen-table concerns. (Although, of course, there are plenty of self-declared socialists in the Democrat Party today; so it’s hardly the case that economic concerns have disappeared, even if most Americans rightfully fear a Hugo Chavez-like policy agenda. Socialism, of course, makes Truman-style populism look pretty darn good.)

Still, the leftward ideological transformation of the Democrat Party might be helping the Republicans in some places—it’s getting easier to portray Democrats as “loony left”—and yet it also means that there will be hell to pay when the Democrats next win.

The Party That Works for Workers Will Win with Workers

Of course, in the short run, there’s not much to be done about these changes. What matters more for the right is getting its own house in order, and that requires a franker understanding of who, exactly, is voting Republican these days.

To that end, more Republicans might take a close look at the 2014 manifesto that helped inspire Donald Trump to run for president: Rick Santorum’s Blue Collar Conservatives: Recommitting to an America That Works.

In addition, majority-minded Republicans might study The Republican Workers Party: How the Trump Victory Drove Everyone Crazy, and Why It Was Just What We Needed, published last year by F. H. Buckley. That phrase, Republican Workers Party, is a keeper.

In this vein of Main Street Republicanism, it was heartening to see the September 17 headline in Politico: “White House intervenes in General Motors strike: The effort would effectively put the White House on the side of the United Auto Workers.” (Yes, the formal UAW structure is still strongly aligned with the Democrats, but as Breitbart News has noted, in 2017 and again in 2019, the actual auto workers are now mostly Republican—although, of course, it’s always possible to make them more Republican.)

Yet of course, if the Democrats, starting with Sanders and Warren, choose, once again, to worry about auto workers and the working class in general—and if they can demonstrate that they’re truly sincere and not just using workers for props—well, who knows what will happen in 2020, and beyond.

In addition, over the long run, if we’re feeling philosophical, we might give ourselves time to think about how America would be different today if labor unions hadn’t been so profoundly sundered by Taft-Hartley, way back in the fateful decade of the ’40s.

That is, what if the Democrats were still following practical-minded middle-of-the-roaders, such as Harry Truman? As we have seen, back in the ’40s, Truman did not succeed in saving the unions from the start of their long slide—but at least he gave it his best shot.

Harry Truman, Meet Your Senatorial Successor, Josh Hawley

And as we think back on Truman, we might also think ahead. We might look, for instance, to the man now sitting in Truman’s Senate seat, Josh Hawley. Just on September 18, in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, Hawley outlined his vision of standing up for ordinary folks: “If the conservative movement wants to have a future, it’s going to have to commit itself to being the movement of working people. If we do that, if conservatives do that, if there’s a core group that will do that, then the rest of D.C., the lobbyists, they will follow along. It’s going to have to be people-driven change.”

So what, exactly, does Hawley have in mind? How, precisely, is he going to seek to raise the standard of living in Missouri—and everywhere else? Hawley hasn’t yet fleshed out the details, but hey, let’s give him space; he’s only been in the Senate for nine months, and he’s spent most of that time on a worthy mission, namely, taking on Big Tech—and on that subject, he’s provided plenty of details.

Yet even so, he had more to say to Breitbart News, and what he said is encouraging:

We have to stay focused on the issues that actually matter to real people and have to challenge the leadership class. So, as the Democrats turn towards socialism, is that a problem? Yeah, it is, but it just goes to show you that they have no idea how to respond to the needs of working people. We can’t just reject their crazy ideas. We also have to push forward with an agenda that actually benefits what I call the “American middle,” which is the middle of our society, people that really sustain our society. So it’s going to be a pro-worker agenda, it has to get wages up, we have to get manufacturing going again, we have to get healthcare costs down, to get folks new opportunities to get skills and jobs training, break up the monopoly of higher education, and take on the monopolists in the economy and their sweetheart deals with government.

Hawley has his own ideas, and yet we can recognize some Trumanesque themes.

And Truman, let’s not forget, spent nearly eight years in the White House."

WARREN SURGES IN IOWA

Des Moines Register: “Elizabeth Warren has surged in Iowa, narrowly overtaking Joe Biden and distancing herself from fellow progressive Bernie Sanders, the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows. Warren, the U.S. senator from Massachusetts, now holds a 2-percentage-point lead, with 22% of likely Democratic caucusgoers saying she is their first choice for president. It is the first time she has led in the Register’s poll. Former Vice President Biden, who had led each of the Register’s three previous 2020 cycle polls, follows her at 20%. Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont, has fallen to third place with 11%. No other candidate reaches double digits. ‘This is the first major shakeup’ in what had been a fairly steady race, said J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., which conducted the poll. … South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg follows the three leaders as the favorite of 9% of poll respondents. U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California is at 6%. U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey are at 3%. Polling at 2% are U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, businessman Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang.”



Dem candidates take two approaches in Iowa - Des Moines Register: “Former Vice President Joe Biden brought in a fire truck, bouncy house and ice cream truck for a carnival-style ‘Biden fest.’ A Mariachi band played at former U.S. Housing Secretary Juliàn Castro’s rally site and then marched in with the candidate and his supporters. And Lizzo and Prince blared through the speakers at a gathering for U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. But others took a different tack: U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren focused on organizing supporters, gathering voter information and knocking doors rather than big displays of support. Saturday’s Polk County Steak Fry in Iowa was the largest in the event’s storied history, drawing more than 12,000 excited Democrats to Water Works Park, where they heard from 17 presidential candidates vying for their attention and support on caucus day. Many of the candidates gathered with their supporters ahead of the main event, holding rallies where they each tried to outshine their competitors.”



Voters dislike Trump, still have doubts about Dems - NBC News: “As Democratic candidates compete for the opportunity to take on President Donald Trump, the incumbent they hope to oust is more personally disliked than any of his recent predecessors, and half of voters say they’re very uncomfortable with the idea of his re-election. But the electorate at large also expresses doubts about some of the progressive policies being backed by candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and the party’s more moderate frontrunner — Joe Biden — also faces questions about his fitness for the job. Those are the major findings in the latest release from the September NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll… But Trump also continues to benefit from the upside of the polarization of the electorate around him, commanding more enthusiasm than his Democratic competitors as well. A quarter of voters (26 percent) say they’re enthusiastic about him, while fewer say they’re enthusiastic about Warren (17 percent), Sanders (13 percent) and Biden (12 percent.)”



The end may be near for Booker - Politico: “Cory Booker’s presidential campaign is betting it all on the next 10 days, signaling Saturday that it will cease to exist unless it can raise nearly $2 million by the end of the month. ‘We have reached a critical moment, and time is running out,’ campaign manager Addisu Demissie warned in a memo to Booker staff and supporters. ‘It’s now or never: The next 10 days will determine whether Cory Booker can stay in this race and compete to win the nomination.’ The bottom line, Demissie said, is that ‘we do not see a legitimate long-term path forward’ if the campaign can’t raise another $1.7 million by Sept. 30, the third-quarter fundraising deadline. … Demissie made clear on a conference call with reporters later Saturday that the campaign isn’t out of money or at risk of running out of funds.”

TIME OUT: MEET YOU IN ST. LOUIS

History: “Amid much public excitement, American explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark return to St. Louis, Missouri, from the first recorded overland journey from the Mississippi River to the Pacific coast and back. The Lewis and Clark Expedition had set off more than two years before to explore the territory of the Louisiana Purchase. Even before the U.S. government concluded purchase negotiations with France, President Thomas Jefferson commissioned his private secretary Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, an army captain, to lead an expedition into what is now the U.S. Northwest. On May 14, the ‘Corps of Discovery,’ featuring some two dozen men, left St. Louis for the American interior. … On September 23, 1806, after two and a half years, the expedition returned to the city, bringing back a wealth of information about the largely unexplored region, as well as valuable U.S. claims to Oregon Territory.”

IMPEACHMENT PRESSURE BUILDS AROUND TRUMP PHONE CALL

NYT: “President Trump acknowledged on Sunday that he raised corruption accusations against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. during a phone call with Ukraine’s leader, a stunning admission as pressure mounted on Democrats to impeach Mr. Trump over allegations he leaned on a foreign government to help damage a political rival. In public and in private, many Democrats said the evidence that has emerged in recent days indicating that Mr. Trump pushed the Ukrainian government to investigate Mr. Biden, and his administration’s stonewalling of attempts by Congress to learn more, were changing their calculations about whether to charge him with articles of impeachment. … The fast-moving developments prompted Speaker Nancy Pelosi to level a warning of her own to the White House: Turn over the secret whistle-blower complaint by Thursday, or face a serious escalation from Congress. In a letter to House Democrats, Ms. Pelosi never mentioned the word ‘impeachment,’ but her message hinted at that possibility.”



Trump continues to defend his call about Biden - Politico: “President Donald Trump on Monday intensified his attempts to justify a phone call with Ukraine’s president in which he reportedly pushed for an investigation into one of his chief political rivals, maintaining that he’s merely concerned about stamping out corruption. He once again dismissed the accusations that he was using his position of power to pressure a foreign government into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son as a ‘witch hunt.’ For the first time, however, Trump appeared to connect the idea to the issue of foreign aid. ‘If we're supporting a country, we want to make sure that country is honest,’ Trump told reporters after arriving for the U.N. General Assembly. … Also at issue with critics of the president is $250 million in foreign aid meant for Ukraine that the White House mysteriously withheld before releasing under bipartisan pressure early this month. There is no evidence that Trump directly tied the release of foreign aid to an investigation into Biden and his son.”



Schumer insists on hearings over whistleblower complaint - Politico: “Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is requesting that the Republican Senate conduct hearings and issue a subpoena to the Trump administration in response to a whistleblower complaint about President Donald Trump's alleged request that Ukraine investigate one of his political opponents. In a letter to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Monday morning, the New York Democrat said the Senate should hold hearings regarding any connection between delayed aid to Ukraine and Trump's reported request that the country probe the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic contender in next year's presidential election. Schumer also asks McConnell to compel the Senate to issue a subpoena to bring the whistleblower complaint to Congress ‘as required by law.’”



Giuliani accuses Ukraine of laundering $3M to Hunter Biden - Fox News: “Rudy Giuliani channeled President Trump Monday with a wee-hours Twitter blitz aimed at turning the Ukraine story currently roiling Washington into a big problem for Democrats. Giuliani, the personal attorney for Trump and outspoken critic of presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son’s relationship with Ukraine, accused Kiev of laundering $3 million to Hunter Biden, suggested that the Obama administration turned a blind eye, and made the prediction that the scandal is in its infancy. ‘If Dem party doesn’t call for an investigation of Bidens’ millions from Ukraine and billions from China, they will own it,’ he tweeted. ‘Bidens’ made big money selling public office. How could Obama have allowed this to happen? Will Dems continue to condone and enable this kind pay-for-play?’”



CONGRESS SET TO PASS STOPGAP SPENDING BILL THIS WEEK

Roll Call: “The Senate needs to act this week to clear a stopgap spending bill before recessing through the end of the government’s fiscal year, but that is really the only must-pass business for either chamber. The House passed the measure Thursday, 301-123, after resolving hangups that included a debate over assisting farmers who have seen demand for crops plummet thanks to the ongoing sparring over trade with China. … There is no expectation the Senate will have trouble reaching an agreement to clear the measure to keep the government funded through Nov. 21, but it is certainly not the only piece of business that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wants to advance. … Once the House is back Tuesday, Democrats will once again turn their attention to border politics as the chamber considers two measures designed to improve the Department of Homeland Security’s treatment of migrants.”

LET’S GET THIS BREAD

UPI: “A raccoon went for a 16-mile ride on top of a Florida bread delivery truck that reached speeds of over 50 mph during the trip. The driver of the Wonder Bread truck said other drivers called his attention to the raccoon on top of his truck, and he had already traveled about 10 miles before calling 911 from the parking lot of a fast food restaurant. Police and the driver attempted to get the raccoon to safety by pulling the truck up to a convenient tree branch, but the animal refused to climb down. The driver said he eventually had to drive the final 6 miles of his journey with the raccoon still riding on the roof. He said the animal eventually apparently climbed down on its own once the truck was parked at his company's headquarters in North Fort Myers.”

The September NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Sunday shows that 69 percent of voters dislike Trump. That is a toxic level in any race let alone one for the presidency.

It is impossible to improve that sentiment to less than 50 percent in the remaining 14 months before the 2020 election. Prior to this poll, the highest dislike of a president was 42 percent for George W. Bush after Hurricane Katrina in March 2006.

ANDREW MCCARTHY: WHAT IS TRUMP-BIDEN CLASH OVER UKRAINE AND WHISTLEBLOWER ALL ABOUT?

In the same poll, 49 percent say they’re very uncomfortable with Trump’s 2020 candidacy. That’s compared with 41 percent for Bernie Sanders and 33 percent apiece for Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. Furthermore, a record 50 percent dislike Trump and his policies.

Other polls show Trump losing a general election to any of the top five Democratic candidates for president.

Clearly Trump’s reelection is in trouble. And it may explain why Trump allegedly sought foreign assistance against Joe Biden, the front-runner in the crowded Democratic primary field. That should concern every American.

It has been widely reported that Trump asked the newly elected president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, eight times in a July phone call to investigate whether Biden, while vice president, acted improperly in pressuring the resignation of a Ukraine prosecutor whose office was investigating a company that employed Biden's son. Trump denies these allegations and the Ukrainian foreign minister said Saturday, “I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure.”

It was also reported that Trump threatened to withhold $250 million in military aid from Ukraine if they didn’t cooperate. That money was released this month.

Furthermore, Trump insisted that Ukraine work on the matter with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, not official representatives of the U.S. government.

However, if these reports are true, a request to benefit Trump’s political prospects, rather than United States or its national security, is illegal.

Clearly Trump’s reelection is in trouble. And it may explain why he allegedly sought foreign assistance against Joe Biden, the Democratic front-runner.

Trump's acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, refused to discuss the complaint that brought this matter to light when he appeared before the House Intelligence Committee last week and refused to provide the whistleblower complaint to Congress … which they are legally entitled to receive.

In addition to allegedly seeking assistance from a foreign government to interfere in our election,Trump has done nothing to secure our election systems.

In June, the House passed the Secure Election Act, which authorized $600 million for states to bolster election systems. The act would require the implementation of cybersecurity safeguards for hardware and software used in elections, bar wireless communication devices in election systems, and require electronic voting machines be manufactured in the United States.

However, the Senate had not taken up the measure because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was refusing to do so. Until last week. Out of the blue, just one day after the Ukraine story broke, McConnell approved $250 million for election security, a token amount that will provide only $5 million per state to fight the Russians and will have little real effect.

It seems McConnell, who takes umbrage with his nickname “Moscow Mitch,"" may have been trying to head off criticism about foreign election interference with this gesture. But it is just that, a gesture. There are 406 days until next year's general election – and only 133 until the 2020 caucuses and primaries begin – and the resources and reforms to guard against foreign interference are not close to what is needed.

It appears Trump is so worried about his poll numbers that he thinks he needs outside help to win and that no one can or will stop him … again.

If that is true, then Trump is acting in a decidedly un-American fashion.

He should be held accountable. Every member of Congress and every American should stand up to Trump and for the rule of law.

For days, Democrats have seized on allegations that Trump in July pressured Zelensky to investigate Biden family dealings – using military aid as leverage – and cited the reports to revive calls for the president's impeachment.

But the firestorm, apparently related to a still-secret whistleblower complaint, has, in turn, opened the door for Republicans to revisit the original controversy involving Joe Biden's son Hunter. Further, they allege, the details of that story suggest Biden did the same thing Trump is accused of doing -- leveraging military aid to pressure Ukraine.

GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN

“The more they want to talk about Ukraine, the better,” Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said Monday morning on Fox Business Network’s “Mornings with Maria.”

Giuliani has long been looking into the Bidens’ ties to Ukraine, claiming Hunter Biden improperly benefited from business dealings in Ukraine with energy company Burisma Holdings as a member of its board and questioning whether his dad helped protect him.

Hunter Biden was hired by Burisma in April 2014, two months after Ukraine's Russia-friendly president was ousted by protesters and as his father was heavily involved in U.S. efforts to support the new pro-Western government and its pledge to fight corruption. The hiring of the younger Biden immediately raised concerns that the Ukrainian firm, whose owner was a political ally of the ousted president, was seeking to gain influence with the Obama administration.

Two years later, then-Vice President Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine unless a top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was fired. Shokin was accused by many in Ukraine and in the West of being soft on corruption, but he also had been leading an investigation into Burisma's owner.

Trump has claimed Shokin ""was after"" Hunter Biden and the vice president was trying to protect his son.

“The very thing they’re accusing President Trump of doing, Biden did,” Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told “Fox & Friends” Monday.

Fox News reported on the Biden controversy in April. The New York Times published a lengthy story on the matter in May. But the controversy flew largely under the radar until now. While the heat is on Trump over whether or not he pressured Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, that firestorm has prompted multiple news outlets to revisit the original Biden controversy in order to provide context.

Trump allies are hammering that as the real scandal, as video of Biden once bragging about his role in having Shokin fired has gone viral.

BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN LIKELY COMING TO AN END, NUNES SAYS

Biden has denied wrongdoing, with Shokin having already been suspected of corruption before his dismissal, and hammered Trump over the reports on his phone conversation with Kiev. For his part, Trump addressed his phone call with Zelensky by calling the conversation “perfect” and insisting “there was no quid pro quo” and that he “said absolutely nothing wrong.” Trump also insists that the idea of withholding military aid from Ukraine is bogus because he gave the aid.

Trump also tweeted Sunday night, stating that the Ukrainian government backed him up by saying he did not pressure them during the phone call. In the same tweet, he said the “real story” was Biden pressuring Ukraine into firing Shokin.

Giuliani is also trying to circulate new Biden allegations.

Giuliani accused Kiev on Monday of laundering $3 million to Hunter Biden and suggested the Obama administration turned a blind eye.

""If Dem party doesn’t call for an investigation of Bidens’ millions from Ukraine and billions from China, they will own it,” he tweeted. ""Bidens’ made big money selling public office. How could Obama have allowed this to happen? Will Dems continue to condone and enable this kind pay-for-play?""

While the former vice president has claimed he and his son never discussed Hunter’s business, Hunter told The New Yorker that they did talk about it once, with Joe Biden telling his son, ""I hope you know what you are doing.""

Democrats and Republicans are both pushing for investigations. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who has shied away from calling for impeachment in the past, told CNN on Sunday that the latest allegations against Trump may warrant such a measure.

“If the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit … then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that that conduct represents,” Schiff said.

Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has resisted calls for impeachment for other alleged Trump transgressions, said Sunday that unless acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire provides information about the whistleblower complaint involving Trump to Congress, administration officials ""will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness, which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.""

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., meanwhile, told Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” that he wants the Justice Department to look into the Bidens’ dealings with Ukraine.

“Nobody’s looked at this, but somebody should, so I’m hoping the Department of Justice will look at the Biden-Ukraine connection like we looked at the Trump-Russia connection,” Graham said. “Was there a relationship between the vice president’s family and the Ukraine business world that was inappropriate? I don’t know. Somebody other than me needs to look at it, and I sure as hell don’t trust the media to get to the bottom of it.”

All this comes as Democrats continue to battle for the 2020 presidential nomination. After three debates, Biden remains the front-runner, but he has lost ground to rivals Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., with Warren surpassing Biden in a new Iowa poll.

Grisham was then asked if Trump’s frequent gaggles are the new form of press briefing, which previously consisted of press secretaries Sean Spicer and Sarah Sanders taking questions from sometimes-hostile reporters in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room.

“Ultimately, if the president decided it’s something we should do, we can do that, but right now he’s doing just fine and to be honest the briefings had become a lot of just theater,” she said. “I think that a lot of reporters were doing it to… get famous.”

“They’re writing books now, they’re all getting famous off of this presidency, so I think it’s great what we’re doing now,” Grisham added.

Grisham didn’t name names, but CNN White House reporter Jim Acosta has emerged as a household name for constantly sparring with members of the Trump administration when they are made available to the press.

Last year, Acosta was briefly banned from the White House after he engaged in a contentious back-and-forth with Trump and refused to pass the microphone to a female White House aide. He has since written a book about his time covering Trump.

CNN’s April Ryan, another White House reporter, also scuffled with Spicer and Sanders on a regular basis and wrote a book about it. ABC News White House reporter Jonathan Karl has a book about covering the Trump White House scheduled for 2020.

TRUMP SLAMS CNN’S ACOSTA FOR PRESS CONFERENCE PERFORMANCE: ‘YOU ARE A RUDE, TERRIBLE PERSON’

“Fox & Friends” co-host Brian Kilmeade then asked how Trump reacted to the way Spicer and Sanders were treated by critics such as NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” which pokes fun at members of the administration with unflattering impersonations on a regular basis.

“Absolutely, I think it’s so important that the spokesperson for the president can adequately speak to his policies and get his message out there. I think the president saw that that’s not what was happening,"" Grisham said. ""It had become, again, theater, and they weren’t being good to his people. He doesn’t like that. He’s very loyal to his people, and he put a stop to it.”"

He's been railing against the detrimental effects of millionaires and billionaires on the nation's economy for years.

But on Tuesday afternoon, Sanders took it even a step farther. In a tweet touting his newly unveiled plan to tax the ultra-wealthy, the Vermont senator wrote this: ""There should be no billionaires. We are going to tax their extreme wealth and invest in working people.""

No billionaires! As in, Sanders is going to tax them out of existence?

That's not, at least according to my reading of the plan, what Sanders is actually proposing. Here's the basics of his ultra-wealth tax, according to his website

""It would start with a 1 percent tax on net worth above $32 million for a married couple. That means a married couple with $32.5 million would pay a wealth tax of just $5,000."
112,"Tami Luhby and Gregory Krieg, CNN",,"Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday unveiled plans for a hefty tax on the ultra-rich that he says will  pay for several of his expensive social spending proposals, including part of ""Medicare for All.""",2019-09-24,CNN,Bernie Sanders rolls out wealth tax plan that would help fund 'Medicare for All',https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/24/politics/bernie-sanders-wealth-tax-proposal-medicare-for-all/index.html,"(CNN) Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday unveiled plans for a hefty tax on the ultra-rich that he says will pay for several of his expensive social spending proposals, including part of ""Medicare for All.""

Sanders, a Vermont independent, has come under fire from a number of his 2020 Democratic presidential primary rivals over the cost of his plans, which would run into the trillions of dollars. While he has maintained that the wealthy would foot the bill for most of those proposals, Sanders has acknowledged that the middle class would see their taxes rise to pay for Medicare for All. He says that many Americans would still come out ahead because they would no longer pay premiums or out-of-pocket bills for health care.

The new proposal was rolled out a day after Bloomberg reported that a polling firm associated with former Vice President Joe Biden had been studying which arguments against Medicare for All would be most effective with voters. One of its conclusions: the cost to taxpayers. Sanders responded to the news by insisting again that ""no one earning less than $29,000 will pay any new taxes"" under his plan, which he called ""a great deal for the American people.""

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has already unveiled plans to push for a similar wealth tax , which she often cites on the campaign trail -- to roaring approval from supporters -- as the potential source of funding for a series of ambitious programs. Sanders could be angling to establish a similar pitch, and respond to Biden, with a populist win-win proposal that pays for expensive new programs by soaking the rich.

Under Sanders' ""tax on extreme wealth,"" married couples worth more than $32 million would pay a 1% tax on their wealth above that threshold. The rate would rise to 2% on net worth between $50 million and $250 million, climbing in increments to a 8% tax on wealth above $10 billion.

In July, CNN's poll with the University of New Hampshire found Biden, Warren and Sanders clustered at the top of the field, with 24% for Biden, and 19% each for Warren and Sanders.

Warren saw a significant jump in support from Monmouth's last poll of New Hampshire in May, mirroring other recent polling showing her increasing her backing in Iowa and nationally. She is up 19 percentage points since the spring in the new poll, while Biden dropped 11 percentage points, and Sanders dipped 6 percentage points.

Since May, Warren's support among those who describe themselves as liberal has increased 28 percentage points, while Sanders' has dropped 13 percentage points and Biden's down 7.

Likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire continue to prioritize beating President Donald Trump (61%) over voting for someone they agree with completely but who would have a hard time beating him (27%).

But most seem to think they can have it all if their choice wins the nomination. Almost 7 in 10 likely Democratic voters in New Hampshire said their candidate is the one they agree with the most, and over half (52%) said their candidate has the best chance against the president.

Warren holds the best favorability rating with 74% of likely New Hampshire voters who have a favorable opinion of the Massachusetts senator, 19% unfavorable. Biden's is down since May, with 66% who said they had a favorable opinion, 24% unfavorable, while Sanders receives 63% favorable, 28% unfavorable.

The Monmouth University Poll was conducted by telephone from September 17 to 21, 2019 with 401 New Hampshire voters who are likely to vote in the Democratic presidential primary in February 2020. Results among likely Democratic primary voters have a margin of error of +/- 4.9 percentage points."

""Look, my position remains the same. I think impeachment would be terribly divisive for our already very divided country,"" Gabbard said in an interview with CNN's Brooke Baldwin. ""I think Congress needs to exercise oversight over the information that's been leaked. I think it's important this transcript is released to Congress so that Congress can do its job.""

The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, in the past, has cautioned against impeaching Trump. Her comments on Tuesday came shortly before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry into the President. ""The actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the President's betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,"" Pelosi said in doing so.

Trump faces outrage over reports that he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July phone call to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son, Hunter. Trump on Sunday said that he did indeed discuss Biden with Zelensky -- at a time when the country was awaiting the aid package from the United States -- but he denied doing anything improper. The call is also the subject of a whistleblower complaint.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

Forty-two percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers said they want to continue the state's caucus system, which has traditionally made the Hawkeye State the center of the early months of presidential campaigns, even if it means not everyone who wants to can participate. Iowa's status as the first state where voters weigh in on who the parties will nominate to run for the White House has given it special importance in the campaign as many candidates choose to spend much of their time meeting voters in diners and house parties across a state that demands face-to-face interactions with the candidates.

However, that tradition has been questioned in recent years and now 44% of likely Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa say they're in favor of switching to a primary, even if it risks Iowa's status as the first contest of the nominating season. Advocates for a primary argue it would increase access to the voting process because it wouldn't require hours of participation in the same way that a caucus does.

Voters in Iowa who spoke to CNN after taking the poll saw pros and cons to both sides of the argument, but many mentioned how much they enjoy the ability to meet candidates and the unique opportunity that is provided to them.

""I've had the chance to meet just about every presidential candidate throughout my life, since I was 11. That's awesome,"" likely Iowa caucusgoer Allie Paarsmith told CNN. ""I know how lucky I am. We just wouldn't get that sort of attention otherwise, it brings people to the Midwest. It would be sad to see a Midwestern state lose that first in the nation status.""

(CNN) The Democratic National Committee just announced the debate criteria for November. As expected, it has modestly raised the bar again, asking for candidates to meet a slightly higher polling and donor threshold than the last debates. But like my elderly cat when we got a slightly taller box spring, some candidates just can't make the leap.

And yet, we are hearing a lot of meowing of protest from the field. Candidates have said they are being forced to adjust their campaign strategies away from winning votes to meet these benchmarks; party insiders are saying the benchmarks are excluding highly credentialed voices in favor of celebrity candidates; and down-ballot Democrats are complaining the donor threshold is taking much-needed money away from their races.

But first, let's be clear that Democratic primary voters want to narrow the field. Generally speaking, a larger and more fractured field tends to benefit some front-runners (Joe Biden) while disadvantaging others (Elizabeth Warren). And, of course, no candidate left off the stage is going to praise a system that torpedoed his campaign, but even those candidates know they can't get their message across with 24 people on the stage. This is all to say, there is no solution to make everyone happy.

The Republican National Committee experienced much the same problem in 2016 and some of us would argue blew it in far more epic fashion. (Full disclosure: I worked for Carly Fiorina during 2016 and was watching the March debate from my hotel room as a handful of dudes tossed around not-so-veiled references to the size of their penises .) My point being that we should at least give the DNC credit for trying to trim the fat with a scalpel instead of the RNC's machete that arbitrarily set and reset qualifications each month based solely on poll numbers.

Even so, I am not the first to point out that there's something wrong here . Polling and fundraising don't measure whether someone will be a good president -- or even a good candidate. And incentivizing your candidates to spend money to meet those thresholds doesn't move the ball down the field for the party or the eventual nominee.

And of course, there's the absurdity of putting that much stock in national name recognition whereby the only way for your candidate to get exposure to tens of millions of viewers during the debate is to have high national poll numbers, which more often than not are simply a reflection of name recognition among voters who have already been exposed to that candidate. Captain Yossarian would be proud.

It's almost as if you'd be better off if you'd starred on a hit reality TV show for years instead of served as a governor or run a Fortune 50 company.

Defenders of the system, though, would say it's working. We started with 20 debaters, and by November, we may be down to eight

But here's the problem. If we had whittled the field too quickly in 1991, there would have been no President Clinton. By July of 1991, he had a polling average of only 1.7% -- in a tie for 13th place with Jay Rockefeller. As Nate Silver has pointed out , in two of the past nine cycles, the eventual Democratic nominee was not even in the top 10 by July -- and both Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton went on to win the presidency the next year.

So here's an alternative I'm proposing to the DNC:

The top three polling candidates according to an average of qualifying national polls get an automatic ticket to the stage. In the end, this is still our closest approximation to votes. But why should this be coupled with fundraising? If you're a great, progressive candidate who has managed to capture the support of 20% of your party's supporters without creating an enormous money machine, you have perhaps all the more reason to be on that stage.

Any candidate with a million individual donors gets a ticket. The goal of this metric isn't to reward a big fundraising haul but to measure support that may not be showing up in the polls. The threshold, therefore, must be meaningful and high. Bernie Sanders is the only candidate to hit this number so far. But by way of example, if Sanders were polling at only 2% nationwide, would the DNC really want to exclude a guy with a million high-enthusiasm Democratic voters who presumably has a uniquely powerful message that is resonating with those who have heard it?

Any candidate with more than 15% support when the same polling averages are weighted for name recognition would be on the stage. Silver has a nice chart on adjusted polling averages here. But in short, if two candidates both have 5% in the latest poll but Candidate A's names is familiar to 80% of voters and Candidate B is known by only 30% of voters, we would assume Candidate B would poll higher than Candidate A if all voters knew who both of them were. So you would ""weight"" that poll by multiplying their support as if they had the same name recognition as the most well-known candidate (Biden). Suddenly, Candidate B would have a weighted polling average just over 15%. Side note: It boggles my mind why this hasn't already happened. If voters haven't heard your message because you're, let's say, the governor of Montana without a lot of national airtime, why would the party want to limit your only chance to reach a broader audience with how you've succeeded in implementing progressive policies? And on the flip side, if you are a celebrity politician with near-universal name recognition among voters but only 4% support in a poll, do we really need to hear more?

These rules would have ensured Clinton made the stage in 1991. Ironically, it also would have excluded Biden in 2007 (along with Dennis Kucinich, Wesley Clark and Chris Dodd, among others).

And what of 2020? Of course, it's impossible to say for sure because the candidates would have run their campaigns differently if the DNC rules had been, well, different. Like those who talk about the popular vote versus the Electoral College, you can't rerun the game with different rules and assume the same inputs.

But as of July, the field would have been narrowed to Biden, Sanders, Kamala Harris, Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke. And given how close Cory Booker and Andrew Yang would have been to the cutoff, it seems fair to assume they would have tweaked their strategies to get to an adjusted 5% as well.

Funny enough, it's the same eight who will probably be on the stage come November. But it sure sounds a lot fairer, doesn't it?"

(Of the top five candidates, Warren was the only candidate to see her support grow since June.)

* On a related note, it’s worth noting that in the same Iowa poll, local Democrats were asked for their first and second choices, which matter a great deal given the way the state’s caucus system is structured. When first- and second-choice preferences are combined, Warren’s advantage over Biden is even more striking: 42% to 30%. Sanders is further back at 21%, followed by Buttigieg’s 18%.

As summer turns to fall, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden have separated themselves from the pack. The gold standard poll in Iowa showed Warren with 22% support and Biden with 20% of likely Democratic caucus-goers.

The new reality left more than a dozen other Democrats scrambling to keep the primary from turning into a two-person race -- with New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker offering an extraordinary admission that he might have no path forward.

Their weekend of retail politicking took place amid a national firestorm over reports that President Donald Trump had pressed the Ukrainian president to investigate the business dealings of Biden's son, Hunter Biden, in the country.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

Warren arrived in Iowa newly at war with Democratic leaders in Congress. She declared -- first in a fundraising email, then in her speech in front of 12,000 Democrats at the Polk County Steak Fry on Saturday -- that "" Congress is complicit "" in Trump's actions because the Democratic-led House has failed to begin impeachment proceedings.

""What the President has now demonstrated is that he thinks it's pretty clear he doesn't have to follow the law, and in fact can continue to commit high crimes and misdemeanors,"" Warren told reporters in Cedar Rapids. ""He can go back to the well on exactly what he did before. And that is invite and profit from foreign interference in our election. It's time for Congress to step up and begin serious impeachment proceedings against this man.""

Biden, meanwhile, was at times testy with reporters over the news. It's the sort of clash that Biden has relished -- one that gave him the opportunity to go toe-to-toe with Trump as if the general election had already arrived.

But Biden was also insistent that the focus should remain on Trump improperly inviting foreign interference in a US election -- not on Biden and his son.

""Trump did a terrible thing,"" he said Sunday in Kansas City, Kansas -- his first stop after two days in Iowa. ""Focus on the violation of the Constitution this President has engaged in.""

But as he campaigned in Iowa -- a climate change speech and an LGBTQ forum in Cedar Rapids on Friday, then a Steak Fry appearance Saturday -- there were signs of trouble, including a poll that showed Warren as the second choice of 20% of Democrats surveyed to Biden's 10% -- a potentially important factor given Iowa's unique caucus rules that will force those backing candidates with less than 15% support to move on to their second choices.

He also faced criticism over his response to the moderator at the LGBTQ forum.

Lyz Lenz, an Iowa-based journalist and author, had asked Biden a pointed question about his voting record and his reference to Vice President Mike Pence as a ""decent guy.""

Biden paused and responded: ""You're a lovely person."" Then, on the way off the stage, Lenz tweeted, Biden ""said to me dryly, 'You're a real sweetheart.' ""

""It's 2019 -- we shouldn't be calling professional women sweethearts,"" Lenz told CNN backstage.

In Iowa, Warren and Biden appear to be the dominant forces a little more than four months from the Democratic caucuses. But there remains room for movement.

The poll found that just 20% of likely caucus-goers have a first-choice candidate and say they are unlikely to be persuaded to support someone else.

That reality was underscored at the Polk County Steak Fry on Saturday: While many of the 12,000 tickets organizers said they sold to the event were purchased by campaigns that brought their own supporters in, many attendees who had purchased their own tickets or gotten them from their local Democratic parties said in interviews that they were still considering multiple candidates.

Harper Folsom, a 23-year-old student from Manchester, Iowa, said her top two candidates are Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro -- but she also likes Biden, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and Booker.

""I think it's important to have the most diverse amount of voices that we can,"" she said.

Still, many of the Steak Fry attendees said they are ready for the field to winnow -- and the CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll found evidence of who voters have already broadly dropped from the lists of candidates they are considering.

Only eight candidates are even viewed favorably by a clear majority of likely Democratic caucusgoers: Warren and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have by far the highest net favorability rating, followed by California Sen. Kamala Harris, Booker, Biden, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, O'Rourke and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Entrepreneur Andrew Yang is viewed favorably by just four percentage points more of those polled than see him unfavorably. And the rest of the field -- including Castro, billionaire investor Tom Steyer and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, all of whom might qualify for the party's October presidential debate -- is viewed unfavorably by a majority of likely Democratic caucusgoers.

Some candidates seeking a way out of the low single digits are turning to desperate measures.

Booker campaign manager Addisu Demissie started Saturday morning with a memo featuring an unusual and startling admission : If Booker couldn't raise $1.7 million by the end of the month, he'd have no path forward and would need to exit the race.

The tactic appeared to work, at least initially. Demissie tweeted Sunday morning that Saturday had been Booker's biggest online fundraising day of the campaign, hauling in $300,000.

Other candidates were looking for a break-out at the Steak Fry in front of a crowd so large that it would have accounted for 5% of the total turnout in Iowa's record-breaking 2008 Democratic caucuses.

As Warren lingered at the Steak Fry for hours to greet and take pictures with attendees, Castro jumped into the line, and the two had a warm exchange.

Harris' campaign has mastered the art of the entrance . She walked into the Steak Fry dancing alongside a marching drumline.

O'Rourke had one of the day's most memorable moments when he repeated his call for mandatory assault-style rifle buy-backs. He also took a jab at Democratic leaders in Washington, saying they should not ""live in fear"" of Trump and the National Rifle Association, days after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, had said no other members of the party agree with O'Rourke's position.

""This is how we free ourselves from fear. We decide what we believe in and we fight like hell to achieve it -- and we don't let anyone, whether it's the NRA, the corporations, or the political action committees, or even our fellow Democrats tell us what is possible and what is not possible,"" O'Rourke said. ""We the people decide what is possible in this country.""

""I thought Beto really got people motivated,"" said Ray Johnson, a 67-year-old consumer protection worker in West Des Moines.

He and his wife said they were also considering backing O'Rourke, as well as Warren and Buttigieg, and said they were most concerned with who will defeat Trump. Johnson said he likes Biden, but thinks Democrats need someone younger who can excite voters.

Buttigieg, meanwhile, is seeking to leverage the eye-popping $25 million he raised in the last fundraising quarter in Iowa, where he is already on the air with television ads.

His campaign bought the second-most tickets to the Steak Fry after Biden, and turned in the day's most raucous appearance as a light rain fell in Des Moines.

Then, Buttigieg started a four-day bus tour of Iowa -- with reporters in tow and allowed to ask the candidate questions at any point.

At the Steak Fry, Nikki Lunden, a 41-year-old warehouse worker from Iowa City, said Buttigieg is her favorite candidate -- but most importantly, she wants to support ""who's going to win it.""

Robert Hein, who had driven from Minnesota -- a Super Tuesday state -- with his wife Amy, said he was ""thinking maybe somebody young might be the better choice"" after hearing former President Jimmy Carter say there should be an ""age limit"" for the presidency that would exclude Biden. He said he was already impressed by Buttigieg and left even more so.

He said Biden represents ""a guarantee that we can get Trump out of there.""

""But the more I listen to these folks, I think there are a good number of them who have a good shot at beating him in November,"" he said."

Written and directed by Ava DuVernay , the four-part drama tells the true story of the Central Park Five -- Korey Wise, Antron McCray, Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson and Yusef Salaam -- who were pressured into falsely confessing to the brutal attack and rape of Trisha Meili in 1989.

Jerome's riveting performance as Wise -- who was then the oldest of the accused at 16 years old, and thus served his 14 years as an adult in the corrections system -- earned him critical praise. He was the only one of the five main actors to play his role as a teen and as an adult.

After thanking his parents, the 21-year-old named the five men who sat alongside veteran actors and Oscar-winners in the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles.

As they stood up and applauded him, a visibly emotional Jerome said: ""I felt like I was in a championship game, and we went through our final hurrah,"" he said. ""Thirty years ago they were sitting in a prison cell, falsely incarcerated, and today they're in suits styled by designers for the Emmys.""

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) held a campaign event in Decorah, Iowa, on Monday and agreed with a woman who suggested that Americans are brainwashed into embracing the traditional American dream and capitalism, telling the crowd that she is “exactly right.”

Sanders held an event in the Luther College gymnasium and took a remark from an attendee, who suggested that Americans are brainwashed into believing in the American dream and capitalism.

“I think that the kind of brainwashing – the idea at least that I grew up with – is that our definition of success is like the American dream and great capitalism,” she said.

“You’re rewarded for getting everything and just keeping it to yourself and not worrying about everybody else,” she continued.

“That’s sort of like the psychology that we’ve all been taught. Well, not everyone, but a lot of people have been taught that that’s the American way, so I think that has something to do with it,” she added.

Sanders did not push back, adamantly agreeing with the attendee and calling her remarks “exactly right.”

“It’s a profound point,” the socialist senator added.

On Tuesday, Sanders unveiled a massive redistribution scheme in the form of an “extreme wealth tax,” which would tax the wealthy on their assets, starting with a one percent tax on couples with a net worth over $32 million:

The tax rate would increase to 2 percent on net worth from $50 to $250 million, 3 percent from $250 to $500 million, 4 percent from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent from $1 to $2.5 billion, 6 percent from $2.5 to $5 billion, 7 percent from $5 to $10 billion, and 8 percent on wealth over $10 billion.

Sanders openly expressed his desire to diminish the wealth of the rich, noting that billionaires “would be cut in half over 15 years” and lamenting their existence in a tweet which read, “Billionaires should not exist”:

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) declared on Tuesday that “billionaires should not exist” as part of the rollout of his massive proposal to redistribute wealth in America via an “extreme wealth” tax, which he claims will “reduce the outrageous level of inequality that exists in America today.”

Sanders unveiled his plan to redistribute wealth in the U.S. via an “extreme wealth tax,” which the socialist senator says will apply to the “top 0.1 percent.” While Sanders’ plan is reminiscent of Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) proposed wealth tax, it goes even further, taxing more individuals at even higher rates.

For example, Sanders proposes to implement a one percent tax on couples with a net worth over $32 million. The percentage increases alongside the value of assets:

The tax rate would increase to 2 percent on net worth from $50 to $250 million, 3 percent from $250 to $500 million, 4 percent from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent from $1 to $2.5 billion, 6 percent from $2.5 to $5 billion, 7 percent from $5 to $10 billion, and 8 percent on wealth over $10 billion.

“These brackets are halved for singles,” Sanders explains.

The socialist senator admits the goal of his ultra-progressive redistribution proposal, boasting that — under his plan — the wealth of billionaires “would be cut in half over 15 years” and declaring that “billionaires should not exist”:

There should be no billionaires. We are going to tax their extreme wealth and invest in working people. Read the plan: https://t.co/RJDLvX5H4c — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 24, 2019

Sanders’ proposal would also spur the creation of a “national wealth registry” and provide an “increase in IRS funding” in order to manage a swell of new audits.

It states:

In order to ensure that the wealthy are not able to evade the tax, the proposal includes a number of key enforcement policies. First, it would create a national wealth registry and significant additional third party reporting requirements. Second, it includes an increase in IRS funding for enforcement and requires the IRS to perform an audit of 30 percent of wealth tax returns for those in the 1 percent bracket and a 100 percent audit rate for all billionaires. Third, the wealth tax includes a 40 percent exit tax on the net value of all assets under $1 billion and 60 percent over $1 billion for all wealthy individual seeking to expatriate to avoid the tax. Finally, the wealth tax proposal will include enhancements to the international tax enforcement and anti-money laundering regime including the strengthening of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.

The presidential candidate argues the U.S. already taxes inherited wealth via the estate tax and says his proposal is constitutional, citing two Yale law professors, Bruce Ackerman and Anne Alstott, who have expressed support for the radical concept. Sanders adds that it is “not radical” to ask the wealthy to “pay their fair share.”

His proposal is expected to result in $4.5 trillion over the next decade, according to University of California, Berkeley, economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. Nonetheless, that number does not come close to paying for his expansive, expensive proposals, such as his $16 trillion Green New Deal proposal or Medicare for All, which could — by some estimates — cost the U.S. over $60 trillion over the next decade alone.

Sanders’ ideological ally, Warren, has also introduced a wealth tax, although it does not go as far. She proposes implementing a two percent wealth tax on those with $50 million in assets, as opposed to Sanders’ $32 million. Warren’s plan increases the tax to three percent for those with assets of $1 billion or greater, with no distinction between couples or single filers. She, like Sanders, plans to fund her costly proposals via the wealth tax, although Saez and Zucman estimate that her proposal would result in $2.6 trillion over the next decade, $1.9 trillion less than Sanders’ proposal.

“If we make the top 0.1% pay their fair share in taxes, their quality of life would not change at all,” Sanders tweeted following the announcement of his redistribution scheme.

“But we would be able to invest in housing, child care and health care and improve the lives of millions of working people,” he added:"

Instead he jokingly remarking on the president’s hair before eventually giving him props for his notoriously early mornings, but not before blasting him as a racist, sexist, homophobe, xenophobe, and religious bigot.

Sanders spoke at the event in Des Moines, Iowa, on Sunday and took a question from an attendee, who asked the socialist senator to name a “genuine thing” he admires about Trump.

“Politics has become so divisive that it’s often difficult to see members of the opposing party as human. If you could say one genuine thing you admire about President Donald Trump, what would it be?” the attendee asked.

“His hair, I’m really impressed by the color of his hair,” Sanders initially said to a few chuckles:

﻿

“Look, let me answer your question in a non-facetious way,” Sanders continued, urging the audience to “look at recent history” and blaming the Republican Party for going too far to the right:

I think the answer is – you may not be happy with this answer – but I think if you look at it you will find that there was once –I don’t know, I don’t know – 20, 30 years ago where you had a Republican Party which is what we would call a center-right party, conservative party. Center-right. You had a president called Dwight D. Eisenhower was president in this country who was probably … his politics today would be a moderate Democrat actually. But for a variety of reasons over the years – before Trump – the party moved very very far to the right, and that is where it is right now. And it gives me no pleasure, I mean it really does not. I have Republican colleagues who I respect I like –they differ with me.

Sanders added he has colleagues he disagrees with politically, telling the crowd, “You know you’d be shocked to know people sit down, they have lunch together they don’t hate each other,” but followed up by calling Trump a racist, sexist, homophobe, xenophobe, and religious bigot.

“In this president, you have somebody who is a racist – in my view – who is a sexist, who is a homophobe, was a xenophobe, and there’s a religious bigot, and you have to speak that out,” Sanders said.

“I have to do everything I can to take that type of behavior on. That’s what I gotta do,” Sanders added.

“Is there a single thing about the president that you can say you admire? Single thing?” the attendee followed up.

Sanders conceded, giving the president props for waking up early, albeit a bit sarcastically.

“He gets up at 3 o’clock in the morning to tweet, so I’m impressed by people who get up at 3 o’clock in the morning,” Sanders said."

The actor-activist hosted the LGBTQ presidential forum in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Friday, which featured all of the Democrat presidential candidates except Sanders.

The 38-year-old star spoke to the Guardian following the forum and criticized Sanders for skipping the event.

“I was disappointed to not see all of the candidates here. I was further disappointed to hear this was not the only LGBTQ event Bernie was making other commitments for,” Ross said. “You don’t show up for both of our LGBTQ events? That’s obviously telling us all we need to know.”

The Pose actor claimed access to inside information, which purportedly revealed that Sanders’ prior commitments included visiting historically black colleges and universities as well as an “old black barbershop”:

I’m going to risk being super real here for a second. When you’re on the campaign trail, what’s happening a lot – and what a lot of these candidates have to avoid – is being seen as looking for a photo op. To be seen in certain communities and spaces. I heard that he was not only visiting the [Historically Black Colleges and Universities] but also visiting an old black barbershop.

“Found out Bernie has a prior commitments to visit HBCUs in North Carolina and Prestige Barber College (a black barbershop) and will be touring the civil rights museum,” Ross tweeted last week, alongside a sarcastic GIF of The Office’s Michael Scott:

Ross told the Guardian that it is a struggle to “get folks in my own black community to understand that being black and being LGBTQ are not mutally exclusive”:

What I hope Bernie would learn is you don’t have to pander to just one aspect of the black community. If he would have been at the LGBTQ forum tonight, he would have seen we were talking about issues affecting people of color. I think it was a huge misstep on his part. And I’m not here for any of the excuses. I say: ‘Make it up to me. Make it up to us.'”

Several social media users disagreed with the former model’s critique of Sanders.

“To question Bernie Sanders stance on lgbtq rights is the most ridiculous thing ever and shows your bias against him,” one user wrote.

“I don’t think he skipped this forum because he doesn’t believe in equal rights for all,” another said.

“Except you decided to focus on one candidate who has the most robust background on this issue. Also, he was at a HBCU which was already scheduled. To think sanders is weak on LGBTQ is frankly laughable,” another added.

The backlash continued to escalate, leading Ross to announce a break from social media “for a while.”

This would not be the first time Sanders has experienced accusations of harassment and intimidation related to his supporters. Black leaders signed a letter last week, which detailed alleged “hateful, violent, and racist threats” from people who identify as Sanders supporters. The alleged harassment followed the socialist senator’s loss of the Working Families Party (WFP) endorsement.

As Breitbart News reported:

A draft of the letter, obtained by Splinter News, claimed that Sanders supporters have called black leaders “Uncle Tom,” “Slave,” and “Cunt.” The alleged threats followed Sanders’ loss of the WFP endorsement, according to the letter. … The leaders continued, demanding the Sanders campaign “unequivocally denounce the racism in its ranks, and issue a public statement separating themselves from these abhorrent attacks.” They also urged Democrats across the board – both Sanders supporters and Warren supporters – to come together to “defeat one of the most serious threats to peace and justice in our lifetimes.” “We cannot wait to make justice real amongst the resisters — our lives literally depend on each other,” the leaders added in the letter.

Sanders followed up with a tweet, which read, “This campaign condemns racist bullying and harassment of any kind, in any space. We are building a multiracial movement for justice — that’s how we win the White House.”

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) will take his campaign for the 2020 Democrat Presidential nomination on Tuesday to join the strike authorization vote rally of the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU).

Sanders’ campaign issued a press release over the weekend announcing the “Chicago Teachers Union Strike Authorization Rally with Sen. Bernie Sanders” will be held at 7 p.m. at the CTU offices in downtown Chicago:

Throughout the campaign, Sanders has stood on multiple picket lines with workers and has used his email and text lists to urge his supporters to stand with striking workers across the country. In August, he released his Workplace Democracy Plan, which would double union membership during his term and give workers unprecedented protections in the workplace.

The following day, Wednesday, “Sanders will head to Michigan to join United Auto Workers on the picket line in front of General Motors’ Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly,” the press release continued.

“In the midst of heated contract negotiations with Mayor Lori Lightfoot, the Chicago Teachers Union is getting a boost from a major supporter,” the Chicago Sun–Times reported. In addition to presidential candidate Sanders, “Members of several other unions will be there, including support staff at Chicago Public Schools who are represented by Service Employees International Union Local 73.” The more than 7,000 special education classroom assistants, bus aides, security guards and custodians with SEIU Local 73 have already authorized a potential mid-October work stoppage.

Striking General Motors workers with the United Automobile Workers union are also expected to be among those joining the group. The CTU appears delighted with the national attention Sanders’ presence will bring to the strike authorization vote.

Local 943—which, like the CTU and Local 73, are poised to strike their schools, with more labor unions and grassroots community groups joining by the hour.

“Senator Sanders has been a stalwart supporter of union workers and their right to strike when necessary for dignity and decent wages and working conditions. He has also championed quality health care for all, a key issue in bargaining for both the CTU and SEIU Local 73,” the CTU said in a press release announcing Tuesday’s event:

CTU members are voting next week to authorize a strike. Local 73 members have already voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike against CPS. Both unions are demanding that the mayor put her campaign promises for equity and educational justice in writing in an enforceable contract—including living wages for workers at the bottom of CPS salary scales, thousands of whom earn wages so low their children are eligible for free and reduced lunches under federal poverty guidelines. Lori Lightfoot successfully campaigned for mayor on a platform of equity and educational justice that closely mirrors the CTU’s contract demands, but has refused to put those promises in writing in an enforceable contract—the only mechanism workers have to force the 5th floor to keep its promises to students and families.

Sanders is not the only purveyor of a Democrat-Socialist political philosophy who will be coming to town in support of the CTU’s demands.

Rebecca Garelli, the former CTU member who moved to Arizona where she became an early leader of the #RedforEd movement posted on her Facebook page Saturday that she’s coming home for a #RedforEd rally in support of the CTU on Sunday:

In July, a four member delegation from the CTU went to Venezuela to lend their support to the socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro:

A four member delegation from the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), all active supporters of the #RedforEd movement, traveled to Venezuela earlier this month to provide support for the socialist regime of Nicolas Maduro. The delegation consisted of Richard Berg, a former Teamsters Union official who currently works for the CTU, and “rank and file” CTU strike captains Sarah Chambers, Fabiana Mariel, and V Voeta Vargas, according to press reports.

As Breitbart News reported in February:

A well-funded and subversive leftist movement of teachers in the United States threatens to tilt the political balance nationwide in the direction of Democrats across the country as Republicans barely hang on in key states that they need to hold for President Donald Trump to win re-election and for Republicans to have a shot at retaking the House and holding onto their Senate majority. This teachers union effort, called #RedforEd, has its roots in the very same socialism that President Trump vowed in his 2019 State of the Union address to stop, and it began in its current form in early 2018 in a far-flung corner of the country before spreading nationally. Its stated goals–higher teacher pay and better education conditions–are overshadowed by a more malevolent political agenda: a leftist Democrat uprising designed to flip purple or red states to blue, using the might of a significant part of the education system as its lever.

Sanders, along with several other Democrat presidential candidates, has been a strong supporter of the #RedforEd movement throughout his campaign."

Khanna, though, said on MSBBC that Trump is “misinformed if he thinks showing up at this rally is somehow going to help him with the Indian American vote.”

Indian American voters could be critical in swing states and help Trump keep a red state like Texas red, but Indian Americans were some of the most vocal critics of Trump after his “go back” tweet that was directed at the freshman “Squad.”

The California Representative said his parents are immigrants and his grandfather spent four years in jail with Gandhi fighting for independence, and he claimed Indian Americans will vote against Trump because of the “Gandhian philosophy of pluralism” that defines his community.

“It’s the Gandhian Philosophy of pluralism, of respect for fellow human beings, of dialogue for peace that define the values of the Indian American community,” Khanna said, adding “that is why 80 percent [of Indian Americans] voted for Hillary Clinton” in 2016."

Bernie Sanders on Tuesday unveiled a massive tax on the wealthiest Americans that aims to diminish income inequality -- a central theme of his campaign -- and at least begin to finance the steep price tags for the numerous government programs the Democratic presidential candidate is proposing.

The release of the independent senator from Vermont's ‘Tax on Extreme Wealth’ follows a similar plan from one of his top rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination, fellow progressive and populist lawmaker Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

“There should be no billionaires. We are going to tax their extreme wealth and invest in working people,” Sanders said on Twitter as he urged supporters to read his new plan. His campaign also sent an email under the subject line: ""Billionaires should not exist.""

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

In his decades in Congress and during both of his runs for the White House, Sanders has railed against an American economic system that he says favors corporations and the rich, at the expense of the working class.

Sanders' plan, if enacted into law, would place a 1 percent tax on net worth over $32 million, a 2 percent tax on net worth between $50 million and $250 million, and a 3 percent tax on net worth between $250 million and $500 million. The proposed Sanders tax would increase to 4 percent net worth from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent for net worth from $1 billion to $2.5 billion, and ultimately reach 8 percent for wealth over $10 billion.

The Sanders campaign says their plan would impact approximately 180,000 households nationwide, and would raise about $4.35 trillion in government revenue by the 2028 budget year.

“Our tax on extreme wealth would only apply to the wealthiest households in America and would cut the wealth of billionaires in half over 15 years, which would substantially break up the concentration of wealth and power of this small, privileged class,” Sanders said in an email to supporters announcing his plan.

And he said that he would “use the revenue to fund our affordable housing plan, universal childcare, and help fund our work to guarantee health care as a right for every man, woman, and child in this country.""

The Republican National Committee criticized Sanders, with spokesman Michael Joyce arguing that “no matter how many new taxes Bernie proposes, it still won’t come even close to covering the costs of Bernie’s socialist pie-in-the-sky policy proposals.”

Warren’s plan – which she unveiled at the beginning of the year-- by comparison would place a 2 percent annual tax on net worth above $50 million and would slap a 3 percent tax on net worth above $1 billion.

Her campaign says it would affect the top 70,000 households in the county and would bring in an estimated $2.6 trillion over 10 years.

The Sanders plan Affects about 180,000 households



Would raise about $4.35 trillion in government revenue by the 2028 budget year

The Warren plan Affects the top 70,000 households



Would bring in about $2.6 trillion over 10 years

Sanders, in order “ensure that the wealthy are not able to evade the tax,” is calling for creating a national registry and beefing up third-party reporting requirements, increasing funding for the Internal Revenue Service and requiring the IRS to perform audits of 30 percent of those in the 1 percent bracket and audits of all billionaires.

He’s also calling for a 40 percent exit tax on the net value of all assets under $1 billion and a steeper 60 percent on assets over $1 billion “for all wealthy individuals seeking to expatriate to avoid the tax.”

President Trump’s re-election campaign took aim at Sanders, not specifically over his new plan but for vows by the senator and the rest of the Democratic field to repeal the tax cuts passed in 2017 by the then-GOP controlled Congress and signed into law by the president.

“By repealing President Trump’s tax cuts, Sanders and the rest of the Democrats would raise taxes on almost all Americans, not just the very rich,” campaign spokesperson Erin Perrine said."

According to the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, when all American voters are asked to rank 12 policies from best to worst, a plan to provide taxpayer-funded healthcare to all illegal aliens — endorsed by Democrat front-runners like Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) — ranks as the least popular among the bunch.

The Journal notes:

Of 12 policy ideas tested in the poll, providing government-sponsored health care to undocumented immigrants was the least popular among the broader electorate, with 62% rejecting it. In a June Democratic debate, all 10 candidates on the stage, including Messrs. Biden and Sanders, raised their hands when asked who backed the idea. In the new survey, it was supported by 64% of Democratic primary voters but only 36% of voters overall. [Emphasis added]

As Breitbart News estimated, providing free healthcare to every illegal alien in the U.S. would cost up to $66 billion a year or $660 billion over a decade to American taxpayers. Already, Americans are forced to subsidize illegal aliens’ medical costs to the sum of almost $20 billion a year.

The Urban Institute’s Linda Blumberg, a health insurance expert, told the New York Times that such a policy providing free healthcare for every foreign national who crosses the U.S.-Mexico border or overstays a visa would drive a migration of “people with serious health problems” to the country.

Similar polls conducted in recent months found that American anywhere between 60 to 63 percent of swing voters oppose offering free healthcare to illegal aliens, as well as 55 to 59 percent of all U.S. voters.

The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll of 900 registered voters was conducted between September 13 and 16 with a margin of error of +/- 3.27 percentage points.

The Hawaii congresswoman hit the other DNC debate threshold, which requires candidates score over 130,000 campaign donors.

In addition to Gabbard, other 2020 White House hopefuls participating in the October debate are: former vice president Joe Biden, Sens.

Robert Francis “Beto” Rourke, billionaire climate crusader Tom Steyer, and technology entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

The next debate, co-hosted by the New York Times and CNN, is scheduled for October 15th in Westerville, Ohio.

News of Gabbard’s inclusion in the fourth debate comes one day after the DNC announced intensified requirements for candidates to clinch a spot at the fifth debate in November. White House hopefuls will need to garner at 3 percent or higher in four polls or at least 5 percent in a pair of early-state polls as well as enjoys the support of 165,000 campaign donors."

Thunberg, who has become the de facto leader of the youth climate movement, addressed attendees of Monday’s Climate Action Summit at U.N. headquarters.

“You are failing us,” Thunberg told the politicians and policymakers assembled at U.N. headquarters. “But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us I say we will never forgive you. We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not.”

Later Monday, Thunberg and 15 other children filed a lawsuit against five countries over the climate change crisis.

According to the suit, Germany, France, Brazil, Argentina, and Turkey have violated the activists’ rights as children. The five named countries are parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, a treaty signed by dozens of nations 30 years ago.

NEW DETAILS REPORTED ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL AS DEMS CLASH WITH WHITE HOUSE ON COMPLAINT

The latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll showed Warren as the first choice for 22 percent of the voters surveyed, while Biden was first choice of 20 percent of the voters.

In June, the Register poll showed Biden leading with 24 percent support, nine percentage points clear of Warren and eight points clear of Sanders.

Ilhan Omar (D-MN) declared over the weekend that former Vice President Joe Biden doesn’t have what it takes to achieve “systemic” social change — yet another indication that his 2020 bid faces heavy skepticism from the Democrat Party’s progressive wing.

“There are few people who fit into the kind of progress that we all want to see in this country,” Omar said in an interview with the Guardian on Saturday. “And I would say he is not one of them.”

“I think it has been very clear to many of the people who have been creating the kind of movement that is exciting generations, that we want somebody who really has a plan that is going to tackle a lot of the systematic challenges that we have, and he doesn’t,” she added.

Omar’s criticism of Biden came after delivering a keynote address at the Iowa People’s Presidential Forum, an event organized by several progressive organizations, in which she argued the United States needs a president who “realizes we are not just fighting for one election; we are fighting for the very soul of our democracy and what society we want to become.”

Several Democrat presidential candidates —including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg — attended the gathering.

The far-left “Squad” member is not the only lawmaker in the four-person clique to raise concerns about Biden’s bid for the White House. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), an author of the Green New Deal, has repeatedly taken aim at Biden’s climate change proposal for fossil fuels to be eliminated by 2050. However, according to the New York Democrat, the former Veep’s plan is too little, too late.

“Scientifically, anything that is less than helping us cut carbon emissions in half by 2030 is going to be too late,” she said. “It’s a start, and I think that what that has shown is a dramatic shift in the right direction, but we need to keep pushing for a plan that is at the scale of the problem.”

Ocasio-Cortez also previously knocked Biden’s performance at the first Democratic presidential debate, saying it “raised questions” about his capacity to be commander-in-chief.

“I think Joe Biden, his performance on the stage, kind of raised some questions in respect to that,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “But I don’t want to say just because someone is 79, they can’t or shouldn’t run for president. I don’t want to… use a number as a proxy for capacity,” she told The New Yorker radio hour in July."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) declared herself vindicated for being less than two percent Native American, the former Harvard University professor is leading in multiple state and national polls for the 2020 Democrat nomination for president.

In the most recent Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll out of Iowa, Warren took the lead with 22 percent of Democrat primary voters for the first time. Former Vice President Joe Biden, meanwhile, fell to second place with 20 percent, while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) trailed in third with 11 percent.

When Democrat primary voters were asked who their second choice for president would be, Warren gained 20 percent of voters for a combined first and second choice tally of 42 percent. Biden, on the other hand, is only the second choice for about ten percent of voters, while Sanders about doubles his prospects.

Warren had led hugely against her Democrat contenders in an Iowa Starting Line-Change Research poll from August. In that poll, Warren surged past Biden and Sanders by 11 points, earning nearly 30 percent of support overall.

Since the second Democrat presidential primary debate on September 12, Warren’s Real Clear Politics average of Iowa polls leads all other candidates with 23 percent. Biden comes in with 20.3 percent average post-debate in Iowa, while Sanders garners 12 percent.

Warren’s surge in Iowa, though, has been met with confrontation from some farmers in the agricultural state who vehemently oppose the Green New Deal, which she has endorsed. In one conversation, an Iowa farmer confronted Warren over her support for the plan, which he said would cripple his industry because of its goals to eliminate cows.

It’s not just Iowa where Warren is surging. Across the country, Warren has steadily climbed over Biden and Sanders to take the lead.

The latest Civiqs/DataProgress poll conducted this month put Warren at 30 percent with likely Democrat primary voters. Biden fell to second place with 24 percent and Sanders trailed with 14 percent.

In an Economist/YouGov poll taken in the second week of September, Warren tied with Biden nationally with each taking 26 percent of Democrat primary voters. Sanders, at third, came in at 16 percent.

Even in California, where Biden has led the pack in most statewide polls, Warren took the lead in the latest Change Research poll, getting 25 percent compared to Biden’s 23 percent. At stake in California for 2020 Democrats are about 416 delegates.

Warren’s recent taking the lead in key Democrat primary states and polls has come after embarrassing mishaps in which she formally apologized to Native Americans for spending years claiming to be Native American herself. Those critics, though, have been reluctant to accept her apology, as Breitbart News noted.

The flops on the campaign trail are far from being in the past for Warren. Last week, she exaggerated for the third time the size of her campaign rally crowds. After holding a rally in Washington Square in New York City, the Warren campaign claimed 20,000 people were at the event. New York City Parks confirmed that Washington Square can only hold a maximum of 10,000 people.

Similarly, in August, Warren’s campaign claimed that 12,000 people were in attendance at her rally on the campus of Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota. The maximum capacity of the venue, though, is about 3,000 people, and with crowd spillover, there could not have been more than 6,000 attendees.

In New Hampshire, Warren’s campaign claimed there were 700 people in attendance at a rally on a farm. Breitbart News was there and judged the crowd at about “over 300.”

Built mostly on the perception of a grassroots populist campaign, Warren’s run for president has seen her take on multinational corporations for outsourcing American jobs and promising an economic patriotist agenda even while using billionaire donor money and pleasing the donor class by taking a mass illegal and legal immigration position.

Despite her anti-establishment messaging, Warren has reportedly been in talks with Democrat Party establishment figures like failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and has received praise from former Senator Harry Reid. One Democrat strategist told NBC News that Clinton has been impressed with Warren’s campaign thus far.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has surged and now enjoys a slight 2-point advantage over former Vice President Joe Biden, the longtime front-runner in the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

The Monmouth University survey, released Tuesday, also shows Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont fading to a distant third.

WARREN EDGES OUT BIDEN IN NEW IOWA POLL, SANDERS DISTANT THIRD

Warren stands at 27 percent among likely Democratic presidential primary voters in the state, with Biden at 25 percent. Warren’s 2-point edge is well within the survey’s sampling error.

Warren’s support has soared by 19 points from the previous Monmouth poll in the Granite State, which was conducted in May. Biden’s dropped 11 points from that survey.

Sanders, meanwhile, is in third in the new poll, at 12 percent, dropping 6 points from Monmouth’s May survey.

New Hampshire, which votes second in the presidential nominating calendar following the Iowa caucuses, is considered by many political analysts and pundits as a must-win for both Sanders and Warren.

The independent senator from Vermont crushed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire, launching the one-time longshot for the nomination into a marathon battle against the eventual nominee. He’s retained a strong organization and devoted supporters in the state as he bids a second time for the White House.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

But Warren, who like Sanders hails from a neighboring state to New Hampshire, has also built up a powerful campaign organization in the Granite State, and has made numerous visits. Warren will return to the state to hold town halls on Wednesday and Friday.

“Warren continues to look stronger with every new poll. She seems to be picking up support across the spectrum with gains coming at the expense of both Biden and Sanders,” said Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray.

The surge from Warren is coming from self-described liberals, among whom she’s up 28 points since the May poll to stand at 39 percent, with Sanders dropping 13 points down to 16 percent. Warren’s also risen 11 points among self-described moderate and conservative voters to stand at 18 percent, with Biden dropping 15 points to stand at 30 percent.

According to the poll, the only other candidate to register in double digits is South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who’s at 10 percent, slightly behind Sanders.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California stands at 3 percent in the survey, with Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, billionaire philanthropist and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii each at 2 percent. The remaining 10 candidates tested in the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls earned 1 percent or less in the poll.

The Monmouth poll in New Hampshire is one of the qualifying surveys the Democratic National Committee uses for their polling thresholds for candidates to make the cut for the primary debates. Gabbard’s 2 percent showing in the new poll means she’s reached 2 percent in four qualifying polls, allowing her to make the stage at next month’s fourth round of nomination debates.

The poll’s findings are similar to those of the latest poll in Iowa this past weekend. A Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom survey indicated Warren at 22 percent, Biden at 20 percent and Sanders a distant third at 11 percent. The Des Moines Register surveys have long been considered the gold standard in Iowa polling.

A new poll released Tuesday in Nevada, which holds it's caucus following the New Hampshire primary, also indicates a close contest between Biden and Warren.

A USA Today/Suffolk University survey puts Biden at 23 percent, Warren at 19 percent and Sanders at 14 percent.

The most recent polls in New Hampshire have been all over the board, with one suggesting Sanders holding a lead; another indicating a three-way tie among Biden, Warren and Sanders; and a third pointing to Sanders trailing Biden and Warren.

The Monmouth University poll was conducted from Sept. 17-21, among 401 New Hampshire voters likely to vote in next February’s Democratic presidential primary questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s sampling error is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.

The poll’s release comes with four-and-a-half months to go until the New Hampshire primary.

Behar started the debate by claiming that people who denied climate change didn't care about their grandchildren.

""Some of these people who are denying climate change — they're going to be dead and they don't care apparently about their grandchildren. They only care about their 401k's,"" Behar argued.

For Huntsman, Behar's statement went too far. She argued that it wasn't ""fair to say that they don't care about their own grandkids.""

""That's what it looks like to me,"" Behar shot back. She later indicated she would continue ""guilt-tripping"" people over the issue.

""Guilt-tripping might work,"" she said, before standing behind her previous statement about grandchildren. Huntsman contended that Behar was discouraging ""rational conversation"" by taking a shot at people's relationships with their grandchildren.

Their comments came as climate activists held demonstrations in major cities over the issue and the United Nations held a ""climate summit"" with world leaders.

""Do you motivate people by saying we've got to better the environment or do you motivate them by saying, 'You know what, we're going to die in 10 years anyway. Just stop having all kids. Let's just think about not having kids anymore?'"" Huntsman asked.

She pointed to comments from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who has worried about whether she should have kids and warned that Miami would be gone within a few years."

The Ontario Provincial Police told Fox News that Linda O’Leary was charged for the Aug. 24 accident, in which her smaller vessel struck a larger vessel in Ontario, Canada. Her court date is set for Oct. 29. A rep for Kevin O'Leary did not immediately return Fox News' request for comment.

According to TMZ, police obtained five videos from surveillance cameras which showed she was driving the boat at 17 mph around 11:30 p.m., which police told the outlet is not a safe speed.

Delaney said the candidates' platforms are moving too far left and will end up scaring away voters who favor private insurance and economic growth.

""Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are fundamentally running on almost like a government takeover of the private economy of the United States of America,"" he said.

The DNC is raising both the fundraising threshold as well as the polling standards, making it even more difficult for presidential hopefuls to lay out their vision on the national debate stage in November. In order to qualify, a candidate will have to report at least 165,000 individual donors, up from 130,000. The DNC is also requiring 600 unique donors in at least 20 states.

Candidates will have two ways to qualify for the debate via polling, either receiving five percent support in two early primary and caucus state polls – which includes Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina – or receiving three percent support in four early primary and caucus state polls or national polls.

While details of the November date are to be determined, any polls released “between Sept. 13 and midnight seven days before the debate” will count, the New York Times added, noting that “at least eight candidates have already met the 165,000-donor threshold.”

Candidates have until October 1 to qualify for next month’s debate at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. In order to qualify, a candidate must garner at least two percent in four DNC-approved polls and report 130,000 individual donors, up from the 65,000 required for the first debate. Eleven candidates have qualified, including Tom Steyer (D). He will be joined by:

Joe Biden (D)

Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ)

Julián Castro (D)

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA)

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN)

Beto O’Rourke (D)

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)

Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D)

Andrew Yang (D)

Both Marianne Williamson (D) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) are still vying to get on the October debate stage, needing three polls and two polls, respectively.

The increased threshold is likely to draw critiques from low-tier candidates, who slammed the DNC’s requirements in the past.

“Here’s the situation: there’s a whole bunch of different polls that have come out. The DNC has only recognized some of them as being qualifying polls for the debate,” Gabbard told Tucker Carlson in August.

“The whole thing gets a little bit confusing. You’ve gotta jump way down into the weeds of the numbers and statistics, but I think the bigger problem is that whole process really lacks transparency,” she added.

“The DNC’s process is stifling debate at a time when we need it most,” Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) declared last month. “And it will NOT help us beat Donald Trump. If we wanted to be the party that excluded people, we’d be Republicans”:

“If the DNC had followed the process they announced in February and kept to the promised 17 [sic] qualifying polls, the lineup of the upcoming third debate might be very different,” Williamson’s communications director Patricia Ewing said prior to the third Democrat debate in Houston, Texas."

Nearly two-thirds of Democratic primary voters questioned in a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal national poll say they support a government-run single-payer Medicare-for-all style system that would replace existing private insurance. That plan is championed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the two progressive standard-bearers in the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL SAYS ABOUT MEDICARE BUY-INS AND MEDICARE FOR ALL

But among all voters, support for such a plan plunges to just 41 percent. About 56 percent of registered voters oppose a ""Medicare-for-all"" plan that replaces private insurance.

The poll, released Sunday, indicates that what two-thirds of all voters do like is allowing a Medicare buy-in for those under 65 years old. That’s in line with the public option being pitched by former Vice President Joe Biden. Currently, the taxpayer-funded program covers Americans 65 and older.

The latest Fox News national poll also points to the popularity of the Medicare buy-in plan, with 83 percent of Democratic primary voters saying they favor the plan, which would allow individuals to buy into the government-run system. Even 51 percent of Republicans agree.

Among all voters, 68 percent support a buy-in system. But support for a ""Medicare-for-all"" plan that replaces private insurance nosedives to 46 percent among all voters in the Fox News poll, which was released last week. Sen. Kamala Harris of California also supports Medicare-for-all, albeit with a role for private insurers.

Health care has been a leading concern among Democratic primary voters, with the issue topping the past two primary debates.

TRUMP UKRAINE GAMES TIP DEMS TOWARD IMPEACHMENT

Politico: “President Donald Trump on Tuesday shifted his explanation for temporarily withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, citing what he criticized as a lack of similar financial contribution by other Western powers to the Eastern European nation. Trump’s latest remarks are at odds with his assertion Monday that he denied the assistance because he feared bureaucratic corruption within Ukraine’s government. The new claim also comes after weekend reports that he repeatedly pressured newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son. ‘As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid. They were fully paid,’ Trump told reporters Tuesday, ahead of his address to the United Nations General Assembly. ‘But my complaint has always been, and I'd withhold again, and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine,’ he continued.”



Officials say Pelosi quietly making moves - WaPo: “[Speaker Nancy] Pelosi, according to multiple senior House Democrats and congressional aides, has been gauging the mood of her caucus members about whether they believe that allegations that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate a political foe are a tipping point. She was making calls as late as Monday night, and many leadership aides who once thought Trump’s impeachment was unlikely now say they think it’s almost inevitable. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly. Pelosi’s conversations — and reconsideration of her long-held position that impeachment is too divisive — come amid a growing clamor for impeachment that extends beyond the party’s liberal base and many Democratic presidential candidates to moderate lawmakers in competitive House seats.”



Moderate Dems join the effort - Fox News: “A slew of key swing-district Democrats late Monday threw their support en masse behind opening a formal impeachment inquiry, as The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal reported in the evening that President Trump personally ordered acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before he pressed the new Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The rapid-fire declarations by the influential Democrats, after seemingly months of teetering on the brink, came just a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi strongly suggested she was now warming to the idea of impeaching the president. Speaking to Fox News, a House Democratic leadership aide confirmed that the Democratic caucus will meet Tuesday afternoon to discuss the Ukraine matter and how to proceed.”



Trump’s attacks on Biden worry Dems of 2016 repeat - WaPo: “But in a worrisome sign for Democrats anxious about reliving the party’s woes in 2016, [the Biden] campaign’s counterattack is being drowned out by a pro-Trump network on social media and cable news that kicked into gear over the weekend, leveling accusations against Biden that have scant factual basis. … The flurry of online attacks against Biden carries echoes of conspiracy theories spread by Trump and his allies about Hillary Clinton’s health and claims about her foreign entanglements that helped turn voters against her. The onslaught comes at a crucial moment in the Democratic primary contest, as the former vice president attempts to showcase his ability to go toe-to-toe with Trump. But with the Democratic National Committee attempting to be a more neutral arbiter than it was in 2016, when it was accused of aiding Clinton, the party helped monitor viral attacks but publicly remained silent.”



THE RULEBOOK: PROVE YOURSELF

“To reverse and undo what has been done by a predecessor, is very often considered by a successor as the best proof he can give of his own capacity and desert… and that the less he resembles him, the more he will recommend himself to the favor of his constituents.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 72



TIME OUT: ONE OF A KIND

Smithsonian: “The guitar Prince plays in [the Purple Rain video] was custom-made for him by a luthier at a Minneapolis music shop called Knut-Koupee Enterprises. … It made sense, even then, that Prince would require an instrument that didn’t resemble anything anyone else was playing. Knut-Koupee made three so-called ‘cloud’ guitars for Prince in the early 1980s. … In 1993, Prince gave a cloud guitar to the Smithsonian Institution, but he didn’t include any information about the instrument’s origins. But earlier this year, John Woodland, the conservator for Prince’s guitar collection … reached out to the Smithsonian with a sneaking suspicion. After the guitar underwent a CT scan and extensive paint analysis, what they found was a shocker… This wasn’t just a cloud guitar, in other words, it was the cloud guitar—the instrument responsible for some of the most iconic sounds and images in American popular music.”

WARREN CLOSING IN ON BIDEN IN NEVADA

USA Today: “Elizabeth Warren has pulled within striking distance of Joe Biden for the lead in Nevada's influential presidential caucuses. A new Suffolk University/USA TODAY Network Poll, taken after this month's Democratic debate, shows Biden at 23% and Warren at 19% in Nevada, the state that follows Iowa and New Hampshire in the opening presidential contests next year. Bernie Sanders is at 14%. While Warren trailed Biden, the Massachusetts senator was within the margin of error of the former vice president for the first time in a public poll in the Silver State. … Among the second tier of candidates in Nevada, California Sen. Kamala Harris was at 4% and South Bend (Ind.) Mayor Pete Buttigieg, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and activist Tom Steyer at 3%. … The survey showed Warren positioned to increase her support as the Democratic field narrows. She was the ‘second choice’ of 19%, compared to 16% for Biden, 12% for Sanders and 10% for California Sen. Kamala Harris.”



She also joins him upfront in New Hampshire - Monmouth University: “Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has joined former Vice President Joe Biden at the front of the pack in New Hampshire, according to the latest Monmouth University Poll. … Among registered New Hampshire Democrats and unaffiliated voters who are likely to participate in the February 2020 Democratic primary, 27% currently support Warren and 25% support Biden. The only other candidates in double digits are Sanders at 12% and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 10%. Others with measurable support are California Sen. Kamala Harris (3%), New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (2%), Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (2%), Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar (2%), former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer (2%), and entrepreneur Andrew Yang (2%).”



Gabbard is the 12th Dem to qualify for October debate - Politico: “Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has qualified for the October Democratic presidential primary debate, making her the twelfth candidate to hit the Democratic National Committee's thresholds. Gabbard got 2 percent support in a New Hampshire poll conducted by Monmouth University and released on Tuesday. The Hawaii congresswoman had previously gotten 2 percent in three other DNC-approved polls, and her campaign said she already racked up more than the 130,000 donors she needed to make the debate stage. Gabbard will join Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julian Castro, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O'Rourke, Tom Steyer, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang onstage in October.”



DNC raises qualifying thresholds for November debate - Fox News: “The DNC announced on Monday that to qualify for the November showdown, candidates must reach at least 3 percent in four approved national or early-voting-state polls. That’s up from the 2 percent needed to reach the stage at the September and October debates and up from the 1 percent needed in three approved surveys for the June and July debates. But, to tamper down any criticism from the early voting states, the DNC added another way to satisfy the polling criteria – reaching 5 percent in two qualifying surveys in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina – the first four states to vote in the nominating calendar. The window for the polling is from Sept. 13 to seven days before the still-unannounced November debate. In previous debates, candidates had until two weeks before the showdown to reach the polling criteria.”

Fox News: “A Russian navy boat embarking on a research expedition in the Arctic Sea sunk after being attacked by a female walrus that was defending her young, according to reports Monday. The Altai, a tugboat operated by the Russian navy’s Northern Fleet, carried researchers from the Russian Geographical Society and other expedition participants into waters near a remote island chain called Franz Josef Land in the Arctic Sea, Ars Technica reported. The boat dispatched a smaller inflatable landing craft in shallow waters off Wilczek Island to bring researchers ashore near Cape Heller. Before the boat could reach the beach, it was attacked by a female walrus who was probably ‘fearing for her cubs,’ according to a press release from the Russian Geographical Society. ‘The boat sank, but a tragedy was avoided thanks to the prompt action by the squad leader. All landing participants safely reached the shore,’ the press release said.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“The first week, I thought, the terrible thing is that people are going to judge me now by a different standard. If I can just muddle through life, they'll say it was a great achievement, given this. I thought that would be the worst, that would be the greatest defeat in my life -- if I allowed that. I decided if I could make people judge me by the old standard, that would be a triumph and that's what I try to do. It seemed to me the only way to live.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) speaking with the Washington Post on Aug. 17, 1984.

WARREN SURGES IN IOWA

Des Moines Register: “Elizabeth Warren has surged in Iowa, narrowly overtaking Joe Biden and distancing herself from fellow progressive Bernie Sanders, the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows. Warren, the U.S. senator from Massachusetts, now holds a 2-percentage-point lead, with 22% of likely Democratic caucusgoers saying she is their first choice for president. It is the first time she has led in the Register’s poll. Former Vice President Biden, who had led each of the Register’s three previous 2020 cycle polls, follows her at 20%. Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont, has fallen to third place with 11%. No other candidate reaches double digits. ‘This is the first major shakeup’ in what had been a fairly steady race, said J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., which conducted the poll. … South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg follows the three leaders as the favorite of 9% of poll respondents. U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California is at 6%. U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey are at 3%. Polling at 2% are U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, businessman Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang.”



Dem candidates take two approaches in Iowa - Des Moines Register: “Former Vice President Joe Biden brought in a fire truck, bouncy house and ice cream truck for a carnival-style ‘Biden fest.’ A Mariachi band played at former U.S. Housing Secretary Juliàn Castro’s rally site and then marched in with the candidate and his supporters. And Lizzo and Prince blared through the speakers at a gathering for U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. But others took a different tack: U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren focused on organizing supporters, gathering voter information and knocking doors rather than big displays of support. Saturday’s Polk County Steak Fry in Iowa was the largest in the event’s storied history, drawing more than 12,000 excited Democrats to Water Works Park, where they heard from 17 presidential candidates vying for their attention and support on caucus day. Many of the candidates gathered with their supporters ahead of the main event, holding rallies where they each tried to outshine their competitors.”



Voters dislike Trump, still have doubts about Dems - NBC News: “As Democratic candidates compete for the opportunity to take on President Donald Trump, the incumbent they hope to oust is more personally disliked than any of his recent predecessors, and half of voters say they’re very uncomfortable with the idea of his re-election. But the electorate at large also expresses doubts about some of the progressive policies being backed by candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and the party’s more moderate frontrunner — Joe Biden — also faces questions about his fitness for the job. Those are the major findings in the latest release from the September NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll… But Trump also continues to benefit from the upside of the polarization of the electorate around him, commanding more enthusiasm than his Democratic competitors as well. A quarter of voters (26 percent) say they’re enthusiastic about him, while fewer say they’re enthusiastic about Warren (17 percent), Sanders (13 percent) and Biden (12 percent.)”



The end may be near for Booker - Politico: “Cory Booker’s presidential campaign is betting it all on the next 10 days, signaling Saturday that it will cease to exist unless it can raise nearly $2 million by the end of the month. ‘We have reached a critical moment, and time is running out,’ campaign manager Addisu Demissie warned in a memo to Booker staff and supporters. ‘It’s now or never: The next 10 days will determine whether Cory Booker can stay in this race and compete to win the nomination.’ The bottom line, Demissie said, is that ‘we do not see a legitimate long-term path forward’ if the campaign can’t raise another $1.7 million by Sept. 30, the third-quarter fundraising deadline. … Demissie made clear on a conference call with reporters later Saturday that the campaign isn’t out of money or at risk of running out of funds.”

“For the sake of certainty and uniformity, therefore, the power of defining felonies in this case was in every respect necessary and proper.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 42



TIME OUT: MEET YOU IN ST. LOUIS

History: “Amid much public excitement, American explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark return to St. Louis, Missouri, from the first recorded overland journey from the Mississippi River to the Pacific coast and back. The Lewis and Clark Expedition had set off more than two years before to explore the territory of the Louisiana Purchase. Even before the U.S. government concluded purchase negotiations with France, President Thomas Jefferson commissioned his private secretary Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, an army captain, to lead an expedition into what is now the U.S. Northwest. On May 14, the ‘Corps of Discovery,’ featuring some two dozen men, left St. Louis for the American interior. … On September 23, 1806, after two and a half years, the expedition returned to the city, bringing back a wealth of information about the largely unexplored region, as well as valuable U.S. claims to Oregon Territory.”

IMPEACHMENT PRESSURE BUILDS AROUND TRUMP PHONE CALL

NYT: “President Trump acknowledged on Sunday that he raised corruption accusations against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. during a phone call with Ukraine’s leader, a stunning admission as pressure mounted on Democrats to impeach Mr. Trump over allegations he leaned on a foreign government to help damage a political rival. In public and in private, many Democrats said the evidence that has emerged in recent days indicating that Mr. Trump pushed the Ukrainian government to investigate Mr. Biden, and his administration’s stonewalling of attempts by Congress to learn more, were changing their calculations about whether to charge him with articles of impeachment. … The fast-moving developments prompted Speaker Nancy Pelosi to level a warning of her own to the White House: Turn over the secret whistle-blower complaint by Thursday, or face a serious escalation from Congress. In a letter to House Democrats, Ms. Pelosi never mentioned the word ‘impeachment,’ but her message hinted at that possibility.”



Trump continues to defend his call about Biden - Politico: “President Donald Trump on Monday intensified his attempts to justify a phone call with Ukraine’s president in which he reportedly pushed for an investigation into one of his chief political rivals, maintaining that he’s merely concerned about stamping out corruption. He once again dismissed the accusations that he was using his position of power to pressure a foreign government into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son as a ‘witch hunt.’ For the first time, however, Trump appeared to connect the idea to the issue of foreign aid. ‘If we're supporting a country, we want to make sure that country is honest,’ Trump told reporters after arriving for the U.N. General Assembly. … Also at issue with critics of the president is $250 million in foreign aid meant for Ukraine that the White House mysteriously withheld before releasing under bipartisan pressure early this month. There is no evidence that Trump directly tied the release of foreign aid to an investigation into Biden and his son.”



Schumer insists on hearings over whistleblower complaint - Politico: “Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is requesting that the Republican Senate conduct hearings and issue a subpoena to the Trump administration in response to a whistleblower complaint about President Donald Trump's alleged request that Ukraine investigate one of his political opponents. In a letter to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Monday morning, the New York Democrat said the Senate should hold hearings regarding any connection between delayed aid to Ukraine and Trump's reported request that the country probe the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic contender in next year's presidential election. Schumer also asks McConnell to compel the Senate to issue a subpoena to bring the whistleblower complaint to Congress ‘as required by law.’”



Giuliani accuses Ukraine of laundering $3M to Hunter Biden - Fox News: “Rudy Giuliani channeled President Trump Monday with a wee-hours Twitter blitz aimed at turning the Ukraine story currently roiling Washington into a big problem for Democrats. Giuliani, the personal attorney for Trump and outspoken critic of presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son’s relationship with Ukraine, accused Kiev of laundering $3 million to Hunter Biden, suggested that the Obama administration turned a blind eye, and made the prediction that the scandal is in its infancy. ‘If Dem party doesn’t call for an investigation of Bidens’ millions from Ukraine and billions from China, they will own it,’ he tweeted. ‘Bidens’ made big money selling public office. How could Obama have allowed this to happen? Will Dems continue to condone and enable this kind pay-for-play?’”



CONGRESS SET TO PASS STOPGAP SPENDING BILL THIS WEEK

Roll Call: “The Senate needs to act this week to clear a stopgap spending bill before recessing through the end of the government’s fiscal year, but that is really the only must-pass business for either chamber. The House passed the measure Thursday, 301-123, after resolving hangups that included a debate over assisting farmers who have seen demand for crops plummet thanks to the ongoing sparring over trade with China. … There is no expectation the Senate will have trouble reaching an agreement to clear the measure to keep the government funded through Nov. 21, but it is certainly not the only piece of business that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wants to advance. … Once the House is back Tuesday, Democrats will once again turn their attention to border politics as the chamber considers two measures designed to improve the Department of Homeland Security’s treatment of migrants.”

UPI: “A raccoon went for a 16-mile ride on top of a Florida bread delivery truck that reached speeds of over 50 mph during the trip. The driver of the Wonder Bread truck said other drivers called his attention to the raccoon on top of his truck, and he had already traveled about 10 miles before calling 911 from the parking lot of a fast food restaurant. Police and the driver attempted to get the raccoon to safety by pulling the truck up to a convenient tree branch, but the animal refused to climb down. The driver said he eventually had to drive the final 6 miles of his journey with the raccoon still riding on the roof. He said the animal eventually apparently climbed down on its own once the truck was parked at his company's headquarters in North Fort Myers.”

For days, Democrats have seized on allegations that Trump in July pressured Zelensky to investigate Biden family dealings – using military aid as leverage – and cited the reports to revive calls for the president's impeachment.

But the firestorm, apparently related to a still-secret whistleblower complaint, has, in turn, opened the door for Republicans to revisit the original controversy involving Joe Biden's son Hunter. Further, they allege, the details of that story suggest Biden did the same thing Trump is accused of doing -- leveraging military aid to pressure Ukraine.

GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN

“The more they want to talk about Ukraine, the better,” Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said Monday morning on Fox Business Network’s “Mornings with Maria.”

Giuliani has long been looking into the Bidens’ ties to Ukraine, claiming Hunter Biden improperly benefited from business dealings in Ukraine with energy company Burisma Holdings as a member of its board and questioning whether his dad helped protect him.

Hunter Biden was hired by Burisma in April 2014, two months after Ukraine's Russia-friendly president was ousted by protesters and as his father was heavily involved in U.S. efforts to support the new pro-Western government and its pledge to fight corruption. The hiring of the younger Biden immediately raised concerns that the Ukrainian firm, whose owner was a political ally of the ousted president, was seeking to gain influence with the Obama administration.

Two years later, then-Vice President Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine unless a top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was fired. Shokin was accused by many in Ukraine and in the West of being soft on corruption, but he also had been leading an investigation into Burisma's owner.

Trump has claimed Shokin ""was after"" Hunter Biden and the vice president was trying to protect his son.

“The very thing they’re accusing President Trump of doing, Biden did,” Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told “Fox & Friends” Monday.

Fox News reported on the Biden controversy in April. The New York Times published a lengthy story on the matter in May. But the controversy flew largely under the radar until now. While the heat is on Trump over whether or not he pressured Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, that firestorm has prompted multiple news outlets to revisit the original Biden controversy in order to provide context.

Trump allies are hammering that as the real scandal, as video of Biden once bragging about his role in having Shokin fired has gone viral.

BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN LIKELY COMING TO AN END, NUNES SAYS

Biden has denied wrongdoing, with Shokin having already been suspected of corruption before his dismissal, and hammered Trump over the reports on his phone conversation with Kiev. For his part, Trump addressed his phone call with Zelensky by calling the conversation “perfect” and insisting “there was no quid pro quo” and that he “said absolutely nothing wrong.” Trump also insists that the idea of withholding military aid from Ukraine is bogus because he gave the aid.

Trump also tweeted Sunday night, stating that the Ukrainian government backed him up by saying he did not pressure them during the phone call. In the same tweet, he said the “real story” was Biden pressuring Ukraine into firing Shokin.

Giuliani is also trying to circulate new Biden allegations.

Giuliani accused Kiev on Monday of laundering $3 million to Hunter Biden and suggested the Obama administration turned a blind eye.

""If Dem party doesn’t call for an investigation of Bidens’ millions from Ukraine and billions from China, they will own it,” he tweeted. ""Bidens’ made big money selling public office. How could Obama have allowed this to happen? Will Dems continue to condone and enable this kind pay-for-play?""

While the former vice president has claimed he and his son never discussed Hunter’s business, Hunter told The New Yorker that they did talk about it once, with Joe Biden telling his son, ""I hope you know what you are doing.""

Democrats and Republicans are both pushing for investigations. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who has shied away from calling for impeachment in the past, told CNN on Sunday that the latest allegations against Trump may warrant such a measure.

“If the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit … then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that that conduct represents,” Schiff said.

Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has resisted calls for impeachment for other alleged Trump transgressions, said Sunday that unless acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire provides information about the whistleblower complaint involving Trump to Congress, administration officials ""will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness, which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.""

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., meanwhile, told Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” that he wants the Justice Department to look into the Bidens’ dealings with Ukraine.

“Nobody’s looked at this, but somebody should, so I’m hoping the Department of Justice will look at the Biden-Ukraine connection like we looked at the Trump-Russia connection,” Graham said. “Was there a relationship between the vice president’s family and the Ukraine business world that was inappropriate? I don’t know. Somebody other than me needs to look at it, and I sure as hell don’t trust the media to get to the bottom of it.”

All this comes as Democrats continue to battle for the 2020 presidential nomination. After three debates, Biden remains the front-runner, but he has lost ground to rivals Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., with Warren surpassing Biden in a new Iowa poll.

But, the upping of polling and donor thresholds – more modest than the doubling of the criteria from July’s second round to this month’s third round – may not significantly winnow the field of White House contenders still standing after October’s debate.

The DNC announced on Monday that to qualify for the November showdown, candidates must reach at least 3 percent in four approved national or early-voting-state polls. That’s up from the 2 percent needed to reach the stage at the September and October debates and up from the 1 percent needed in three approved surveys for the June and July debates.

OCTOBER DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY DEBATE TO BE HELD IN OHIO

But, to tamper down any criticism from the early voting states, the DNC added another way to satisfy the polling criteria – reaching 5 percent in two qualifying surveys in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina – the first four states to vote in the nominating calendar.

The window for the polling is from Sept. 13 to seven days before the still-unannounced November debate. In previous debates, candidates had until two weeks before the showdown to reach the polling criteria.

""Qualification period ends 1 week (not 2 weeks) before the debate, giving candidates more time to qualify,"" DNC communications director Xochitl Hinojosa tweeted.

The other threshold – fundraising – also saw a slight raising of the bar. To make the cut, candidates will have to receive campaign contributions from 165,000 individual donors. That’s up from 130,000 for the September and October debates and from 65,000 for the first two rounds of showdowns. Candidates also will have to receive 600 unique contributions from each of 20 states, the District of Columbia or U.S. territories.

The DNC’s faced criticism over its thresholds for months from many of the lower and middle-tier candidates, who argued that the criteria forced them to concentrate on boosting donor contributions at the expense of retail politicking in the early voting states. And, some activists and party leaders in the early voting states have also criticized the DNC for winnowing the record field of candidates – which topped off at roughly two-dozen contenders this summer – before voters actually got to vote in the primaries and caucuses starting this coming February.

""The DNC is using polling to winnow the field even further, when it's voters and caucus-goers who should be determining our nominee,"" said Shannon Beckham, a spokeswoman for Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet's presidential campaign.

And, Galia Slayen, a spokeswoman for Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, told Fox News that ""as the DNC continues to make the rules up as they go along, Governor Bullock will remain focused on bringing his message of a fair shot for every American directly to voters on the ground.""

Both Bennet and Bullock were on the debate stage in July for the third round but failed to qualify for this month's showdown and it appears unlikely either will make the cut for October's debate.

The new thresholds shouldn’t be much of a problem for many of the leading contenders – such as former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Kamala Harris of California, as well as South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

2020 DEMOCRATS FUME AT DNC OVER DEBATE THRESHOLDS

Some of the other six candidates likely to make the October debate are not sure bets to qualify for November’s showdown. That group consists of Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

As he has in the past, Yang praised the DNC, tweeting, ""Kudos to the DNC for raising the thresholds in a fair and transparent manner as well.""

Some of the candidates, including Booker and Buttigieg, quickly used news of the new thresholds to reach out to supporters with fundraising emails.

Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro and billionaire philanthropist and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer – who've also made the cut for October’s showdown – have yet to hit 3 percent in any polls since the November qualifying period kicked off earlier this month. And, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who's just one poll away from making the October debate, also has yet to reach 3 percent in any approved surveys.

The September NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Sunday shows that 69 percent of voters dislike Trump. That is a toxic level in any race let alone one for the presidency.

It is impossible to improve that sentiment to less than 50 percent in the remaining 14 months before the 2020 election. Prior to this poll, the highest dislike of a president was 42 percent for George W. Bush after Hurricane Katrina in March 2006.

ANDREW MCCARTHY: WHAT IS TRUMP-BIDEN CLASH OVER UKRAINE AND WHISTLEBLOWER ALL ABOUT?

In the same poll, 49 percent say they’re very uncomfortable with Trump’s 2020 candidacy. That’s compared with 41 percent for Bernie Sanders and 33 percent apiece for Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. Furthermore, a record 50 percent dislike Trump and his policies.

Other polls show Trump losing a general election to any of the top five Democratic candidates for president.

Clearly Trump’s reelection is in trouble. And it may explain why Trump allegedly sought foreign assistance against Joe Biden, the front-runner in the crowded Democratic primary field. That should concern every American.

It has been widely reported that Trump asked the newly elected president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, eight times in a July phone call to investigate whether Biden, while vice president, acted improperly in pressuring the resignation of a Ukraine prosecutor whose office was investigating a company that employed Biden's son. Trump denies these allegations and the Ukrainian foreign minister said Saturday, “I know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure.”

It was also reported that Trump threatened to withhold $250 million in military aid from Ukraine if they didn’t cooperate. That money was released this month.

Furthermore, Trump insisted that Ukraine work on the matter with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, not official representatives of the U.S. government.

However, if these reports are true, a request to benefit Trump’s political prospects, rather than United States or its national security, is illegal.

Clearly Trump’s reelection is in trouble. And it may explain why he allegedly sought foreign assistance against Joe Biden, the Democratic front-runner.

Trump's acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, refused to discuss the complaint that brought this matter to light when he appeared before the House Intelligence Committee last week and refused to provide the whistleblower complaint to Congress … which they are legally entitled to receive.

In addition to allegedly seeking assistance from a foreign government to interfere in our election,Trump has done nothing to secure our election systems.

In June, the House passed the Secure Election Act, which authorized $600 million for states to bolster election systems. The act would require the implementation of cybersecurity safeguards for hardware and software used in elections, bar wireless communication devices in election systems, and require electronic voting machines be manufactured in the United States.

However, the Senate had not taken up the measure because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was refusing to do so. Until last week. Out of the blue, just one day after the Ukraine story broke, McConnell approved $250 million for election security, a token amount that will provide only $5 million per state to fight the Russians and will have little real effect.

It seems McConnell, who takes umbrage with his nickname “Moscow Mitch,"" may have been trying to head off criticism about foreign election interference with this gesture. But it is just that, a gesture. There are 406 days until next year's general election – and only 133 until the 2020 caucuses and primaries begin – and the resources and reforms to guard against foreign interference are not close to what is needed.

It appears Trump is so worried about his poll numbers that he thinks he needs outside help to win and that no one can or will stop him … again.

If that is true, then Trump is acting in a decidedly un-American fashion.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., presidential candidate: The climate change is real. It is an existential threat to our country and the entire planet.

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., presidential candidate: If NATO is about the common defense, the biggest existential threat is climate change.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, presidential candidate: This is climate change. It really is the existential threat.

Julian Castro, presidential candidate: We're going to have to address the most existential threat to our nation and the world, climate change.

Beto O'Rourke, presidential candidate: On climate change, the greatest existential threat that we face.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., presidential candidate: We are facing a climate crisis, it represents an existential threat to who we are as human beings.

""A threat to who we are as humans."" Well, there are a number of questions here. Let's see if we can unpack them.

The first one: is climate change real? That's an easy one. Of course, it's real. Climate always changes.

If you're in the United States, for example, the ground that you're standing on right now was not so long ago really covered with glacial ice a mile thick. Now, it's not covered in glacial ice a mile thick. So what happened?

What happened is climate change. That's been happening since the Earth cooled. Is human activity accelerating climate change? Can we reverse or slow climate change? Despite what they tell you, no one really knows.

But the real question here has nothing to do with climate science. It has to do with people who pretend they understand climate science. Do those people actually believe what they're saying?

This is what climate activism has become -- a performative stunt, mixed with hypocrisy. These are the people who promised to crack down on your cheeseburgers while flying across the country, on private jets.

Well, let's see. Here was Kamala Harris recently talking at a CNN town hall about how red meat contributes to the absolutely existential threat of climate change.

Harris: As a nation, we have actually have to have a real priority at the highest level of government around what we eat and in terms of healthy eating, because we have a problem in America.

Erin Burnett, CNN host: But would you support changing the Dietary Guidelines?

Harris: Yes.

Burnett: You know, the food pyramid, what people are eating?

Harris: Yes.

Burnett: So reduce red meat specifically.

Harris: Yes, I would.

Got that? Kamala Harris is a good person, and because she is a good person -- a much better person than you are -- she cares about the existential threat of climate change so much, that she is willing to forgo red meat. That's what she told CNN viewers recently.

But when she is in the pork producing state of Iowa, though, it's a very different story. Just this past weekend, Harris attended the Annual Polk County Democratic Party Steak Fry. She took her turn working the grill posing for the cameras.

And by the way, so did all of the other Democratic candidates. Liz Warren was there, Beto O'Rourke, even Cory Booker, who says he is a vegan. Organizers grilled more than 10,000 steaks over the weekend. Tape of the event shows plumes of ozone destroying meat smoke rising heavenward. The candidates standing amidst all of this seemed wholly unconcerned.

Are you surprised? Don't be surprised. This is what climate activism has become -- a performative stunt, mixed with hypocrisy. These are the people who promised to crack down on your cheeseburgers while flying across the country, on private jets. No one says a word about it.

Last week, millions of concerned progressives took part in the so-called climate strike. In their wake, they left mountains of litter. On Monday in Washington, climate activists demanded change by blocking roads, causing gridlock, and throwing confetti on the ground.

Well, if you're under 40, you might be surprised to learn that people didn't use to express concern about the environment by littering. That used to seem weird, but then the point of environmentalism used to be about nature and preserving it and protecting it.

The point now is very different. The point now is political power. You gin up a crisis and you demand the population submit to your will, or else. And as you do that, of course, you don't need to fight fair or acknowledge democracy or make a rational case for your position. You do whatever it takes. You'll even use children, if it helps.

Just today, for example, a 16-year-old Swedish girl named Greta Thunberg addressed the United Nations at the behest of climate activists. Here's part of what she said:

Thunberg, climate change activist: This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school, on the other side of the ocean. Yet, you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you? You have stolen my dreams, my childhood with your empty words.

We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is the money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you? If you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil, and that I refuse to believe.

You stole my childhood? Do what I want you to do, or else you're evil?

How do you respond to statements like that? The truth is you can't respond. And of course, that's the point.

When you use children to demand power, they become a kind of human shield. You can hide safely behind them, no one can criticize you.

“He’s his own best spokesperson… also, he’s the most accessible president in history,” Grisham said of President Trump on “Fox & Friends.”

TRUMP SCOLDS CNN’S JIM ACOSTA, AS ANGEL MOMS CONFRONT REPORTER IN ROSE GARDEN: ‘YOU HAVE AN AGENDA’

Grisham was then asked if Trump’s frequent gaggles are the new form of press briefing, which previously consisted of press secretaries Sean Spicer and Sarah Sanders taking questions from sometimes-hostile reporters in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room.

“Ultimately, if the president decided it’s something we should do, we can do that, but right now he’s doing just fine and to be honest the briefings had become a lot of just theater,” she said. “I think that a lot of reporters were doing it to… get famous.”

“They’re writing books now, they’re all getting famous off of this presidency, so I think it’s great what we’re doing now,” Grisham added.

KELLYANNE CONWAY EMBARRASSES CNN’S JIM ACOSTA DURING HEATED EXCHANGE: 'YOU'RE SUCH A SMARTA--'

Grisham didn’t name names, but CNN White House reporter Jim Acosta has emerged as a household name for constantly sparring with members of the Trump administration when they are made available to the press.

Last year, Acosta was briefly banned from the White House after he engaged in a contentious back-and-forth with Trump and refused to pass the microphone to a female White House aide. He has since written a book about his time covering Trump.

CNN’s April Ryan, another White House reporter, also scuffled with Spicer and Sanders on a regular basis and wrote a book about it. ABC News White House reporter Jonathan Karl has a book about covering the Trump White House scheduled for 2020.

TRUMP SLAMS CNN’S ACOSTA FOR PRESS CONFERENCE PERFORMANCE: ‘YOU ARE A RUDE, TERRIBLE PERSON’

“Fox & Friends” co-host Brian Kilmeade then asked how Trump reacted to the way Spicer and Sanders were treated by critics such as NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” which pokes fun at members of the administration with unflattering impersonations on a regular basis.

“Absolutely, I think it’s so important that the spokesperson for the president can adequately speak to his policies and get his message out there. I think the president saw that that’s not what was happening,"" Grisham said. ""It had become, again, theater, and they weren’t being good to his people. He doesn’t like that. He’s very loyal to his people, and he put a stop to it.”"

Many users on Twitter were disturbed by Spicer’s stay in the competition, blasting DWTS as a “disgrace” for having Spicer on the show, and calling the former White House press secretary a “Nazi” while blaming “Trumpsters” for his advancement in the competition:

“#DWTS not watching you this year putting somebody like Sean Spicer on your show is an insult to the American people”

“but let’s be real spicer should have been sent home”

“Nope done with @abc after they put spicer on #DWTS”

“All the old Republican grandmas that watch Dancing With The Stars are gonna keep Sean Spicer on the show WAYYY longer then he should be huh? #DWTS”

“I want him to go back to his cocaine and hookers and get off my television. #DWTS is a disgrace for having him on. I tape the show and fast forward past him and Sean Spicer.”

“These “party over country” people have gone too fucking far. Voting to keep Sean Spicer on #DWTS ?? Absolutely shameful.”

“Sean Spicer? I’ll never again watch this show. #DWTS”

“But as we’ve all see with Sean “DWTS” Spicer, and Sarah “I’m now a Fox “News” Employee” Huckabee Sanders, they’re not being black balled as they should be.”

“Here’s your weekly reminder. Fuck Sean Spicer and the people who thought profiting off of his shittiness was a great idea. You took my favorite show away from me. #DWTS”

“Ugh. I’m watching DWTS as I grade and why is Sean #Nazi Spicer getting votes? #trumpsters”

Spicer told Breitbart News Sunday that he views his participation in DWTS as an opportunity to send a message to the Hollywood elites who typically snub right-leaning Americans.

“Hollywood largely shuns folks on the right. This is an opportunity to show that we’re human beings. We’re good people. We care about the country, that we’re out there,” Spicer said.

“And hopefully, it sends the message – especially if people get out there and vote – it really lets them know that there are people out there that aren’t just on the left that watch television and care about those causes– that you know people on both sides of the aisle are good people, that we care about this country and we can’t just shun one side of the political aisle,” he continued.

“I hope our side gets engaged out there and really, really sends a message that everybody deserves to go out and enjoy shows and have fun and that’s what the show’s all about,” he added.

Last week, Spicer released a lighthearted video, pledging to stand up for Americans “forgotten” due to their “lack [of] rhythm and moves.”

“For 28 years Dancing with the Stars has had plenty of great dancers full of rhythm and moves. This fall, let’s finally vote for someone who represents people like us,” the narrator stated in the video.

“I’m going to fight for every American who has been overlooked and forgotten because they lack rhythm and moves,” Spicer added:"

Elizabeth Warren is making a major television and digital ad buy to spread her message to potential primary voters.

Warren’s presidential campaign announced on Tuesday that the populist Democratic senator from Massachusetts, who’s released one progressive policy proposal after another through the primary campaign, will spend eight figures – or at least $10 million – to place spots on TV and on-line in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. Those are the first four states to vote on the primary and caucus calendar.

WARREN SURGING IN NEW 2020 POLLS IN NH, NEVADA, IOWA

“Right now, our biggest expense as a campaign is our staff, but as the campaign heats up, it will be on media to reach potential voters,” Warren campaign manager Roger Lau wrote in an email to supporters.

Lau explained that spots “will be more digital than old-school broadcast television, and we have built an in-house staff to produce videos and ads rather than adopt the consultant-driven approach of other campaigns (and the big commissions and fees that come along with it).”

The Warren campaign confirmed to Fox News that the digital ads would start running immediately, and that they’re currently reserving time for the TV commercials. Officials said the buy would last for several months.

The Warren campaign released three of the ads on Tuesday – 15-second, 30-second and one-minute spots.

“Take any of our big problems – health care, climate change, gun violence. Corruption is at the root of why our government won’t act,” Warren says in the 15-second ad. “I know what’s wrong. I know how to fix it. And I’ll fight to get it done.”

SANDERS UPS THE ANTE WITH WEALTH TAX HIGHER THAN WARREN'S PLAN

Lau also announced the campaign is continuing to expand its staffing. While Warren already has a formidable team in the four early-voting states, Lau spoke of ""hiring state directors and organizers in a number of states that have primaries and caucuses in March. And we're targeting our resources to invest in places that will be critical to keeping the House, taking back the U.S. Senate and regaining ground in key state legislatures in 2020.”

The $10 million ad buy and the expansion of campaign staff suggest that Warren’s fundraising remains strong. After a slow start earlier in the year, the senator hauled in over $19 million in the April-June second quarter of fundraising."

""It would start with a 1 percent tax on net worth above $32 million for a married couple. That means a married couple with $32.5 million would pay a wealth tax of just $5,000."

Bernie Sanders on Tuesday unveiled plans for a hefty tax on the ultra-rich that he says will  pay for several of his expensive social spending proposals, including part of ""Medicare for All.""",2019-09-24,CNN,Bernie Sanders rolls out wealth tax plan that would help fund 'Medicare for All',https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/24/politics/bernie-sanders-wealth-tax-proposal-medicare-for-all/index.html,"(CNN) Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday unveiled plans for a hefty tax on the ultra-rich that he says will pay for several of his expensive social spending proposals, including part of ""Medicare for All.""

Sanders, a Vermont independent, has come under fire from a number of his 2020 Democratic presidential primary rivals over the cost of his plans, which would run into the trillions of dollars. While he has maintained that the wealthy would foot the bill for most of those proposals, Sanders has acknowledged that the middle class would see their taxes rise to pay for Medicare for All. He says that many Americans would still come out ahead because they would no longer pay premiums or out-of-pocket bills for health care.

The new proposal was rolled out a day after Bloomberg reported that a polling firm associated with former Vice President Joe Biden had been studying which arguments against Medicare for All would be most effective with voters. One of its conclusions: the cost to taxpayers. Sanders responded to the news by insisting again that ""no one earning less than $29,000 will pay any new taxes"" under his plan, which he called ""a great deal for the American people.""

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has already unveiled plans to push for a similar wealth tax , which she often cites on the campaign trail -- to roaring approval from supporters -- as the potential source of funding for a series of ambitious programs. Sanders could be angling to establish a similar pitch, and respond to Biden, with a populist win-win proposal that pays for expensive new programs by soaking the rich.

Under Sanders' ""tax on extreme wealth,"" married couples worth more than $32 million would pay a 1% tax on their wealth above that threshold. The rate would rise to 2% on net worth between $50 million and $250 million, climbing in increments to a 8% tax on wealth above $10 billion.

The 30-second spot -- titled ""Your Choice"" -- heralds Buttigieg's ""Medicare for All Who Want It"" plan that would not force people onto government health coverage but instead would offer a public option for people who choose to enroll, a key distinction with the sweeping overhaul that would be instituted under a fully Medicare for All program.

""Providing every single American with quality health insurance isn't just my plan, it's our cause,"" Buttigieg says straight to the camera . ""Now, I go about it in a very different way than my competitors.""

The South Bend, Indiana, mayor goes on to tout how his plan ""gives everybody access to Medicare. Everybody. But, if you're happy with the private insurance you've got my plan would let you stick with it -- if you want.""

Bernie Sanders is preparing to renew his focus on early-voting states Iowa and New Hampshire, as frustrations grow inside his presidential campaign over slumping poll numbers and a series of taxing clashes between lower level staff and national leadership.

The campaign's in-house production team recently began shooting its first television ads of the 2020 cycle in Iowa, likely quieting at least one source of dissent among some senior aides, who have been pushing for Sanders to get on the air.

But concerns over the trajectory of Vermont independent's second presidential bid as new evidence emerges that Sen. Elizabeth Warren is beginning to peel away at his base are becoming more pronounced, along with a realization that a failure to launch in Iowa and New Hampshire could spell the campaign's early doom.

Sanders began his 2020 run dedicated to hammering away at the argument that he, more than any other Democrat, was best positioned to deny President Donald Trump a second term. But Sanders is no longer running as the party's lone progressive populist, as he did in 2016. Warren's emergence in that space, and the sense among some Democrats that she is a better bet to successfully unite the party than Sanders or Biden has altered the shape of the race.

The new dynamic came into sharp relief last weekend, when a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom survey showed Warren surging into the top tier in Iowa with former Vice President Joe Biden. Sanders, who was well off the pace in third, trailed her in the state by more than 10 points, 22% to 11%.

Perhaps more worrying to some Sanders supporters, the Massachusetts progressive also overtook her colleague from Vermont with what has traditionally been his most reliable bloc of support: voters under 35, among whom Warren now leads in Iowa, 27% to Sanders' 22%.

Asked by a reporter on Sunday about the poll, Sanders said the campaign's internal numbers painted a different picture. But even if the senator and his staff have reason to believe the Iowa race is closer than the most recent polling indicates, interviews with two senior aides to Sanders revealed growing concerns that the Hawkeye State and New Hampshire could be at risk of slipping away.

The twin sources of frustration and internal debate, both aides told CNN, was a schedule that too often takes Sanders away from the early voting states and a perception among staff, especially in Iowa, that the campaign has been wrong-headed in its decision to put off investing there in television ads.

""It can't be this national campaign anymore. He's got to go on TV in Iowa. He's got to park himself in Iowa. He's got to show that he's the underdog fighting back,"" one of the aides told CNN.

The aide, who said that staff in Iowa has been ""screaming for Bernie to get on TV"" there, suggested that Sanders had overestimated his strength in Iowa and New Hampshire.

""I think there was initially this sense of, which candidates always want to do, they want to expand,"" the aide said. ""And so I think there was a sense in the campaign, probably a little bit wrongly, that he had an Iowa and New Hampshire base and was going to focus on South Carolina and Nevada and California and expanding. And I think what this is showing is he's got to just go back to basics.""

In an interview, campaign manager Faiz Shakir brushed off criticism that Sanders has spent too much time building a national brand, along with the suggestion that it had cost him in those early states. He pointed to Sanders' recent travels in Oklahoma, North Carolina and Colorado as evidence that the campaign is prepared for the long haul.

""We have four fingers in the air,"" Shakir said, referencing the start of the fourth quarter of 2019. ""We are ready to finish strong and, with that, comes an adjustment in the time and attention we pay to certain parts of the map and that includes Iowa and New Hampshire.""

But Shakir conceded that the shrinking calendar meant the campaign's margin for error was diminishing too.

""The arguments that we have framed up for the public, they need to come through clearly in this next period of time,"" he said of Sanders' efforts in Iowa. ""I think delivering that message is absolutely critical here in the fourth quarter. We have put ourselves in a position to do very well.""

A second senior aide also indicated that a move to focus more on Iowa and New Hampshire was imminent. That doesn't mean Sanders plans to eschew future trips to join striking union workers outside those states, as he did this week, but that Iowa, where he kicked off his ""Bernie Beats Trump"" tour on Monday, is soon likely to serve as a de facto base of operations.

Shakir also told CNN that Sanders, after parting ways earlier this year with the firm that made his ads in 2016, has personally decided to use the campaign's in-house team to produce his first round of television spots. The group, a fixture on the trail with the Sanders, began shooting elements for its first TV ad this week. Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have already begun to run ads in the state. Warren on Tuesday announced a planned eight-figure TV and digital ad buy in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.

""We have a major advantage over other campaigns in that we have a lot more cash on hand,"" Shakir said of the campaign's approach to ad expenditures. ""You can use it correctly, or you can squander it. We are trying to stick to our strategy and make sure we are using our resources wisely.""

The back-and-forth over the campaign's media strategy has been pointed, but both of the senior aides who spoke to CNN touched on a more fundamental source of internal tension: the increasingly public disconnect between state level operations, most notably seen in New Hampshire, and the campaign's national leadership.

Those conflicts have been stoked, the aides said, by mostly lower level staffers, many of them Sanders loyalists from 2016 who have bristled at the 2020 leadership's tone and more exacting standards.

A progressive consultant familiar with the campaign's operation in New England told CNN that unsettled Sanders diehards pushed, successfully, for the ouster of former New Hampshire state director Joe Caiazzo, who was reassigned to Massachusetts. Caiazzo, who declined to comment, has been replaced by Shannon Jackson, a more familiar face who managed Sanders' 2018 Senate race.

According to a new poll from Monmouth released Tuesday, the campaign is facing increased headwinds in New Hampshire, where Warren -- as she did in Iowa -- has surged into the top-tier with Biden. Sanders, again, sits third with 12% to Warren's 27%.

The progressive consultant also said the campaign's internal politics were complicating efforts to broaden its appeal and forge alliances with outside grassroots groups.

""It's very confusing,"" the progressive consultant said of communications with the campaign. ""I have talked to people that hear from all of them -- that hear from (senior adviser) Chuck Rocha, that hear from (senior adviser) Jeff Weaver and that hear from Faiz. But my understanding is that if you want to get to Bernie, it's not Faiz that you go through. It's Weaver or (deputy campaign manager) Ari Rabin-Havt.""

For new groups only beginning to make sense of the progressive firmament, the process of sorting out the campaign hierarchy can be a turn-off -- especially when Warren's team has developed a reputation for proactively seeking out those less seasoned activists.

One of the senior Sanders aides conceded that the growing pains have been, at times, sharper than many expected. In 2016, the aide said, the absence at times of a coherent national operation meant that field staff had much more autonomy. The shakeup in New Hampshire, and lower level changes in Iowa, were largely instigated by internal arguments rooted in differing ideas about how to run a successful campaign without betraying the spirit of Sanders' first run.

Shakir conceded that there is a level of angst between staff at the local level and the national office. But he insisted that the decisions being made are part of a desire to see the vision of the candidate executed.

In the end, he argued, the campaign team -- from top to bottom -- needs to trust in Sanders' judgment.

""We all take our leadership and follow the direction of Bernie Sanders and he drives the strategy, and the argument of how we are going to win people over,"" Shakir said. ""I think to the extent that there's other people on campaign who have different views, I respect and appreciate that.

""But ultimately I believe strongly that we all take our guidance from the top -- and he is the one driving this train."""

Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden lead the Democratic field in New Hampshire, with 27% and 25% support respectively, according to a new poll of likely Democratic primary voters from Monmouth University on Tuesday.

In a close race for third place, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders received 12% in the poll, followed by South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg with 10%.

This is the fourth qualifying poll to show Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard with 2% support or higher, meaning she has now met both the polling and fundraising requirements to join the other 11 candidates who have qualified for the October Democratic presidential debate hosted by CNN and The New York Times.

California Sen. Kamala Harris got 3%, and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Gabbard, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, investor Tom Steyer and businessman Andrew Yang received 2% each. All other candidates received 1% or less in the New Hampshire poll.

In July, CNN's poll with the University of New Hampshire found Biden, Warren and Sanders clustered at the top of the field, with 24% for Biden, and 19% each for Warren and Sanders.

Warren saw a significant jump in support from Monmouth's last poll of New Hampshire in May, mirroring other recent polling showing her increasing her backing in Iowa and nationally. She is up 19 percentage points since the spring in the new poll, while Biden dropped 11 percentage points, and Sanders dipped 6 percentage points.

Since May, Warren's support among those who describe themselves as liberal has increased 28 percentage points, while Sanders' has dropped 13 percentage points and Biden's down 7.

Likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire continue to prioritize beating President Donald Trump (61%) over voting for someone they agree with completely but who would have a hard time beating him (27%).

But most seem to think they can have it all if their choice wins the nomination. Almost 7 in 10 likely Democratic voters in New Hampshire said their candidate is the one they agree with the most, and over half (52%) said their candidate has the best chance against the president.

Warren holds the best favorability rating with 74% of likely New Hampshire voters who have a favorable opinion of the Massachusetts senator, 19% unfavorable. Biden's is down since May, with 66% who said they had a favorable opinion, 24% unfavorable, while Sanders receives 63% favorable, 28% unfavorable.

The Monmouth University Poll was conducted by telephone from September 17 to 21, 2019 with 401 New Hampshire voters who are likely to vote in the Democratic presidential primary in February 2020. Results among likely Democratic primary voters have a margin of error of +/- 4.9 percentage points."

Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden are virtually deadlocked in a close race for the Democratic presidential nomination, according to a new national poll out Wednesday from Quinnipiac University.

The poll shows Warren at 27% and Biden at 25% among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, and is the first major national poll to show Warren in this strong a position since polling in Iowa and New Hampshire also found the two knotted at the top of the field. Although the difference between the candidates' numbers is within the poll's margin of error, the Massachusetts Democrat's new ranking is the first time a candidate other than the former vice president has topped the pack since Quinnipiac started posing the question in March.

The two candidates also saw change in support from the poll's August results, when Biden was at 32% and Warren was at 19%.

The poll reflects a tightening Democratic race as well as Warren's increasing consolidation of the progressive vote and making inroads among black voters. Her support among that crucial demographic bloc has climbed dramatically in recent months, from 4% in July to 8% in August to 19% now. Biden's support among black voters, meanwhile, has dipped from 53% to 40% over the same time. The numbers signal a potential softening in a key base for Biden's campaign, as well as an ability for Warren to grow support beyond white college-educated liberals.

In the new poll, Warren and Biden are followed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (16%), South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (7%) and California Sen. Kamala Harris (3%). All other candidates got 2% or lower in the poll.

""I think Congress needs to exercise oversight over the information that's been leaked. I think it's important this transcript is released to Congress so that Congress can do its job.""

The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, in the past, has cautioned against impeaching Trump. Her comments on Tuesday came shortly before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry into the President.

Forty-two percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers said they want to continue the state's caucus system, which has traditionally made the Hawkeye State the center of the early months of presidential campaigns, even if it means not everyone who wants to can participate. Iowa's status as the first state where voters weigh in on who the parties will nominate to run for the White House has given it special importance in the campaign as many candidates choose to spend much of their time meeting voters in diners and house parties across a state that demands face-to-face interactions with the candidates.

However, that tradition has been questioned in recent years and now 44% of likely Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa say they're in favor of switching to a primary, even if it risks Iowa's status as the first contest of the nominating season. Advocates for a primary argue it would increase access to the voting process because it wouldn't require hours of participation in the same way that a caucus does.

Voters in Iowa who spoke to CNN after taking the poll saw pros and cons to both sides of the argument, but many mentioned how much they enjoy the ability to meet candidates and the unique opportunity that is provided to them.

""I've had the chance to meet just about every presidential candidate throughout my life, since I was 11. That's awesome,"" likely Iowa caucusgoer Allie Paarsmith told CNN. ""I know how lucky I am. We just wouldn't get that sort of attention otherwise, it brings people to the Midwest. It would be sad to see a Midwestern state lose that first in the nation status.""

(CNN) The Democratic National Committee just announced the debate criteria for November. As expected, it has modestly raised the bar again, asking for candidates to meet a slightly higher polling and donor threshold than the last debates. But like my elderly cat when we got a slightly taller box spring, some candidates just can't make the leap.

And yet, we are hearing a lot of meowing of protest from the field. Candidates have said they are being forced to adjust their campaign strategies away from winning votes to meet these benchmarks; party insiders are saying the benchmarks are excluding highly credentialed voices in favor of celebrity candidates; and down-ballot Democrats are complaining the donor threshold is taking much-needed money away from their races.

But first, let's be clear that Democratic primary voters want to narrow the field. Generally speaking, a larger and more fractured field tends to benefit some front-runners (Joe Biden) while disadvantaging others (Elizabeth Warren). And, of course, no candidate left off the stage is going to praise a system that torpedoed his campaign, but even those candidates know they can't get their message across with 24 people on the stage. This is all to say, there is no solution to make everyone happy.

The Republican National Committee experienced much the same problem in 2016 and some of us would argue blew it in far more epic fashion. (Full disclosure: I worked for Carly Fiorina during 2016 and was watching the March debate from my hotel room as a handful of dudes tossed around not-so-veiled references to the size of their penises .) My point being that we should at least give the DNC credit for trying to trim the fat with a scalpel instead of the RNC's machete that arbitrarily set and reset qualifications each month based solely on poll numbers.

Even so, I am not the first to point out that there's something wrong here . Polling and fundraising don't measure whether someone will be a good president -- or even a good candidate. And incentivizing your candidates to spend money to meet those thresholds doesn't move the ball down the field for the party or the eventual nominee.

And of course, there's the absurdity of putting that much stock in national name recognition whereby the only way for your candidate to get exposure to tens of millions of viewers during the debate is to have high national poll numbers, which more often than not are simply a reflection of name recognition among voters who have already been exposed to that candidate. Captain Yossarian would be proud.

It's almost as if you'd be better off if you'd starred on a hit reality TV show for years instead of served as a governor or run a Fortune 50 company.

Defenders of the system, though, would say it's working. We started with 20 debaters, and by November, we may be down to eight

But here's the problem. If we had whittled the field too quickly in 1991, there would have been no President Clinton. By July of 1991, he had a polling average of only 1.7% -- in a tie for 13th place with Jay Rockefeller. As Nate Silver has pointed out , in two of the past nine cycles, the eventual Democratic nominee was not even in the top 10 by July -- and both Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton went on to win the presidency the next year.

So here's an alternative I'm proposing to the DNC:

The top three polling candidates according to an average of qualifying national polls get an automatic ticket to the stage. In the end, this is still our closest approximation to votes. But why should this be coupled with fundraising? If you're a great, progressive candidate who has managed to capture the support of 20% of your party's supporters without creating an enormous money machine, you have perhaps all the more reason to be on that stage.

Any candidate with a million individual donors gets a ticket. The goal of this metric isn't to reward a big fundraising haul but to measure support that may not be showing up in the polls. The threshold, therefore, must be meaningful and high. Bernie Sanders is the only candidate to hit this number so far. But by way of example, if Sanders were polling at only 2% nationwide, would the DNC really want to exclude a guy with a million high-enthusiasm Democratic voters who presumably has a uniquely powerful message that is resonating with those who have heard it?

Any candidate with more than 15% support when the same polling averages are weighted for name recognition would be on the stage. Silver has a nice chart on adjusted polling averages here. But in short, if two candidates both have 5% in the latest poll but Candidate A's names is familiar to 80% of voters and Candidate B is known by only 30% of voters, we would assume Candidate B would poll higher than Candidate A if all voters knew who both of them were. So you would ""weight"" that poll by multiplying their support as if they had the same name recognition as the most well-known candidate (Biden). Suddenly, Candidate B would have a weighted polling average just over 15%. Side note: It boggles my mind why this hasn't already happened. If voters haven't heard your message because you're, let's say, the governor of Montana without a lot of national airtime, why would the party want to limit your only chance to reach a broader audience with how you've succeeded in implementing progressive policies? And on the flip side, if you are a celebrity politician with near-universal name recognition among voters but only 4% support in a poll, do we really need to hear more?

These rules would have ensured Clinton made the stage in 1991. Ironically, it also would have excluded Biden in 2007 (along with Dennis Kucinich, Wesley Clark and Chris Dodd, among others).

And what of 2020? Of course, it's impossible to say for sure because the candidates would have run their campaigns differently if the DNC rules had been, well, different. Like those who talk about the popular vote versus the Electoral College, you can't rerun the game with different rules and assume the same inputs.

But as of July, the field would have been narrowed to Biden, Sanders, Kamala Harris, Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke. And given how close Cory Booker and Andrew Yang would have been to the cutoff, it seems fair to assume they would have tweaked their strategies to get to an adjusted 5% as well.

Funny enough, it's the same eight who will probably be on the stage come November. But it sure sounds a lot fairer, doesn't it?"

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) held a campaign event in Decorah, Iowa, on Monday and agreed with a woman who suggested that Americans are brainwashed into embracing the traditional American dream and capitalism, telling the crowd that she is “exactly right.”

Sanders held an event in the Luther College gymnasium and took a remark from an attendee, who suggested that Americans are brainwashed into believing in the American dream and capitalism.

“I think that the kind of brainwashing – the idea at least that I grew up with – is that our definition of success is like the American dream and great capitalism,” she said.

“You’re rewarded for getting everything and just keeping it to yourself and not worrying about everybody else,” she continued.

“That’s sort of like the psychology that we’ve all been taught. Well, not everyone, but a lot of people have been taught that that’s the American way, so I think that has something to do with it,” she added.

Sanders did not push back, adamantly agreeing with the attendee and calling her remarks “exactly right.”

“It’s a profound point,” the socialist senator added.

On Tuesday, Sanders unveiled a massive redistribution scheme in the form of an “extreme wealth tax,” which would tax the wealthy on their assets, starting with a one percent tax on couples with a net worth over $32 million:

The tax rate would increase to 2 percent on net worth from $50 to $250 million, 3 percent from $250 to $500 million, 4 percent from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent from $1 to $2.5 billion, 6 percent from $2.5 to $5 billion, 7 percent from $5 to $10 billion, and 8 percent on wealth over $10 billion.

Sanders openly expressed his desire to diminish the wealth of the rich, noting that billionaires “would be cut in half over 15 years” and lamenting their existence in a tweet which read, “Billionaires should not exist”:

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) declared on Tuesday that “billionaires should not exist” as part of the rollout of his massive proposal to redistribute wealth in America via an “extreme wealth” tax, which he claims will “reduce the outrageous level of inequality that exists in America today.”

Sanders unveiled his plan to redistribute wealth in the U.S. via an “extreme wealth tax,” which the socialist senator says will apply to the “top 0.1 percent.” While Sanders’ plan is reminiscent of Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) proposed wealth tax, it goes even further, taxing more individuals at even higher rates.

For example, Sanders proposes to implement a one percent tax on couples with a net worth over $32 million. The percentage increases alongside the value of assets:

The tax rate would increase to 2 percent on net worth from $50 to $250 million, 3 percent from $250 to $500 million, 4 percent from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent from $1 to $2.5 billion, 6 percent from $2.5 to $5 billion, 7 percent from $5 to $10 billion, and 8 percent on wealth over $10 billion.

“These brackets are halved for singles,” Sanders explains.

The socialist senator admits the goal of his ultra-progressive redistribution proposal, boasting that — under his plan — the wealth of billionaires “would be cut in half over 15 years” and declaring that “billionaires should not exist”:

Billionaires should not exist. https://t.co/hgR6CeFvLa — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 24, 2019

There should be no billionaires. We are going to tax their extreme wealth and invest in working people. Read the plan: https://t.co/RJDLvX5H4c — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 24, 2019

Sanders’ proposal would also spur the creation of a “national wealth registry” and provide an “increase in IRS funding” in order to manage a swell of new audits.

It states:

In order to ensure that the wealthy are not able to evade the tax, the proposal includes a number of key enforcement policies. First, it would create a national wealth registry and significant additional third party reporting requirements. Second, it includes an increase in IRS funding for enforcement and requires the IRS to perform an audit of 30 percent of wealth tax returns for those in the 1 percent bracket and a 100 percent audit rate for all billionaires. Third, the wealth tax includes a 40 percent exit tax on the net value of all assets under $1 billion and 60 percent over $1 billion for all wealthy individual seeking to expatriate to avoid the tax. Finally, the wealth tax proposal will include enhancements to the international tax enforcement and anti-money laundering regime including the strengthening of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.

The presidential candidate argues the U.S. already taxes inherited wealth via the estate tax and says his proposal is constitutional, citing two Yale law professors, Bruce Ackerman and Anne Alstott, who have expressed support for the radical concept. Sanders adds that it is “not radical” to ask the wealthy to “pay their fair share.”

His proposal is expected to result in $4.5 trillion over the next decade, according to University of California, Berkeley, economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. Nonetheless, that number does not come close to paying for his expansive, expensive proposals, such as his $16 trillion Green New Deal proposal or Medicare for All, which could — by some estimates — cost the U.S. over $60 trillion over the next decade alone.

Sanders’ ideological ally, Warren, has also introduced a wealth tax, although it does not go as far. She proposes implementing a two percent wealth tax on those with $50 million in assets, as opposed to Sanders’ $32 million. Warren’s plan increases the tax to three percent for those with assets of $1 billion or greater, with no distinction between couples or single filers. She, like Sanders, plans to fund her costly proposals via the wealth tax, although Saez and Zucman estimate that her proposal would result in $2.6 trillion over the next decade, $1.9 trillion less than Sanders’ proposal.

“If we make the top 0.1% pay their fair share in taxes, their quality of life would not change at all,” Sanders tweeted following the announcement of his redistribution scheme.

“But we would be able to invest in housing, child care and health care and improve the lives of millions of working people,” he added:"

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced on Tuesday the launch of an official impeachment inquiry, using the whistleblower complaint as a launching point. This follows months of far-left “Squad” members pushing impeachment and Pelosi’s continuous stiff-arming of such efforts.

“I’m announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry,” Pelosi announced at a Capitol Hill press conference.

“I am directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry,” she said.

“The President must be held accountable. No one is above the law,” she continued, citing the Founding Fathers.

“Getting back to our founders, in the darkest days of the American Revolution, Thomas Paine wrote that times have found us, that times found them to fight for and establish our democracy,” she added. “The times have found us today”:

Nancy Pelosi: ""Therefore today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry."" pic.twitter.com/HyHKD39N7M — Axios (@axios) September 24, 2019

Several 2020 Democrat candidates called for the inquiry prior to Pelosi’s announcement.

“This isn’t a partisan issue—or shouldn’t be,” Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) tweeted. “When the president of the United States is working with other countries to interfere with our elections, we should begin impeachment proceedings.”

“It was true when I said it in 2017 running for Senate in Texas and it’s still true today: President Trump should be impeached,” former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D) added.

“The House must impeach. It must start today,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wrote.

Noticeably absent though, was Sanders. While he believes that “impeachable offenses” exist, he signaled that Democrats may be acting too hastily and would not say if he would support the impeachment effort if it made it to the Senate.

“Here’s the dilemma that you have,” Sanders told reporters in Iowa on Tuesday, according to BuzzFeed News. “Now I don’t know — I’ll tell you that my gut is that the average Republican in the Senate and the House is totally intimidated by President Trump.”

“And at this particular point, I have my doubts, like you all. I have my doubts that any Republican, or very few, would vote against him,” he continued, detailing his fear. Sanders worries that – in the event that the impeachment effort gets passed on to the Senate – which would require a two-thirds majority (or 67 votes) – it would fail and Trump would claim vindication as a result.

“I know and you know what [Trump] will do: ‘I am vindicated! … I am vindicated!’ And I think that is a fact that has to be taken into consideration,” Sanders said, according to BuzzFeed.

“But what do you do when you have a president who has acted in an unconstitutional way? If that is the findings,” Sanders continued. “Again, I don’t want to judge it. I think that is the face. But there is a process that has to take place.”

Sanders reiterated that he believes there are impeachable offenses, and he has signaled such before, floating an inquiry in May:

It is obvious that the President is a pathological liar who does not understand the Constitution. The fact is that if Mr. Trump continues to disregard the right of Congress to subpoena, he will leave House Members with no choice but to begin an impeachment inquiry. — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) May 23, 2019

“I believe that there are impeachable offenses. That’s my view. But my view is not good enough,” Sanders said, according to BuzzFeed News.

“I happen to believe that there are grounds to do it. But you have to lay it out,” Sanders explained, refusing to reveal his thoughts on the controversy surrounding Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine.

“I know I’m a little bit old-fashioned. I like to see the evidence before I talk about things. I read the papers and I read what I read,” Sanders said. “But I don’t know that I know enough at this point to make any definitive statement.”

Fellow presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has taken her position on impeachment farther than Sanders, telling CNN’s Newsroom on Tuesday that impeachment would “further tear apart an already divided country.”

“Impeachment is something — that is a step that will divide the country and will be worse off for our country,” she said."

The swipes signal what could be a newly aggressive phase for the Vermont senator's campaign, with a hitherto ""truce"" between him and Warren beginning to crack as his polling numbers suffer. One progressive strategist with ties to the independent senator’s campaign said that when it comes to negating Warren’s surge in the polls, the Sanders team has been “flailing around.”

WARREN SURGES IN LATEST POLLS, TIES BIDEN FOR TOP SPOT; SANDERS SLIPS TO DISTANT THIRD

Sanders and Warren met last December before they launched their presidential bids and agreed to not criticize each other while on the campaign trail. That non-aggression-style pact has largely held – with both teaming up at recent presidential debates to defend their ""Medicare-for-all"" proposals.

And both had refrained from attacking each other.

“Bernie and I have been friends for many, many years. Long before I ever got into politics. And I don’t see any reason that that should change,” Warren told reporters recently after being asked if she was going to start painting contrasts with Sanders.

Sanders – who’s making his second straight White House run – has repeatedly said when asked about Warren that “Elizabeth is a friend of mine” and noting that the two “have been friends for over 20 years.”

But that’s apparently not stopping some leading members of Sanders' team from taking aim at Warren.

The Sanders campaign’s national press secretary Briahna Joy Gray recently criticized Warren on Twitter for failing to support Sanders’ national rent control proposal. Warren has said she doesn’t think such a policy would be realistic across the country. Gray used Warren’s viral zinger from the July debate in targeting the senator from Massachusetts.

Gray also jabbed at Warren over her campaign's lack of a collective bargaining agreement with her staff since recognizing her campaign workers’ union in June.

Sanders also faced a bit of criticism as he met the demands from his own unionized campaign staff.

In another case, senior Sanders adviser Warren Gunnels took aim at Warren’s climate change plan. As Vox noted, Gunnels retweeted a tweet from a New York City councilman saying that Warren had “missed the mark.”

As they were battling for second place in the polls most of the summer, the Sanders campaign repeatedly insisted that former Vice President Joe Biden was the main target. The former vice president was the clear front-runner in nearly all polling from his entry into the race in late April until recent days, when a slew of new surveys suggested that Warren had tied Biden for the top spot.

WARREN LANDS BACKING OF PROGRESSIVE GROUP THAT ENDORSED SANDERS IN HIS 2016 PRESIDENTIAL BID

While Sanders kept his focus on Biden, Warren surged in polling and, in a well-publicized moment, she landed the endorsement of the progressive group the Working Families Party, which backed Sanders four years ago in his first White House bid. Meanwhile, Sanders in recent weeks has replaced a couple of key staffers in Iowa and New Hampshire, the states that kick off the presidential primary and caucus calendar.

“They thought their opponent was Biden because they thought he was the next Hillary Clinton,” noted the progressive strategist, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely.

The strategist argued that the Sanders campaign failed to realize that Warren was the real threat, spotlighting that “their strategy was wrong. They were looking at Biden as the main opponent when it was really Warren.”"

Bernie Sanders on Tuesday unveiled a massive tax on the wealthiest Americans that aims to diminish income inequality -- a central theme of his campaign -- and at least begin to finance the steep price tags for the numerous government programs the Democratic presidential candidate is proposing.

The release of the independent senator from Vermont's ‘Tax on Extreme Wealth’ follows a similar plan from one of his top rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination, fellow progressive and populist lawmaker Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

“There should be no billionaires. We are going to tax their extreme wealth and invest in working people,” Sanders said on Twitter as he urged supporters to read his new plan. His campaign also sent an email under the subject line: ""Billionaires should not exist.""

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

In his decades in Congress and during both of his runs for the White House, Sanders has railed against an American economic system that he says favors corporations and the rich, at the expense of the working class.

Sanders' plan, if enacted into law, would place a 1 percent tax on net worth over $32 million, a 2 percent tax on net worth between $50 million and $250 million, and a 3 percent tax on net worth between $250 million and $500 million. The proposed Sanders tax would increase to 4 percent net worth from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent for net worth from $1 billion to $2.5 billion, and ultimately reach 8 percent for wealth over $10 billion.

The Sanders campaign says their plan would impact approximately 180,000 households nationwide, and would raise about $4.35 trillion in government revenue by the 2028 budget year.

“Our tax on extreme wealth would only apply to the wealthiest households in America and would cut the wealth of billionaires in half over 15 years, which would substantially break up the concentration of wealth and power of this small, privileged class,” Sanders said in an email to supporters announcing his plan.

And he said that he would “use the revenue to fund our affordable housing plan, universal childcare, and help fund our work to guarantee health care as a right for every man, woman, and child in this country.""

The Republican National Committee criticized Sanders, with spokesman Michael Joyce arguing that “no matter how many new taxes Bernie proposes, it still won’t come even close to covering the costs of Bernie’s socialist pie-in-the-sky policy proposals.”

Warren’s plan – which she unveiled at the beginning of the year-- by comparison would place a 2 percent annual tax on net worth above $50 million and would slap a 3 percent tax on net worth above $1 billion.

Her campaign says it would affect the top 70,000 households in the county and would bring in an estimated $2.6 trillion over 10 years.

Sanders, in order “ensure that the wealthy are not able to evade the tax,” is calling for creating a national registry and beefing up third-party reporting requirements, increasing funding for the Internal Revenue Service and requiring the IRS to perform audits of 30 percent of those in the 1 percent bracket and audits of all billionaires.

He’s also calling for a 40 percent exit tax on the net value of all assets under $1 billion and a steeper 60 percent on assets over $1 billion “for all wealthy individuals seeking to expatriate to avoid the tax.”

President Trump’s re-election campaign took aim at Sanders, not specifically over his new plan but for vows by the senator and the rest of the Democratic field to repeal the tax cuts passed in 2017 by the then-GOP controlled Congress and signed into law by the president.

“By repealing President Trump’s tax cuts, Sanders and the rest of the Democrats would raise taxes on almost all Americans, not just the very rich,” campaign spokesperson Erin Perrine said."

WARREN EDGES BIDEN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE POLL, GAINS GROUND IN NEVADA

Warren – the populist senator who’s pushed out one progressive policy proposal after another – stands at 27 percent among Democratic voters and independents who lean Democratic in a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday morning, with the former vice president commanding 25 percent. Warren’s two-point edge is well within the survey’s margin of error.

Warren has surged 8 percentage points since Quinnipiac’s previous national poll, which was conducted late last month, with Biden -- long considered the frontrunner in the race -- dropping seven points.

Sanders, the independent populist longtime lawmaker who’s making his second straight White House bid, stands at 16 percent in the new survey, basically unchanged from last month.

""After trailing Biden by double digits since March in the race for the Democratic nomination, Warren catches Biden,"" Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said. ""We now have a race with two candidates at the top of the field, and they’re leaving the rest of the pack behind.""

Going beyond the poll’s topline numbers, Malloy noted that if you “dig a little deeper…the reasons behind Warren's rise become more clear. She generates a lot of excitement as a potential nominee. On top of that, half of Democrats want a presidential candidate that supports big changes - even if it means things are harder along the way.""

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg stands at 7 percent in the new Quinnipiac poll, with Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 3 percent. Everyone else in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential contenders registered at 2 percent or less.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Many political analysts downplay the results of national polls, pointing to the fact the race for the presidential nomination is a battle for the states and their delegates to the parties' nominating conventions. But the Quinnipiac results follow similar findings in polls released the past couple of days in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, the first three states to vote in the presidential primary and caucus nominating calendar.

Warren stands at 27 percent among likely Democratic presidential primary voters in New Hampshire in a Monmouth University survey released Tuesday, with Biden at 25 percent. Warren’s 2-point edge is well within that survey’s sampling error. Sanders is in third in the poll, at 12 percent.

A couple of hours after the release of the Monmouth poll in New Hampshire, a new survey in Nevada, which holds its caucus following the New Hampshire primary, also indicates a close contest between Biden and Warren.

A USA Today/Suffolk University survey put Biden at 23 percent, Warren at 19 percent and Sanders at 14 percent.

And in Iowa, a Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll released this past weekend indicated Warren at 22 percent, Biden at 20 percent and Sanders a distant third at 11 percent. The Des Moines Register surveys have long been considered the gold standard in Iowa polling.

The release of the surveys come as Warren’s campaign on Tuesday announced they’re spending a whopping $10-million to run digital and TV ads over the next few months in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, which votes fourth in the nominating calendar and holds the first southern primary.

WARREN DISHING OUT $10 MILLION TO RUN DIGITAL AND TV ADS IN ALL FOUR EARLY VOTING STATES

The release of these new live telephone operator polls comes with just over four months to go until the first votes in Iowa. But that can be an eternity in campaign politics.

Warren continues to downplay her surge in the surveys, telling reporters a few days ago that, “I don’t do polls. We are still months away from the Iowa caucuses and the first primary elections.”

The pollsters agree. Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray noted that “it is important to keep in mind that the race is still very much in flux.”

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted September 19-23, with 1,337 registered voters nationwide – including 561 self-described Democratic voters independents who lean towards the Democrats – questioned by telephone. The sampling error for the survey Democratic nomination questions is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points."

Gabbard garnered 2 percent support in a Monmouth University poll in New Hampshire published Tuesday, placing her at four DNC-sanctioned surveys where she enjoyed at least two percent support. The Hawaii congresswoman hit the other DNC debate threshold, which requires candidates score over 130,000 campaign donors.

In addition to Gabbard, other 2020 White House hopefuls participating in the October debate are: former vice president Joe Biden, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Cory Booker (D-NJ), South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Rep. Robert Francis “Beto” Rourke, billionaire climate crusader Tom Steyer, and technology entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

The next debate, co-hosted by the New York Times and CNN, is scheduled for October 15th in Westerville, Ohio.

News of Gabbard’s inclusion in the fourth debate comes one day after the DNC announced intensified requirements for candidates to clinch a spot at the fifth debate in November. White House hopefuls will need to garner at 3 percent or higher in four polls or at least 5 percent in a pair of early-state polls as well as enjoys the support of 165,000 campaign donors."

""I've just never met anyone that said 'Please, Joe Biden, I want him to be president', and there's an enthusiasm gap that he suffers from. He just can't get people to a Biden rally,"" he said contrasting Biden's rally turnout to President Trump's significantly larger campaign crowds in 2016.

""Look at the way Trump did it... when he wasn't on top of the polls he would show up with a couple tweets -- I remember he showed up in Las Vegas with like 25,000 people showing up and you don't see that organically on the Democratic side.

JIMMY CARTER SAYS HE HOPES 'THERE'S AN AGE LIMIT FOR PRESIDENCY' IN APPARENT JAB AT BIDEN, SANDERS

Biden’s been largely brushing off criticism that he’s too old for the Oval Office. Earlier this month, he told reporters he’ll prove his fitness through the grinding process that is the presidential campaign trail, and pledged to release his medical records when he gets his ""next physical” before the voting begins next February in the Iowa caucuses.

Former President Jimmy Carter, 95, also weighed in on the issue, saying he couldn't have handled the presidency at 80 years old during his term as the 39th U.S. president from 1977 until 1981, when he was in his 50s.

BRIT HUME CALLS BIDEN'S CONDITION 'WORRISOME'

Speaking during his annual report at the Carter Center in Atlanta, Ga., last week, Carter said he hopes ""there's an age limit"" to serving in one of the most powerful positions in the world.

“If I were just 80 years old, if I was 15 years younger, I don’t believe I could undertake the duties I experienced when I was president,"" he told the crowd.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has surged and now enjoys a slight 2-point advantage over former Vice President Joe Biden, the longtime front-runner in the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

The Monmouth University survey, released Tuesday, also shows Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont fading to a distant third.

WARREN EDGES OUT BIDEN IN NEW IOWA POLL, SANDERS DISTANT THIRD

Warren stands at 27 percent among likely Democratic presidential primary voters in the state, with Biden at 25 percent. Warren’s 2-point edge is well within the survey’s sampling error.

Warren’s support has soared by 19 points from the previous Monmouth poll in the Granite State, which was conducted in May. Biden’s dropped 11 points from that survey.

Sanders, meanwhile, is in third in the new poll, at 12 percent, dropping 6 points from Monmouth’s May survey.

New Hampshire, which votes second in the presidential nominating calendar following the Iowa caucuses, is considered by many political analysts and pundits as a must-win for both Sanders and Warren.

The independent senator from Vermont crushed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire, launching the one-time longshot for the nomination into a marathon battle against the eventual nominee. He’s retained a strong organization and devoted supporters in the state as he bids a second time for the White House.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

But Warren, who like Sanders hails from a neighboring state to New Hampshire, has also built up a powerful campaign organization in the Granite State, and has made numerous visits. Warren will return to the state to hold town halls on Wednesday and Friday.

“Warren continues to look stronger with every new poll. She seems to be picking up support across the spectrum with gains coming at the expense of both Biden and Sanders,” said Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray.

The surge from Warren is coming from self-described liberals, among whom she’s up 28 points since the May poll to stand at 39 percent, with Sanders dropping 13 points down to 16 percent. Warren’s also risen 11 points among self-described moderate and conservative voters to stand at 18 percent, with Biden dropping 15 points to stand at 30 percent.

According to the poll, the only other candidate to register in double digits is South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who’s at 10 percent, slightly behind Sanders.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California stands at 3 percent in the survey, with Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, billionaire philanthropist and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii each at 2 percent. The remaining 10 candidates tested in the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls earned 1 percent or less in the poll.

The Monmouth poll in New Hampshire is one of the qualifying surveys the Democratic National Committee uses for their polling thresholds for candidates to make the cut for the primary debates. Gabbard’s 2 percent showing in the new poll means she’s reached 2 percent in four qualifying polls, allowing her to make the stage at next month’s fourth round of nomination debates.

The poll’s findings are similar to those of the latest poll in Iowa this past weekend. A Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom survey indicated Warren at 22 percent, Biden at 20 percent and Sanders a distant third at 11 percent. The Des Moines Register surveys have long been considered the gold standard in Iowa polling.

A new poll released Tuesday in Nevada, which holds it's caucus following the New Hampshire primary, also indicates a close contest between Biden and Warren.

A USA Today/Suffolk University survey puts Biden at 23 percent, Warren at 19 percent and Sanders at 14 percent.

The most recent polls in New Hampshire have been all over the board, with one suggesting Sanders holding a lead; another indicating a three-way tie among Biden, Warren and Sanders; and a third pointing to Sanders trailing Biden and Warren.

The Monmouth University poll was conducted from Sept. 17-21, among 401 New Hampshire voters likely to vote in next February’s Democratic presidential primary questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s sampling error is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.

The poll’s release comes with four-and-a-half months to go until the New Hampshire primary.

""Some of these people who are denying climate change — they're going to be dead and they don't care apparently about their grandchildren. They only care about their 401k's,"" Behar argued.

For Huntsman, Behar's statement went too far. She argued that it wasn't ""fair to say that they don't care about their own grandkids.""

""That's what it looks like to me,"" Behar shot back. She later indicated she would continue ""guilt-tripping"" people over the issue.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has overtaken Joe Biden and zoomed into first place nationally, according to polling from the far-left Quinnipiac.

Since polling of the 2020 Democrat primary began, and since he announced his candidacy, former Vice President Joe Biden had held a stubbornly wide lead against all comers.

That lead is now gone.

Thanks to a 15 point swing, Quinnipiac now has Warren leading Biden 27 to 25 percent. That is an eight point jump since August for Warren and a seven point collapse for Biden.

The only other contender who’s close is Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VA), with 16 points.

Still chugging along in single digits, despite more positive news coverage than anyone not named Barry Obama, is South Bend, IN, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, with just seven percent support.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) is DOA with just three percent support. She has lost four points, more than half of her support, since August.

The Quinnipiac poll, which surveyed 1,337 registered voters between September 19-23, does not appear to be an outlier. An Emerson poll conducted between September 19-23 of 462 Democrat primary voters, showed Biden with 25 percent national support, while Warren nips at his heels at 23 percent. Sanders is right there with 22 percent, which basically makes the national race a three-way tie.

In those two most recent national polls, Robert Francis “Paddy” O’Rourke, has hit bottom with 1 and 2 percent support, which puts him behind some guy named Andrew Yang.

In the Real Clear Politics poll of national Democrat primary polls, Biden enjoys an eight point lead over his rivals. But that lead was once closer to 20 points. Over the summer, the erosion has been slow and steady.

The same is true in the early primary states.

In the latest two polls out of Iowa, where the first voting begins in that state’s caucus on February 3, Warren leads by eight and two points.

In New Hampshire, which votes on February 11, Warren is ahead by two points in the latest poll.

In Nevada, the third primary state, Biden’s lead has slipped to just four points.

What’s happening in the fourth primary state, South Carolina, which is supposed to be Biden’s firewall, we just don’t know. There hasn’t been any polling there since early August. The older polls show Biden with a 20-plus point lead.

Does all of this mean Warren is the new frontrunner?

No.

What it means is what I’ve been saying all along: summer is over and the race has officially begun.

Over the summer, as rank-and-file Democrats did what all Americans do — fish, swim, camp, run the kids around, vacation, go to the movies, barbecue, picnic — they parked their votes on Biden. But now that the kids are back in school, they are taking a closer look at who’s out there and, finally, they are seeing that Joe Biden is no longer Joe Biden.

While Biden was never anything close to a good campaigner, now that he’s 188 years-old, he is even worse. Already, his eyes has exploded, his teeth have come loose, and he’s lost his train of thought too many times to count. Joe Biden is an old, old man. He’s frail when a president must be virile.

On top of that, unlike Trump, no one has to lie to prove Biden is a racist.

So now that the race has finally begun, people are giving Warren a serious look. In the past, though, whenever she has been under the spotlight, Warren has dissolved into a puddle of neuroses, so we will have to see how she does now. What’s more, she has a huge problem with attracting black voters, which might have something to do with this whiter-than-white woman having spent decades impersonating an American Indian in order to advance her academic and political careers.

During her own five days in the sun over the summer, Kamala Harris completely melted down, but there is still a chance voters might give her a second shot.

Whatever happens, an objective look at the Democrat field tells you why House Democrats are pursuing impeachment of President Trump. This is a very weak and extreme group, and Democrats know that without a recession, Trump will probably win a second term against any one of these extremists.

He smeared Ilhan Omar. He smeared San Francisco. He denied the existence of an obvious delay in military aid to Ukraine. He denied that the name of the Democratic Party is the Democratic Party. He confused champion mountain climbers by claiming that champion mountain climbers had tried and failed to climb his border wall.

President Donald Trump made 79 false claims last week, mixing some fresh false accusations and pointlessly false anecdotes into his usual stew of repeat favorites.

Seventy-nine false claims is down from 90 the week prior to last , Trump's highest total since we started counting at CNN on July 8, but it was still his fourth-most-dishonest of these 11 weeks. His weekly average since July 8 is now 59 false claims.

Trump made 29 of last week's 79 false claims at his campaign rally in New Mexico. He made 13 more in his White House meeting and press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, seven on Twitter. The rest came in a smattering of events, interviews and exchanges with reporters.

Twenty-seven of the false claims were about the economy, 15 about Democrats.

The most egregious false claim: The Ukraine delay

Facing difficult questions about why he delayed military aid to Ukraine, Trump and his allies have tested out a variety of possible explanations. At one point last week, though, Trump decided to just deny the very existence of the delay.

""I didn't delay anything,"" he told reporters . ""We paid the military aid, to the best of my knowledge.""

The money was paid, but that payment very clearly came after a delay. By this week, Trump was openly defending the delay he had said did not happen.

""I'd withhold again and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine, because they're not doing it,"" he said -- which is also not true.

The most revealing false claim: Maligning Omar, again

This time, Trump amplified a tweet from a conservative commentator, Terrence K. Williams. Posting a video of Omar dancing, Williams accused her of partying on the anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

The most absurd false claim: The name of the Democratic Party

For sheer weirdness, it is hard to top Trump's story about the mountain climbers and the border wall. But we say his claim about the Democratic Party did it.

Some of Trump's false claims are so bizarre that it's almost embarrassing to check them. When you do, some of his supporters will inevitably accuse you of humorlessness or pettiness.

Whatever: this is a comprehensive tally, and we must do our solemn duty. Thus, we must point out that ... the name of the Democratic Party is the Democratic Party.

We must do so because Trump has repeatedly and solemnly insisted that the actual name is the ""Democrat Party.""

He said last week, again, that he is not only using ""Democrat Party"" because it sounds worse but because that is the party's official name. He urged the Democrats to make a change to the nicer ""Democratic Party,"" in which case he might call them that.

Yes, he might just be trolling. No, that does not make any of this less confusing.

Here is a list of false claims from last week that we had not previously fact checked in a weekly update:

Google and the 2016 election

""Did you see Google? He said I may have lost 2 million to 10 million votes according to this character that worked at Google, right? And we still won. How the hell did we win? Everybody was against us. How did we win? How did we win? This is a Google executive. From two million to 10.5 million votes, and we won."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: That flawed study was conducted by a psychologist, not a Google employee or executive. You can read a full fact check on the study : That flawed study was conducted by a psychologist, not a Google employee or executive. You can read a full fact check on the study here

Joe Biden

Hunter Biden and the investigation

""The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, want to stay as far away as possible from the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son, or they won't get a very large amount of U.S. money..."" -- September 21 tweet

""And, you know, he really made it a -- it was an offer. It was beyond an offer. It was something where he said, 'I'm not going to give billions of dollars to Ukraine unless they remove this prosecutor.' And they removed the prosecutor supposedly in one hour. And the prosecutor was prosecuting the company of the son and the son."" -- September 22 exchange with reporters after Coast Guard briefing in Houston

Facts First: There is no public evidence that Hunter Biden was ever himself under investigation.

The investigation, as far as we know, was into the business activities of Mykola Zlochevsky, who owned a natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, for which Hunter Biden had sat on the board of directors since 2014. The United Kingdom had begun investigating Zlochevsky before Hunter Biden joined the board.

""Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws -- at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,"" Shokin's successor as prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Bloomberg.

Joe Biden and ""the case""

""Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case. So, somebody ought to look into that."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters at meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: There is no evidence that Biden ever called on Ukraine to remove its chief prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, from a case involving Mykola Zlochevsky, the owner of a natural gas company on whose board of directors Biden's son Hunter Biden sat. Rather, Biden, like the US government more broadly and several US allies, tried to get Shokin fired.

Trump's allies might argue that calling for a prosecutor's firing was even worse than calling for him to be taken off a particular case. But there is a key difference given the context.

Had Biden called for Shokin to be taken off a particular matter in which his son had a stake, this would seem to suggest that his motivation was helping his son. But Biden calling for Shokin's firing, without mentioning that particular case, was consistent with the international concern about Shokin's performance.

Joe Biden's previous comments

""This is a very dishonest thing that Joe Biden did. And then he said he never spoke to this son. Does anybody believe that one? But then he also said, long before, that that he did speak to his son. So he lied, again."" And: ""I mean, give me a break, he's already said he spoke to his son. And now he said, yesterday, very firmly. Who wouldn't speak to your son? Of course, you spoke to your son. So, he made the mistake of saying he never spoke to his son. He spoke to his son."" -- September 22 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure

Facts First: Biden has not previously said that he did speak to his son about his overseas business dealings. Rather, it was Hunter Biden who said that there was a conversation on the subject, according to a New Yorker : Biden has not previously said that he did speak to his son about his overseas business dealings. Rather, it was Hunter Biden who said that there was a conversation on the subject, according to a New Yorker article in July.

That article said this: ""As Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: 'Dad said, ""I hope you know what you are doing,"" and I said, ""I do.'""

Once is more than never, so Trump can fairly point out the contradiction -- though the New Yorker article did not offer evidence that the father-son exchange was detailed. Regardless, the elder Biden was not contradicting himself; he was contradicting his son.

Cokie Roberts

""I never met her. She never treated me nicely. But I would like to wish her family well. She was a professional, and I respect professionals. I respect you guys a lot, you people a lot. She was a real professional. Never treated me well, but I certainly respect her as a professional."" -- September 17 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

Facts First: Trump had met Roberts, who : Trump had met Roberts, who died on September 17. As CNN's Brian Stelter noted , she interviewed him at Trump Tower for a story that aired on ABC in December 1999. (Roberts also questioned him by phone during the 2016 campaign; she asked him asked about children using his campaign rhetoric to bully other children. He called the question ""very nasty."")

Trump, who has been interviewed many hundreds of times, could well have just forgotten the 1999 meeting, but his statement was false regardless of his intent.

San Francisco, the ocean and needles

""We'll start with those two cities and we're looking at San Francisco, we're looking at Los Angeles. And we're looking at all of the things that are happening. You know, there's tremendous pollution being put into the ocean, because they're going through what's called a storm sewer. That's for rainwater. And we have tremendous things that we don't have to discuss pouring into the ocean. There are needles, there are other things. Lot of bad -- lot of -- it's a terrible situation. That's in Los Angeles and in San Francisco. And we're going to be giving San Francisco -- they're in total violation -- we're going to be giving them the notice very soon."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

Facts First: There is no evidence for Trump's claim that San Francisco has significant pollution, including needles, being sent into the ocean through storm sewers.

San Francisco Mayor London Breed called Trump's claims ""ridiculous,"" saying in a statement that the city's sewer system ""ensures that all debris that flow into storm drains are filtered out at the city's wastewater treatment plants."" David Lewis, executive director of nonprofit Save the Bay, told the Mercury News: ""In San Francisco, all solids in that stormwater and sewage water are removed. And what comes out of the plant is sometimes cleaner than the water that many people in this state are drinking.""

The San Francisco Chronicle reported : ""Storm drain runoff is piped to one of two city treatment facilities, the Southeast Treatment Plant in the Bayview neighborhood or the Oceanside Treatment Plant near the zoo. Any pollutants would be treated at those points if they haven't already been filtered out at catch basins beneath city streets, according to the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. 'We haven't had any (recent) problems with syringes,' said SFPUC spokesman Tyler Gamble.""

Mountain climbers and the wall

""We actually built prototypes and we have, I guess you could say, world-class mountain climbers. We got climbers. We had 20 mountain climbers. That's all they do; they love to climb mountains. They can have it. Me, I don't want to climb mountains. But they're very good. And some of them were champions. And we gave them different prototypes of walls, and this was the one that was hardest to climb."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: There is no evidence that 20 mountain climbers, or any number of champion mountain climbers, were recruited to test Trump's border barriers. When The Daily Beast : There is no evidence that 20 mountain climbers, or any number of champion mountain climbers, were recruited to test Trump's border barriers. When The Daily Beast contacted several top mountain climbers and governing body USA Climbing, nobody had any idea what Trump was talking about. Customs and Border Protection refused to comment to CNN, referring questions to the White House.

The wall and San Diego

""You know in San Diego, California, is very difficult, always complaining, not doing great, but they wanted a wall in San Diego -- good mayor in San Diego, by the way. They wanted a wall, and I said, 'You know what, let's build it someplace else, because California, you know, once we build it, they'll complain.'"" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: It is possible that someone or some group from San Diego told him they wanted a wall, but as we : It is possible that someone or some group from San Diego told him they wanted a wall, but as we reported at the Toronto Star, there is no basis for Trump's repeated suggestion that the city itself wanted a wall. San Diego's city council voted 5-3 in 2017 to express opposition to the proposal, and even the Republican mayor Trump was praising here, Kevin Faulconer, has made clear that he is opposed

The name of the Democratic Party

Trump said he calls the Democratic Party the ""Democrat Party"" not only because ""Democrat"" sounds worse than ""Democratic"" but because ""that's their name, the Democrat Party""; he said, ""Frankly, they should probably change it -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The party is already named the Democratic Party. We realize this is a strange-sounding fact check, but Trump has repeatedly : The party is already named the Democratic Party. We realize this is a strange-sounding fact check, but Trump has repeatedly insisted that the actual name is the Democrat Party, so we are not going to let it slide.

A tweet on Ilhan Omar

Trump shared a tweet from comedian and conservative commentator Terrence K. Williams, who alleged that Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar was dancing on the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In his own comment above Williams' tweet, which Williams later deleted, Trump wrote , ""IIhan Omar, a member of AOC Plus 3, will win us the Great State of Minnesota. The new face of the Democrat Party!"" -- September 18 tweet

Facts First: The footage of Omar dancing was from September 13, 2019, not the anniversary of September 11. She was attending an event, called Breaking Concrete Ceilings, connected to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's Annual Legislative Conference.

Nuclear weapons

""Our nuclear was getting very tired. They hadn't spent the money on it. And now we have it have it in, as we would say, 'tippy-top shape.' Tippy-top. It's — we have new and we have renovated and it's — it's incredible."" --September 20 press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

""As you know, we've spent tremendous and hopefully -- and we pray to God we never have to use it, but we've totally renovated and bought new nuclear. And the rest of our military is all brand new. The nuclear now is at a level that's it's never been before."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: ""Tired"" is vague and subjective, but experts reject that characterization of the US nuclear arsenal prior to the Trump administration. Obama did spend money on the arsenal, launching a modernization program that is expected to : ""Tired"" is vague and subjective, but experts reject that characterization of the US nuclear arsenal prior to the Trump administration. Obama did spend money on the arsenal, launching a modernization program that is expected to cost more than $1 trillion . And experts say that Trump has not yet implemented significant changes to the arsenal.

""I feel comfortable saying that the scientific studies to date have yet to provide any evidence that the nuclear arsenal was 'tired' or in any way at risk of being ineffective if called upon,"" said Scott Kemp, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Nuclear Security and Policy.

""I am not aware that Trump can claim to have done anything for the state of the nuclear arsenal — but nothing urgent needed to be done anyway,"" said Kemp, who served as a State Department adviser on arms control early in the Obama administration.

Alexandra Bell, senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control & Non-Proliferation, said that, with the exception of a hypothetical top-secret development she doesn't know about, ""everything is the same"" in the deployed arsenal ""as it was in January 2017"" -- aside from reductions the US made to fulfill its obligations under the New START treaty with Russia.

While ""the Trump administration has certainly requested and received increased funding for nuclear modernization,"" Bell said, ""this is a trajectory we have been on since 2010 "" -- and ""he hasn't really changed anything yet.""

""Budgets clearly demonstrate that we have spent enormous of money on nuclear modernization over the past decade,"" said Bell, who served in the State Department under Obama from 2010 to 2017.

A wall at the Democratic convention?

Talking about the large barriers he had visited at a California border site and is planning to erect elsewhere, Trump was asked if that's what he wants around the White House grounds. He said, ""No, but that's what the Democrats are putting up around their convention...They're building a big wall around their convention. Which they should do."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

""You know what I saw the other day? Where the Democrats are having their convention, their national convention. They just gave out a tremendous contract. You know what it's for? They're building a big wall around the building, they're building a big wall, a massive wall."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: There is no evidence that the Democrats are planning to erect a big wall around the convention site. ""It's not true,"" Democratic National Committee spokesman Brandon Gassaway told CNN.

There will likely be some sort of security fencing in the vicinity of the convention, as is standard, but there are no known plans for a wall even slightly resembling the steel-and-concrete structure Trump visited in California.

The Green New Deal and cars

Trump said that, under the Democrats' Green New Deal proposal, people would be limited to one car: ""Now, under the Green New Deal that (energy revenue) all goes away, that all goes away. It all goes away. You can forget it. No more cows, no more airplanes, no more trips. A single car. Make it electric -- single car, you're not allowed to travel more than 162 miles."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The congressional : The congressional resolution on the Green New Deal does not include any restrictions on the number of cars people could own or the number of miles they could drive.

The proposal calls for ""overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible, including through investment in zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing; clean, affordable, and accessible public transit; and high-speed rail.""

Bay of Pigs veterans

""You know just before the last election, the Cubans from Miami, where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote close to 90%. They gave me the Bay of Pigs award. Can you imagine, right? The Bay of Pigs award."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump got an endorsement, not an award, from the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association. The : Trump got an endorsement, not an award, from the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association. The endorsement was the first the association had ever made in a presidential election, so Trump could fairly boast about it. But still, an award and an endorsement are different things. (Trump claimed in August to have received an award from the Log Cabin Republicans, which told CNN it gave him an endorsement but not an award.)

Trump's Cuban American support in 2016

""You know just before the last election, the Cubans from Miami, where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote close to 90%..."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump did not get anywhere near 90% of the Cuban-American vote, in Miami or elsewhere, according to multiple analyses : Trump did not get anywhere near 90% of the Cuban-American vote, in Miami or elsewhere, according to multiple analyses reported on by the Miami Herald when Trump claimed in 2017 that he had received ""84%"" of the Cuban-American vote. The Herald noted that estimates range from 50% to 58%.

The Herald reported: ""Mauricio Claver-Carone, former executive director of the US-Cuba Democracy PAC who was appointed by Trump to the Treasury Department, estimated that Trump won 58% of the Cuban-American vote based on his review of results from about 30 Miami-Dade precincts with large Cuban-American populations."" As the Herald reported, University of Florida professor Daniel A. Smith found that Trump's best performance with Cuban-American voters in any Miami-Dade precinct was 68%.

Military aid to Ukraine

Question: ""How do you explain the military aid, sir? How do you explain delaying military aid (inaudible)?"" Trump: ""Because I want Germany and I want France and I want the European Union to put up money. And I didn't delay anything. We paid the military aid, to the best of my knowledge."" -- September 22 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure

Facts First: Trump's administration did delay military aid to Ukraine. : Trump's administration did delay military aid to Ukraine. CNN , the Washington Post and the New York Times reported that Trump himself ordered the hold on the aid.

Trump was correct that the aid was eventually paid, but he was incorrect when he denied the very existence of a delay; the delay has been publicly discussed by members of Congress and by people who were serving in the Ukrainian government this summer. The Post reported that although the Trump administration notified congressional officials in February and in May that portions of the aid was going to be released, but the release didn't actually happen until September.

The estate tax

""And to keep New Mexico's farms, ranches and small businesses in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax or death tax so that you can now give your farm or your ranch to your children."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. His 2017 tax law raised the threshold at which the tax must be paid, from $5.5 million to $11.2 million for an individual, but : Trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. His 2017 tax law raised the threshold at which the tax must be paid, from $5.5 million to $11.2 million for an individual, but did not get rid of the tax entirely

It's also misleading to suggest that the estate tax had been a particular burden on farms and small businesses; very few of them were paying the tax even before Trump's changes came into effect. According to the Tax Policy Center, a mere 50 farms and closely held businesses were among the 5,190 estates to pay the estate tax in 2017, before Trump's tax law. The Center wrote on its website: ""The Tax Policy Center estimates that small farms and businesses will pay $20 million in estate tax in 2017, one-tenth of 1 percentage of the total estate tax revenue.""

Oil prices

""Our country is doing well. You look at so many different things. Look at all of the regulation cutting that allows us to do what we did. Look at what happened three days ago — where you have an attack like that and it takes out a big chunk of oil, and the prices go up $4, $5, and now it's heading down rapidly. That tells you — that would have happened years ago, it would have gone up $50. It would've doubled. And this was a blip."" -- September 20 press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: Though oil prices did head back downward after an initial spike after the attack on Saudi oil facilities, that initial spike was larger than $4 or $5: : Though oil prices did head back downward after an initial spike after the attack on Saudi oil facilities, that initial spike was larger than $4 or $5: Brent crude futures , the international benchmark, and West Texas Intermediate futures both rose more than $8, about 15% each, between the close of trading on Friday, before the attack, and the close of trading on Monday; it was the largest single-day percentage gain for Brent since at least 1988, Reuters reported

We can't fact check Trump's hypothetical about what might have happened to oil prices if the attack had occurred some unspecified number of years ago.

The cost of the Mueller investigation

""House Judiciary has given up on the Mueller Report, sadly for them after two years and $40,000,000 spent..."" -- September 16 tweet

""...they spent $40 million -- there's not a person in the room that I couldn't find something on with that."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The Mueller investigation cost $32 million, not $40 million, according to : The Mueller investigation cost $32 million, not $40 million, according to figures released by the Justice Department -- and the government is expected recoup about $17 million as a result of the investigation, according to a CNN analysis of the sentences handed out to people charged by Mueller.

The vast majority of this $17 million is expected to come from former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was ordered to forfeit assets and pay millions to the Internal Revenue Service.

Here's a list of claims we've fact checked before in one of our weekly updates:

Immigration

Mexican troops on the border

""And I want to thank the President of Mexico, who right now has 27,000 soldiers on our southern border. It's been incredible what's taken place in a short period of time."" -- September 22 speech at Howdy, Modi event in Houston

Facts First: The approximately 26,000 troops are split between the US border and Mexico's southern border. Trump himself said in late July that 6,000 of the troops were near Guatemala; speaking to the press in September, acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner Mark Morgan said , ""Since June, Mexico has deployed thousands of troops. They've created a new national guard within their country: 10,000 troops to the southern border; 15,000 troops to the norther border with the United States.""

Mexico's immigration assistance

""You know, Mexico has never done anything to impede people from pouring into our country, and now they're doing just the opposite. They've really been incredible."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: Mexico also took action to impede migrants from entering the United States during the Obama administration.

Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, noted that the Mexican government beefed up its border enforcement measures as part of a cooperation program with the US that aimed to address the 2014 surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America. ""The numbers of unaccompanied minors dropped as a result of this cooperation (and the two countries dealt with a second, smaller spike in 2016 the same way),"" Selee said. He added: ""The Mexican government has actually deported more Central Americans to their home countries since 2015 than the US government has, sharply limiting the number of migrants from that region that have made it to the US border.""

Building the wall

""Well, this section is 14 (miles), but we're building many that are 50 and 40 and 17 and different areas. We're building on many different sites all up and down along the border."" -- September 18 interview with Fox News' Ed Henry

""Well, you know we're building the wall and it's going up and it's going up fast."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

""Now, the wall still, obviously, has a ways to go, but we're building it at a breakneck speed."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: Trump was exaggerating the pace of border-barrier construction. No new miles of border wall had been built during Trump's presidency as of August, Customs and Border Protection told CNN's Geneva Sands. Sixty miles of existing barriers had been replaced over Trump's tenure in office, but Trump was incorrect that there are ""many"" sections of 50, 40 and 17 miles under construction.

Democrats and the border

Trump said the Democrats have an agenda of ""open borders."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Even Democratic presidential candidates who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests.

Human trafficking

""If you want to stop the drug smugglers and the human traffickers, how about the human traffic? And they traffic really for the most part in women, that's what they traffic in, it's women. They're not trafficking in men, they capture women and they bring them across the open borders and they don't go through ports of entry where you have guards standing there with guns and rifles and everything else. They go out into the desert areas and they hang a left or they hang a right and they come in."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Many human trafficking victims do indeed come through ports of entry, according to US experts on trafficking and according to international data.

Experts say that victims are more likely to be deceived into crossing the border willingly than kidnapped and put in the back of a vehicle. ""I have worked on human trafficking on multiple continents in multiple countries for more than two decades, and in all the work that I've done with trafficking victims, I have met one who was actually kidnapped and thrown into a car,"" Martina Vandenberg of the Human Trafficking Legal Center told CNN in January, when Trump was telling frequent stories about women being bound and gagged in cars.

Many victims, experts say, are tricked into coming to the US with promises of a good job. Others are coerced through threats to their families or themselves. While experts say there may be some cases like the ones Trump has described, they emphasize that such cases are in a small minority. In 2018, the UN International Organization for Migration found that ""in the last 10 years, almost 80% of journeys undertaken by victims trafficked internationally cross through official border points, such as airports and land border control points.""

Democrats

The Green New Deal, cows and planes

""Now, under the Green New Deal that (energy revenue) all goes away, that all goes away. It all goes away. You can forget it. No more cows, no more airplanes, no more trips."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The Democrats' Green New Deal environmental resolution does not call for the elimination of cows or planes.

Trump did not make up this claim out of thin air. A ""FAQ"" page that once appeared on the website of a leading Green New Deal proponent, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, calls for the government to ""build out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary."" In explaining why Green New Deal proponents were aiming to get to ""net-zero"" carbon emissions in 10 years rather than the more ambitious goal of zero carbon emissions at all, the FAQ said, ""We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren't sure that we'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.""

The FAQ was not an official party document and has not been broadly adopted by Green New Deal supporters. Its language about cows and planes does not appear in the text of the Green New Deal resolution many congressional Democrats have endorsed. The resolution calls for ""overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector"" and ""working collaboratively with farmers and ranchers in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector as much as is technologically feasible.

Popularity and accomplishments

Special election in North Carolina's 9th District

Trump said North Carolina congressional candidate Dan Bishop, who won a September special election, was down ""17 points three weeks ago,"" before Trump got involved. -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Bishop was not down 17 points in any : Bishop was not down 17 points in any public poll , though some did have him trailing by single-digit margins.

When we tweeted about this, Matt Wolking, deputy director of communications for the Trump campaign, responded ""Try harder"" -- pointing to a tweet by Jim Blaine, a Republican strategist, that included an apparent poll excerpt that showed Bishop down 14.

But 14 is not 17. And neither Wolking nor Blaine responded to our questions about who conducted the poll, who it was conducted for, when it was conducted, what its methodology was, or what its sample size was; Blaine's tweet did not include any of that information.

Special election in North Carolina's 3rd District

Trump said Greg Murphy, who won the special election in North Carolina's 3rd District, ""was up a couple of points"" before his victory. -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Murphy was leading by significantly more than ""a couple of points,"" according to public polling. One : Murphy was leading by significantly more than ""a couple of points,"" according to public polling. One late poll had him up by 11 points.

The poll was in line with pundits' expectations for the race, which was widely seen to be an easy Republican victory. Murphy was running in a district formerly held by the late Republican Rep. Walter Jones, who ran unopposed by the Democrats in the 2018 election; and Trump won the district by about 24 points in 2016.

Trump could have fairly said Murphy outperformed the polls, since he won by 24 points, but ""a couple of points"" is incorrect.

Suppression polls

""Now, if it's close, like it's in play, you know you wait two three four or five hours to see what it is, but they don't even take a breath because they're called suppression polls, and they're no different than all of the dishonest reporting that you people say. They're no different. They're suppression polls."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: There is simply no evidence that pollsters have manipulated their numbers to suppress the enthusiasm of Trump voters, as Trump has repeatedly alleged.

Veterans Choice

Trump boasted that he was the one who got the Veterans Choice health care Trump passed, saying, ""They've tried to get that for 45 years. They haven't been able to get it. But I'm good at getting things."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was : The Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was signed into law by Barack Obama in 2014. In 2018, Trump signed the VA Mission Act, which expanded and changed the program.

Foreign and military affairs

Venezuela's wealth

""Look at Venezuela: Venezuela, 15 years ago, was one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and today very sad, no food, no water, no nothing."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Venezuela was not one of the world's wealthiest countries 15 years ago.

The International Monetary Fund ranked Venezuela 67th in the world in 2004 by GDP per capita, at $4,019 (US) -- better than more than half of the world's countries, but nowhere near the top.

""Venezuela was one of the richest countries in the world 60 years ago. The richest in Latin America 40 years ago. But not 20 years ago,"" Ricardo Hausmann, a former Venezuelan planning minister and central bank board member, said in response to a previous version of this Trump claim. Hausmann, now a Harvard University professor of economic development, was chief economist of the Inter-American Development Bank from 1994 to 2000.

The war in Afghanistan

""We have hit — in Afghanistan, we have hit the Taliban harder than they've ever been hit in the entire 19 years of war."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters at a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: We'll ignore Trump's subjective claim about how ""hard"" the US is attacking the Taliban. ""Nineteen years of war,"" though, was a small exaggeration. The US invaded Afghanistan in October 2001, nearly 18 years ago. This was not a one-time slip though; Trump habitually says ""19 years.""

The Iran nuclear deal

""The problem was, the deal that was signed by the previous administration was a disaster — which, by the way, would be expiring in a very short period of time also. So you really don't have a deal. You know, that deal was a very short-term deal. So they made a deal, but it was for a very short period of time. So that deal would be expiring very soon."" -- September 16 exchange with reporters with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

Facts First: Some central provisions of the nuclear agreement with Iran were written to expire in the next 10 to 15 years. But the deal as a whole -- including a blanket prohibition on Iran developing nuclear weapons -- was written to continue in perpetuity. You can read a fuller fact check : Some central provisions of the nuclear agreement with Iran were written to expire in the next 10 to 15 years. But the deal as a whole -- including a blanket prohibition on Iran developing nuclear weapons -- was written to continue in perpetuity. You can read a fuller fact check here

ISIS fighters and Europe

""We have thousands of ISIS fighters and we want those fighters to be taken -- you're talking about, I think it's a big -- we have thousands of ISIS fighters that we've taken into -- we've defeated 100% of the caliphate. We are holding in various forms of prison. We're holding thousands of people. Many come from Germany, many come from France, many come from Holland -- really most of them come from various European countries. And we want them to take them back."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

""They mostly come out of Europe."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters at a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: According to Trump's own government estimates, a minority of ISIS fighters being held in Syria came from Europe.

James Jeffrey, Trump's special envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition, said August 1 that about 8,000 of 10,000 terrorist fighters who were then prisoners in northeastern Syria were Iraqi or Syrian nationals; there were ""about 2,000 ISIS foreign fighters"" from all other countries.

Trump himself tweeted in February to ask that European countries take back ""over 800"" ISIS fighters captured in Syria.

Remains from North Korea

""We've gotten our hostages back. We've gotten our great soldiers back who were killed — many of them. And many more are coming back. We have many more coming back. And the families of those — we call them 'our heroes.' And they were our heroes. And they're coming back."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: While North Korea returned some remains last year, it is no longer doing so. The US military announced in May that the remains program had been suspended for the rest of the 2019 fiscal year because North Korea had stopped communicating with the US agency responsible for the effort.

Trump could accurately tout the return of remains in the past tense: North Korea returned 55 cases of possible remains in the summer of 2018. But the remains are no longer being returned. You can read a longer fact check of this claim here

Trade

Unions and the USMCA

Trump said of his USMCA trade agreement, ""Unions love it."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The agreement is generally opposed in its current form by major US unions, who have demanded changes to the text; the president of the AFL-CIO federation : The agreement is generally opposed in its current form by major US unions, who have demanded changes to the text; the president of the AFL-CIO federation says it will be a ""disaster for workers"" if it is not amended. As The New York Times has reported, the United Automobile Workers and United Steelworkers, among other unions, have also demanded changes.

Trade deficit with China

Trump said the trade deficit with China was $500 billion, alleging that previous presidents allowed China to ""to take out $500 billion a year"" or even ""more than that"" including theft of intellectual property. -- September 20 exchange with reporters at meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: Trump refers to trade deficits as losses and surpluses as gains or takings, though this characterization is rejected by many economists. The US trade deficit with China has never been $500 billion; it was : Trump refers to trade deficits as losses and surpluses as gains or takings, though this characterization is rejected by many economists. The US trade deficit with China has never been $500 billion; it was $381 billion last year when counting goods and services, $420 billion when counting goods alone.

Aid to farmers

Talking about his tariffs on China, Trump said, ""And I'm taking care of our farmers out of that. We're helping our farmers. Our farmers were targeted, and they were targeted for $16 billion. And I made that up to them. We paid them the $16 billion and had tens of billions of dollars left over."" -- September 20 press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: It's incorrect that there are tens of billions of dollars left over in tariff receipts after accounting for the $28 billion Trump has pledged to farmers affected by his trade war with China. (The $16 billion Trump mentioned here was a : It's incorrect that there are tens of billions of dollars left over in tariff receipts after accounting for the $28 billion Trump has pledged to farmers affected by his trade war with China. (The $16 billion Trump mentioned here was a second announcement that followed an earlier $12 billion announcement. The China-specific tariffs have generated a total of about $30 billion, according to the US government's tracking data as of September 24.

Who is paying for Trump's tariffs on China

Trump said twice that China is ""eating the tariffs"" he has imposed on imports of Chinese products, and he said on a third occasion that the government was taking in the tariff revenue ""from China.""

Facts First: A bevy of : A bevy of economic studies has found that Americans are bearing the overwhelming majority of the tariff costs, and Americans make the actual tariff payments.

China's economic performance

Trump said four times that China is having its worst economic year in ""57 years.""

Facts First: China's second-quarter growth rate was the : China's second-quarter growth rate was the worst in 27 years . Trump has repeatedly made clear that he knows that this is the reported figure, but he has added additional years for no apparent reason.

History of the tariffs

On three occasions on which eh talked about tariff revenue, Trump said the US has never previously received ""10 cents,"" ""100 cents"" or ""billions"" from China.

Facts First: The US government has been charging tariffs on imported Chinese goods for more than two centuries, and it took in billions from such tariffs long before Trump imposed his own tariffs. (As always, we'll note it is US importers and consumers, not China, who have paid these tariffs.)

The Treasury received $14 billion from tariffs on China in 2014 , to look at one pre-Trump year.

Economy and energy

Automotive investments

""My relationship has been very powerful with the autoworkers — not necessarily the top person or two, but the people that work doing automobiles. Nobody has ever brought more companies into the United States. You know, I have Japan and Germany, and many countries have been bringing car companies in and opening plants and expanding plants. "" -- September 16 exchange with reporters with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

Facts First: Contrary to Trump's claims, there has been no boom in investment from Japanese, German, or other foreign automakers during his tenure. From Trump's inauguration through July, the Center for Automotive Research, a nonprofit that studies the industry, found 66 automaker announcements of new US manufacturing facilities, or expansions or updates to existing facilities. The center found 170 such announcements in Obama's (four-year) first term, 154 in Obama's second term, according to the center's Bernard Swiecki.

Just two Japanese car companies, Toyota and Mazda, have announced plans to build a US plant (together) during Trump's presidency; their joint venture is under construction in Alabama. There is no evidence Trump was personally responsible for this investment decision.

Trump has said since 2018 that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has told him that more Japanese carmakers will soon announce major US investments. But none of these companies has announced a new US plant since Toyota and Mazda introduced the joint venture in early 2018, though Japanese automakers have made additional investments in existing facilities and Japanese truck company Hino Motors has built a truck-cab assembly plant in West Virginia.

""We know of no German or Japanese automakers currently looking to place additional car or truck assembly capacity in the United States,"" said Kristin Dziczek, the center's vice president of industry, labor and economics.

Energy independence

""Well, we have the Strategic — if you look at what we have, we have tremendous amounts of oil in our country. We're independent of everybody now."" -- September 16 exchange with reporters

""So nice that our Country is now Energy Independent. The USA is in better shape than ever before."" -- September 18 tweet

""We're independent, as independent as we want, and we are now a net exporter of energy"" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: While definitions of ""energy independence"" vary, the US is not ""energy independent"" by any definition; it is : While definitions of ""energy independence"" vary, the US is not ""energy independent"" by any definition; it is expected to export more energy than it imports by 2020, according to the government's Energy Information Administration, but that has not happened yet. In the first five months of 2019, PolitiFact noted , the US also consumed more energy than it produced.

There have been occasional, brief periods where US exports have exceed imports or where its production has exceeded consumption, but this hasn't happened for a full recent year.

""The US is still a net importer of crude and refined products, although the trend of declining dependence on imports should continue due to increased domestic production of unconventional oil and biofuels and growing investment in export infrastructure following the 2015 repeal of the crude export ban,"" said Josh Price, a senior analyst for energy and utilities at Height Capital Markets. ""Most of these factors preceded President Trump and have not been significantly altered by administration policies.""

The decrease in US imports and increase in exports began before the Trump administration. Obama presided over a boom in liquefied natural gas exports and signed a bill lifting a 40-year-old ban on crude oil exports.

""The truth is that both of the presidents of this decade (President Obama and President Trump) have presided over an incredibly brisk expansion of our capacity to produce oil and refined products. Executive policy has had little to do with the explosive gains, which are attributable to technology and price,"" said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service.

It's worth noting that the US will still be using large quantities of foreign energy even if it does become a net exporter next year. In other words, it will not be completely independent from foreign suppliers.

Energy production

Trump claimed four times that the US had only recently become the world's largest producer of oil and gas; in one of the claims, he added a message of self-congratulation in the third person: ""Thank you, Mr. President!""

Facts First: The US has not just ""now"" or ""very recently"" become the world's top energy producer, and it did not achieve this status because of Trump's policies: it took the top spot : The US has not just ""now"" or ""very recently"" become the world's top energy producer, and it did not achieve this status because of Trump's policies: it took the top spot in 2012 , under Obama, according to the US government's Energy Information Administration. The US became the top producer of crude oil in particular during Trump's tenure.

""The United States has been the world's top producer of natural gas since 2009, when US natural gas production surpassed that of Russia, and it has been the world's top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded Saudi Arabia's,"" the Energy Information Administration says

Asian American unemployment

Facts First: Trump falsely claimed four times that Asian Americans are at their lowest-ever unemployment rate. The unemployment rate for Asian Americans was : Trump falsely claimed four times that Asian Americans are at their lowest-ever unemployment rate. The unemployment rate for Asian Americans was 2.8% in August -- higher than the 2.6% rate in December 2016, Obama's last full month in office.

Overall unemployment

""Our job numbers for African Americans are the best in history. You saw the new ones came out; they're even better than they were two months ago. Hispanic, the best in history. Asian, the best in history. Overall, they're phenomenal. The best in 51 years. And I think we'll soon be historic on that one too."" -- September 16 exchange with reporters with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

""We're doing -- we have this great economy. We're doing better than we've ever done. Our employment numbers are the best they've ever been and unemployment numbers also. We are doing great. But we should be cutting. There's no inflation."" -- September 18 interview with Fox News' Ed Henry

""And unemployment in the United States has just reached the lowest level in over 51 years, and very soon, we think that will be broken to be a historic number."" -- September 22 speech at Howdy, Modi event in Houston

Facts First: Trump was exaggerating in all three cases -- very slightly with ""51 years,"" more significantly when he said ""the best they've ever been."" The Trump was exaggerating in all three cases -- very slightly with ""51 years,"" more significantly when he said ""the best they've ever been."" The unemployment rate over this spring and summer -- 3.7% in each of June, July and August, 3.6% in each of April and May -- has been the lowest since December 1969, slightly less than 50 years ago; all of these rates were well off the record 2.5%, set in 1953.

The dollar

""Will Fed ever get into the game? Dollar strongest EVER!"" -- September 16 tweet

Facts First: The dollar is not the strongest it has ever been against other currencies, according to various indices; it was significantly stronger in the 1980s and earlier this decade. You can read a longer version of this fact check : The dollar is not the strongest it has ever been against other currencies, according to various indices; it was significantly stronger in the 1980s and earlier this decade. You can read a longer version of this fact check here

Women's unemployment

Trump said at his New Mexico rally that unemployment numbers for women were the best in ""71 years.""

Facts First: This was his usual slight exaggeration. The rate this summer has been the lowest since 1953, 66 years ago.

Inflation

Trump claimed three times that there is ""no inflation."" Facts First: There is inflation: 1.7% for the last 12 months ending in August. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, was up 2.4% for the 12 months ending in August. Trump could fairly say that inflation is low, but ""no inflation"" is incorrect.

Trump could fairly say that inflation is low, but ""no inflation"" is incorrect.

Prescription drug prices

Trump claimed that last year was ""the first year in 51 years where prices went down"" for prescription drugs. -- September 16 exchange w with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

Facts First: This was a slight exaggeration. Prescription drug prices declined last year for the first time in 46 years, according to one of several measures. You can read a longer version of this fact check : This was a slight exaggeration. Prescription drug prices declined last year for the first time in 46 years, according to one of several measures. You can read a longer version of this fact check here

Pre-existing conditions

""And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. The Republicans will always do that."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: This promise has already proven false. Trump and Republicans, who have tried to pass : This promise has already proven false. Trump and Republicans, who have tried to pass bills that would have weakened protections for people with pre-existing conditions, are now trying to get the courts to declare Obamacare void, without a plan to replace those pre-existing protections if their lawsuit succeeds.

Air quality

""And I'm an environmentalist, I believe in the environment. I want the cleanest water on the planet. I want the cleanest air. I want a lot of things. You know right now we have the cleanest air that we've ever had in this country?"" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: By several measures, US air was cleaner under Obama than it's been under Trump. Three of the six types of pollutants identified by the Clean Air Act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before Trump took office, according to Environmental Protection Agency : By several measures, US air was cleaner under Obama than it's been under Trump. Three of the six types of pollutants identified by the Clean Air Act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before Trump took office, according to Environmental Protection Agency data

Additionally, there were more ""unhealthy air days"" for sensitive groups in 2018 than in 2016 -- 799 days across the 35 American cities surveyed by the EPA, up from 702. Though there were significantly more ""unhealthy air days"" in Obama's first term than there have been in Trump's, the lowest amount of unhealthy air days -- 598 -- occurred in 2014 under Obama.

Judicial vacancies

""President Obama said they (prisoners at Guantanamo Bay) were going to be totally completed and emptied out by the time he left office. And very much like judges, where, as you know, I ended up with 138 slots, you had a situation where that wasn't cleaned out."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

""In a few short weeks, we'll be up to 180, sounds impossible, federal judges, including court of appeals judges, because President Obama did us a great favor. when I came in, I said, 'I assume I have no judges to appoint.' 'No sir, you have 138 judges.' 138, didn't put them up, couldn't get them approved. I don't know what happened, but we started off with 138."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump did not enter office with 138 judicial vacancies. According to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments, there were 103 vacancies on district and appeals courts on Jan. 1, 2017, just before Trump took office, plus a vacancy on the Supreme Court.

Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the confirmation of many of Obama's judicial nominees late in his term; Obama obviously didn't intend to ""hand"" vacancies to Trump."

TRUMP UKRAINE GAMES TIP DEMS TOWARD IMPEACHMENT

Politico: “President Donald Trump on Tuesday shifted his explanation for temporarily withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, citing what he criticized as a lack of similar financial contribution by other Western powers to the Eastern European nation. Trump’s latest remarks are at odds with his assertion Monday that he denied the assistance because he feared bureaucratic corruption within Ukraine’s government. The new claim also comes after weekend reports that he repeatedly pressured newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son. ‘As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid. They were fully paid,’ Trump told reporters Tuesday, ahead of his address to the United Nations General Assembly. ‘But my complaint has always been, and I'd withhold again, and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine,’ he continued.”



Officials say Pelosi quietly making moves - WaPo: “[Speaker Nancy] Pelosi, according to multiple senior House Democrats and congressional aides, has been gauging the mood of her caucus members about whether they believe that allegations that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate a political foe are a tipping point. She was making calls as late as Monday night, and many leadership aides who once thought Trump’s impeachment was unlikely now say they think it’s almost inevitable. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly. Pelosi’s conversations — and reconsideration of her long-held position that impeachment is too divisive — come amid a growing clamor for impeachment that extends beyond the party’s liberal base and many Democratic presidential candidates to moderate lawmakers in competitive House seats.”



Moderate Dems join the effort - Fox News: “A slew of key swing-district Democrats late Monday threw their support en masse behind opening a formal impeachment inquiry, as The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal reported in the evening that President Trump personally ordered acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before he pressed the new Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The rapid-fire declarations by the influential Democrats, after seemingly months of teetering on the brink, came just a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi strongly suggested she was now warming to the idea of impeaching the president. Speaking to Fox News, a House Democratic leadership aide confirmed that the Democratic caucus will meet Tuesday afternoon to discuss the Ukraine matter and how to proceed.”



Trump’s attacks on Biden worry Dems of 2016 repeat - WaPo: “But in a worrisome sign for Democrats anxious about reliving the party’s woes in 2016, [the Biden] campaign’s counterattack is being drowned out by a pro-Trump network on social media and cable news that kicked into gear over the weekend, leveling accusations against Biden that have scant factual basis. … The flurry of online attacks against Biden carries echoes of conspiracy theories spread by Trump and his allies about Hillary Clinton’s health and claims about her foreign entanglements that helped turn voters against her. The onslaught comes at a crucial moment in the Democratic primary contest, as the former vice president attempts to showcase his ability to go toe-to-toe with Trump. But with the Democratic National Committee attempting to be a more neutral arbiter than it was in 2016, when it was accused of aiding Clinton, the party helped monitor viral attacks but publicly remained silent.”



THE RULEBOOK: PROVE YOURSELF

“To reverse and undo what has been done by a predecessor, is very often considered by a successor as the best proof he can give of his own capacity and desert… and that the less he resembles him, the more he will recommend himself to the favor of his constituents.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 72



TIME OUT: ONE OF A KIND

Smithsonian: “The guitar Prince plays in [the Purple Rain video] was custom-made for him by a luthier at a Minneapolis music shop called Knut-Koupee Enterprises. … It made sense, even then, that Prince would require an instrument that didn’t resemble anything anyone else was playing. Knut-Koupee made three so-called ‘cloud’ guitars for Prince in the early 1980s. … In 1993, Prince gave a cloud guitar to the Smithsonian Institution, but he didn’t include any information about the instrument’s origins. But earlier this year, John Woodland, the conservator for Prince’s guitar collection … reached out to the Smithsonian with a sneaking suspicion. After the guitar underwent a CT scan and extensive paint analysis, what they found was a shocker… This wasn’t just a cloud guitar, in other words, it was the cloud guitar—the instrument responsible for some of the most iconic sounds and images in American popular music.”

WARREN CLOSING IN ON BIDEN IN NEVADA

USA Today: “Elizabeth Warren has pulled within striking distance of Joe Biden for the lead in Nevada's influential presidential caucuses. A new Suffolk University/USA TODAY Network Poll, taken after this month's Democratic debate, shows Biden at 23% and Warren at 19% in Nevada, the state that follows Iowa and New Hampshire in the opening presidential contests next year. Bernie Sanders is at 14%. While Warren trailed Biden, the Massachusetts senator was within the margin of error of the former vice president for the first time in a public poll in the Silver State. … Among the second tier of candidates in Nevada, California Sen. Kamala Harris was at 4% and South Bend (Ind.) Mayor Pete Buttigieg, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and activist Tom Steyer at 3%. … The survey showed Warren positioned to increase her support as the Democratic field narrows. She was the ‘second choice’ of 19%, compared to 16% for Biden, 12% for Sanders and 10% for California Sen. Kamala Harris.”



She also joins him upfront in New Hampshire - Monmouth University: “Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has joined former Vice President Joe Biden at the front of the pack in New Hampshire, according to the latest Monmouth University Poll. … Among registered New Hampshire Democrats and unaffiliated voters who are likely to participate in the February 2020 Democratic primary, 27% currently support Warren and 25% support Biden. The only other candidates in double digits are Sanders at 12% and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 10%. Others with measurable support are California Sen. Kamala Harris (3%), New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (2%), Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (2%), Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar (2%), former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer (2%), and entrepreneur Andrew Yang (2%).”



Gabbard is the 12th Dem to qualify for October debate - Politico: “Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has qualified for the October Democratic presidential primary debate, making her the twelfth candidate to hit the Democratic National Committee's thresholds. Gabbard got 2 percent support in a New Hampshire poll conducted by Monmouth University and released on Tuesday. The Hawaii congresswoman had previously gotten 2 percent in three other DNC-approved polls, and her campaign said she already racked up more than the 130,000 donors she needed to make the debate stage. Gabbard will join Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julian Castro, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O'Rourke, Tom Steyer, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang onstage in October.”



DNC raises qualifying thresholds for November debate - Fox News: “The DNC announced on Monday that to qualify for the November showdown, candidates must reach at least 3 percent in four approved national or early-voting-state polls. That’s up from the 2 percent needed to reach the stage at the September and October debates and up from the 1 percent needed in three approved surveys for the June and July debates. But, to tamper down any criticism from the early voting states, the DNC added another way to satisfy the polling criteria – reaching 5 percent in two qualifying surveys in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina – the first four states to vote in the nominating calendar. The window for the polling is from Sept. 13 to seven days before the still-unannounced November debate. In previous debates, candidates had until two weeks before the showdown to reach the polling criteria.”

GOO GOO G'JOOB

Fox News: “A Russian navy boat embarking on a research expedition in the Arctic Sea sunk after being attacked by a female walrus that was defending her young, according to reports Monday. The Altai, a tugboat operated by the Russian navy’s Northern Fleet, carried researchers from the Russian Geographical Society and other expedition participants into waters near a remote island chain called Franz Josef Land in the Arctic Sea, Ars Technica reported. The boat dispatched a smaller inflatable landing craft in shallow waters off Wilczek Island to bring researchers ashore near Cape Heller. Before the boat could reach the beach, it was attacked by a female walrus who was probably ‘fearing for her cubs,’ according to a press release from the Russian Geographical Society. ‘The boat sank, but a tragedy was avoided thanks to the prompt action by the squad leader. All landing participants safely reached the shore,’ the press release said.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“The first week, I thought, the terrible thing is that people are going to judge me now by a different standard. If I can just muddle through life, they'll say it was a great achievement, given this. I thought that would be the worst, that would be the greatest defeat in my life -- if I allowed that. I decided if I could make people judge me by the old standard, that would be a triumph and that's what I try to do. It seemed to me the only way to live.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) speaking with the Washington Post on Aug. 17, 1984.

On the roster: Biden hits the skids in new Q Poll - Trump leaned on Ukrainian leader for Biden dirt - Audible: Excuses, excuses! - Happy hump day



BIDEN HITS THE SKIDS IN NEW Q POLL

Politico: “A new national survey shows Elizabeth Warren now sitting atop the 2020 Democratic field… Twenty-seven percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents polled by Quinnipiac University said they favor Warren, according to a poll released Wednesday morning. Twenty-five percent said they prefer former Vice President Joe Biden. Although Warren’s edge falls within the survey’s margin of error, Biden’s formidable lead over the rest of the field has crumbled since the last Quinnipiac national poll in August, which showed him with 32 percent support and Warren with 19 percent support. The latest survey reinforces other public polling showing Warren and Biden separating from their fellow contenders in the Democratic presidential race. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders ranked third in Tuesday’s poll, achieving 16 percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., with 7 percent, and California Sen. Kamala Harris at 3 percent.”



Trump attacks raise doubts about Biden for Dem voters - NYT: “In public, for the last five days, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his campaign have been on a ferocious offensive, ripping into President Trump for allegedly abusing his powers in asking Ukraine’s leader to help hurt Mr. Biden politically, and castigating the news media for questioning his son Hunter Biden’s financial dealings there. … In private, though, this has been an enraging and uncertain time for the Biden campaign, and for Mr. Biden himself… He and his advisers have long feared that Hunter Biden would become a target for political opponent…And as Mr. Trump’s onslaught has pushed the House of Representatives to start an impeachment inquiry, Mr. Biden now faces a crucial political test where his standing may hinge on how he handles a wildly unpredictable confrontation with Mr. Trump.”



Warren ready for air war with $10 million buy - Politico: “Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign on Tuesday announced an early-state ad campaign of at least $10 million, suggesting that the Massachusetts senator is continuing to raise big money from grass-roots donors after an anemic start. The campaign told POLITICO that a digital ad campaign would begin immediately and that they are currently reserving television time, with the entire buy ramping up over the next few months. The campaign declined to say when its spending on digital and TV ads would reach eight figures. ‘Right now, our biggest expense as a campaign is our staff, but as the campaign heats up, it will be on media to reach potential voters,’ campaign manager Roger Lau wrote in a memo emailed to supporters Tuesday morning. The campaign ‘will be more digital than old-school broadcast television.’ The campaign also released three ads Tuesday — 15-second, 30-second, and 1-minute spots — which highlight Warren’s policy plans and her intention to crack down on corruption in government.”



Buttigieg hitches a ride on McCain’s media strategy - CBS News: “The South Bend, Indiana mayor rolled across Iowa on a four-day bus tour and allowed everything uttered on the bus to be on the record, drawing ready comparisons to the late Senator John McCain's ‘Straight Talk Express,’ the bus he toured the country in when he ran for president in 2000. The coach, which has also been around the country in the service of former President Barack Obama, Justin Timberlake and Tom Hanks, is now styled with Buttigieg signs, marble floors and plays news channels or football in the background. … He and his campaign have ramped up spending in Iowa in the past month, releasing a new TV ad on Monday, hiring more staff on the ground and opening offices. He added that the strategy is not to ‘go around Iowa.’”



Sanders touts dozen of union member endorsements - The Hill: “White House hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) unveiled the endorsements of 85 union members in Iowa as he works to shore up support for his progressive bona fides against a surging Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). The endorsements were announced on the ‘Bernie beats Trump’ tour in Iowa during which Sanders is visiting counties that voted for former President Obama in 2008 and 2012 and for President Trump in 2016 to help ensure skeptical voters that he can beat Trump in a general election. … The endorsements come from members of several unions, including the autoworkers of America and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.”

TIME OUT: WELL PACKAGED PEANUTS

New Yorker: “Timing is the life force of comics. Without a sensitivity to the rhythms and the music—a.k.a. the reality—of life, a comic strip will arrive D.O.A., nothing more than a bunch of dumb pictures. … The reader doesn’t just look at Charlie Brown, Linus, Lucy, and Snoopy but reads them as musical notes in a silently heard composition of hilarity, cruelty, and occasional melancholy. In 1950, the comics page was a more or less settled territory into which very few new features could be shoehorned, and, from the get-go, ‘Peanuts’ was marketed as a space-saver. The strip was created out of four equally sized panels, which allowed it to run horizontally, vertically, or stacked two by two. … Who would’ve thought that such a hard-nosed commercial decision would catalyze one of the greatest works of popular art of the twentieth century?”

TRUMP LEANED ON UKRAINIAN LEADER FOR BIDEN DIRT

WSJ: “President Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, to ‘look into’ former Vice President Joe Biden’s son and said he would direct his personal lawyer and attorney general to reach out to Mr. Zelensky to ‘get to the bottom of it,’ according to a document released by the White House designed to memorialize a July phone call between the leaders. The document also revealed that Mr. Trump, before asking Ukraine to examine actions by Mr. Biden’s son, reminded Mr. Zelensky that the U.S. sends security aid to Ukraine. ‘I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine,’ he said. ‘We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time.’ He contrasted the U.S. aid with what European countries do to help Ukraine. According to the document released by the White House on Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump didn’t make an explicit link on the call between the U.S. aid—which he had ordered a hold on a week earlier—and an investigation into Mr. Biden’s son.”



Trump lawyer: State Department directed involvement - WashEx: “President Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani said he began dealing with Ukrainian officials at the behest of the State Department. During an interview Tuesday evening on Fox News, Giuliani was prompted to respond to a Washington Post report in which White House insiders complained about how he was improperly ‘injecting himself’ into U.S.-Ukraine relations. ‘Man, I really did,’ Giuliani said sarcastically. ‘And you know who I did at the request of? The State Department. I never talked to a Ukrainian official until the State Department called me and asked me to do it.’ Holding up his mobile phone, Giuliani said he reported every conversation he had to the Trump administration and that evidence of this communications with the State Department were all on the device.”



Pelosi heats up impeachment rhetoric, but not her go-slow approach - Roll Call: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s announcement Tuesday that the House is in an ‘official impeachment inquiry’ gave no hints of how or whether it would accelerate any Democratic effort to remove President Donald Trump from office. Pelosi said she directed the six House committees conducting oversight of the Trump administration to move forward ‘under that umbrella’ of an impeachment inquiry — but gave no details about how the day-to-day approach would differ. In that way, Pelosi appeared to stay on a measured Democratic approach that for months has fallen short of raising public support for impeachment — particularly with the Trump administration’s unyielding rejection of congressional subpoena power — and put off potentially stronger moves toward impeachment.”



Poll shows reason for her caution - WaPo: “Amid a groundswell of support for impeachment proceedings among House Democrats, a new poll finds a majority of Americans do not favor ousting President Trump from office. Thirty-seven percent of voters say that Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 57 percent say he should not be impeached, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday morning. … The poll shows a stark partisan divide on the question of impeachment. Among Democrats, 73 percent support impeachment, while 21 percent are opposed. Among Republicans, only 4 percent support impeachment, while 95 percent are opposed. Trump’s overall job approval rating remains in the range it has for nearly his entire presidency, with 40 percent of voters approving of how he is handling his job, and 55 percent saying they disapprove.”



Silver: Will Dems learn lessons of Russia probe? - FiveThirtyEight: “Despite Trump being quite unpopular, and despite the public largely buying Democrats’ interpretation of the fact pattern on Russia — most polls find that a majority of the public thinks that Trump sought to obstruct the investigation into Russia, for instance — impeachment was a soundly unpopular proposition. … The politics of impeachment on Ukraine may be different than on Russia. But Democrats should take public opinion seriously. That doesn’t mean you always have to do the poll-driven thing. But don’t wish the numbers away because you don’t like them, or presume that they’ll change in your favor, or assume there won’t be consequences for taking an unpopular action. More specifically for Democrats, their failure to persuade the public that Russia warranted impeachment offers several potential lessons if they are to proceed on Ukraine.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I just have a political science question regarding the 2020 Senate race in Kansas. Kris Kobach lost the governor’s race in 2018 and is now running for the GOP nomination for Senate (yinz know this already). I was wondering do voters’ think differently when selecting a governor rather than a Senator? Kobach was too right-wing for the Topeka state House as an executive, but as a legislator in Washington? Does it make a difference that electing a Democratic Governor is vastly different than a Democratic Senator with vastly different consequences politically? Hopefully my question makes sense.” – James Belany, Pittsburgh



[Ed. note: The first thing to remember, Mr. Belany, is that there’s precious little science in politics. Like many of the humanities, political theory and the study of campaigns and elections, got squeezed into a faux “science” during the middle of the last century. To that I say: Phooey! The science at play in your question could be social psychology, though. Would the voters of Kansas feel differently about a radical senator than they would a radical governor? Maybe there’s something to that. But maybe there’s another discipline to consider: Mathematics. There were three candidates for governor in 2018, but maybe only two for Senate in 2020. Could Kobach slide by in a binary election especially when Republican voters are storming the polls in a presidential year? Maybe. But that doesn’t change the fact that the GOP would much rather not have to deal with Kobach. Not only does he increase the degree of difficulty in Kansas, but Democrats running in other states can use his comments and record against his fellow Republicans.]

Chortle if you will at my Cubbies misfortune -- but just wait until next year!” – Stephen J. Tock, Dwight, Ill.



[Ed. note: I can’t go so far as to say that I felt “bad” for the Cubs, but I can say that I admire your determination, Mr. Tock. And we can all be proud to say that the National League Central continues to be the best, most competitive division in baseball. And with three games left against the Cards, I’m sure your squad will try hard to avenge the Wrigley sweep!]

HAPPY HUMP DAY

AP: “A veterinarian has prescribed antibiotics to a camel owned by a Louisiana truck stop petting zoo after a woman bit the 600-pound (272-kilogram) animal to free herself from under its weight. Iberville Parish Sheriff's Office documents obtained by The Advocate on Monday accuse Florida couple Gloria and Edmond Lancaster of throwing treats for their unleashed dog into Caspar the camel's enclosure at Tiger Truck Stop. The couple told deputies the camel attacked the dog, but the sheriff's office said the couple had provoked the animal before it sat on Gloria Lancaster. She'd crawled under barbed wire to retrieve her pet. Gloria Lancaster told officers she had to bite the camel to free herself. Truck stop manager Pamela Bossier said a veterinarian prescribed Caspar antibiotics as a precaution.”

Pelosi made the announcement following a meeting of the House Democratic Caucus at the Capitol, saying that ""the president must be held accountable"" for what she called the ""betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections.""

The only Democratic hopeful to explicitly come out against impeachment was Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii. Speaking on Fox Business' “Kennedy” on Tuesday night Gabbard said she thinks impeachment would be very ""divisive"" for a country that is already divided.

PELOSI ANNOUNCES FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP

“Donald Trump has abused his power, obstructed justice, and violated his oath of office. He puts his political interests over our national interest,” tweeted Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. “I agree with @SpeakerPelosi— no one is above the law. He must be impeached.”

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who first called for impeachment proceedings to begin in May after Special Counsel Robert Mueller spoke publicly about the findings of his Russia investigation, tweeted on Tuesday evening, “In 2016, Trump welcomed foreign adversaries to meddle in our democracy for his own gain. Now he appears to be using the same playbook to remain in power.""

Mueller’s probe was intended to examine Russian election interference and whether President Trump's campaign colluded with Russian officials during the 2016 election. In the report, Mueller said he could not exonerate the president on obstruction of justice but that investigators did not find sufficient evidence to establish charges of criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign.

Booker added, ""I applaud Speaker Pelosi's announcement of an impeachment inquiry—it’s our one remaining path to ensuring justice is served.”

Pelosi specifically charged that the Trump administration had violated the law by not turning over an intelligence community whistleblower's complaint concerning a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Citing testimony that the director of national intelligence is blocking the release of that complaint, she said: ""This is a violation of law. The law is unequivocal.""

GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN

Trump allegedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The president vowed earlier Tuesday to release a ""complete"" transcript of his call with Zelensky on Wednesday, though it's unlikely to settle the issue in Congress.

Joe Biden has acknowledged that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board.

""This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,"" Pelosi said Tuesday. ""Therefore, today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella.”

Following Pelosi’s announcement, Biden tweeted, “Pressuring the leader of another nation to investigate a political opponent — to help win an election — is not the conduct of an American President.”

Earlier Tuesday, Biden called Trump’s alleged actions “an abuse of power.”

“They undermine our national security,” Biden tweeted. “They violate the oath of office. If we allow a President to get away with shredding the United States Constitution — that will last forever.”

In remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Monday, Trump denied linking the Ukraine aid money to an investigation of the Bidens.

“No, I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said. But, he also repeatedly called the Bidens' actions in Ukraine a “disgrace,” acknowledged that Biden had come up during the call and added: ""It's very important to talk about corruption. ... Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?""

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., did not immediately release a statement, but sent out a somewhat-cryptic tweet Tuesday night, writing only: ""Billionaires should not be able to control our political system.""

During a press conference earlier on Tuesday Sanders said, “If you're going to go forward with impeachment. You're going to have grounds to do it. I happen to believe they're authorized to do it, but you got to lay it out.”

In a statement, former Texas rep. Beto O’Rourke said he is “grateful to Speaker Pelosi for opening an impeachment inquiry into President Trump” and called her announcement “a defining moment for our country.”

“For more than two years, even as I was running for Senate in Texas, I have been clear that I support impeachment,” O’Rourke said. “We all must come to terms with what we face: a lawless president who has obstructed justice and undermined our democracy by inviting a foreign power to intervene in 2016, and who is doing it again in 2020.”

Entrepreneur Andrew Yang tweeted on Tuesday, “Given the President’s latest actions I think impeachment is the right path forward.”

Yang added: “Asking foreign leaders for political help in return for aid and then suppressing your own agency’s inquiry is egregious. There have to be limits and Congress is right to act.”

In a follow-up tweet, Yang wrote, “A reminder that successful impeachment requires a majority vote in the House and then two-thirds in the Senate. Given that there are 53 Republican Senators one would need 20 of them to support impeachment to be successful. That is highly unlikely unless there is some huge shift.”

He added that he still agrees that moving forward “is for the best,” saying it will allow for a more thorough investigation “that may unearth new details.”

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., tweeted simply, “The House did the right thing.”

Former Maryland Congressman John Delaney released a statement following the announcement saying he agreed with Pelosi’s decision to move forward with an official impeachment inquiry, adding that “she deserves our support.”

""The President’s behavior, combined with the administration’s refusal to cooperate, leaves her no other choice,"" Delaney added. ""Our nation can only be as strong as the rules that govern it.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called Pelosi's announcement ""an overdue but important step.”

""Now the impeachment inquiry must move forward with the efficiency and seriousness this crisis demands,"" she said. ""The House needs to vote on articles of impeachment—and when it comes to the Senate, I will do what the Constitution requires.”

Billionaire hedge fund manager Tom Steyer said he applauded Pelosi and Democrats in Congress who are calling for an investigation into Trump’s alleged criminal behavior.

“Removing Trump from office has always been about doing what’s right, not what’s politically convenient,” Steyer said. “We built a nationwide movement to impeach a lawless president and defend our democracy. This is just the beginning.”

Earlier this month, Steyer told Fox News' Bret Baier during an interview on “Special Report” that he thinks President Trump is “the most corrupt president in American history” and that he has “more than met the criteria for impeachment.”

Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., did not react on social media, but in an interview on CNN on Tuesday night said the announcement is “a moment of truth for the country,” adding that “sooner or later it had to come.”

He went on to say that the announcement is also “a moment of truth for the Republican Party.""

A total of 172 House Democrats have now signaled support for an impeachment inquiry. A simple majority of House members present and voting would be required to impeach the president. A highly unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-controlled Senate would be needed to convict and remove Trump from office.

Vice President Mike Pence would then take office in that scenario and become the 46th President of the United States.

But, the upping of polling and donor thresholds – more modest than the doubling of the criteria from July’s second round to this month’s third round – may not significantly winnow the field of White House contenders still standing after October’s debate.

The DNC announced on Monday that to qualify for the November showdown, candidates must reach at least 3 percent in four approved national or early-voting-state polls. That’s up from the 2 percent needed to reach the stage at the September and October debates and up from the 1 percent needed in three approved surveys for the June and July debates.

OCTOBER DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY DEBATE TO BE HELD IN OHIO

But, to tamper down any criticism from the early voting states, the DNC added another way to satisfy the polling criteria – reaching 5 percent in two qualifying surveys in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina – the first four states to vote in the nominating calendar.

The window for the polling is from Sept. 13 to seven days before the still-unannounced November debate. In previous debates, candidates had until two weeks before the showdown to reach the polling criteria.

""Qualification period ends 1 week (not 2 weeks) before the debate, giving candidates more time to qualify,"" DNC communications director Xochitl Hinojosa tweeted.

The other threshold – fundraising – also saw a slight raising of the bar. To make the cut, candidates will have to receive campaign contributions from 165,000 individual donors. That’s up from 130,000 for the September and October debates and from 65,000 for the first two rounds of showdowns. Candidates also will have to receive 600 unique contributions from each of 20 states, the District of Columbia or U.S. territories.

The DNC’s faced criticism over its thresholds for months from many of the lower and middle-tier candidates, who argued that the criteria forced them to concentrate on boosting donor contributions at the expense of retail politicking in the early voting states. And, some activists and party leaders in the early voting states have also criticized the DNC for winnowing the record field of candidates – which topped off at roughly two-dozen contenders this summer – before voters actually got to vote in the primaries and caucuses starting this coming February.

""The DNC is using polling to winnow the field even further, when it's voters and caucus-goers who should be determining our nominee,"" said Shannon Beckham, a spokeswoman for Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet's presidential campaign.

And, Galia Slayen, a spokeswoman for Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, told Fox News that ""as the DNC continues to make the rules up as they go along, Governor Bullock will remain focused on bringing his message of a fair shot for every American directly to voters on the ground.""

Both Bennet and Bullock were on the debate stage in July for the third round but failed to qualify for this month's showdown and it appears unlikely either will make the cut for October's debate.

The new thresholds shouldn’t be much of a problem for many of the leading contenders – such as former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Kamala Harris of California, as well as South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

2020 DEMOCRATS FUME AT DNC OVER DEBATE THRESHOLDS

Some of the other six candidates likely to make the October debate are not sure bets to qualify for November’s showdown. That group consists of Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

As he has in the past, Yang praised the DNC, tweeting, ""Kudos to the DNC for raising the thresholds in a fair and transparent manner as well.""

Some of the candidates, including Booker and Buttigieg, quickly used news of the new thresholds to reach out to supporters with fundraising emails.

Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro and billionaire philanthropist and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer – who've also made the cut for October’s showdown – have yet to hit 3 percent in any polls since the November qualifying period kicked off earlier this month. And, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who's just one poll away from making the October debate, also has yet to reach 3 percent in any approved surveys.

A new qualifying poll – a Monmouth University survey in New Hampshire – is set for release on Tuesday."

If you did, hold on to those memories. It might be the last relaxing moment you'll have for a while. We're about to wreck your peace of mind.

It turns out that all is not well on this blue planet of ours, far from it. Indeed, it appears that the Earth itself is facing what we're going to call tonight, an existential threat from climate change.

Now, what does the term ""existential threat"" actually mean, you ask? Honestly, we don't know. But it sounds absolutely terrifying.

CLIMATE CHANGE PROTESTS SNARL DC TRAFFIC AS BIZARRE SCENES UNFOLD IN CAPITAL

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., presidential candidate: The climate change is real. It is an existential threat to our country and the entire planet.

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., presidential candidate: If NATO is about the common defense, the biggest existential threat is climate change.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, presidential candidate: This is climate change. It really is the existential threat.

Julian Castro, presidential candidate: We're going to have to address the most existential threat to our nation and the world, climate change.

Beto O'Rourke, presidential candidate: On climate change, the greatest existential threat that we face.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., presidential candidate: We are facing a climate crisis, it represents an existential threat to who we are as human beings.

""A threat to who we are as humans."" Well, there are a number of questions here. Let's see if we can unpack them.

The first one: is climate change real? That's an easy one. Of course, it's real. Climate always changes.

If you're in the United States, for example, the ground that you're standing on right now was not so long ago really covered with glacial ice a mile thick. Now, it's not covered in glacial ice a mile thick. So what happened?

What happened is climate change. That's been happening since the Earth cooled. Is human activity accelerating climate change? Can we reverse or slow climate change? Despite what they tell you, no one really knows.

But the real question here has nothing to do with climate science. It has to do with people who pretend they understand climate science. Do those people actually believe what they're saying?

This is what climate activism has become -- a performative stunt, mixed with hypocrisy. These are the people who promised to crack down on your cheeseburgers while flying across the country, on private jets.

Well, let's see. Here was Kamala Harris recently talking at a CNN town hall about how red meat contributes to the absolutely existential threat of climate change.

Harris: As a nation, we have actually have to have a real priority at the highest level of government around what we eat and in terms of healthy eating, because we have a problem in America.

Erin Burnett, CNN host: But would you support changing the Dietary Guidelines?

Harris: Yes.

Burnett: You know, the food pyramid, what people are eating?

Harris: Yes.

Burnett: So reduce red meat specifically.

Harris: Yes, I would.

Got that? Kamala Harris is a good person, and because she is a good person -- a much better person than you are -- she cares about the existential threat of climate change so much, that she is willing to forgo red meat. That's what she told CNN viewers recently.

But when she is in the pork producing state of Iowa, though, it's a very different story. Just this past weekend, Harris attended the Annual Polk County Democratic Party Steak Fry. She took her turn working the grill posing for the cameras.

And by the way, so did all of the other Democratic candidates. Liz Warren was there, Beto O'Rourke, even Cory Booker, who says he is a vegan. Organizers grilled more than 10,000 steaks over the weekend. Tape of the event shows plumes of ozone destroying meat smoke rising heavenward. The candidates standing amidst all of this seemed wholly unconcerned.

Are you surprised? Don't be surprised. This is what climate activism has become -- a performative stunt, mixed with hypocrisy. These are the people who promised to crack down on your cheeseburgers while flying across the country, on private jets. No one says a word about it.

Last week, millions of concerned progressives took part in the so-called climate strike. In their wake, they left mountains of litter. On Monday in Washington, climate activists demanded change by blocking roads, causing gridlock, and throwing confetti on the ground.

Well, if you're under 40, you might be surprised to learn that people didn't use to express concern about the environment by littering. That used to seem weird, but then the point of environmentalism used to be about nature and preserving it and protecting it.

The point now is very different. The point now is political power. You gin up a crisis and you demand the population submit to your will, or else. And as you do that, of course, you don't need to fight fair or acknowledge democracy or make a rational case for your position. You do whatever it takes. You'll even use children, if it helps.

Just today, for example, a 16-year-old Swedish girl named Greta Thunberg addressed the United Nations at the behest of climate activists. Here's part of what she said:

Thunberg, climate change activist: This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school, on the other side of the ocean. Yet, you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you? You have stolen my dreams, my childhood with your empty words.

We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is the money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you? If you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil, and that I refuse to believe.

You stole my childhood? Do what I want you to do, or else you're evil?

How do you respond to statements like that? The truth is you can't respond. And of course, that's the point.

When you use children to demand power, they become a kind of human shield. You can hide safely behind them, no one can criticize you.

But who would do something that unscrupulous? Anyone who would do that is someone who would literally do anything to seize control. And that's exactly what they're doing.

Many users on Twitter were disturbed by Spicer’s stay in the competition, blasting DWTS as a “disgrace” for having Spicer on the show, and calling the former White House press secretary a “Nazi” while blaming “Trumpsters” for his advancement in the competition:

“#DWTS not watching you this year putting somebody like Sean Spicer on your show is an insult to the American people”

“but let’s be real spicer should have been sent home”

“Nope done with @abc after they put spicer on #DWTS”

“All the old Republican grandmas that watch Dancing With The Stars are gonna keep Sean Spicer on the show WAYYY longer then he should be huh? #DWTS”

“I want him to go back to his cocaine and hookers and get off my television. #DWTS is a disgrace for having him on. I tape the show and fast forward past him and Sean Spicer.”

“These “party over country” people have gone too fucking far. Voting to keep Sean Spicer on #DWTS ?? Absolutely shameful.”

“Sean Spicer? I’ll never again watch this show. #DWTS”

“But as we’ve all see with Sean “DWTS” Spicer, and Sarah “I’m now a Fox “News” Employee” Huckabee Sanders, they’re not being black balled as they should be.”

“Here’s your weekly reminder. Fuck Sean Spicer and the people who thought profiting off of his shittiness was a great idea. You took my favorite show away from me. #DWTS”

“Ugh. I’m watching DWTS as I grade and why is Sean #Nazi Spicer getting votes? #trumpsters”

Spicer told Breitbart News Sunday that he views his participation in DWTS as an opportunity to send a message to the Hollywood elites who typically snub right-leaning Americans.

“Hollywood largely shuns folks on the right. This is an opportunity to show that we’re human beings. We’re good people. We care about the country, that we’re out there,” Spicer said.

“And hopefully, it sends the message – especially if people get out there and vote – it really lets them know that there are people out there that aren’t just on the left that watch television and care about those causes– that you know people on both sides of the aisle are good people, that we care about this country and we can’t just shun one side of the political aisle,” he continued.

“I hope our side gets engaged out there and really, really sends a message that everybody deserves to go out and enjoy shows and have fun and that’s what the show’s all about,” he added.

Last week, Spicer released a lighthearted video, pledging to stand up for Americans “forgotten” due to their “lack [of] rhythm and moves.”

“For 28 years Dancing with the Stars has had plenty of great dancers full of rhythm and moves. This fall, let’s finally vote for someone who represents people like us,” the narrator stated in the video.

“I’m going to fight for every American who has been overlooked and forgotten because they lack rhythm and moves,” Spicer added:"

“What did we find in our research? We found that analyzing data from a combination of large Italian epidemiological studies, we found that people who regularly consumed pizza had a decreased risk of digestive cancer and myocardial infarction,” Gallus said during his speech.

He also clarified that the pizza he’s talking about — made and consumed in Italy — is not entirely healthy in and of itself. As also outlined in the studies his team published between 2003 and 2006, he and his team suggested that the consumption of an Italian pizza’s Mediterranean ingredients indicated a healthier Mediterranean diet, which has been linked to a healthier lifestyle.

“Our interpretation is that pizza may represent a general indication, a marker, of the Italian diet that, as other Mediterranean diets [have], has been shown to have major health benefits,"" Gallus said.

“In conclusion, we recommend eating Italian pizza, but please, please hold the pepperoni for health reasons,"" he added.

Elizabeth Warren is making a major television and digital ad buy to spread her message to potential primary voters.

Warren’s presidential campaign announced on Tuesday that the populist Democratic senator from Massachusetts, who’s released one progressive policy proposal after another through the primary campaign, will spend eight figures – or at least $10 million – to place spots on TV and on-line in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. Those are the first four states to vote on the primary and caucus calendar.

WARREN SURGING IN NEW 2020 POLLS IN NH, NEVADA, IOWA

“Right now, our biggest expense as a campaign is our staff, but as the campaign heats up, it will be on media to reach potential voters,” Warren campaign manager Roger Lau wrote in an email to supporters.

Lau explained that spots “will be more digital than old-school broadcast television, and we have built an in-house staff to produce videos and ads rather than adopt the consultant-driven approach of other campaigns (and the big commissions and fees that come along with it).”

The Warren campaign confirmed to Fox News that the digital ads would start running immediately, and that they’re currently reserving time for the TV commercials. Officials said the buy would last for several months.

The Warren campaign released three of the ads on Tuesday – 15-second, 30-second and one-minute spots.

“Take any of our big problems – health care, climate change, gun violence. Corruption is at the root of why our government won’t act,” Warren says in the 15-second ad. “I know what’s wrong. I know how to fix it. And I’ll fight to get it done.”

SANDERS UPS THE ANTE WITH WEALTH TAX HIGHER THAN WARREN'S PLAN

Lau also announced the campaign is continuing to expand its staffing. While Warren already has a formidable team in the four early-voting states, Lau spoke of ""hiring state directors and organizers in a number of states that have primaries and caucuses in March. And we're targeting our resources to invest in places that will be critical to keeping the House, taking back the U.S. Senate and regaining ground in key state legislatures in 2020.”

The $10 million ad buy and the expansion of campaign staff suggest that Warren’s fundraising remains strong. After a slow start earlier in the year, the senator hauled in over $19 million in the April-June second quarter of fundraising."

Bernie Sanders is preparing to renew his focus on early-voting states Iowa and New Hampshire, as frustrations grow inside his presidential campaign over slumping poll numbers and a series of taxing clashes between lower level staff and national leadership.

The campaign's in-house production team recently began shooting its first television ads of the 2020 cycle in Iowa, likely quieting at least one source of dissent among some senior aides, who have been pushing for Sanders to get on the air.

But concerns over the trajectory of Vermont independent's second presidential bid as new evidence emerges that Sen. Elizabeth Warren is beginning to peel away at his base are becoming more pronounced, along with a realization that a failure to launch in Iowa and New Hampshire could spell the campaign's early doom.

Sanders began his 2020 run dedicated to hammering away at the argument that he, more than any other Democrat, was best positioned to deny President Donald Trump a second term. But Sanders is no longer running as the party's lone progressive populist, as he did in 2016. Warren's emergence in that space, and the sense among some Democrats that she is a better bet to successfully unite the party than Sanders or Biden has altered the shape of the race.

The new dynamic came into sharp relief last weekend, when a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom survey showed Warren surging into the top tier in Iowa with former Vice President Joe Biden. Sanders, who was well off the pace in third, trailed her in the state by more than 10 points, 22% to 11%.

Perhaps more worrying to some Sanders supporters, the Massachusetts progressive also overtook her colleague from Vermont with what has traditionally been his most reliable bloc of support: voters under 35, among whom Warren now leads in Iowa, 27% to Sanders' 22%.

Asked by a reporter on Sunday about the poll, Sanders said the campaign's internal numbers painted a different picture. But even if the senator and his staff have reason to believe the Iowa race is closer than the most recent polling indicates, interviews with two senior aides to Sanders revealed growing concerns that the Hawkeye State and New Hampshire could be at risk of slipping away.

The twin sources of frustration and internal debate, both aides told CNN, was a schedule that too often takes Sanders away from the early voting states and a perception among staff, especially in Iowa, that the campaign has been wrong-headed in its decision to put off investing there in television ads.

""It can't be this national campaign anymore. He's got to go on TV in Iowa. He's got to park himself in Iowa. He's got to show that he's the underdog fighting back,"" one of the aides told CNN.

The aide, who said that staff in Iowa has been ""screaming for Bernie to get on TV"" there, suggested that Sanders had overestimated his strength in Iowa and New Hampshire.

""I think there was initially this sense of, which candidates always want to do, they want to expand,"" the aide said. ""And so I think there was a sense in the campaign, probably a little bit wrongly, that he had an Iowa and New Hampshire base and was going to focus on South Carolina and Nevada and California and expanding. And I think what this is showing is he's got to just go back to basics.""

In an interview, campaign manager Faiz Shakir brushed off criticism that Sanders has spent too much time building a national brand, along with the suggestion that it had cost him in those early states. He pointed to Sanders' recent travels in Oklahoma, North Carolina and Colorado as evidence that the campaign is prepared for the long haul.

""We have four fingers in the air,"" Shakir said, referencing the start of the fourth quarter of 2019. ""We are ready to finish strong and, with that, comes an adjustment in the time and attention we pay to certain parts of the map and that includes Iowa and New Hampshire.""

But Shakir conceded that the shrinking calendar meant the campaign's margin for error was diminishing too.

""The arguments that we have framed up for the public, they need to come through clearly in this next period of time,"" he said of Sanders' efforts in Iowa. ""I think delivering that message is absolutely critical here in the fourth quarter. We have put ourselves in a position to do very well.""

A second senior aide also indicated that a move to focus more on Iowa and New Hampshire was imminent. That doesn't mean Sanders plans to eschew future trips to join striking union workers outside those states, as he did this week, but that Iowa, where he kicked off his ""Bernie Beats Trump"" tour on Monday, is soon likely to serve as a de facto base of operations.

Shakir also told CNN that Sanders, after parting ways earlier this year with the firm that made his ads in 2016, has personally decided to use the campaign's in-house team to produce his first round of television spots. The group, a fixture on the trail with the Sanders, began shooting elements for its first TV ad this week. Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have already begun to run ads in the state. Warren on Tuesday announced a planned eight-figure TV and digital ad buy in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.

""We have a major advantage over other campaigns in that we have a lot more cash on hand,"" Shakir said of the campaign's approach to ad expenditures. ""You can use it correctly, or you can squander it. We are trying to stick to our strategy and make sure we are using our resources wisely.""

The back-and-forth over the campaign's media strategy has been pointed, but both of the senior aides who spoke to CNN touched on a more fundamental source of internal tension: the increasingly public disconnect between state level operations, most notably seen in New Hampshire, and the campaign's national leadership.

Those conflicts have been stoked, the aides said, by mostly lower level staffers, many of them Sanders loyalists from 2016 who have bristled at the 2020 leadership's tone and more exacting standards.

A progressive consultant familiar with the campaign's operation in New England told CNN that unsettled Sanders diehards pushed, successfully, for the ouster of former New Hampshire state director Joe Caiazzo, who was reassigned to Massachusetts. Caiazzo, who declined to comment, has been replaced by Shannon Jackson, a more familiar face who managed Sanders' 2018 Senate race.

According to a new poll from Monmouth released Tuesday, the campaign is facing increased headwinds in New Hampshire, where Warren -- as she did in Iowa -- has surged into the top-tier with Biden. Sanders, again, sits third with 12% to Warren's 27%.

The progressive consultant also said the campaign's internal politics were complicating efforts to broaden its appeal and forge alliances with outside grassroots groups.

""It's very confusing,"" the progressive consultant said of communications with the campaign. ""I have talked to people that hear from all of them -- that hear from (senior adviser) Chuck Rocha, that hear from (senior adviser) Jeff Weaver and that hear from Faiz. But my understanding is that if you want to get to Bernie, it's not Faiz that you go through. It's Weaver or (deputy campaign manager) Ari Rabin-Havt.""

For new groups only beginning to make sense of the progressive firmament, the process of sorting out the campaign hierarchy can be a turn-off -- especially when Warren's team has developed a reputation for proactively seeking out those less seasoned activists.

One of the senior Sanders aides conceded that the growing pains have been, at times, sharper than many expected. In 2016, the aide said, the absence at times of a coherent national operation meant that field staff had much more autonomy. The shakeup in New Hampshire, and lower level changes in Iowa, were largely instigated by internal arguments rooted in differing ideas about how to run a successful campaign without betraying the spirit of Sanders' first run.

Shakir conceded that there is a level of angst between staff at the local level and the national office. But he insisted that the decisions being made are part of a desire to see the vision of the candidate executed.

In the end, he argued, the campaign team -- from top to bottom -- needs to trust in Sanders' judgment.

""We all take our leadership and follow the direction of Bernie Sanders and he drives the strategy, and the argument of how we are going to win people over,"" Shakir said. ""I think to the extent that there's other people on campaign who have different views, I respect and appreciate that.

""But ultimately I believe strongly that we all take our guidance from the top -- and he is the one driving this train."""

Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden are virtually deadlocked in a close race for the Democratic presidential nomination, according to a new national poll out Wednesday from Quinnipiac University.",2019-09-25,CNN,Warren and Biden virtually deadlocked in new national poll,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/25/politics/elizabeth-warren-joe-biden-poll-quinnipiac/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden are virtually deadlocked in a close race for the Democratic presidential nomination, according to a new national poll out Wednesday from Quinnipiac University.

The poll shows Warren at 27% and Biden at 25% among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, and is the first major national poll to show Warren in this strong a position since polling in Iowa and New Hampshire also found the two knotted at the top of the field. Although the difference between the candidates' numbers is within the poll's margin of error, the Massachusetts Democrat's new ranking is the first time a candidate other than the former vice president has topped the pack since Quinnipiac started posing the question in March.

The two candidates also saw change in support from the poll's August results, when Biden was at 32% and Warren was at 19%.

The poll reflects a tightening Democratic race as well as Warren's increasing consolidation of the progressive vote and making inroads among black voters. Her support among that crucial demographic bloc has climbed dramatically in recent months, from 4% in July to 8% in August to 19% now. Biden's support among black voters, meanwhile, has dipped from 53% to 40% over the same time. The numbers signal a potential softening in a key base for Biden's campaign, as well as an ability for Warren to grow support beyond white college-educated liberals.

In the new poll, Warren and Biden are followed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (16%), South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (7%) and California Sen. Kamala Harris (3%). All other candidates got 2% or lower in the poll.

* To the surprise of no one, Donald Trump’s political operation is trying to raise money off the House Democrats’ impeachment effort.

* In New Hampshire, a Monmouth poll released yesterday showed Warren narrowly leading Biden, 27% to 25%. Sanders is third with 12%, followed by Buttigieg at 10%. No other candidate reached double digits.

* In California, a new UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll, conducted for the Los Angeles Times, found Warren leading Biden, 29% to 22%. Sanders was third with 19%, while Kamala Harris, in her home state, was fourth with 8%.

* The former vice president has not, however, lost his lead in all of the latest polls: a national Emerson poll released yesterday showed Biden narrowly leading Warren, 25% to 23%, with Sanders very close behind at 22%. As Rachel noted on last night’s show, this is the same poll that found Andrew Yang at 8%.

* Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, still struggling to break through in the Democratic presidential race, endorsed the impeachment process against Trump yesterday. Marianne Williamson and Andrew Yang reached the same conclusion yesterday. Tulsi Gabbard, however, criticized impeachment as “divisive.”

* Speaking of the Hawaii congresswoman, Gabbard was at 2% support in New Hampshire in the aforementioned Monmouth poll, which appears to qualify her for next month’s presidential primary debate.

* And with just six weeks remaining before Kentucky’s gubernatorial election, incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin (R) shook up his campaign leadership this week, shifting operational control to Michael Antonopoulos, a longtime GOP strategist."

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) fears the Democrat-led House impeachment effort could lead President Trump to ultimately claim vindication, he told reporters in Iowa on Tuesday.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced on Tuesday the launch of an official impeachment inquiry, using the whistleblower complaint as a launching point. This follows months of far-left “Squad” members pushing impeachment and Pelosi’s continuous stiff-arming of such efforts.

“I’m announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry,” Pelosi announced at a Capitol Hill press conference.

“I am directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry,” she said.

“The President must be held accountable. No one is above the law,” she continued, citing the Founding Fathers.

“Getting back to our founders, in the darkest days of the American Revolution, Thomas Paine wrote that times have found us, that times found them to fight for and establish our democracy,” she added. “The times have found us today”:

Nancy Pelosi: ""Therefore today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry."" pic.twitter.com/HyHKD39N7M — Axios (@axios) September 24, 2019

Several 2020 Democrat candidates called for the inquiry prior to Pelosi’s announcement.

“This isn’t a partisan issue—or shouldn’t be,” Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) tweeted. “When the president of the United States is working with other countries to interfere with our elections, we should begin impeachment proceedings.”

“It was true when I said it in 2017 running for Senate in Texas and it’s still true today: President Trump should be impeached,” former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D) added.

“The House must impeach. It must start today,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wrote.

Noticeably absent though, was Sanders. While he believes that “impeachable offenses” exist, he signaled that Democrats may be acting too hastily and would not say if he would support the impeachment effort if it made it to the Senate.

“Here’s the dilemma that you have,” Sanders told reporters in Iowa on Tuesday, according to BuzzFeed News. “Now I don’t know — I’ll tell you that my gut is that the average Republican in the Senate and the House is totally intimidated by President Trump.”

“And at this particular point, I have my doubts, like you all. I have my doubts that any Republican, or very few, would vote against him,” he continued, detailing his fear. Sanders worries that – in the event that the impeachment effort gets passed on to the Senate – which would require a two-thirds majority (or 67 votes) – it would fail and Trump would claim vindication as a result.

“I know and you know what [Trump] will do: ‘I am vindicated! … I am vindicated!’ And I think that is a fact that has to be taken into consideration,” Sanders said, according to BuzzFeed.

“But what do you do when you have a president who has acted in an unconstitutional way? If that is the findings,” Sanders continued. “Again, I don’t want to judge it. I think that is the face. But there is a process that has to take place.”

Sanders reiterated that he believes there are impeachable offenses, and he has signaled such before, floating an inquiry in May:

It is obvious that the President is a pathological liar who does not understand the Constitution. The fact is that if Mr. Trump continues to disregard the right of Congress to subpoena, he will leave House Members with no choice but to begin an impeachment inquiry. — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) May 23, 2019

“I believe that there are impeachable offenses. That’s my view. But my view is not good enough,” Sanders said, according to BuzzFeed News.

“I happen to believe that there are grounds to do it. But you have to lay it out,” Sanders explained, refusing to reveal his thoughts on the controversy surrounding Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine.

“I know I’m a little bit old-fashioned. I like to see the evidence before I talk about things. I read the papers and I read what I read,” Sanders said. “But I don’t know that I know enough at this point to make any definitive statement.”

Fellow presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has taken her position on impeachment farther than Sanders, telling CNN’s Newsroom on Tuesday that impeachment would “further tear apart an already divided country.”

“Impeachment is something — that is a step that will divide the country and will be worse off for our country,” she said."

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts -- the other progressive superstar in the Democratic nomination race who’s soared ahead of Sanders in the surveys.

The swipes signal what could be a newly aggressive phase for the Vermont senator's campaign, with a hitherto ""truce"" between him and Warren beginning to crack as his polling numbers suffer. One progressive strategist with ties to the independent senator’s campaign said that when it comes to negating Warren’s surge in the polls, the Sanders team has been “flailing around.”

WARREN SURGES IN LATEST POLLS, TIES BIDEN FOR TOP SPOT; SANDERS SLIPS TO DISTANT THIRD

Sanders and Warren met last December before they launched their presidential bids and agreed to not criticize each other while on the campaign trail. That non-aggression-style pact has largely held – with both teaming up at recent presidential debates to defend their ""Medicare-for-all"" proposals.

And both had refrained from attacking each other.

“Bernie and I have been friends for many, many years. Long before I ever got into politics. And I don’t see any reason that that should change,” Warren told reporters recently after being asked if she was going to start painting contrasts with Sanders.

Sanders – who’s making his second straight White House run – has repeatedly said when asked about Warren that “Elizabeth is a friend of mine” and noting that the two “have been friends for over 20 years.”

But that’s apparently not stopping some leading members of Sanders' team from taking aim at Warren.

The Sanders campaign’s national press secretary Briahna Joy Gray recently criticized Warren on Twitter for failing to support Sanders’ national rent control proposal. Warren has said she doesn’t think such a policy would be realistic across the country. Gray used Warren’s viral zinger from the July debate in targeting the senator from Massachusetts.

Gray also jabbed at Warren over her campaign's lack of a collective bargaining agreement with her staff since recognizing her campaign workers’ union in June.

Sanders also faced a bit of criticism as he met the demands from his own unionized campaign staff.

In another case, senior Sanders adviser Warren Gunnels took aim at Warren’s climate change plan. As Vox noted, Gunnels retweeted a tweet from a New York City councilman saying that Warren had “missed the mark.”

As they were battling for second place in the polls most of the summer, the Sanders campaign repeatedly insisted that former Vice President Joe Biden was the main target. The former vice president was the clear front-runner in nearly all polling from his entry into the race in late April until recent days, when a slew of new surveys suggested that Warren had tied Biden for the top spot.

WARREN LANDS BACKING OF PROGRESSIVE GROUP THAT ENDORSED SANDERS IN HIS 2016 PRESIDENTIAL BID

While Sanders kept his focus on Biden, Warren surged in polling and, in a well-publicized moment, she landed the endorsement of the progressive group the Working Families Party, which backed Sanders four years ago in his first White House bid. Meanwhile, Sanders in recent weeks has replaced a couple of key staffers in Iowa and New Hampshire, the states that kick off the presidential primary and caucus calendar.

“They thought their opponent was Biden because they thought he was the next Hillary Clinton,” noted the progressive strategist, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely.

The strategist argued that the Sanders campaign failed to realize that Warren was the real threat, spotlighting that “their strategy was wrong. They were looking at Biden as the main opponent when it was really Warren.”"

Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, the two populist standard-bearers in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.

The National Union of Healthcare Workers – which backed the independent senator from Vermont in his 2016 Democratic presidential primary bid – announced on Thursday that they’ll provide resources and grassroots support to both Sanders and Warren.

SANDERS CAMPAIGN SWIPES AT WARREN, TESTING TRUCE BETWEEN THE PROGRESSIVE 2020 CHAMPIONS

The union explained that the gap between Warren and Sanders in a vote by union members was close enough that the union’s executive board decided on Wednesday to endorse both candidates.

“This is not your typical union endorsement. We didn’t tell our members how to vote, they told us,” union president Sal Rosselli said. “We trust our members and their judgments and the outcome of this vote reflects the collective will of members from San Diego to the Oregon border. Our members clearly like both Senators Warren and Sanders.”

“After reviewing the vote totals, our executive board felt that an endorsement of both candidates was most fair due to the closeness of the vote,” he explained.

Union members voted from Sunday through Wednesday, with members able to cast a ballot for up to three candidates. Warren received the most votes, appearing on 61 percent of ballots, with Sanders showing up on 50 percent of ballots.

Home-state Sen. Kamala Harris appeared on 34 percent of ballots. She was endorsed by the union in her races for California attorney general and her 2016 election to the U.S. Senate. Former Vice President Joe Biden was fourth in the voting, showing up on 32 percent of ballots.

WARREN SURGES TO TIE BIDEN IN LATEST POLLS, SANDERS SLIPS TO THIRD

The splitting of the endorsement comes as some in the Sanders campaign are starting to take aim at Warren. Both Sanders and Warren have – to date – refrained for criticizing each other.

But new national and early voting state polls released over the past week indicate Warren soaring into a tie with long-time front-runner Biden for the top spot in the 2020 Democratic battle, with Sanders dipping to third.

WARREN EDGES BIDEN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE POLL, GAINS GROUND IN NEVADA

Warren – the populist senator who’s pushed out one progressive policy proposal after another – stands at 27 percent among Democratic voters and independents who lean Democratic in a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday morning, with the former vice president commanding 25 percent. Warren’s two-point edge is well within the survey’s margin of error.

Warren has surged 8 percentage points since Quinnipiac’s previous national poll, which was conducted late last month, with Biden -- long considered the frontrunner in the race -- dropping seven points.

Sanders, the independent populist longtime lawmaker who’s making his second straight White House bid, stands at 16 percent in the new survey, basically unchanged from last month.

""After trailing Biden by double digits since March in the race for the Democratic nomination, Warren catches Biden,"" Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said. ""We now have a race with two candidates at the top of the field, and they’re leaving the rest of the pack behind.""

Going beyond the poll’s topline numbers, Malloy noted that if you “dig a little deeper…the reasons behind Warren's rise become more clear. She generates a lot of excitement as a potential nominee. On top of that, half of Democrats want a presidential candidate that supports big changes - even if it means things are harder along the way.""

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg stands at 7 percent in the new Quinnipiac poll, with Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 3 percent. Everyone else in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential contenders registered at 2 percent or less.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Many political analysts downplay the results of national polls, pointing to the fact the race for the presidential nomination is a battle for the states and their delegates to the parties' nominating conventions. But the Quinnipiac results follow similar findings in polls released the past couple of days in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, the first three states to vote in the presidential primary and caucus nominating calendar.

Warren stands at 27 percent among likely Democratic presidential primary voters in New Hampshire in a Monmouth University survey released Tuesday, with Biden at 25 percent. Warren’s 2-point edge is well within that survey’s sampling error. Sanders is in third in the poll, at 12 percent.

A couple of hours after the release of the Monmouth poll in New Hampshire, a new survey in Nevada, which holds its caucus following the New Hampshire primary, also indicates a close contest between Biden and Warren.

A USA Today/Suffolk University survey put Biden at 23 percent, Warren at 19 percent and Sanders at 14 percent.

And in Iowa, a Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll released this past weekend indicated Warren at 22 percent, Biden at 20 percent and Sanders a distant third at 11 percent. The Des Moines Register surveys have long been considered the gold standard in Iowa polling.

The release of the surveys come as Warren’s campaign on Tuesday announced they’re spending a whopping $10-million to run digital and TV ads over the next few months in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, which votes fourth in the nominating calendar and holds the first southern primary.

WARREN DISHING OUT $10 MILLION TO RUN DIGITAL AND TV ADS IN ALL FOUR EARLY VOTING STATES

The release of these new live telephone operator polls comes with just over four months to go until the first votes in Iowa. But that can be an eternity in campaign politics.

Warren continues to downplay her surge in the surveys, telling reporters a few days ago that, “I don’t do polls. We are still months away from the Iowa caucuses and the first primary elections.”

The pollsters agree. Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray noted that “it is important to keep in mind that the race is still very much in flux.”

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted September 19-23, with 1,337 registered voters nationwide – including 561 self-described Democratic voters independents who lean towards the Democrats – questioned by telephone. The sampling error for the survey Democratic nomination questions is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) would fare better than Joe Biden (D) in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup against President Trump, a Daily Kos/Civiqs poll released on Thursday found.

Civiqs surveyed 1,548 registered voters September 21-24, 2019, and asked respondents whom they would support in hypothetical general election matchups featuring the president and top Democrat presidential candidates.

“If the election for president of the United States were held today, and the choices were Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren, who would you vote for?” the survey asked.

In that scenario, 48 percent of voters chose Warren, and 44 percent chose Donald Trump, taking her lead outside of the 2.8 percent margin of error.

The survey asked the same question, replacing Warren with Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA). While Biden also experienced a four-point advantage over the president – 47 percent to 43 percent – he did not earn as much national support as Warren, who edged him out by one point. It further signals an increase in the Massachusetts senator’s electability.

The poll found Sanders with a two-point advantage over Trump – 46 percent to 44 percent – and Harris tied with the president with 44 percent each:

The House Intelligence Committee released the complaint on Thursday, which detailed accusations from an anonymous “whistleblower” who did not have firsthand knowledge of the conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The alleged “whistleblower” contends that Trump was “using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.”

However, as the transcripts of the conversation, which were released Wednesday, showed, Trump’s explicit use of the word “favor” was used in reference to Crowdstrike and the questions surrounding election meddling and hacking efforts. Biden and his son were not mentioned until later in the conversation. The transcripts show no quid pro quo or “pressure,” and the Ukrainian president confirmed such.

Nonetheless, Democrats – particularly 2020 Democrat candidates – are claiming that the “whistleblower” complaint is “explosive” in nature and contend that it proves Trump committed “crimes” in the White House.

Joe Biden (D), whose alleged corrupt practices remain at the center of the controversy, proclaimed that Trump “believes he is above the law” and attempted to convince Americans across the board that the Democrats’ latest investigation and impeachment effort is not a partisan issue:

We have a President who believes there is no limit to his power, who believes he can do anything and get away with it, and who believes he is above the law. This isn’t a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. This is a national issue. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 26, 2019

“The whistleblower complaint is explosive,” Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) wrote. “It paints a sobering picture of a president abusing his power for his own political gain against US national security interests.”

“Americans deserve to know the truth—that’s why an impeachment inquiry is so critical & our moral obligation,” he added:

“This is only the tip of an iceberg of corrupt, illegal and immoral behavior by Trump,” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) assessed. “The House must thoroughly investigate Trump’s cover-up of this call and his other attempts to use government resources to help his re-election”:

Like Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) declared that Trump “believes he is above the law” and predicted that he will “continue to commit crimes from the White House” until lawmakers take action.

“The House needs to vote on articles of impeachment—and when it comes to the Senate, I will do what the Constitution requires,” she wrote:

Julián Castro (D) described the president as an “active national security threat” and said the complaint “exposed a criminal effort to extort political dirtywork from a foreign government, and a massive cover-up orchestrated by the White House”:

The #WhistleblowerComplaint has exposed a criminal effort to extort political dirtywork from a foreign government, and a massive cover-up orchestrated by the White House.

Both Castro and Beto O’Rourke (D) called on the House to cancel its scheduled recess to begin impeachment proceedings.

“As the whistleblower made clear: Every day Trump is in office, our democracy is less safe. We can’t wait to act,” O’Rourke added:

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) tweeted a clip from her Wednesday appearance on Anderson Cooper 360, urging Americans to refrain from viewing the latest Democrat effort to take down Trump as a partisan issue:

Cory Booker (D-NJ) are losing to some guy named Andrew Yang.

The four most recent national polls show Yang beating Booker in every single one. These same polls show Yang tied with O’Rourke in three, but shellacking him in a fourth.

The Economist has Yang at two points, Paddy with two points, and Booker with — LOL — zero.

Emerson has Yang at eight(!) points, Paddy with one point, and Booker with two.

Quinnipiac has Yang at two points, Paddy with two points, and Booker with — LOL — zero.

Morning Consult has all three sitting at three points.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Julian Castro, a former HUD secretary under President Obama, are polling even worse than Paddy and Booker.

The most interesting bit of polling news, though, is the total collapse of Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who is only polling a little better than Yang. But in the Emerson poll, which is only a few days old, he beats her eight points to four points.

In just ten weeks, Harris has dived from having 15 points of average national support from Democrat primary voters to just 4.9 percent, which is where she sits today, according to the Real Clear Politics poll of polls.

The Real Clear Politics poll of polls has Yang at 3.3 percent, which puts him ahead of O’Rourke at 2.4 percent, Booker at 1.7 percent, Klobuchar at 1.6 percent, and Castro at 1.3 percent.

Right now, the race for a 2020 Democrat presidential nomination is a three-way race… period. And it’s not even close.

In that poll of polls, former Vice President Joe Biden leads with 28 percent, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VA) with 22 and 17 percent, respectively.

The only positive thing you can say about Mean Little Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s poll position is that he’s at the top of the bottom tier with 5.9 percent support, which only puts him a little ahead of Yang’s 3.3 percent. But…

In that Emerson poll, Buttigieg is behind Yang — eight to six.

The 44-year-old Yang has no political experience. He’s a private sector success, an entrepreneur, lawyer, and CEO. His big idea is to take away everyone’s private health insurance by forcing us into a government-run Medicare For All. He wants to confiscate guns and give everyone $1,000 every month as a guaranteed income, for some crazy reason.

In other words, he’s a crank.

But so are all the others.

The difference is that Yang has some charisma and a sense of humor. Unlike Booker and Paddy and Klobuchar and Castro and the Mean Little Mayor, Yang is likable and self-deprecating. And that is all it takes to beat a bunch of left-wing stiffs these days.

“I said, ‘I don’t do cocaine,’ and he said, ‘I hear that all the time -- but your urinalysis says otherwise,’” Walker told The State.

“Dorn Emergency Room personnel informed (Walker) that his stomach pains were a direct result of ingesting multiple illegal drugs, in particular, excessive cocaine,” his lawsuit claimed, The State reported in January 2018.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has overtaken Joe Biden and zoomed into first place nationally, according to polling from the far-left Quinnipiac.

Since polling of the 2020 Democrat primary began, and since he announced his candidacy, former Vice President Joe Biden had held a stubbornly wide lead against all comers.

That lead is now gone.

Thanks to a 15 point swing, Quinnipiac now has Warren leading Biden 27 to 25 percent. That is an eight point jump since August for Warren and a seven point collapse for Biden.

The only other contender who’s close is Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VA), with 16 points.

Still chugging along in single digits, despite more positive news coverage than anyone not named Barry Obama, is South Bend, IN, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, with just seven percent support.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) is DOA with just three percent support. She has lost four points, more than half of her support, since August.

The Quinnipiac poll, which surveyed 1,337 registered voters between September 19-23, does not appear to be an outlier. An Emerson poll conducted between September 19-23 of 462 Democrat primary voters, showed Biden with 25 percent national support, while Warren nips at his heels at 23 percent. Sanders is right there with 22 percent, which basically makes the national race a three-way tie.

In those two most recent national polls, Robert Francis “Paddy” O’Rourke, has hit bottom with 1 and 2 percent support, which puts him behind some guy named Andrew Yang.

In the Real Clear Politics poll of national Democrat primary polls, Biden enjoys an eight point lead over his rivals. But that lead was once closer to 20 points. Over the summer, the erosion has been slow and steady.

The same is true in the early primary states.

In the latest two polls out of Iowa, where the first voting begins in that state’s caucus on February 3, Warren leads by eight and two points.

In New Hampshire, which votes on February 11, Warren is ahead by two points in the latest poll.

In Nevada, the third primary state, Biden’s lead has slipped to just four points.

What’s happening in the fourth primary state, South Carolina, which is supposed to be Biden’s firewall, we just don’t know. There hasn’t been any polling there since early August. The older polls show Biden with a 20-plus point lead.

Does all of this mean Warren is the new frontrunner?

No.

What it means is what I’ve been saying all along: summer is over and the race has officially begun.

Over the summer, as rank-and-file Democrats did what all Americans do — fish, swim, camp, run the kids around, vacation, go to the movies, barbecue, picnic — they parked their votes on Biden. But now that the kids are back in school, they are taking a closer look at who’s out there and, finally, they are seeing that Joe Biden is no longer Joe Biden.

While Biden was never anything close to a good campaigner, now that he’s 188 years-old, he is even worse. Already, his eyes has exploded, his teeth have come loose, and he’s lost his train of thought too many times to count. Joe Biden is an old, old man. He’s frail when a president must be virile.

On top of that, unlike Trump, no one has to lie to prove Biden is a racist.

So now that the race has finally begun, people are giving Warren a serious look. In the past, though, whenever she has been under the spotlight, Warren has dissolved into a puddle of neuroses, so we will have to see how she does now. What’s more, she has a huge problem with attracting black voters, which might have something to do with this whiter-than-white woman having spent decades impersonating an American Indian in order to advance her academic and political careers.

During her own five days in the sun over the summer, Kamala Harris completely melted down, but there is still a chance voters might give her a second shot.

Whatever happens, an objective look at the Democrat field tells you why House Democrats are pursuing impeachment of President Trump. This is a very weak and extreme group, and Democrats know that without a recession, Trump will probably win a second term against any one of these extremists.

He smeared Ilhan Omar. He smeared San Francisco. He denied the existence of an obvious delay in military aid to Ukraine. He denied that the name of the Democratic Party is the Democratic Party. He confused champion mountain climbers by claiming that champion mountain climbers had tried and failed to climb his border wall.

President Donald Trump made 79 false claims last week, mixing some fresh false accusations and pointlessly false anecdotes into his usual stew of repeat favorites.

Seventy-nine false claims is down from 90 the week prior to last , Trump's highest total since we started counting at CNN on July 8, but it was still his fourth-most-dishonest of these 11 weeks. His weekly average since July 8 is now 59 false claims.

Trump made 29 of last week's 79 false claims at his campaign rally in New Mexico. He made 13 more in his White House meeting and press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, seven on Twitter. The rest came in a smattering of events, interviews and exchanges with reporters.

Twenty-seven of the false claims were about the economy, 15 about Democrats.

The most egregious false claim: The Ukraine delay

Facing difficult questions about why he delayed military aid to Ukraine, Trump and his allies have tested out a variety of possible explanations. At one point last week, though, Trump decided to just deny the very existence of the delay.

""I didn't delay anything,"" he told reporters . ""We paid the military aid, to the best of my knowledge.""

The money was paid, but that payment very clearly came after a delay. By this week, Trump was openly defending the delay he had said did not happen.

""I'd withhold again and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine, because they're not doing it,"" he said -- which is also not true.

The most revealing false claim: Maligning Omar, again

This time, Trump amplified a tweet from a conservative commentator, Terrence K. Williams. Posting a video of Omar dancing, Williams accused her of partying on the anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

The most absurd false claim: The name of the Democratic Party

For sheer weirdness, it is hard to top Trump's story about the mountain climbers and the border wall. But we say his claim about the Democratic Party did it.

Some of Trump's false claims are so bizarre that it's almost embarrassing to check them. When you do, some of his supporters will inevitably accuse you of humorlessness or pettiness.

Whatever: this is a comprehensive tally, and we must do our solemn duty. Thus, we must point out that ... the name of the Democratic Party is the Democratic Party.

We must do so because Trump has repeatedly and solemnly insisted that the actual name is the ""Democrat Party.""

He said last week, again, that he is not only using ""Democrat Party"" because it sounds worse but because that is the party's official name. He urged the Democrats to make a change to the nicer ""Democratic Party,"" in which case he might call them that.

Yes, he might just be trolling. No, that does not make any of this less confusing.

Here is a list of false claims from last week that we had not previously fact checked in a weekly update:

Google and the 2016 election

""Did you see Google? He said I may have lost 2 million to 10 million votes according to this character that worked at Google, right? And we still won. How the hell did we win? Everybody was against us. How did we win? How did we win? This is a Google executive. From two million to 10.5 million votes, and we won."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Hunter Biden and the investigation

""The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, want to stay as far away as possible from the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son, or they won't get a very large amount of U.S. money..."" -- September 21 tweet

""And, you know, he really made it a -- it was an offer. It was beyond an offer. It was something where he said, 'I'm not going to give billions of dollars to Ukraine unless they remove this prosecutor.' And they removed the prosecutor supposedly in one hour. And the prosecutor was prosecuting the company of the son and the son."" -- September 22 exchange with reporters after Coast Guard briefing in Houston

Facts First: There is no public evidence that Hunter Biden was ever himself under investigation.

The investigation, as far as we know, was into the business activities of Mykola Zlochevsky, who owned a natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, for which Hunter Biden had sat on the board of directors since 2014. The United Kingdom had begun investigating Zlochevsky before Hunter Biden joined the board.

""Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws -- at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,"" Shokin's successor as prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Bloomberg.

Joe Biden and ""the case""

""Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case. So, somebody ought to look into that."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters at meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: There is no evidence that Biden ever called on Ukraine to remove its chief prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, from a case involving Mykola Zlochevsky, the owner of a natural gas company on whose board of directors Biden's son Hunter Biden sat. Rather, Biden, like the US government more broadly and several US allies, tried to get Shokin fired.

Trump's allies might argue that calling for a prosecutor's firing was even worse than calling for him to be taken off a particular case. But there is a key difference given the context.

Had Biden called for Shokin to be taken off a particular matter in which his son had a stake, this would seem to suggest that his motivation was helping his son. But Biden calling for Shokin's firing, without mentioning that particular case, was consistent with the international concern about Shokin's performance.

Joe Biden's previous comments

""This is a very dishonest thing that Joe Biden did. And then he said he never spoke to this son. Does anybody believe that one? But then he also said, long before, that that he did speak to his son. So he lied, again."" And: ""I mean, give me a break, he's already said he spoke to his son. And now he said, yesterday, very firmly. Who wouldn't speak to your son? Of course, you spoke to your son. So, he made the mistake of saying he never spoke to his son. He spoke to his son."" -- September 22 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure

Facts First: Biden has not previously said that he did speak to his son about his overseas business dealings. Rather, it was Hunter Biden who said that there was a conversation on the subject, according to a New Yorker : Biden has not previously said that he did speak to his son about his overseas business dealings. Rather, it was Hunter Biden who said that there was a conversation on the subject, according to a New Yorker article in July.

That article said this: ""As Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: 'Dad said, ""I hope you know what you are doing,"" and I said, ""I do.'""

Once is more than never, so Trump can fairly point out the contradiction -- though the New Yorker article did not offer evidence that the father-son exchange was detailed. Regardless, the elder Biden was not contradicting himself; he was contradicting his son.

She was a real professional. Never treated me well, but I certainly respect her as a professional."" -- September 17 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

Facts First: Trump had met Roberts, who : Trump had met Roberts, who died on September 17. As CNN's Brian Stelter noted , she interviewed him at Trump Tower for a story that aired on ABC in December 1999. (Roberts also questioned him by phone during the 2016 campaign; she asked him asked about children using his campaign rhetoric to bully other children. He called the question ""very nasty."")

Trump, who has been interviewed many hundreds of times, could well have just forgotten the 1999 meeting, but his statement was false regardless of his intent.

San Francisco, the ocean and needles

""We'll start with those two cities and we're looking at San Francisco, we're looking at Los Angeles. And we're looking at all of the things that are happening. You know, there's tremendous pollution being put into the ocean, because they're going through what's called a storm sewer. That's for rainwater. And we have tremendous things that we don't have to discuss pouring into the ocean. There are needles, there are other things. Lot of bad -- lot of -- it's a terrible situation. That's in Los Angeles and in San Francisco. And we're going to be giving San Francisco -- they're in total violation -- we're going to be giving them the notice very soon."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

Facts First: There is no evidence for Trump's claim that San Francisco has significant pollution, including needles, being sent into the ocean through storm sewers.

San Francisco Mayor London Breed called Trump's claims ""ridiculous,"" saying in a statement that the city's sewer system ""ensures that all debris that flow into storm drains are filtered out at the city's wastewater treatment plants."" David Lewis, executive director of nonprofit Save the Bay, told the Mercury News: ""In San Francisco, all solids in that stormwater and sewage water are removed. And what comes out of the plant is sometimes cleaner than the water that many people in this state are drinking.""

The San Francisco Chronicle reported : ""Storm drain runoff is piped to one of two city treatment facilities, the Southeast Treatment Plant in the Bayview neighborhood or the Oceanside Treatment Plant near the zoo. Any pollutants would be treated at those points if they haven't already been filtered out at catch basins beneath city streets, according to the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. 'We haven't had any (recent) problems with syringes,' said SFPUC spokesman Tyler Gamble.""

Mountain climbers and the wall

""We actually built prototypes and we have, I guess you could say, world-class mountain climbers. We got climbers. We had 20 mountain climbers. That's all they do; they love to climb mountains. They can have it. Me, I don't want to climb mountains. But they're very good. And some of them were champions. And we gave them different prototypes of walls, and this was the one that was hardest to climb."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: There is no evidence that 20 mountain climbers, or any number of champion mountain climbers, were recruited to test Trump's border barriers. When The Daily Beast : There is no evidence that 20 mountain climbers, or any number of champion mountain climbers, were recruited to test Trump's border barriers. When The Daily Beast contacted several top mountain climbers and governing body USA Climbing, nobody had any idea what Trump was talking about. Customs and Border Protection refused to comment to CNN, referring questions to the White House.

The wall and San Diego

""You know in San Diego, California, is very difficult, always complaining, not doing great, but they wanted a wall in San Diego -- good mayor in San Diego, by the way. They wanted a wall, and I said, 'You know what, let's build it someplace else, because California, you know, once we build it, they'll complain.'"" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: It is possible that someone or some group from San Diego told him they wanted a wall, but as we : It is possible that someone or some group from San Diego told him they wanted a wall, but as we reported at the Toronto Star, there is no basis for Trump's repeated suggestion that the city itself wanted a wall. San Diego's city council voted 5-3 in 2017 to express opposition to the proposal, and even the Republican mayor Trump was praising here, Kevin Faulconer, has made clear that he is opposed

The name of the Democratic Party

Trump said he calls the Democratic Party the ""Democrat Party"" not only because ""Democrat"" sounds worse than ""Democratic"" but because ""that's their name, the Democrat Party""; he said, ""Frankly, they should probably change it -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The party is already named the Democratic Party. We realize this is a strange-sounding fact check, but Trump has repeatedly : The party is already named the Democratic Party. We realize this is a strange-sounding fact check, but Trump has repeatedly insisted that the actual name is the Democrat Party, so we are not going to let it slide.

A tweet on Ilhan Omar

Trump shared a tweet from comedian and conservative commentator Terrence K. Williams, who alleged that Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar was dancing on the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In his own comment above Williams' tweet, which Williams later deleted, Trump wrote , ""IIhan Omar, a member of AOC Plus 3, will win us the Great State of Minnesota. The new face of the Democrat Party!"" -- September 18 tweet

Facts First: The footage of Omar dancing was from September 13, 2019, not the anniversary of September 11. She was attending an event, called Breaking Concrete Ceilings, connected to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's Annual Legislative Conference.

Nuclear weapons

""Our nuclear was getting very tired. They hadn't spent the money on it. And now we have it have it in, as we would say, 'tippy-top shape.' Tippy-top. It's — we have new and we have renovated and it's — it's incredible."" --September 20 press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

""As you know, we've spent tremendous and hopefully -- and we pray to God we never have to use it, but we've totally renovated and bought new nuclear. And the rest of our military is all brand new. The nuclear now is at a level that's it's never been before."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: ""Tired"" is vague and subjective, but experts reject that characterization of the US nuclear arsenal prior to the Trump administration. Obama did spend money on the arsenal, launching a modernization program that is expected to : ""Tired"" is vague and subjective, but experts reject that characterization of the US nuclear arsenal prior to the Trump administration. Obama did spend money on the arsenal, launching a modernization program that is expected to cost more than $1 trillion . And experts say that Trump has not yet implemented significant changes to the arsenal.

""I feel comfortable saying that the scientific studies to date have yet to provide any evidence that the nuclear arsenal was 'tired' or in any way at risk of being ineffective if called upon,"" said Scott Kemp, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Nuclear Security and Policy.

""I am not aware that Trump can claim to have done anything for the state of the nuclear arsenal — but nothing urgent needed to be done anyway,"" said Kemp, who served as a State Department adviser on arms control early in the Obama administration.

Alexandra Bell, senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control & Non-Proliferation, said that, with the exception of a hypothetical top-secret development she doesn't know about, ""everything is the same"" in the deployed arsenal ""as it was in January 2017"" -- aside from reductions the US made to fulfill its obligations under the New START treaty with Russia.

While ""the Trump administration has certainly requested and received increased funding for nuclear modernization,"" Bell said, ""this is a trajectory we have been on since 2010 "" -- and ""he hasn't really changed anything yet.""

""Budgets clearly demonstrate that we have spent enormous of money on nuclear modernization over the past decade,"" said Bell, who served in the State Department under Obama from 2010 to 2017.

A wall at the Democratic convention?

Talking about the large barriers he had visited at a California border site and is planning to erect elsewhere, Trump was asked if that's what he wants around the White House grounds. He said, ""No, but that's what the Democrats are putting up around their convention...They're building a big wall around their convention. Which they should do."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

""You know what I saw the other day? Where the Democrats are having their convention, their national convention. They just gave out a tremendous contract. You know what it's for? They're building a big wall around the building, they're building a big wall, a massive wall."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: There is no evidence that the Democrats are planning to erect a big wall around the convention site. ""It's not true,"" Democratic National Committee spokesman Brandon Gassaway told CNN.

There will likely be some sort of security fencing in the vicinity of the convention, as is standard, but there are no known plans for a wall even slightly resembling the steel-and-concrete structure Trump visited in California.

The Green New Deal and cars

Trump said that, under the Democrats' Green New Deal proposal, people would be limited to one car: ""Now, under the Green New Deal that (energy revenue) all goes away, that all goes away. It all goes away. You can forget it. No more cows, no more airplanes, no more trips. A single car. Make it electric -- single car, you're not allowed to travel more than 162 miles."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The congressional : The congressional resolution on the Green New Deal does not include any restrictions on the number of cars people could own or the number of miles they could drive.

The proposal calls for ""overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible, including through investment in zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing; clean, affordable, and accessible public transit; and high-speed rail.""

Bay of Pigs veterans

""You know just before the last election, the Cubans from Miami, where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote close to 90%. They gave me the Bay of Pigs award. Can you imagine, right? The Bay of Pigs award."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump got an endorsement, not an award, from the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association. The : Trump got an endorsement, not an award, from the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association. The endorsement was the first the association had ever made in a presidential election, so Trump could fairly boast about it. But still, an award and an endorsement are different things. (Trump claimed in August to have received an award from the Log Cabin Republicans, which told CNN it gave him an endorsement but not an award.)

Trump's Cuban American support in 2016

""You know just before the last election, the Cubans from Miami, where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote close to 90%..."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump did not get anywhere near 90% of the Cuban-American vote, in Miami or elsewhere, according to multiple analyses : Trump did not get anywhere near 90% of the Cuban-American vote, in Miami or elsewhere, according to multiple analyses reported on by the Miami Herald when Trump claimed in 2017 that he had received ""84%"" of the Cuban-American vote. The Herald noted that estimates range from 50% to 58%.

The Herald reported: ""Mauricio Claver-Carone, former executive director of the US-Cuba Democracy PAC who was appointed by Trump to the Treasury Department, estimated that Trump won 58% of the Cuban-American vote based on his review of results from about 30 Miami-Dade precincts with large Cuban-American populations."" As the Herald reported, University of Florida professor Daniel A. Smith found that Trump's best performance with Cuban-American voters in any Miami-Dade precinct was 68%.

Military aid to Ukraine

Question: ""How do you explain the military aid, sir? How do you explain delaying military aid (inaudible)?"" Trump: ""Because I want Germany and I want France and I want the European Union to put up money. And I didn't delay anything. We paid the military aid, to the best of my knowledge."" -- September 22 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure

Facts First: Trump's administration did delay military aid to Ukraine. : Trump's administration did delay military aid to Ukraine. CNN , the Washington Post and the New York Times reported that Trump himself ordered the hold on the aid.

Trump was correct that the aid was eventually paid, but he was incorrect when he denied the very existence of a delay; the delay has been publicly discussed by members of Congress and by people who were serving in the Ukrainian government this summer. The Post reported that although the Trump administration notified congressional officials in February and in May that portions of the aid was going to be released, but the release didn't actually happen until September.

The estate tax

""And to keep New Mexico's farms, ranches and small businesses in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax or death tax so that you can now give your farm or your ranch to your children."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. His 2017 tax law raised the threshold at which the tax must be paid, from $5.5 million to $11.2 million for an individual, but : Trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. His 2017 tax law raised the threshold at which the tax must be paid, from $5.5 million to $11.2 million for an individual, but did not get rid of the tax entirely

It's also misleading to suggest that the estate tax had been a particular burden on farms and small businesses; very few of them were paying the tax even before Trump's changes came into effect. According to the Tax Policy Center, a mere 50 farms and closely held businesses were among the 5,190 estates to pay the estate tax in 2017, before Trump's tax law. The Center wrote on its website: ""The Tax Policy Center estimates that small farms and businesses will pay $20 million in estate tax in 2017, one-tenth of 1 percentage of the total estate tax revenue.""

Oil prices

""Our country is doing well. You look at so many different things. Look at all of the regulation cutting that allows us to do what we did. Look at what happened three days ago — where you have an attack like that and it takes out a big chunk of oil, and the prices go up $4, $5, and now it's heading down rapidly. That tells you — that would have happened years ago, it would have gone up $50. It would've doubled. And this was a blip."" -- September 20 press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: Though oil prices did head back downward after an initial spike after the attack on Saudi oil facilities, that initial spike was larger than $4 or $5: : Though oil prices did head back downward after an initial spike after the attack on Saudi oil facilities, that initial spike was larger than $4 or $5: Brent crude futures , the international benchmark, and West Texas Intermediate futures both rose more than $8, about 15% each, between the close of trading on Friday, before the attack, and the close of trading on Monday; it was the largest single-day percentage gain for Brent since at least 1988, Reuters reported

We can't fact check Trump's hypothetical about what might have happened to oil prices if the attack had occurred some unspecified number of years ago.

The cost of the Mueller investigation

""House Judiciary has given up on the Mueller Report, sadly for them after two years and $40,000,000 spent..."" -- September 16 tweet

""...they spent $40 million -- there's not a person in the room that I couldn't find something on with that."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The Mueller investigation cost $32 million, not $40 million, according to : The Mueller investigation cost $32 million, not $40 million, according to figures released by the Justice Department -- and the government is expected recoup about $17 million as a result of the investigation, according to a CNN analysis of the sentences handed out to people charged by Mueller.

The vast majority of this $17 million is expected to come from former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was ordered to forfeit assets and pay millions to the Internal Revenue Service.

Here's a list of claims we've fact checked before in one of our weekly updates:

Immigration

Mexican troops on the border

""And I want to thank the President of Mexico, who right now has 27,000 soldiers on our southern border. It's been incredible what's taken place in a short period of time."" -- September 22 speech at Howdy, Modi event in Houston

Facts First: The approximately 26,000 troops are split between the US border and Mexico's southern border. Trump himself said in late July that 6,000 of the troops were near Guatemala; speaking to the press in September, acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner Mark Morgan said , ""Since June, Mexico has deployed thousands of troops. They've created a new national guard within their country: 10,000 troops to the southern border; 15,000 troops to the norther border with the United States.""

Mexico's immigration assistance

""You know, Mexico has never done anything to impede people from pouring into our country, and now they're doing just the opposite. They've really been incredible."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: Mexico also took action to impede migrants from entering the United States during the Obama administration.

Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, noted that the Mexican government beefed up its border enforcement measures as part of a cooperation program with the US that aimed to address the 2014 surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America. ""The numbers of unaccompanied minors dropped as a result of this cooperation (and the two countries dealt with a second, smaller spike in 2016 the same way),"" Selee said. He added: ""The Mexican government has actually deported more Central Americans to their home countries since 2015 than the US government has, sharply limiting the number of migrants from that region that have made it to the US border.""

Building the wall

""Well, this section is 14 (miles), but we're building many that are 50 and 40 and 17 and different areas. We're building on many different sites all up and down along the border."" -- September 18 interview with Fox News' Ed Henry

""Well, you know we're building the wall and it's going up and it's going up fast."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

""Now, the wall still, obviously, has a ways to go, but we're building it at a breakneck speed."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: Trump was exaggerating the pace of border-barrier construction. No new miles of border wall had been built during Trump's presidency as of August, Customs and Border Protection told CNN's Geneva Sands. Sixty miles of existing barriers had been replaced over Trump's tenure in office, but Trump was incorrect that there are ""many"" sections of 50, 40 and 17 miles under construction.

Democrats and the border

Trump said the Democrats have an agenda of ""open borders."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Even Democratic presidential candidates who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests.

Human trafficking

""If you want to stop the drug smugglers and the human traffickers, how about the human traffic? And they traffic really for the most part in women, that's what they traffic in, it's women. They're not trafficking in men, they capture women and they bring them across the open borders and they don't go through ports of entry where you have guards standing there with guns and rifles and everything else. They go out into the desert areas and they hang a left or they hang a right and they come in."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Many human trafficking victims do indeed come through ports of entry, according to US experts on trafficking and according to international data.

Experts say that victims are more likely to be deceived into crossing the border willingly than kidnapped and put in the back of a vehicle. ""I have worked on human trafficking on multiple continents in multiple countries for more than two decades, and in all the work that I've done with trafficking victims, I have met one who was actually kidnapped and thrown into a car,"" Martina Vandenberg of the Human Trafficking Legal Center told CNN in January, when Trump was telling frequent stories about women being bound and gagged in cars.

Many victims, experts say, are tricked into coming to the US with promises of a good job. Others are coerced through threats to their families or themselves. While experts say there may be some cases like the ones Trump has described, they emphasize that such cases are in a small minority. In 2018, the UN International Organization for Migration found that ""in the last 10 years, almost 80% of journeys undertaken by victims trafficked internationally cross through official border points, such as airports and land border control points.""

Democrats

The Green New Deal, cows and planes

""Now, under the Green New Deal that (energy revenue) all goes away, that all goes away. It all goes away. You can forget it. No more cows, no more airplanes, no more trips."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The Democrats' Green New Deal environmental resolution does not call for the elimination of cows or planes.

Trump did not make up this claim out of thin air. A ""FAQ"" page that once appeared on the website of a leading Green New Deal proponent, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, calls for the government to ""build out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary."" In explaining why Green New Deal proponents were aiming to get to ""net-zero"" carbon emissions in 10 years rather than the more ambitious goal of zero carbon emissions at all, the FAQ said, ""We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren't sure that we'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.""

The FAQ was not an official party document and has not been broadly adopted by Green New Deal supporters. Its language about cows and planes does not appear in the text of the Green New Deal resolution many congressional Democrats have endorsed. The resolution calls for ""overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector"" and ""working collaboratively with farmers and ranchers in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector as much as is technologically feasible.

Popularity and accomplishments

Special election in North Carolina's 9th District

Trump said North Carolina congressional candidate Dan Bishop, who won a September special election, was down ""17 points three weeks ago,"" before Trump got involved. -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Bishop was not down 17 points in any : Bishop was not down 17 points in any public poll , though some did have him trailing by single-digit margins.

When we tweeted about this, Matt Wolking, deputy director of communications for the Trump campaign, responded ""Try harder"" -- pointing to a tweet by Jim Blaine, a Republican strategist, that included an apparent poll excerpt that showed Bishop down 14.

But 14 is not 17. And neither Wolking nor Blaine responded to our questions about who conducted the poll, who it was conducted for, when it was conducted, what its methodology was, or what its sample size was; Blaine's tweet did not include any of that information.

Special election in North Carolina's 3rd District

Trump said Greg Murphy, who won the special election in North Carolina's 3rd District, ""was up a couple of points"" before his victory. -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Murphy was leading by significantly more than ""a couple of points,"" according to public polling. One : Murphy was leading by significantly more than ""a couple of points,"" according to public polling. One late poll had him up by 11 points.

The poll was in line with pundits' expectations for the race, which was widely seen to be an easy Republican victory. Murphy was running in a district formerly held by the late Republican Rep. Walter Jones, who ran unopposed by the Democrats in the 2018 election; and Trump won the district by about 24 points in 2016.

Trump could have fairly said Murphy outperformed the polls, since he won by 24 points, but ""a couple of points"" is incorrect.

Suppression polls

""Now, if it's close, like it's in play, you know you wait two three four or five hours to see what it is, but they don't even take a breath because they're called suppression polls, and they're no different than all of the dishonest reporting that you people say. They're no different. They're suppression polls."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: There is simply no evidence that pollsters have manipulated their numbers to suppress the enthusiasm of Trump voters, as Trump has repeatedly alleged.

Veterans Choice

Trump boasted that he was the one who got the Veterans Choice health care Trump passed, saying, ""They've tried to get that for 45 years. They haven't been able to get it. But I'm good at getting things."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was : The Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was signed into law by Barack Obama in 2014. In 2018, Trump signed the VA Mission Act, which expanded and changed the program.

Foreign and military affairs

Venezuela's wealth

""Look at Venezuela: Venezuela, 15 years ago, was one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and today very sad, no food, no water, no nothing."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Venezuela was not one of the world's wealthiest countries 15 years ago.

The International Monetary Fund ranked Venezuela 67th in the world in 2004 by GDP per capita, at $4,019 (US) -- better than more than half of the world's countries, but nowhere near the top.

""Venezuela was one of the richest countries in the world 60 years ago. The richest in Latin America 40 years ago. But not 20 years ago,"" Ricardo Hausmann, a former Venezuelan planning minister and central bank board member, said in response to a previous version of this Trump claim. Hausmann, now a Harvard University professor of economic development, was chief economist of the Inter-American Development Bank from 1994 to 2000.

The war in Afghanistan

""We have hit — in Afghanistan, we have hit the Taliban harder than they've ever been hit in the entire 19 years of war."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters at a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: We'll ignore Trump's subjective claim about how ""hard"" the US is attacking the Taliban. ""Nineteen years of war,"" though, was a small exaggeration. The US invaded Afghanistan in October 2001, nearly 18 years ago. This was not a one-time slip though; Trump habitually says ""19 years.""

The Iran nuclear deal

""The problem was, the deal that was signed by the previous administration was a disaster — which, by the way, would be expiring in a very short period of time also. So you really don't have a deal. You know, that deal was a very short-term deal. So they made a deal, but it was for a very short period of time. So that deal would be expiring very soon."" -- September 16 exchange with reporters with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

Facts First: Some central provisions of the nuclear agreement with Iran were written to expire in the next 10 to 15 years. But the deal as a whole -- including a blanket prohibition on Iran developing nuclear weapons -- was written to continue in perpetuity. You can read a fuller fact check : Some central provisions of the nuclear agreement with Iran were written to expire in the next 10 to 15 years. But the deal as a whole -- including a blanket prohibition on Iran developing nuclear weapons -- was written to continue in perpetuity. You can read a fuller fact check here

ISIS fighters and Europe

""We have thousands of ISIS fighters and we want those fighters to be taken -- you're talking about, I think it's a big -- we have thousands of ISIS fighters that we've taken into -- we've defeated 100% of the caliphate. We are holding in various forms of prison. We're holding thousands of people. Many come from Germany, many come from France, many come from Holland -- really most of them come from various European countries. And we want them to take them back."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

""They mostly come out of Europe."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters at a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: According to Trump's own government estimates, a minority of ISIS fighters being held in Syria came from Europe.

James Jeffrey, Trump's special envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition, said August 1 that about 8,000 of 10,000 terrorist fighters who were then prisoners in northeastern Syria were Iraqi or Syrian nationals; there were ""about 2,000 ISIS foreign fighters"" from all other countries.

Trump himself tweeted in February to ask that European countries take back ""over 800"" ISIS fighters captured in Syria.

Remains from North Korea

""We've gotten our hostages back. We've gotten our great soldiers back who were killed — many of them. And many more are coming back. We have many more coming back. And the families of those — we call them 'our heroes.' And they were our heroes. And they're coming back."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: While North Korea returned some remains last year, it is no longer doing so. The US military announced in May that the remains program had been suspended for the rest of the 2019 fiscal year because North Korea had stopped communicating with the US agency responsible for the effort.

Trump could accurately tout the return of remains in the past tense: North Korea returned 55 cases of possible remains in the summer of 2018. But the remains are no longer being returned. You can read a longer fact check of this claim here

Trade

Unions and the USMCA

Trump said of his USMCA trade agreement, ""Unions love it."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The agreement is generally opposed in its current form by major US unions, who have demanded changes to the text; the president of the AFL-CIO federation : The agreement is generally opposed in its current form by major US unions, who have demanded changes to the text; the president of the AFL-CIO federation says it will be a ""disaster for workers"" if it is not amended. As The New York Times has reported, the United Automobile Workers and United Steelworkers, among other unions, have also demanded changes.

Trade deficit with China

Trump said the trade deficit with China was $500 billion, alleging that previous presidents allowed China to ""to take out $500 billion a year"" or even ""more than that"" including theft of intellectual property. -- September 20 exchange with reporters at meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: Trump refers to trade deficits as losses and surpluses as gains or takings, though this characterization is rejected by many economists. The US trade deficit with China has never been $500 billion; it was : Trump refers to trade deficits as losses and surpluses as gains or takings, though this characterization is rejected by many economists. The US trade deficit with China has never been $500 billion; it was $381 billion last year when counting goods and services, $420 billion when counting goods alone.

Aid to farmers

Talking about his tariffs on China, Trump said, ""And I'm taking care of our farmers out of that. We're helping our farmers. Our farmers were targeted, and they were targeted for $16 billion. And I made that up to them. We paid them the $16 billion and had tens of billions of dollars left over."" -- September 20 press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: It's incorrect that there are tens of billions of dollars left over in tariff receipts after accounting for the $28 billion Trump has pledged to farmers affected by his trade war with China. (The $16 billion Trump mentioned here was a : It's incorrect that there are tens of billions of dollars left over in tariff receipts after accounting for the $28 billion Trump has pledged to farmers affected by his trade war with China. (The $16 billion Trump mentioned here was a second announcement that followed an earlier $12 billion announcement. The China-specific tariffs have generated a total of about $30 billion, according to the US government's tracking data as of September 24.

Who is paying for Trump's tariffs on China

Trump said twice that China is ""eating the tariffs"" he has imposed on imports of Chinese products, and he said on a third occasion that the government was taking in the tariff revenue ""from China.""

Facts First: A bevy of : A bevy of economic studies has found that Americans are bearing the overwhelming majority of the tariff costs, and Americans make the actual tariff payments.

China's economic performance

Trump said four times that China is having its worst economic year in ""57 years.""

Facts First: China's second-quarter growth rate was the : China's second-quarter growth rate was the worst in 27 years . Trump has repeatedly made clear that he knows that this is the reported figure, but he has added additional years for no apparent reason.

History of the tariffs

On three occasions on which eh talked about tariff revenue, Trump said the US has never previously received ""10 cents,"" ""100 cents"" or ""billions"" from China.

Facts First: The US government has been charging tariffs on imported Chinese goods for more than two centuries, and it took in billions from such tariffs long before Trump imposed his own tariffs. (As always, we'll note it is US importers and consumers, not China, who have paid these tariffs.)

The Treasury received $14 billion from tariffs on China in 2014 , to look at one pre-Trump year.

Economy and energy

Automotive investments

""My relationship has been very powerful with the autoworkers — not necessarily the top person or two, but the people that work doing automobiles. Nobody has ever brought more companies into the United States. You know, I have Japan and Germany, and many countries have been bringing car companies in and opening plants and expanding plants. "" -- September 16 exchange with reporters with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

Facts First: Contrary to Trump's claims, there has been no boom in investment from Japanese, German, or other foreign automakers during his tenure. From Trump's inauguration through July, the Center for Automotive Research, a nonprofit that studies the industry, found 66 automaker announcements of new US manufacturing facilities, or expansions or updates to existing facilities. The center found 170 such announcements in Obama's (four-year) first term, 154 in Obama's second term, according to the center's Bernard Swiecki.

Just two Japanese car companies, Toyota and Mazda, have announced plans to build a US plant (together) during Trump's presidency; their joint venture is under construction in Alabama. There is no evidence Trump was personally responsible for this investment decision.

Trump has said since 2018 that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has told him that more Japanese carmakers will soon announce major US investments. But none of these companies has announced a new US plant since Toyota and Mazda introduced the joint venture in early 2018, though Japanese automakers have made additional investments in existing facilities and Japanese truck company Hino Motors has built a truck-cab assembly plant in West Virginia.

""We know of no German or Japanese automakers currently looking to place additional car or truck assembly capacity in the United States,"" said Kristin Dziczek, the center's vice president of industry, labor and economics.

Energy independence

""Well, we have the Strategic — if you look at what we have, we have tremendous amounts of oil in our country. We're independent of everybody now."" -- September 16 exchange with reporters

""So nice that our Country is now Energy Independent. The USA is in better shape than ever before."" -- September 18 tweet

""We're independent, as independent as we want, and we are now a net exporter of energy"" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: While definitions of ""energy independence"" vary, the US is not ""energy independent"" by any definition; it is : While definitions of ""energy independence"" vary, the US is not ""energy independent"" by any definition; it is expected to export more energy than it imports by 2020, according to the government's Energy Information Administration, but that has not happened yet. In the first five months of 2019, PolitiFact noted , the US also consumed more energy than it produced.

There have been occasional, brief periods where US exports have exceed imports or where its production has exceeded consumption, but this hasn't happened for a full recent year.

""The US is still a net importer of crude and refined products, although the trend of declining dependence on imports should continue due to increased domestic production of unconventional oil and biofuels and growing investment in export infrastructure following the 2015 repeal of the crude export ban,"" said Josh Price, a senior analyst for energy and utilities at Height Capital Markets. ""Most of these factors preceded President Trump and have not been significantly altered by administration policies.""

The decrease in US imports and increase in exports began before the Trump administration. Obama presided over a boom in liquefied natural gas exports and signed a bill lifting a 40-year-old ban on crude oil exports.

""The truth is that both of the presidents of this decade (President Obama and President Trump) have presided over an incredibly brisk expansion of our capacity to produce oil and refined products. Executive policy has had little to do with the explosive gains, which are attributable to technology and price,"" said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service.

It's worth noting that the US will still be using large quantities of foreign energy even if it does become a net exporter next year. In other words, it will not be completely independent from foreign suppliers.

Energy production

Trump claimed four times that the US had only recently become the world's largest producer of oil and gas; in one of the claims, he added a message of self-congratulation in the third person: ""Thank you, Mr. President!""

Facts First: The US has not just ""now"" or ""very recently"" become the world's top energy producer, and it did not achieve this status because of Trump's policies: it took the top spot : The US has not just ""now"" or ""very recently"" become the world's top energy producer, and it did not achieve this status because of Trump's policies: it took the top spot in 2012 , under Obama, according to the US government's Energy Information Administration. The US became the top producer of crude oil in particular during Trump's tenure.

""The United States has been the world's top producer of natural gas since 2009, when US natural gas production surpassed that of Russia, and it has been the world's top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded Saudi Arabia's,"" the Energy Information Administration says

Asian American unemployment

Facts First: Trump falsely claimed four times that Asian Americans are at their lowest-ever unemployment rate. The unemployment rate for Asian Americans was : Trump falsely claimed four times that Asian Americans are at their lowest-ever unemployment rate. The unemployment rate for Asian Americans was 2.8% in August -- higher than the 2.6% rate in December 2016, Obama's last full month in office.

Overall unemployment

""Our job numbers for African Americans are the best in history. You saw the new ones came out; they're even better than they were two months ago. Hispanic, the best in history. Asian, the best in history. Overall, they're phenomenal. The best in 51 years. And I think we'll soon be historic on that one too."" -- September 16 exchange with reporters with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

""We're doing -- we have this great economy. We're doing better than we've ever done. Our employment numbers are the best they've ever been and unemployment numbers also. We are doing great. But we should be cutting. There's no inflation."" -- September 18 interview with Fox News' Ed Henry

""And unemployment in the United States has just reached the lowest level in over 51 years, and very soon, we think that will be broken to be a historic number."" -- September 22 speech at Howdy, Modi event in Houston

Facts First: Trump was exaggerating in all three cases -- very slightly with ""51 years,"" more significantly when he said ""the best they've ever been."" The Trump was exaggerating in all three cases -- very slightly with ""51 years,"" more significantly when he said ""the best they've ever been."" The unemployment rate over this spring and summer -- 3.7% in each of June, July and August, 3.6% in each of April and May -- has been the lowest since December 1969, slightly less than 50 years ago; all of these rates were well off the record 2.5%, set in 1953.

The dollar

""Will Fed ever get into the game? Dollar strongest EVER!"" -- September 16 tweet

Facts First: The dollar is not the strongest it has ever been against other currencies, according to various indices; it was significantly stronger in the 1980s and earlier this decade. You can read a longer version of this fact check : The dollar is not the strongest it has ever been against other currencies, according to various indices; it was significantly stronger in the 1980s and earlier this decade. You can read a longer version of this fact check here

Women's unemployment

Trump said at his New Mexico rally that unemployment numbers for women were the best in ""71 years.""

Facts First: This was his usual slight exaggeration. The rate this summer has been the lowest since 1953, 66 years ago.

Inflation

Trump claimed three times that there is ""no inflation."" Facts First: There is inflation: 1.7% for the last 12 months ending in August. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, was up 2.4% for the 12 months ending in August. Trump could fairly say that inflation is low, but ""no inflation"" is incorrect.

Trump could fairly say that inflation is low, but ""no inflation"" is incorrect.

Prescription drug prices

Trump claimed that last year was ""the first year in 51 years where prices went down"" for prescription drugs. -- September 16 exchange w with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

Facts First: This was a slight exaggeration. Prescription drug prices declined last year for the first time in 46 years, according to one of several measures. You can read a longer version of this fact check : This was a slight exaggeration. Prescription drug prices declined last year for the first time in 46 years, according to one of several measures. You can read a longer version of this fact check here

Pre-existing conditions

""And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. The Republicans will always do that."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: This promise has already proven false. Trump and Republicans, who have tried to pass : This promise has already proven false. Trump and Republicans, who have tried to pass bills that would have weakened protections for people with pre-existing conditions, are now trying to get the courts to declare Obamacare void, without a plan to replace those pre-existing protections if their lawsuit succeeds.

Air quality

""And I'm an environmentalist, I believe in the environment. I want the cleanest water on the planet. I want the cleanest air. I want a lot of things. You know right now we have the cleanest air that we've ever had in this country?"" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: By several measures, US air was cleaner under Obama than it's been under Trump. Three of the six types of pollutants identified by the Clean Air Act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before Trump took office, according to Environmental Protection Agency : By several measures, US air was cleaner under Obama than it's been under Trump. Three of the six types of pollutants identified by the Clean Air Act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before Trump took office, according to Environmental Protection Agency data

Additionally, there were more ""unhealthy air days"" for sensitive groups in 2018 than in 2016 -- 799 days across the 35 American cities surveyed by the EPA, up from 702. Though there were significantly more ""unhealthy air days"" in Obama's first term than there have been in Trump's, the lowest amount of unhealthy air days -- 598 -- occurred in 2014 under Obama.

Judicial vacancies

""President Obama said they (prisoners at Guantanamo Bay) were going to be totally completed and emptied out by the time he left office. And very much like judges, where, as you know, I ended up with 138 slots, you had a situation where that wasn't cleaned out."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

""In a few short weeks, we'll be up to 180, sounds impossible, federal judges, including court of appeals judges, because President Obama did us a great favor. when I came in, I said, 'I assume I have no judges to appoint.' 'No sir, you have 138 judges.' 138, didn't put them up, couldn't get them approved. I don't know what happened, but we started off with 138."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump did not enter office with 138 judicial vacancies. According to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments, there were 103 vacancies on district and appeals courts on Jan. 1, 2017, just before Trump took office, plus a vacancy on the Supreme Court.

Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the confirmation of many of Obama's judicial nominees late in his term; Obama obviously didn't intend to ""hand"" vacancies to Trump."

On the roster: Biden hits the skids in new Q Poll - Trump leaned on Ukrainian leader for Biden dirt - Audible: Excuses, excuses! - Happy hump day



BIDEN HITS THE SKIDS IN NEW Q POLL

Politico: “A new national survey shows Elizabeth Warren now sitting atop the 2020 Democratic field… Twenty-seven percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents polled by Quinnipiac University said they favor Warren, according to a poll released Wednesday morning. Twenty-five percent said they prefer former Vice President Joe Biden. Although Warren’s edge falls within the survey’s margin of error, Biden’s formidable lead over the rest of the field has crumbled since the last Quinnipiac national poll in August, which showed him with 32 percent support and Warren with 19 percent support. The latest survey reinforces other public polling showing Warren and Biden separating from their fellow contenders in the Democratic presidential race. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders ranked third in Tuesday’s poll, achieving 16 percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., with 7 percent, and California Sen. Kamala Harris at 3 percent.”



Trump attacks raise doubts about Biden for Dem voters - NYT: “In public, for the last five days, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his campaign have been on a ferocious offensive, ripping into President Trump for allegedly abusing his powers in asking Ukraine’s leader to help hurt Mr. Biden politically, and castigating the news media for questioning his son Hunter Biden’s financial dealings there. … In private, though, this has been an enraging and uncertain time for the Biden campaign, and for Mr. Biden himself… He and his advisers have long feared that Hunter Biden would become a target for political opponent…And as Mr. Trump’s onslaught has pushed the House of Representatives to start an impeachment inquiry, Mr. Biden now faces a crucial political test where his standing may hinge on how he handles a wildly unpredictable confrontation with Mr. Trump.”



Warren ready for air war with $10 million buy - Politico: “Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign on Tuesday announced an early-state ad campaign of at least $10 million, suggesting that the Massachusetts senator is continuing to raise big money from grass-roots donors after an anemic start. The campaign told POLITICO that a digital ad campaign would begin immediately and that they are currently reserving television time, with the entire buy ramping up over the next few months. The campaign declined to say when its spending on digital and TV ads would reach eight figures. ‘Right now, our biggest expense as a campaign is our staff, but as the campaign heats up, it will be on media to reach potential voters,’ campaign manager Roger Lau wrote in a memo emailed to supporters Tuesday morning. The campaign ‘will be more digital than old-school broadcast television.’ The campaign also released three ads Tuesday — 15-second, 30-second, and 1-minute spots — which highlight Warren’s policy plans and her intention to crack down on corruption in government.”



Buttigieg hitches a ride on McCain’s media strategy - CBS News: “The South Bend, Indiana mayor rolled across Iowa on a four-day bus tour and allowed everything uttered on the bus to be on the record, drawing ready comparisons to the late Senator John McCain's ‘Straight Talk Express,’ the bus he toured the country in when he ran for president in 2000. The coach, which has also been around the country in the service of former President Barack Obama, Justin Timberlake and Tom Hanks, is now styled with Buttigieg signs, marble floors and plays news channels or football in the background. … He and his campaign have ramped up spending in Iowa in the past month, releasing a new TV ad on Monday, hiring more staff on the ground and opening offices. He added that the strategy is not to ‘go around Iowa.’”



Sanders touts dozen of union member endorsements - The Hill: “White House hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) unveiled the endorsements of 85 union members in Iowa as he works to shore up support for his progressive bona fides against a surging Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). The endorsements were announced on the ‘Bernie beats Trump’ tour in Iowa during which Sanders is visiting counties that voted for former President Obama in 2008 and 2012 and for President Trump in 2016 to help ensure skeptical voters that he can beat Trump in a general election. … The endorsements come from members of several unions, including the autoworkers of America and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.”

“The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited Constitution.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 78



TIME OUT: WELL PACKAGED PEANUTS

New Yorker: “Timing is the life force of comics. Without a sensitivity to the rhythms and the music—a.k.a. the reality—of life, a comic strip will arrive D.O.A., nothing more than a bunch of dumb pictures. … The reader doesn’t just look at Charlie Brown, Linus, Lucy, and Snoopy but reads them as musical notes in a silently heard composition of hilarity, cruelty, and occasional melancholy. In 1950, the comics page was a more or less settled territory into which very few new features could be shoehorned, and, from the get-go, ‘Peanuts’ was marketed as a space-saver. The strip was created out of four equally sized panels, which allowed it to run horizontally, vertically, or stacked two by two. … Who would’ve thought that such a hard-nosed commercial decision would catalyze one of the greatest works of popular art of the twentieth century?”

TRUMP LEANED ON UKRAINIAN LEADER FOR BIDEN DIRT

WSJ: “President Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, to ‘look into’ former Vice President Joe Biden’s son and said he would direct his personal lawyer and attorney general to reach out to Mr. Zelensky to ‘get to the bottom of it,’ according to a document released by the White House designed to memorialize a July phone call between the leaders. The document also revealed that Mr. Trump, before asking Ukraine to examine actions by Mr. Biden’s son, reminded Mr. Zelensky that the U.S. sends security aid to Ukraine. ‘I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine,’ he said. ‘We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time.’ He contrasted the U.S. aid with what European countries do to help Ukraine. According to the document released by the White House on Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump didn’t make an explicit link on the call between the U.S. aid—which he had ordered a hold on a week earlier—and an investigation into Mr. Biden’s son.”



Trump lawyer: State Department directed involvement - WashEx: “President Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani said he began dealing with Ukrainian officials at the behest of the State Department. During an interview Tuesday evening on Fox News, Giuliani was prompted to respond to a Washington Post report in which White House insiders complained about how he was improperly ‘injecting himself’ into U.S.-Ukraine relations. ‘Man, I really did,’ Giuliani said sarcastically. ‘And you know who I did at the request of? The State Department. I never talked to a Ukrainian official until the State Department called me and asked me to do it.’ Holding up his mobile phone, Giuliani said he reported every conversation he had to the Trump administration and that evidence of this communications with the State Department were all on the device.”



Pelosi heats up impeachment rhetoric, but not her go-slow approach - Roll Call: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s announcement Tuesday that the House is in an ‘official impeachment inquiry’ gave no hints of how or whether it would accelerate any Democratic effort to remove President Donald Trump from office. Pelosi said she directed the six House committees conducting oversight of the Trump administration to move forward ‘under that umbrella’ of an impeachment inquiry — but gave no details about how the day-to-day approach would differ. In that way, Pelosi appeared to stay on a measured Democratic approach that for months has fallen short of raising public support for impeachment — particularly with the Trump administration’s unyielding rejection of congressional subpoena power — and put off potentially stronger moves toward impeachment.”



Poll shows reason for her caution - WaPo: “Amid a groundswell of support for impeachment proceedings among House Democrats, a new poll finds a majority of Americans do not favor ousting President Trump from office. Thirty-seven percent of voters say that Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 57 percent say he should not be impeached, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday morning. … The poll shows a stark partisan divide on the question of impeachment. Among Democrats, 73 percent support impeachment, while 21 percent are opposed. Among Republicans, only 4 percent support impeachment, while 95 percent are opposed. Trump’s overall job approval rating remains in the range it has for nearly his entire presidency, with 40 percent of voters approving of how he is handling his job, and 55 percent saying they disapprove.”



Silver: Will Dems learn lessons of Russia probe? - FiveThirtyEight: “Despite Trump being quite unpopular, and despite the public largely buying Democrats’ interpretation of the fact pattern on Russia — most polls find that a majority of the public thinks that Trump sought to obstruct the investigation into Russia, for instance — impeachment was a soundly unpopular proposition. … The politics of impeachment on Ukraine may be different than on Russia. But Democrats should take public opinion seriously. That doesn’t mean you always have to do the poll-driven thing. But don’t wish the numbers away because you don’t like them, or presume that they’ll change in your favor, or assume there won’t be consequences for taking an unpopular action. More specifically for Democrats, their failure to persuade the public that Russia warranted impeachment offers several potential lessons if they are to proceed on Ukraine.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I just have a political science question regarding the 2020 Senate race in Kansas. Kris Kobach lost the governor’s race in 2018 and is now running for the GOP nomination for Senate (yinz know this already). I was wondering do voters’ think differently when selecting a governor rather than a Senator? Kobach was too right-wing for the Topeka state House as an executive, but as a legislator in Washington? Does it make a difference that electing a Democratic Governor is vastly different than a Democratic Senator with vastly different consequences politically? Hopefully my question makes sense.” – James Belany, Pittsburgh



[Ed. note: The first thing to remember, Mr. Belany, is that there’s precious little science in politics. Like many of the humanities, political theory and the study of campaigns and elections, got squeezed into a faux “science” during the middle of the last century. To that I say: Phooey! The science at play in your question could be social psychology, though. Would the voters of Kansas feel differently about a radical senator than they would a radical governor? Maybe there’s something to that. But maybe there’s another discipline to consider: Mathematics. There were three candidates for governor in 2018, but maybe only two for Senate in 2020. Could Kobach slide by in a binary election especially when Republican voters are storming the polls in a presidential year? Maybe. But that doesn’t change the fact that the GOP would much rather not have to deal with Kobach. Not only does he increase the degree of difficulty in Kansas, but Democrats running in other states can use his comments and record against his fellow Republicans.]



“Just wanted you to know that I came down with a debilitating case of the bird flu this past weekend ... as the hated Cardinals swept my Cubbies at Wrigley Field, and ensured the Cardinals will be Central Division champions this year. The illness hasn't gotten better as Kris Bryant appears out for the season, and my Cubbies appear doomed to sit out the postseason. Chortle if you will at my Cubbies misfortune -- but just wait until next year!” – Stephen J. Tock, Dwight, Ill.



[Ed. note: I can’t go so far as to say that I felt “bad” for the Cubs, but I can say that I admire your determination, Mr. Tock. And we can all be proud to say that the National League Central continues to be the best, most competitive division in baseball. And with three games left against the Cards, I’m sure your squad will try hard to avenge the Wrigley sweep!]

HAPPY HUMP DAY

AP: “A veterinarian has prescribed antibiotics to a camel owned by a Louisiana truck stop petting zoo after a woman bit the 600-pound (272-kilogram) animal to free herself from under its weight. Iberville Parish Sheriff's Office documents obtained by The Advocate on Monday accuse Florida couple Gloria and Edmond Lancaster of throwing treats for their unleashed dog into Caspar the camel's enclosure at Tiger Truck Stop. The couple told deputies the camel attacked the dog, but the sheriff's office said the couple had provoked the animal before it sat on Gloria Lancaster. She'd crawled under barbed wire to retrieve her pet. Gloria Lancaster told officers she had to bite the camel to free herself. Truck stop manager Pamela Bossier said a veterinarian prescribed Caspar antibiotics as a precaution.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“To interpret the Reagan Doctrine as merely a puffed-up rationale for Nicaraguan policy is like calling the Truman Doctrine a cover for a new Greek and Turkish policy. In both cases, the principles established have a much more profound implication.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing for Time magazine on June 24, 2001.

‘DESERVE’S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT’

Let’s start with the precondition that we don’t care whether you think the investigation into President Trump’s efforts to get the Ukrainian government to prosecute his political rivals is “THE GREATEST SCAM IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS!” grounds for immediate impeachment or something in between.



We care in the sense that we’re sure that you are sincere in your beliefs and we acknowledge your God-given right to feel and think the way you do. What we mean is that in order to discern what might happen next, such feelings are hindrances. It’s hard to clearly consider such outcomes when you think in terms of your own beliefs.



This note, for example, would be a poor source for Major League Baseball forecasting since it is our position that the St. Louis Cardinals not only will win it all but deserve to win it all.



As William Munny told Little Bill Daggett right before he blew his head off with a Spencer repeating rifle on a saloon floor: “Deserve’s got nothing to do with it.”



There are plenty of people who think that Bill Clinton unfairly beat the rap, and even some who still think Richard Nixon got a raw deal. If you flipped through the back pages of enough bibliographies, you might even find some historians with strong feelings about what happened to old Andy Johnson.



Woodrow Wilson was incapacitated by a stroke in his second term, with his wife acting as a kind of regent for his last 17 months in office but Congress took no action. Warren Harding’s administration – in particular his Interior and Justice departments – was a quagmire of corruption, but he was dead and buried before any of it came to light. Lyndon Johnson grievously abused the powers of office for political advantage but he never faced any repercussions.



The rightness or wrongness of a president’s actions are all but immaterial in these matters. Whether the supporters or detractors of the aforementioned men were correct or not was of no consequence.

Now, that’s not to say that the passionate partisan bawling that we’re all now being subjected to won’t have an effect on what eventually does happen.



Studies suggest that home field advantage in sports is not only real but quite possibly the result of referees showing favoritism because of “the social atmosphere in the stadium.” The same is true with allegations of presidential misconduct.



We’ve said it many times before, but it bears repeating: Impeachment is a political proposition, not a legal one. And the referees here are the undecided or persuadable voters not yet sure what to make of what’s happening.



But even if you want to be part of working the refs – screaming into the orc-filled chasms of Twitter or annoying friends and loved ones with forwarded emails and Facebook posts – you probably still want to be able to think clearly about where it goes from here.



And that’s what we intend to help you do in the days ahead. You have plenty of other options for getting the latest details on what this unnamed source said or what that hearing may or may not have revealed. We’re going to stay focused on the political repercussions because that’s our job.



For the sake of everybody who is going to be out there fighting passionately for their side, whatever it is, we’ll do our best to not pick one.

TIME OUT: ONCE UPON A TIME…

NatGeo: “The brothers Grimm published what would become one of the most influential and famous collections of folklore in the world. Children’s and Household Tales (Kinder und Hausmärchen), later titled Grimm’s Fairy Tales, are childhood-defining stories. The Grimms, however, had curated the collection as an academic anthology for scholars of German culture, not as a collection of bedtime stories for young readers. Amid the political and social turbulence of the Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815), as France conquered Germanic lands, Jacob and Wilhelm were driven by nationalism to highlight their homeland and heritage. They were inspired by German Romantic authors and philosophers who believed that the purest forms of culture, those that bonded a community, could be found in stories shared from generation to generation. Storytelling expressed the essence of German culture and recalled the spirit and basic values of its people. By excavating Germany’s oral traditions, the brothers urgently sought to ‘preserve them from vanishing . . . to be forever silent in the tumult of our times.’”

I’LL TELL YOU WHAT: NOT SO IMPREACHYKEENMENT

This week Dana Perino and Chris Stirewalt discuss President Trump’s phone call with the Ukrainian president, how impeachment proceedings could affect the 2020 presidential race and Dana starts the countdown until Christmas. Plus, Chris answers trivia. LISTEN AND SUBSCRIBE HERE



WARREN SLIPS AND SWIPES BIDEN ON ETHICS

Fox News: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren spotlighted her longstanding calls for the impeachment of President Trump at a campaign event on Wednesday, emphasizing, ‘I hope we do this and I hope we do this quickly.’ But, she also appeared to unintentionally swipe at a rival Democrat vying for the White House – former Vice President Joe Biden – over his family’s role in the Ukraine controversy that led the House of Representatives to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump. Taking questions from reporters following a town hall event in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire, the Massachusetts Democrat was asked if she would allow her vice president’s child to serve on the board of a foreign company if she were president. Warren quickly answered, ‘no.’ When asked why, she said, in a rare moment where she appeared flustered: ‘I don’t know. I have to go back and look at the details.’”



More family woes for Biden - Politico: “Joe Biden’s brother told executives at a healthcare firm that the former vice president’s cancer initiative would promote their business, according to a participant in the conversation, who said the promise came as part of a pitch on behalf of potential investors in the firm. The allegation is the latest of many times Biden’s relatives have invoked the former vice president and his political clout to further their private business dealings. It is the first that involves the Biden Cancer Initiative, a project Joe Biden made the centerpiece of his post-White House life following the death of his son Beau. Biden’s brother, James, made the promise to executives at Florida-based Integrate Oral Care during a phone call on or around November 8, 2018, according to Michael Frey, CEO of Diverse Medical Management, a health-care firm that is suing James Biden. At the time, James Biden’s business partners were pursuing a potential investment in Integrate, according to Frey and court records.”



Sanders gives supporters the stage in Iowa - Des Moines Register: “As a Democratic candidate for president, [Bernie] Sanders frequently pushes his policies pugnaciously, framing them as moral imperatives as much as practical matters. But in his recent four-day swing through Iowa, he balanced his high-volume sermons with stories from his supporters. … Respondents who watched the September televised debate, where Sanders — who approached the debate stage with his typical fervor, but with a hoarse rasp — were more likely to have an unfavorable view of him. The debate-stage Sanders, whose style is described by some, including one of his 2020 rivals, as ""yelling"", was less present in his late September Iowa swing, Instead, Sanders often gave up the microphone to let others speak. … At his Iowa events, some of the personal stories are arranged in advance. But others are organic — hearing the stories of others inspires Sanders supporters to tell their own.”



Biden leads the pack in Maryland - Goucher College: “The Goucher College Poll asked Maryland Democratic likely voters who they are currently planning to vote for in the Maryland Democratic presidential primary… Thirty-three percent of Maryland Democratic likely voters say they will vote for Joe Biden and 21 percent for Elizabeth Warren. Ten percent would vote for Bernie Sanders, 6 percent for Kamala Harris, and 5 percent for Pete Buttigieg. All other candidates earn support from 1 percent or fewer of voters. Fifteen percent have no preference or are undecided. …Mileah Kromer, director of the Sarah T. Hughes Field Politics Center at Goucher College [said,] ‘Democrats in Maryland are divided over whether they want a more moderate or progressive nominee and whether nominating a candidate who can defeat Trump or match their policy preferences is their top priority.’”



ISSA TO CHALLENGE DUNCAN HUNTER

NYT: “Darrell Issa, the former nine-term congressman from California, will try to return to Congress by challenging Representative Duncan Hunter, who was indicted last year, setting up a clash among two Trump allies for one of Republicans’ most endangered seats. Mr. Issa is expected to announce his challenge at a news conference on Thursday morning in the San Diego County district, according to two sources familiar with his decision. He had been publicly mulling for months whether to make a bid to return to Congress, and started an exploratory committee in August. ‘I have received such a tremendous outpouring of encouragement from supporters inside the district, and around the state and across the nation,’ Mr. Issa said in August in a statement posted to the committee’s website. Mr. Issa will likely bill himself to Republicans as a safer alternative than the incumbent.”



Michigan announces new automatic voter registration - MLive: “Michigan took a leap forward into the modern era by announcing new voter registration policies on National Voter Registration Day. Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson announced [Tuesday] that automatic voter registration has officially launched in Michigan and online voter registration will be available following the November 2019 election. “Making voter registration automatic for eligible citizens means more Michigan residents will have access to participating in our democracy,” Benson said in a release. … Michigan joins 17 other states and the District of Columbia in enacting automatic voter registration.”

*AHEM* THEY GOT TRASHED

News24: “A South Korean mayor who dumped a ton of trash on a clean beach to give environmental campaigners something to pick up has said sorry for his deception. Officials trucked in litter and waste that had already been collected from rubbish-strewn coasts, and scattered it all over the pristine sand of southwest Jindo. The following day hundreds of volunteers scoured the shores and bagged up the garbage as part of an event to mark International Coastal Cleanup Day, a global event aimed at countering the scourge of sea-borne waste. ‘We brought in waste styrofoam and other coastal trash gathered from nearby areas so the 600 participants could carry out clean-up activities,’ said Lee Dong-jin, Jindo county mayor, in a statement. His office apologised for causing trouble and said the event was meant to ‘raise awareness about the seriousness of coastal waste.’”

""I think that it's one of the dumbest and most ridiculous political moves that we've seen in history,"" Sanders said on ""Fox & Friends.""

""I think this should be looked at as an in-kind contribution to the president's reelection campaign... All this is doing is helping fuel his campaign. They're raising more money. They're rallying his base and they're unifying the Republican Party... by attacking this president.""

TRUMP-UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT A FAILED 'INTERNAL ATTEMPT' TO OUST TRUMP, WSJ'S KIMBERLEY STRASSEL SAYS

""It is absurd that they continue to go down this road and haven't learned anything new from it,"" she added. ""I think the big loser in all this process has to be Joe Biden... So far the only inappropriate behavior that I'm seeing in this entire thing is that of Vice President Joe Biden, in order to help his son.""

Sanders likened the recent impeachment push by Democrats to the Russia investigation and accused them of using a ""fake scandal"" to dupe American voters and regain executive power.

""This is exactly out of the Democrats' playbook,"" she said. ""They used a fake scandal with Russia. Now they're trying to create a fake scandal with Ukraine. It doesn't matter who the actors are. The real bad players in this whole process are the Democrats, trying to fool American voters.

""The good thing is, the American voters are far too smart to fall for the Democrat lies,"" Sanders continued. ""I think one of the best things that's coming out of this is the contrast of who is showing up to be fit to lead our country in a very trying time.""

Sanders also said the Democratic Party has become so anti-Trump, they're willing to hurt the country if it means hurting the president.

""Time and time again the Democrats show their true colors. They don't care about the country,"" she added. ""They care about tearing the president down. They've completely lost sight of what is important and are singularly focused on making sure they destroy the president and win reelection.""

Sanders spoke shortly before the public release of a whistleblower complaint involving Trump asking the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. The complaint alleged that Trump used the ""power of his office to solicit interference"" from a foreign country in the 2020 election — and that White House officials subsequently tried to ""lock down"" records of that phone call.

""In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to 'lock down' all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced – as is customary – by the White House Situation Room,"" the complaint says.

Pelosi made the announcement following a meeting of the House Democratic Caucus at the Capitol, saying that ""the president must be held accountable"" for what she called the ""betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections.""

The only Democratic hopeful to explicitly come out against impeachment was Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii. Speaking on Fox Business' “Kennedy” on Tuesday night Gabbard said she thinks impeachment would be very ""divisive"" for a country that is already divided.

PELOSI ANNOUNCES FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP

“Donald Trump has abused his power, obstructed justice, and violated his oath of office. He puts his political interests over our national interest,” tweeted Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. “I agree with @SpeakerPelosi— no one is above the law. He must be impeached.”

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who first called for impeachment proceedings to begin in May after Special Counsel Robert Mueller spoke publicly about the findings of his Russia investigation, tweeted on Tuesday evening, “In 2016, Trump welcomed foreign adversaries to meddle in our democracy for his own gain. Now he appears to be using the same playbook to remain in power.""

Mueller’s probe was intended to examine Russian election interference and whether President Trump's campaign colluded with Russian officials during the 2016 election. In the report, Mueller said he could not exonerate the president on obstruction of justice but that investigators did not find sufficient evidence to establish charges of criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign.

Booker added, ""I applaud Speaker Pelosi's announcement of an impeachment inquiry—it’s our one remaining path to ensuring justice is served.”

Pelosi specifically charged that the Trump administration had violated the law by not turning over an intelligence community whistleblower's complaint concerning a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Citing testimony that the director of national intelligence is blocking the release of that complaint, she said: ""This is a violation of law. The law is unequivocal.""

GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN

Trump allegedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The president vowed earlier Tuesday to release a ""complete"" transcript of his call with Zelensky on Wednesday, though it's unlikely to settle the issue in Congress.

Joe Biden has acknowledged that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board.

""This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,"" Pelosi said Tuesday. ""Therefore, today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella.”

Following Pelosi’s announcement, Biden tweeted, “Pressuring the leader of another nation to investigate a political opponent — to help win an election — is not the conduct of an American President.”

Earlier Tuesday, Biden called Trump’s alleged actions “an abuse of power.”

“They undermine our national security,” Biden tweeted. “They violate the oath of office. If we allow a President to get away with shredding the United States Constitution — that will last forever.”

In remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Monday, Trump denied linking the Ukraine aid money to an investigation of the Bidens.

“No, I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said. But, he also repeatedly called the Bidens' actions in Ukraine a “disgrace,” acknowledged that Biden had come up during the call and added: ""It's very important to talk about corruption. ... Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?""

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., did not immediately release a statement, but sent out a somewhat-cryptic tweet Tuesday night, writing only: ""Billionaires should not be able to control our political system.""

During a press conference earlier on Tuesday Sanders said, “If you're going to go forward with impeachment. You're going to have grounds to do it. I happen to believe they're authorized to do it, but you got to lay it out.”

In a statement, former Texas rep. Beto O’Rourke said he is “grateful to Speaker Pelosi for opening an impeachment inquiry into President Trump” and called her announcement “a defining moment for our country.”

“For more than two years, even as I was running for Senate in Texas, I have been clear that I support impeachment,” O’Rourke said. “We all must come to terms with what we face: a lawless president who has obstructed justice and undermined our democracy by inviting a foreign power to intervene in 2016, and who is doing it again in 2020.”

Entrepreneur Andrew Yang tweeted on Tuesday, “Given the President’s latest actions I think impeachment is the right path forward.”

Yang added: “Asking foreign leaders for political help in return for aid and then suppressing your own agency’s inquiry is egregious. There have to be limits and Congress is right to act.”

In a follow-up tweet, Yang wrote, “A reminder that successful impeachment requires a majority vote in the House and then two-thirds in the Senate. Given that there are 53 Republican Senators one would need 20 of them to support impeachment to be successful. That is highly unlikely unless there is some huge shift.”

He added that he still agrees that moving forward “is for the best,” saying it will allow for a more thorough investigation “that may unearth new details.”

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., tweeted simply, “The House did the right thing.”

Former Maryland Congressman John Delaney released a statement following the announcement saying he agreed with Pelosi’s decision to move forward with an official impeachment inquiry, adding that “she deserves our support.”

""The President’s behavior, combined with the administration’s refusal to cooperate, leaves her no other choice,"" Delaney added. ""Our nation can only be as strong as the rules that govern it.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called Pelosi's announcement ""an overdue but important step.”

""Now the impeachment inquiry must move forward with the efficiency and seriousness this crisis demands,"" she said. ""The House needs to vote on articles of impeachment—and when it comes to the Senate, I will do what the Constitution requires.”

Billionaire hedge fund manager Tom Steyer said he applauded Pelosi and Democrats in Congress who are calling for an investigation into Trump’s alleged criminal behavior.

“Removing Trump from office has always been about doing what’s right, not what’s politically convenient,” Steyer said. “We built a nationwide movement to impeach a lawless president and defend our democracy. This is just the beginning.”

Earlier this month, Steyer told Fox News' Bret Baier during an interview on “Special Report” that he thinks President Trump is “the most corrupt president in American history” and that he has “more than met the criteria for impeachment.”

Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., did not react on social media, but in an interview on CNN on Tuesday night said the announcement is “a moment of truth for the country,” adding that “sooner or later it had to come.”

He went on to say that the announcement is also “a moment of truth for the Republican Party.""

A total of 172 House Democrats have now signaled support for an impeachment inquiry. A simple majority of House members present and voting would be required to impeach the president. A highly unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-controlled Senate would be needed to convict and remove Trump from office.

Vice President Mike Pence would then take office in that scenario and become the 46th President of the United States.

“What did we find in our research? We found that analyzing data from a combination of large Italian epidemiological studies, we found that people who regularly consumed pizza had a decreased risk of digestive cancer and myocardial infarction,” Gallus said during his speech.

He also clarified that the pizza he’s talking about — made and consumed in Italy — is not entirely healthy in and of itself. As also outlined in the studies his team published between 2003 and 2006, he and his team suggested that the consumption of an Italian pizza’s Mediterranean ingredients indicated a healthier Mediterranean diet, which has been linked to a healthier lifestyle.

“Our interpretation is that pizza may represent a general indication, a marker, of the Italian diet that, as other Mediterranean diets [have], has been shown to have major health benefits,"" Gallus said.

“In conclusion, we recommend eating Italian pizza, but please, please hold the pepperoni for health reasons,"" he added.

""This is not something that is to be dismissed, but it's also not something [where] we jump to conclusions and start marching down impeachment road. That is a terrible mistake for our country,"" he said.

Starr, who served as independent counsel on an investigation that was used as the basis for the impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998, accused Democrats of moving too quickly and said there would have to be hard proof of some ""treason"" or ""bribery"" to make any future charges stick.

""To so prematurely jump onto this road and start racing down impeachment road or impeachment alley is, I believe, at this stage, a great disservice to the country,"" he continued. ""Impeachment is about treason. There's no treason here. It's about bribery. There's nothing that, to me, partakes of bribery.""

Democrats accused Trump of attempting to withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for the government's cooperation in investigating 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who had ties to one of the country's natural gas firms involved in a corruption probe.

IMPEACHMENT PUSH WILL UNIFY GOP AND PUSH TRUMP OVER THE TOP IN 2020, SAYS SARAH SANDERS

The whistleblower complaint said Trump used the ""power of his office to solicit interference"" from a foreign country in the 2020 election -- and that White House officials tried to ""lock down"" records of that phone call.

Starr claimed it was within the scope of Trump's authority to ask for a favor and said affairs of state and foreign relations are one of the chief functions of the office of the president.

""The president is asking for a favor... when we go back to the transcript itself... I don't think it was wise of the president to do it,"" he said. ""Look where we are as a country by virtue of that. You give the other side all of this fodder. So I wish the president hadn't done what he did. But it's an exercise in judgment and it's an exercise in his authority as the president of the United States to conduct the foreign relations of the United States.""

""The foreign relations of the United States are, above all, entrusted to the person who we elect,"" Starr continued. ""This is a terrible interference, what is unfolding. It's a terrible interference with what the president does at the most sensitive level -- which is a person-to-person conversation with another leader. And I think it's an erosion of presidential power, which is unfortunate."""

""We ask that you to immediately reverse course and heed the recommendation of top US military officials and faith leaders to open our doors to eligible refugees from all corners of the world,"" the letter reads. ""A generous US refugee policy spares tens of thousands from terrible fates.""

The letter, led by Sens. Jeff Merkley and Ed Markey, comes on the heels of the State Department's report to Congress that proposed a refugee cap -- which dictates how many refugees may be admitted to the US -- to 18,000 for fiscal year 2020, which begins next week.

Under Trump, the administration has slowly chipped away at the refugee cap. The ceiling for fiscal year 2019 stands at 30,000, which, at the time, was the lowest level since 1980.

The State Department announced the proposed refugee ceiling Thursday as part of a larger number of combined refugee and asylum claims expected for the next fiscal year.

""To address several inquiries we have received we are writing to let you know that, pending a final decision after the certification deadline, it is the intention of the DNC and our media partners to hold the October debate over one night on Tuesday October 15th,"" the DNC wrote in an email Friday morning.

The party's fourth sanctioned primary debate will air live at 8 p.m. ET from the campus of Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, with CNN anchors Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper and New York Times national editor Marc Lacey serving as moderators.

Twelve candidates have said they surpassed the polling and contribution thresholds outlined by the DNC to receive an invitation to participate in the debate: former Vice President Joe Biden, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, businessman Tom Steyer, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and businessman Andrew Yang.

At this time, no other candidate appears close to reaching the polling and fundraising thresholds by the October 1 deadline. To receive an invitation to the debate, candidates need a to meet a 2% polling threshold in four DNC-approved polls and at least 130,000 unique donors, including 400 donors per state from at least 20 states, to qualify.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) told late-night host Stephen Colbert on Thursday that his Medicare for All proposal is far from free and Americans making over $29,000 will see their taxes raised to pay for it.

Sanders has been a vocal proponent of Medicare for All, which — by some estimates — could cost over $60 trillion over a decade. Colbert asked Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) last week if Medicare for All would result in higher taxes for middle class Americans, and he posed the same question to Sanders on Thursday.

“Senator Warren was on here last week and I asked her about her plans for Medicare for All, and I’m going to ask you the question that I asked her … at the risk of being accused of trumpeting Republican talking points,” Colbert said.

“Is there an increase in taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for All, or rather, where would the tax burden go to pay for that?” the CBS host asked.

Sanders initially issued a similar answer to Warren, who repeatedly talked about overall “costs” rather than increased taxation itself.

“Under my legislation — 15 co-sponsors I believe in the Senate now — nobody in America will pay any more premiums,” Sanders said. “No more co-payments, gone. No more out-of-pocket expenses, gone. Nobody will go bankrupt… because of medical bills, that is gone.”

“Nobody in America under my bill will pay more than $200 a year in total for their prescription drugs,” he continued.

However, the socialist senator admitted that health care is not “free.”

“Now having said that, is health care free? No, it is not. So what we do is exempt the first $29,000 of a person’s income. You make less than $29,000, you pay nothing in taxes,” Sanders explained, essentially admitting that taxes will go up on middle class families from there.

“Above that, in a progressive way with the wealthiest people paying the largest percentage, people do pay more in taxes,” Sanders said. “But if I say to you, that right now you’re paying $20,000 a year in a tax called a premium for insurance companies. That’s gone.”

Sanders’ admission stands in stark contrast to Warren, who refused to explicitly state that Medicare for All will result in increased taxes for the middle class.

“Will their taxes go up?” Colbert asked after Warren refused to answer the question directly.

“I’ve listened to these answers a few times before, and I just want to make a parallel suggestion to you that you might defend the taxes perhaps that you’re not mentioning in your sentence,” he said.

“Isn’t Medicare for All like public school? There might be taxes for it, but you certainly save a lot of money sending your kids to school and do you want to live in a world where your kids aren’t educated? Do you want to live in a world where your fellow citizens are dying, even if it costs a little bit of money?” he asked.

“So, I accept your point and I believe in your point. Health care is a basic human right. We fight for basic human rights, and that’s Medicare for All. Everyone gets covered,” Warren responded, still refusing to say if she would raise taxes on the middle class to implement Medicare for All."

Now, it's ... different.",2019-09-27,MSNBC,The first White House press secretary to have it easy during a scandal,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-first-white-house-press-secretary-have-it-easy-during-scandal,"Over the last half-century, there have been more than a few instances in which White House press secretaries, serving during presidential scandals, would’ve preferred to have very different jobs. During Watergate, Iran-Contra, the Clinton impeachment affair, and plenty of other controversies, the White House briefing room was filled with reporters demanding answers to tough questions, pushing press secretaries who often weren’t sure how to defend their boss in the Oval Office.

Stephanie Grisham has it quite a bit easier.

Much of the country might struggle to pick Grisham out of a lineup, probably because she hasn’t held any press briefings since succeeding Sarah Huckabee Sanders three months ago. That’s not an exaggeration: the current White House press secretary has held exactly zero briefings in the White House press briefing room.

Earlier this week, Grisham sat down with the hosts of Fox & Friends and explained why no one should expect the briefings to return anytime soon.

[Grisham said] the press briefings under Sean Spicer and Sanders had become “theater,” with reporters using the opportunity to ask questions of the government as a chance to become “famous.” When Fox’s Brian Kilmeade asked Grisham if Trump “took it personal” when the press was combative with her predecessors, she confirmed it. Spicer and Sanders were not able to “get his message out there,” she said. “They weren’t being good to his people. And he doesn’t like that. He is very loyal to his people and he put a stop to it.”

For what it’s worth, there’s all kinds of evidence of Trump failing spectacularly to demonstrate loyalty toward “his people.” For that matter, it’s not the job of White House reporters to be “good” to presidential press secretaries.

But even putting that aside, as I suspect folks in the West Wing have noticed, there’s a major scandal brewing that’s likely to lead to the president’s impeachment. In theory, Stephanie Grisham would face a daily grilling, while simultaneously pushing a pro-Trump message, refuting accusations, and making every effort to shape coverage in ways that might benefit her boss.

None of that is happening. It’s … weird.

The press secretary did turn to Twitter yesterday in the hopes of discrediting some “myths” surrounding the president’s Ukraine scandal, but there were no follow-up questions because Grisham wasn’t willing to deliver a statement from her White House podium.

It led The New Yorker’s Susan Glasser to publish some tweets of her own, featuring questions the press secretary might consider answering:

“Dear [Grisham]: ‘do us a favor, though’. Care to comment? Also, in what capacity is Rudy Giuliani advising the President? Is he paying him? Using what funds? Is there a legal matter involving Trump and Ukraine and if no why is Giuliani involved? Why was US ambassador to Ukraine pushed out? What did President Trump mean when he told Ukraine’s President some things were going to happen to her? “Did the President attach any conditions to meet with the President of Ukraine? What were they and how were they communicated? Why President Trump tell an Oval Office meeting he felt Ukraine was out to get him? Also why did President Trump personally ask to hold up Ukraine military aid, according to what OMB officials told other US officials? Why did the President tell VP Pence not to go to Zelensky’s Inauguration? When was the President told about the whistleblower and by whom?”

I’d encourage White House reporters to use Glasser’s list as a guide during the next briefing, though at this point, the earliest we should expect to see another press briefing is January 2021."

Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, the two populist standard-bearers in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.

The National Union of Healthcare Workers – which backed the independent senator from Vermont in his 2016 Democratic presidential primary bid – announced on Thursday that they’ll provide resources and grassroots support to both Sanders and Warren.

SANDERS CAMPAIGN SWIPES AT WARREN, TESTING TRUCE BETWEEN THE PROGRESSIVE 2020 CHAMPIONS

The union explained that the gap between Warren and Sanders in a vote by union members was close enough that the union’s executive board decided on Wednesday to endorse both candidates.

“This is not your typical union endorsement. We didn’t tell our members how to vote, they told us,” union president Sal Rosselli said. “We trust our members and their judgments and the outcome of this vote reflects the collective will of members from San Diego to the Oregon border. Our members clearly like both Senators Warren and Sanders.”

“After reviewing the vote totals, our executive board felt that an endorsement of both candidates was most fair due to the closeness of the vote,” he explained.

Union members voted from Sunday through Wednesday, with members able to cast a ballot for up to three candidates. Warren received the most votes, appearing on 61 percent of ballots, with Sanders showing up on 50 percent of ballots.

Home-state Sen. Kamala Harris appeared on 34 percent of ballots. She was endorsed by the union in her races for California attorney general and her 2016 election to the U.S. Senate. Former Vice President Joe Biden was fourth in the voting, showing up on 32 percent of ballots.

WARREN SURGES TO TIE BIDEN IN LATEST POLLS, SANDERS SLIPS TO THIRD

The splitting of the endorsement comes as some in the Sanders campaign are starting to take aim at Warren. Both Sanders and Warren have – to date – refrained for criticizing each other.

But new national and early voting state polls released over the past week indicate Warren soaring into a tie with long-time front-runner Biden for the top spot in the 2020 Democratic battle, with Sanders dipping to third.

Earlier this month Warren landed the endorsement of the New York-based progressive group the Working Families Party, which backed Sanders four years ago in his first White House bid."

ELIZABETH WARREN SAYS SHE WOULDN'T ALLOW THE CHILD OF HER VP TO SIT ON FOREIGN COMPANY BOARD

Last week, Colbert attempted to ask Warren the same question, but struggled to get a direct answer from her.

“You keep being asked in the debates how are you going to pay for it, are you going to be raising the middle-class taxes… How are you going to pay for it? Are you going to be raising the middle-class taxes?” Colbert asked.

“So, here’s how we’re going to do this,” Warren responded. “Costs are going to go up for the wealthiest Americans, for big corporations… and hard-working middle-class families are going to see their costs going down.”

“But will their taxes go up?” Colbert pressed.

“But, here’s the thing,” Warren said.

“But, here’s the thing,” Colbert grinningly interrupted. “I’ve listened to these answers a few times before and I just want to make a parallel suggestion to you that you might defend the taxes perhaps that you’re not mentioning in your sentence.”

In that scenario, 48 percent of voters chose Warren, and 44 percent chose Donald Trump, taking her lead outside of the 2.8 percent margin of error.

The survey asked the same question, replacing Warren with Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA). While Biden also experienced a four-point advantage over the president – 47 percent to 43 percent – he did not earn as much national support as Warren, who edged him out by one point. It further signals an increase in the Massachusetts senator’s electability.

The poll found Sanders with a two-point advantage over Trump – 46 percent to 44 percent – and Harris tied with the president with 44 percent each:

'The Contract' was a plank of popular proposals that the Republicans pledged to pursue if the voters put them in power. Plus, it came with a caveat -- if the new Republican majority didn't follow through, then the voters should kick them out of office.

NEWT GINGRICH: SPEAKER PELOSI: THIS IS THE INVESTIGATION CONGRESS NEEDS TO DO RIGHT NOW

""The Contract gave people something worth voting for. We pledged that if you voted Republican in the 1994 election we would bring 10 points of supporting legislation to the House floor. If these legislative policies appeal to you the only way to get them is to vote Republican,"" said Gingrich in Fox Nation's new series ""Inside the Contract With America.""

A few weeks after Gingrich's gamble, Republicans won enough seats in the 1994 midterm elections to secure a majority in the House of Representatives -- overturning 40 years of Democratic-control.

'The Contract' was a revolutionary idea and it is credited with contributing to one of the most dramatic political events in American history -- the Republican Revolution. It included some proposals that were realized such as welfare reform -- and to an extent -- term limits, and others than were not such as the balanced budget.

EXPERTS SAYS CLINTON'S IMPEACHMENT WAS POLITICAL BLUNDER FOR REPUBLICANS

Liberal criticism of 'The Contract' started almost immediately.

""The Democrats played into it, they attacked it. They helped us make it a news story,"" former Republican National Committee chairman and 2017 Virginia gubernatorial nominee Ed Gillespie told Fox Nation.

In fact, shortly after the 1994 midterm election, Senator Bernie Sanders I-Vt., went on CSPAN to offer a progressive response.

""The Contract is a fraud. We think that the more the American people understand what is in the contract, which essentially amounts to very large tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country, the eventual destruction of social security, major slashes in Medicare and Medicaid, increasing military spending and cutting back on nutrition programs for hungry children and for needy senior citizens, I think as people understand what is in the contract I think they will begin to reject it,"" said Sen. Sanders.

Gingrich came up with the idea of reaching around the media to communicate directly with the American electorate and that plan included putting an advertisement in the TV Guide.

""We're in Annapolis, I think in the Spring of '94. [Former RNC Chairman Haley Barbour] and I go to an old bar that's in a Federalist era building right across from the state capital. Down in the basement. And we're sitting there talking,"" remembered Gingrich in the Fox Nation show.

Barbour recalled that he walked into this meeting without being clear on what it was all about.

And the message is, if you elect Republicans to run the House of Representatives if we win the House of Representative this is what we pledge we'll do,"" Barbour said.

The advertisment was printed on a page of the TV Guide that was designed to be torn out and used as a checklist to hold their elected representatives accountable.

""Here's our 10 things, tear this out of your TV Guide, post it up on your refrigerator, and as we do 'em check 'em off, done, done, done. And within a hundred days, if you don't have 10 check marks we don't deserve to be reelected,"" said Barry Johnson, former Executive Director of 'Contract with America.'

On Fox Nation's ""Deep Dive,"" Fox News contributor Liz Peek said that lawmakers should learn from the history of the 'Republican Revolution.'

""The American people are commonsensical... I actually think that in our political world today we underestimate the value of promising good governence and those aren't policies -- that's values,"" she said.

FOX NEWS HOSTS ON DEMS' IMPEACHMENT PUSH

Wall Street Journal Editorial Page member Bill McGurn agreed, ""They picked issues -- unlike Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren picking some of these issues that have no support -- they looked and said 'Where are the American people aligned most strongly with Republican principals.'""

Reflecting back on the selling of the 'Contract with America', Johnson told Fox Nation that it was a smashing success, ""[I]t got to the point where one of the industry magazines, 'Advertising Age' puts out an annual issue naming their top marketing campaigns of the year. 'The Contract with America' was the top marketing campaign of the year, and the front cover of Advertising Age had this picture of Newt and I standing on the Speaker's balcony and they did an interview with us and everything. That's just one of those little weird things that happened out of 'The Contract.'""

DNC RAISES THE BAR FOR CANDIDATES TO QUALIFY FOR NOVEMBER SHOWDOWN

The email, which was sent to the various presidential campaigns, was obtained by Fox News.

Twelve candidates in the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls say they’ve reached the qualifying criteria to make the stage at the showdown, which will be held on the campus of Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. It is the fourth round of debates for Democrats this cycle.

Those candidates – in alphabetical order – are former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Sen. Kamala Harris of California; Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

WELD, WALSH, SWING AT TRUMP IN FIRST GOP PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY DEBATE

No other presidential contenders appear likely to reach the thresholds to make the cut. To reach the stage, candidates need to hit at least 2 percent in four qualifying polls and contributions from at least 130,000 individual donors.

The debate is being hosted by CNN and The New York Times.

The first two rounds of debates in June and July – which had lower criteria to qualify – were held over two consecutive nights with 10 candidates on the stage each evening. Ten candidates faced off on one night in this month’s third round debate, for which the thresholds were raised."

The House Intelligence Committee released the complaint on Thursday, which detailed accusations from an anonymous “whistleblower” who did not have firsthand knowledge of the conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The alleged “whistleblower” contends that Trump was “using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.”

However, as the transcripts of the conversation, which were released Wednesday, showed, Trump’s explicit use of the word “favor” was used in reference to Crowdstrike and the questions surrounding election meddling and hacking efforts. Biden and his son were not mentioned until later in the conversation. The transcripts show no quid pro quo or “pressure,” and the Ukrainian president confirmed such.

Nonetheless, Democrats – particularly 2020 Democrat candidates – are claiming that the “whistleblower” complaint is “explosive” in nature and contend that it proves Trump committed “crimes” in the White House.

Joe Biden (D), whose alleged corrupt practices remain at the center of the controversy, proclaimed that Trump “believes he is above the law” and attempted to convince Americans across the board that the Democrats’ latest investigation and impeachment effort is not a partisan issue:

We have a President who believes there is no limit to his power, who believes he can do anything and get away with it, and who believes he is above the law. This isn’t a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. This is a national issue. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 26, 2019

“The whistleblower complaint is explosive,” Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) wrote. “It paints a sobering picture of a president abusing his power for his own political gain against US national security interests.”

“Americans deserve to know the truth—that’s why an impeachment inquiry is so critical & our moral obligation,” he added:

“This is only the tip of an iceberg of corrupt, illegal and immoral behavior by Trump,” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) assessed. “The House must thoroughly investigate Trump’s cover-up of this call and his other attempts to use government resources to help his re-election”:

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) proclaimed the existence of a “cover-up” and called for White House officials to be subpoenaed to testify under oath “about what else they may have covered up for Donald Trump”:

Like Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) declared that Trump “believes he is above the law” and predicted that he will “continue to commit crimes from the White House” until lawmakers take action.

“The House needs to vote on articles of impeachment—and when it comes to the Senate, I will do what the Constitution requires,” she wrote:

The House needs to vote on articles of impeachment—and when it comes to the Senate, I will do what the Constitution requires. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 26, 2019

Julián Castro (D) described the president as an “active national security threat” and said the complaint “exposed a criminal effort to extort political dirtywork from a foreign government, and a massive cover-up orchestrated by the White House”:

The #WhistleblowerComplaint has exposed a criminal effort to extort political dirtywork from a foreign government, and a massive cover-up orchestrated by the White House. It’s increasingly clear that Trump is not only unfit for office—he’s an active national security threat. — Julián Castro (@JulianCastro) September 26, 2019

Both Castro and Beto O’Rourke (D) called on the House to cancel its scheduled recess to begin impeachment proceedings.

“As the whistleblower made clear: Every day Trump is in office, our democracy is less safe. We can’t wait to act,” O’Rourke added:

Donald Trump has abused his office to benefit himself. Congress must immediately cancel its recess and begin impeachment proceedings to hold him accountable. The future of our democracy depends on it. #WhistleblowerComplaint — Julián Castro (@JulianCastro) September 26, 2019

John Delaney (D) simply quoted Ronald Reagan’s chief of staff, while Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH) accused Trump and Rudy Giuliani of “shaking down” Ukrainian officials for dirt on Biden:

""It's always the cover up rather than the event that gets you into trouble"" – Howard Baker, Chief of Staff to Ronald Reagan — John Delaney (@JohnDelaney) September 26, 2019

I just read the Whistleblower’s report. It’s as straightforward as can be. The President & Guiliani were shaking down the President of Ukraine—withholding needed defensive support—until they got dirt on Joe Biden. This is third-rate, banana republic behavior. — Tim Ryan (@TimRyan) September 26, 2019

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) tweeted a clip from her Wednesday appearance on Anderson Cooper 360, urging Americans to refrain from viewing the latest Democrat effort to take down Trump as a partisan issue:

As I said last night to @andersoncooper on @AC360: This shouldn’t be a partisan issue. Republicans and Democrats have an obligation to uphold the rule of law.

Trump questioned the “whistleblower” complaint in a tweet on Thursday, writing, “A whistleblower with second hand information? Another Fake News Story! See what was said on the very nice, no pressure, call. Another Witch Hunt!”:"

Cory Booker (D-NJ) are losing to some guy named Andrew Yang.

The four most recent national polls show Yang beating Booker in every single one. These same polls show Yang tied with O’Rourke in three, but shellacking him in a fourth.

The Economist has Yang at two points, Paddy with two points, and Booker with — LOL — zero.

Emerson has Yang at eight(!) points, Paddy with one point, and Booker with two.

Quinnipiac has Yang at two points, Paddy with two points, and Booker with — LOL — zero.

Morning Consult has all three sitting at three points.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Julian Castro, a former HUD secretary under President Obama, are polling even worse than Paddy and Booker.

The most interesting bit of polling news, though, is the total collapse of Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who is only polling a little better than Yang. But in the Emerson poll, which is only a few days old, he beats her eight points to four points.

In just ten weeks, Harris has dived from having 15 points of average national support from Democrat primary voters to just 4.9 percent, which is where she sits today, according to the Real Clear Politics poll of polls.

The Real Clear Politics poll of polls has Yang at 3.3 percent, which puts him ahead of O’Rourke at 2.4 percent, Booker at 1.7 percent, Klobuchar at 1.6 percent, and Castro at 1.3 percent.

Right now, the race for a 2020 Democrat presidential nomination is a three-way race… period. And it’s not even close.

In that poll of polls, former Vice President Joe Biden leads with 28 percent, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VA) with 22 and 17 percent, respectively.

The only positive thing you can say about Mean Little Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s poll position is that he’s at the top of the bottom tier with 5.9 percent support, which only puts him a little ahead of Yang’s 3.3 percent. But…

In that Emerson poll, Buttigieg is behind Yang — eight to six.

The 44-year-old Yang has no political experience. He’s a private sector success, an entrepreneur, lawyer, and CEO. His big idea is to take away everyone’s private health insurance by forcing us into a government-run Medicare For All. He wants to confiscate guns and give everyone $1,000 every month as a guaranteed income, for some crazy reason.

In other words, he’s a crank.

But so are all the others.

The difference is that Yang has some charisma and a sense of humor. Unlike Booker and Paddy and Klobuchar and Castro and the Mean Little Mayor, Yang is likable and self-deprecating. And that is all it takes to beat a bunch of left-wing stiffs these days.

‘DESERVE’S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT’

Let’s start with the precondition that we don’t care whether you think the investigation into President Trump’s efforts to get the Ukrainian government to prosecute his political rivals is “THE GREATEST SCAM IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS!” grounds for immediate impeachment or something in between.



We care in the sense that we’re sure that you are sincere in your beliefs and we acknowledge your God-given right to feel and think the way you do. What we mean is that in order to discern what might happen next, such feelings are hindrances. It’s hard to clearly consider such outcomes when you think in terms of your own beliefs.



This note, for example, would be a poor source for Major League Baseball forecasting since it is our position that the St. Louis Cardinals not only will win it all but deserve to win it all.



As William Munny told Little Bill Daggett right before he blew his head off with a Spencer repeating rifle on a saloon floor: “Deserve’s got nothing to do with it.”



There are plenty of people who think that Bill Clinton unfairly beat the rap, and even some who still think Richard Nixon got a raw deal. If you flipped through the back pages of enough bibliographies, you might even find some historians with strong feelings about what happened to old Andy Johnson.



Woodrow Wilson was incapacitated by a stroke in his second term, with his wife acting as a kind of regent for his last 17 months in office but Congress took no action. Warren Harding’s administration – in particular his Interior and Justice departments – was a quagmire of corruption, but he was dead and buried before any of it came to light. Lyndon Johnson grievously abused the powers of office for political advantage but he never faced any repercussions.



The rightness or wrongness of a president’s actions are all but immaterial in these matters. Whether the supporters or detractors of the aforementioned men were correct or not was of no consequence.

Now, that’s not to say that the passionate partisan bawling that we’re all now being subjected to won’t have an effect on what eventually does happen.



Studies suggest that home field advantage in sports is not only real but quite possibly the result of referees showing favoritism because of “the social atmosphere in the stadium.” The same is true with allegations of presidential misconduct.



We’ve said it many times before, but it bears repeating: Impeachment is a political proposition, not a legal one. And the referees here are the undecided or persuadable voters not yet sure what to make of what’s happening.



But even if you want to be part of working the refs – screaming into the orc-filled chasms of Twitter or annoying friends and loved ones with forwarded emails and Facebook posts – you probably still want to be able to think clearly about where it goes from here.



And that’s what we intend to help you do in the days ahead. You have plenty of other options for getting the latest details on what this unnamed source said or what that hearing may or may not have revealed. We’re going to stay focused on the political repercussions because that’s our job.



For the sake of everybody who is going to be out there fighting passionately for their side, whatever it is, we’ll do our best to not pick one.

TIME OUT: ONCE UPON A TIME…

NatGeo: “The brothers Grimm published what would become one of the most influential and famous collections of folklore in the world. Children’s and Household Tales (Kinder und Hausmärchen), later titled Grimm’s Fairy Tales, are childhood-defining stories. The Grimms, however, had curated the collection as an academic anthology for scholars of German culture, not as a collection of bedtime stories for young readers. Amid the political and social turbulence of the Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815), as France conquered Germanic lands, Jacob and Wilhelm were driven by nationalism to highlight their homeland and heritage. They were inspired by German Romantic authors and philosophers who believed that the purest forms of culture, those that bonded a community, could be found in stories shared from generation to generation. Storytelling expressed the essence of German culture and recalled the spirit and basic values of its people. By excavating Germany’s oral traditions, the brothers urgently sought to ‘preserve them from vanishing . . . to be forever silent in the tumult of our times.’”

WARREN SLIPS AND SWIPES BIDEN ON ETHICS

Fox News: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren spotlighted her longstanding calls for the impeachment of President Trump at a campaign event on Wednesday, emphasizing, ‘I hope we do this and I hope we do this quickly.’ But, she also appeared to unintentionally swipe at a rival Democrat vying for the White House – former Vice President Joe Biden – over his family’s role in the Ukraine controversy that led the House of Representatives to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump. Taking questions from reporters following a town hall event in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire, the Massachusetts Democrat was asked if she would allow her vice president’s child to serve on the board of a foreign company if she were president. Warren quickly answered, ‘no.’ When asked why, she said, in a rare moment where she appeared flustered: ‘I don’t know. I have to go back and look at the details.’”



More family woes for Biden - Politico: “Joe Biden’s brother told executives at a healthcare firm that the former vice president’s cancer initiative would promote their business, according to a participant in the conversation, who said the promise came as part of a pitch on behalf of potential investors in the firm. The allegation is the latest of many times Biden’s relatives have invoked the former vice president and his political clout to further their private business dealings. It is the first that involves the Biden Cancer Initiative, a project Joe Biden made the centerpiece of his post-White House life following the death of his son Beau. Biden’s brother, James, made the promise to executives at Florida-based Integrate Oral Care during a phone call on or around November 8, 2018, according to Michael Frey, CEO of Diverse Medical Management, a health-care firm that is suing James Biden. At the time, James Biden’s business partners were pursuing a potential investment in Integrate, according to Frey and court records.”



Sanders gives supporters the stage in Iowa - Des Moines Register: “As a Democratic candidate for president, [Bernie] Sanders frequently pushes his policies pugnaciously, framing them as moral imperatives as much as practical matters. But in his recent four-day swing through Iowa, he balanced his high-volume sermons with stories from his supporters. … Respondents who watched the September televised debate, where Sanders — who approached the debate stage with his typical fervor, but with a hoarse rasp — were more likely to have an unfavorable view of him. The debate-stage Sanders, whose style is described by some, including one of his 2020 rivals, as ""yelling"", was less present in his late September Iowa swing, Instead, Sanders often gave up the microphone to let others speak. … At his Iowa events, some of the personal stories are arranged in advance. But others are organic — hearing the stories of others inspires Sanders supporters to tell their own.”



Biden leads the pack in Maryland - Goucher College: “The Goucher College Poll asked Maryland Democratic likely voters who they are currently planning to vote for in the Maryland Democratic presidential primary… Thirty-three percent of Maryland Democratic likely voters say they will vote for Joe Biden and 21 percent for Elizabeth Warren. Ten percent would vote for Bernie Sanders, 6 percent for Kamala Harris, and 5 percent for Pete Buttigieg. All other candidates earn support from 1 percent or fewer of voters. Fifteen percent have no preference or are undecided. …Mileah Kromer, director of the Sarah T. Hughes Field Politics Center at Goucher College [said,] ‘Democrats in Maryland are divided over whether they want a more moderate or progressive nominee and whether nominating a candidate who can defeat Trump or match their policy preferences is their top priority.’”



ISSA TO CHALLENGE DUNCAN HUNTER

NYT: “Darrell Issa, the former nine-term congressman from California, will try to return to Congress by challenging Representative Duncan Hunter, who was indicted last year, setting up a clash among two Trump allies for one of Republicans’ most endangered seats. Mr. Issa is expected to announce his challenge at a news conference on Thursday morning in the San Diego County district, according to two sources familiar with his decision. He had been publicly mulling for months whether to make a bid to return to Congress, and started an exploratory committee in August. ‘I have received such a tremendous outpouring of encouragement from supporters inside the district, and around the state and across the nation,’ Mr. Issa said in August in a statement posted to the committee’s website. Mr. Issa will likely bill himself to Republicans as a safer alternative than the incumbent.”



Michigan announces new automatic voter registration - MLive: “Michigan took a leap forward into the modern era by announcing new voter registration policies on National Voter Registration Day. Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson announced [Tuesday] that automatic voter registration has officially launched in Michigan and online voter registration will be available following the November 2019 election. “Making voter registration automatic for eligible citizens means more Michigan residents will have access to participating in our democracy,” Benson said in a release. … Michigan joins 17 other states and the District of Columbia in enacting automatic voter registration.”

*AHEM* THEY GOT TRASHED

News24: “A South Korean mayor who dumped a ton of trash on a clean beach to give environmental campaigners something to pick up has said sorry for his deception. Officials trucked in litter and waste that had already been collected from rubbish-strewn coasts, and scattered it all over the pristine sand of southwest Jindo. The following day hundreds of volunteers scoured the shores and bagged up the garbage as part of an event to mark International Coastal Cleanup Day, a global event aimed at countering the scourge of sea-borne waste. ‘We brought in waste styrofoam and other coastal trash gathered from nearby areas so the 600 participants could carry out clean-up activities,’ said Lee Dong-jin, Jindo county mayor, in a statement. His office apologised for causing trouble and said the event was meant to ‘raise awareness about the seriousness of coastal waste.’”

""It is absurd that they continue to go down this road and haven't learned anything new from it,"" she added. ""I think the big loser in all this process has to be Joe Biden... So far the only inappropriate behavior that I'm seeing in this entire thing is that of Vice President Joe Biden, in order to help his son.""

Sanders likened the recent impeachment push by Democrats to the Russia investigation and accused them of using a ""fake scandal"" to dupe American voters and regain executive power.

""This is exactly out of the Democrats' playbook,"" she said. ""They used a fake scandal with Russia. Now they're trying to create a fake scandal with Ukraine. It doesn't matter who the actors are. The real bad players in this whole process are the Democrats, trying to fool American voters.

""The good thing is, the American voters are far too smart to fall for the Democrat lies,"" Sanders continued. ""I think one of the best things that's coming out of this is the contrast of who is showing up to be fit to lead our country in a very trying time.""

Sanders also said the Democratic Party has become so anti-Trump, they're willing to hurt the country if it means hurting the president.

""Time and time again the Democrats show their true colors. They don't care about the country,"" she added. ""They care about tearing the president down. They've completely lost sight of what is important and are singularly focused on making sure they destroy the president and win reelection.""

Sanders spoke shortly before the public release of a whistleblower complaint involving Trump asking the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. The complaint alleged that Trump used the ""power of his office to solicit interference"" from a foreign country in the 2020 election — and that White House officials subsequently tried to ""lock down"" records of that phone call.

""In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to 'lock down' all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced – as is customary – by the White House Situation Room,"" the complaint says.

At the time of his deployment in 2014, Buttigieg said, the men and women he served with didn’t know he was mayor of South Bend, Ind.

IN CROWDED DEMOCRATIC 2020 FIELD, CANDIDATES ARE MEETING WITH GROUPS WHO HOLD CLOUT

“My roommate didn’t know that I was anything besides an active-duty lieutenant,"" the candidate recalled as his bus made its way to Boone, Iowa during a four-day tour of central and eastern Iowa.

But once his fellow service members found out, he said, ""they would start calling me the honorable lieutenant.""

Five years ago, Buttigieg was among the rank and file of the United States military. Now he’s on a bus in Iowa trying to win over voters and distinguish himself in a crowded field of Democrats running for president.

“I think of a lot of them think it’s funny that someone they know is running for president,” Buttigieg said of those he served with in Afghanistan. “They’ve been encouraging.""

He added: ""I mean a lot of them are more politically conservative than I am, but they are supportive.”

Buttigieg decided to take a page from former Republican presidential candidate John McCain’s playbook by emulating the Arizona senator's famous “Straight Talk Express” bus tours -- in which he traveled with members of the media and opened himself up to questions on any topic.

It was Buttigieg’s first cup of coffee Sunday morning when he began comparing politics to football.

“I think football provides the most analogies for politics, he said. ""You’re protecting the quarterback but it’s not all about the quarterback -- because if you forget the importance of the line ,you’re in trouble.""

The campaign and reporters traveled to nine cities in four days on the Premiere Transportation coach that former President Barack Obama, legendary director Steven Spielberg, Sen. Mitt Romney, and entertainers Steve Harvey and Justin Timberlake have used. President Trump also rode on the bus at one point, according to Premiere Transportation staff.

It wasn’t typical bus seating.

The furniture allowed Buttigieg to look reporters in the eye. The bus was equipped with Wi-Fi for the press to file stories, and a flat-screen television, which allowed Buttigieg to keep an eye on football and the news. Also installed: a counter full of snacks, including chocolate chip cookies, protein bars, chips, gummy bears and coffee.

“I like sliced pickles, but other than that, my snack choices are pretty basic. I like beef jerky,” he said.

When he wasn't talking to reporters, Buttigieg was trying to make contact with Iowa voters.

“I looked at all the presidential [candidates] and I put a chart out,"" Amani Latimer, a Wisconsin voter and founder of Mamas 4 Pete, said after Buttigieg’s meet-and-greet in Dubuque. “I was, like, all over analytics, and I said this guy gets it.”

“I think he would make a great president, I mean he so’s smart,” Iowa caucusgoer Lindra Bicksler said after a campaign rally in Clinton. “He speaks seven languages and would be able to talk to leaders of other countries himself.”

While the yellow and blue bus rolled through rural Iowa, Buttigieg took a moment from talking with reporters to pull out his phone and look at the latest polls from The Des Moines Register and CNN. They put him fourth behind Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

“Oh, it’s a four-way race,” Buttigieg said.

Buttigieg said the bus tour is just one part of his strategy of connecting with voters in smaller communities, who he says are key to the Dem nomination.

“I’m not too worried about a variation like that, especially in a moment when only one in five people say they’ve made up their mind,” he said. “I think the important thing is that people know you, know what you’re about, do they like what they see -- and we’re seeing a lot of encouragement on that front.”

As voters prepare for the first-in-the-nation caucus and the first primary in New Hampshire, Buttigieg said his campaign has plans to step up outreach to voters. The bus may next head for the Granite State."

On the roster: Dems look to streamline impeachment probe - Team Trump leans on Mueller moves - Joe = Jeb? Biden benefactors ready to mobilize mega PAC - A little on the nose, don’t you think?



DEMS LOOK TO STREAMLINE IMPEACHMENT PROBE

WaPo: “House Democratic leaders are eyeing a fast-paced investigation into the possible impeachment of President Trump, instructing the committees handling the probe to wrap up their findings within weeks in hopes of concluding before the holiday season. Multiple Democratic lawmakers and congressional aides said there is no formal timeline for the inquiry, but the ‘need for speed,’ as one aide put it, comes as Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is under pressure from vulnerable freshmen to keep the investigation narrowly focused and disciplined. The emerging strategy of a rapid investigation focused mainly on the accusation that Trump urged Ukraine’s president to dig up dirt about a political rival comes as lawmakers prepare to leave Washington for a two-week recess. … Pelosi and other leaders huddled in a basement conference room Thursday evening with more than a dozen ‘front-liner’ members representing the toughest districts for incumbent Democrats to discuss the fledgling probe and, in the words of multiple attendees, ‘get on the same page.’”



Tim Alberta: Will impeachment shatter a badly broken Congress? - Politico: “On Monday, [Rep. Abigail Spanberger] joined with six like-minded freshman colleagues in penning a Washington Post op-ed calling for an impeachment inquiry—stunning the Democratic caucus and effectively forcing Pelosi’s hand. It would be the unlikeliest bunch of members, legislative pacifists who had labored not to be defined by opposition to Trump, leading Congress into an era-defining clash. How the impeachment proceedings affect an increasingly polarized nation is anyone’s guess. But it’s hard to imagine the coming showdown doing any more damage to an institution that, lawmakers in both parties will agree, was broken long before Donald Trump came to town.”



Snap poll shows impeachment supporters outnumber opponents - PBS: “Americans are split over whether they support an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, according to the latest poll from the PBS NewsHour, NPR and Marist. Forty-nine percent of U.S. adults said they supported the House of Representatives launching an impeachment inquiry into the president, while 46 percent of Americans said they disapproved, and 5 percent remained unsure, according to the poll. … Eighty-eight percent of Democrats agreed with the inquiry, along with 44 percent of independent voters, but among Republicans, support was drastically lower, at 6 percent. … This latest poll was conducted the day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for the House of Representatives to begin an impeachment inquiry…”



Kraushaar: Politics of impeachment now favor Democrats - National Journal: “The politics of impeachment is changing, rapidly. No one knows how this will end, but all signs are pointing to growing trouble for Republicans. The whistleblower’s well-documented allegation that Trump extorted Ukraine, an ally, for political gain is damning and direct. House Democrats are narrowly focused on digging deeper into the explosive evidence as the basis for impeachment. Administration officials connected to the alleged cover-up will be subpoenaed under oath before Congress as part of the impeachment hearings. If the White House thinks things will get better for them, they’re fooling themselves. … The larger reality is that public opinion is more fluid than anyone expected last week. Many anti-Trump pundits, expecting a repeat of our predictable tribal political realities, assumed that nothing has changed. But our politics has become so partisan that even rapid short-term movement suggests something is happening.”



Andrew Cuomo mocks ‘leftist,’ ‘unproductive’ impeachment effort - New York Daily News: “Gov. Andrew Cuomo criticized ‘leftist’ Democrats for pushing Congress into launching an impeachment inquiry of President Trump and predicted the probe would lead to government gridlock. The governor derided the ‘quote unquote inquiry’ as the work of angry radicals who forced the hand of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to mount what he suggested would ultimately be an exercise in futility. ‘There is a heightened leftist component of the Democratic Party that she was feeling pressure from,’ Cuomo said. The governor ticked off a list of legislative priorities that would likely languish until after the 2020 elections now that he said Democrats will be focused on removing Trump from power. ‘It’s a long and unproductive road,’ Cuomo said. ‘Where does it go ultimately? Nowhere.’”



TEAM TRUMP LEANS ON MUELLER MOVES

AP: “The White House is dusting off its playbook from the special counsel’s Russia investigation. Caught off guard by the speed at which a whistleblower’s claims have morphed into an impeachment inquiry, President Donald Trump and his team are scrambling to respond. They’re turning, at least for now, to some of the same strategies they used to counter special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. The basic tactics deployed by the short-staffed White House: Attempt to discredit government officials at the heart of the story. Dispatch Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and other allies to muddy the picture. Lean on Republicans in Congress to provide cover.”



Amy Walter: Impeachment won’t change the game - Cook Political Report: “We are a deeply divided, deeply polarized country. Almost everything we do — from choosing where to eat lunch (Chick-fil-A vs. Whole Foods), to picking where to live (urban/suburban vs. rural/small town) is filtered through the lens of how we identify politically. As such, we shouldn't expect views of impeachment to be any different. Opinions won't swing wildly from day to day or week to week. We also shouldn't expect to see Americans overwhelming support or overwhelmingly oppose impeachment. Like everything in this era, the final verdict on impeachment is likely to be decided on the margins by voters who are holding conflicting views on the president and the process of impeachment. It will be decided by those who may dislike Trump, but are also frustrated by the paralysis in Washington, or those who may like the agenda of the president, but are troubled by his behavior.”



Romney’s narrow road - NYT: “Mr. [Mitt] Romney’s public statements reflect what many in his party believe privately but are almost uniformly unwilling to say: that they are faced with damning revelations about the president that are difficult to explain away, and are unsure of whether there is more damaging material to come. What’s more, they are contending with a leader whose appetite for political payback for real or imagined slights is insatiable, and who is responding to the crisis with angry new threats and accusations that will only increase the pressure on them to choose a side. It amounts to an unenviable dilemma for Republicans at a consequential moment for the party. Any internal fractures over the next year could undermine both Mr. Trump’s re-election and Republican hopes for retaining their Senate majority and retaking the House.”



First GOP governors come out in support of impeachment inquiry - WaPo: “For the first time, two Republican governors have publicly supported the impeachment inquiry of President Trump, a new development in an intensifying political fracas that has so far been largely partisan. Vermont Gov. Phil Scott and Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, both outspoken critics of Trump from the Northeast, said Thursday they favored the investigation, but Scott added that he would wait for more information before calling for further action against the president.”

TIME OUT: MAN, HOLES

USA Today: “NASA has given us another historic glimpse into the wonders of space after releasing a video that shows a star-shredding black hole in a galaxy millions of light-years away. The amazing footage of the ‘cataclysmic phenomenon’ was taken by NASA’s planet-hunting Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS. Astronomers think the supermassive black hole weighs around 6 million times the sun’s mass and is located about 375 million light-years away in a galaxy of similar size to the Milky Way, NASA said. The incredible event, called a tidal disruption, is very rare and occurs once every 10,000 to 100,000 years in galaxies like the Milky Way. When a star gets too close, the intense tides of a black hole break apart the star into a stream of gas, according to NASA. As shown in the video, the tail of that stream breaks away from the black hole while other parts of it swing back around and create a halo of debris.”

JOE = JEB? BIDEN BENEFACTORS READY TO MOBILIZE MEGA PAC

NYT: “Allies of Joseph R. Biden Jr., concerned about his slipping poll numbers in the Democratic presidential primary and an onslaught of attacks from President Trump, are weighing whether to mobilize a super PAC supporting Mr. Biden and have held conversations with wealthy donors to gauge their interest in contributing money. Mr. Biden and his campaign aides have said since the start of the race that they would not welcome an outside spending effort on his behalf, and every other major Democratic candidate has sworn off super PACs for the duration of the primary. A spokesman for Mr. Biden on Thursday reiterated that he opposed super PACs and would reject any such group that attempted to support him. Yet several former staffers of Mr. Biden and political donors backing his candidacy have held conversations in recent weeks about moving ahead with a super PAC, and said Mr. Trump’s furious, and often unsubstantiated, allegations about the former vice president had convinced them it was imperative they act.”



Under fire, Biden looks to scamper left - WaPo: “Advisers to presidential candidate Joe Biden are weighing the introduction of a new tax on Wall Street, according to people familiar with the discussions, as the former vice president now stands alone among the Democratic presidential front-runners in not backing a multitrillion-dollar ‘wealth tax’ on the richest Americans. The plan under consideration from Biden’s advisers could tax financial transactions such as the sale of stocks and bonds, one of the people said. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Biden, under pressure throughout the presidential campaign to move left on a range of policy issues, has embraced several ideas to increase taxes on the rich and on corporations but so far has not gone as far as his two main rivals. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have each unveiled their own plans to impose a ‘wealth tax’ on multimillionaires and billionaires, with both also calling for significant new taxes on corporations and wealthy estates. Sanders unveiled his wealth tax earlier this week.”



Wall Street Democratic donors lay down the law on Warren - CNBC: “Democratic donors on Wall Street and in big business are preparing to sit out the presidential campaign fundraising cycle — or even back President Donald Trump — if Sen. Elizabeth Warren wins the party’s nomination. In recent weeks, CNBC spoke to several high-dollar Democratic donors and fundraisers in the business community and found that this opinion was becoming widely shared as Warren, an outspoken critic of big banks and corporations, gains momentum against Joe Biden in the 2020 race. ‘You’re in a box because you’re a Democrat and you’re thinking, ‘I want to help the party, but she’s going to hurt me, so I’m going to help President Trump,’’ said a senior private equity executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity in fear of retribution by party leaders.”



A dozen candidates, one night for next Dem debate - Politico: “The Democratic National Committee intends to hold its fourth presidential primary debate on one night in October, packing the stage with as many as 12 qualified candidates. ‘To address several inquiries we have received we are writing to let you know that, pending a final decision after the certification deadline, it is the intention of the DNC and our media partners to hold the October debate over one night on Tuesday October 15th,’ the DNC wrote in an email to campaigns on Friday.”

WABC: “Officials in New Jersey are looking into multiple complaints of a mystery odor that smells like rotten fish. The Hudson Regional Health Commission said they received two complaints in Jersey City and several complaints in Bayonne on Tuesday night. The HRHC confirmed a presence of an odor, but said the source could not be traced. Inspectors went into Newark - specifically to Raymound Boulevard and Doremus Avenue, because winds were coming from that direction. They were not successful in locating the origin. ‘It's not anything were used to around here. Being a peninsula, we have water on three sides and sometimes at low tide that you can smell the bay. It was really nothing like that. It was a very nasty, almost like a foul meat type of smell,’ OEM Coordinator Edoardo Ferrante said.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Thursday refused to say if Medicare for All will result in higher taxes for middle class families, dodging the question and instead claiming people care more about overall “costs.”

Warren spoke to NBC News’ Ali Vitali, who asked the Massachusetts senator if Medicare for All will result in higher taxes for middle class families– a question Warren has faced several times before on both the debate stage and campaign trail. Once again, Warren did not answer the question, instead claiming that families care more about overall “costs”:

“So one of the things that a few of your opponents were talking about late last week really was this idea of middle class taxes in healthcare. So yes or no– should middle class Americans expect their taxes to go up under a Medicare for All system?” Vitali asked.

“You may remember that I’ve spent a big chunk of my life studying why middle class families go broke, and one of the number one reasons is health care,” Warren said, repeating one of her routine talking points.

“The problem is its total cost for these families, so it’s what you pay in premiums. It’s also what you paying co-pays to see a doctor, or sorry that doctor is out of network so you’ve got to pay for the whole thing,” she explained.

Because of that, Warren suggested that Americans need to change the way they view the system:

People keep reaching into their pockets and reaching into their pockets even when they have health insurance, so how we have to think about this system is yes we should expect that for giant corporations and very wealthy individuals, costs will go up, but for middle class families – for hardworking people – the costs are going to go down.

“But that’s not the same as taxes not going up,” Vitali pointed out.

Warren did not dismiss Vitali’s assertion but argued that families care more about overall “costs,” regardless of increased taxes.

“What matters to families is costs,” Warren said.

Warren faced the same question during the Democrat debate in Houston, Texas, and repeated the same lines about total “cost.”

“What we’re talking about here is what’s going to happen in families’ pockets, what’s going to happen in their budgets, and the answer is, on Medicare for All, costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals and costs are going to go up for giant corporations,” she said.

“But for hardworking families across this country costs are going to go down, and that’s how it should work under Medicare for All,” she added, refusing to ultimately say if middle class taxes would go up, regardless of overall “costs.”

Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) went after Warren for repeatedly refusing to answer the question.

“Senator Warren is known for being straightforward, and was extremely evasive when asked that question, and we’ve seen that repeatedly,” he told CNN’s The Lead last week.

“I think that if you are proud of your plan and it’s the right plan, you should defend it in straightforward terms,” he continued.

“And I think it’s puzzling that when everybody knows the answer to that question, of whether her plan and Senator Sanders’ plan will raise middle-class taxes is yes, why you wouldn’t just say so and then explain why you think that’s the better way forward,” he added."

In an article published this week, Esquire's literary editor, Amy Grace Lloyd, suggested the Trump administration has purged people like the totalitarian regime in ""The Handmaid's Tale.""

""Different. For the moment you and I are not in danger of getting arrested by the NKVD,"" said Atwood, referring to the Soviet police force that carried out mass arrests and executions under dictator Josef Stalin.

""You think Gilead is bad or that the TV series is too violent? Look up the NKVD,"" Atwood added. ""It’s important to have that perspective. People are saying Trump is re-creating Gilead. That’s not true. If it were, we’d not be having this conversation. He’s not even a particularly Gileadean figure, more like a [Babylonian king] Nebuchadnezzar of the right. That guy went mad.""

ELISABETH MOSS SAYS IT'S 'APT' TO COMPARE ANTI-ABORTION LAWS TO 'HANDMAID'S TALE'S' DYSTOPIAN SOCIETY

When Lloyd responded by complaining about ""divisiveness being promoted"" in the U.S., Atwood told her to ""suck it up!""

""Why are you so afraid?"" Atwood asked. ""No one is going to kill you right now. Anybody banging down your door? What you should be doing is figuring out who to vote for in the next election. Which candidate is going to take you the farthest he or she can from Gilead? Panic isn’t helpful.""

Since the Hulu show based on Atwood's novel premiered in April 2017, liberals have repeatedly compared Republicans and their policies to those of the villains in the story. At the 2018 White House Correspondents' Dinner, for example, comedienne Michelle Wolf compared then-White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to Aunt Lydia, the brutal overseer of Gilead's female captives.

Starr, who served as independent counsel on an investigation that was used as the basis for the impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998, accused Democrats of moving too quickly and said there would have to be hard proof of some ""treason"" or ""bribery"" to make any future charges stick.

""To so prematurely jump onto this road and start racing down impeachment road or impeachment alley is, I believe, at this stage, a great disservice to the country,"" he continued. ""Impeachment is about treason. There's no treason here. It's about bribery. There's nothing that, to me, partakes of bribery.""

Democrats accused Trump of attempting to withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for the government's cooperation in investigating 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who had ties to one of the country's natural gas firms involved in a corruption probe.

Follow her on Twitter: @FromaHarrop . The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers; view more opinion articles at CNN.

(CNN) Democrats might ask themselves why President Donald Trump is so intent on smearing former Vice President Joe Biden with phony scandals. Why isn't he doing the same to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who's been climbing in the polls and has a shot at becoming the Democratic nominee for president?

The clear answer is that Biden, in his own words, could ""beat him like a drum"" -- and while Warren could win against Trump, her victory does not look like a resounding one, according to recent polls . In Trump's view, Biden poses the greatest threat and must be destroyed. And what better way than to wound Biden to the point that Democrats might think he's more trouble than he's worth?

Warren fans will point to national polls showing their candidate defeating Trump in a general election. But it's important to note that Warren has been largely spared from Trump's attacks thus far, and those polls don't take into account the campaign of calumny that would surely follow a Warren nomination. It's Biden that Trump clearly most fears.

It would not surprise me if foreign propagandists decided to take to social media to advance Warren's candidacy and hurt Biden's. This happened in 2016, when Russian trolls tried to turn fans of Bernie Sanders against Hillary Clinton. Many supporters took the bait and either voted for third party candidates or sat out the election.

Though polls suggest that Warren could defeat Trump by a few points, Biden still holds a more comfortable margin over the President. Let's not forget that poll numbers don't necessarily translate to an Electoral College victory. In 2016, Clinton lost the election even though she bested Trump by nearly 2.9 million votes nationally.

Biden is still a stronger bet against Trump in crucial swing states like Wisconsin and Ohio, compared to Warren. The most recent Wisconsin poll pitting Democrats against Trump has Biden winning by 9 points, while Elizabeth Warren is tied with the President. In Ohio, Biden is the only Democrat who can beat Trump. According to the most recent Quinnipiac poll from July, Biden leads Trump by 8 points, while Sanders and Warren both trail the President by 1.

President Trump has claimed Biden called for Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor who was ""investigating his son."" But there is no evidence Hunter Biden was under investigation. The probe was into the business dealings of the owner of a Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden sat on the board of directors.

How should Democrats handle Trump's hatchet job on Biden's integrity? For starters, they should not get sucked into arguments over Biden's guilt or innocence. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden, and Ukraine's current prosecutor general also came out in defense of the two. And making the case that the Trump children are profiting from their proximity to their father establishes a false equivalence that turns a flat-out lie into a ""what about the other side?"" discussion.

Meanwhile, other polls underscore weaknesses in the Warren campaign. For one thing, Warren seems to have a likeability problem, even in politically friendly states. A CNN/UNH Survey Center poll from July asked likely New Hampshire voters which Democrat they found most likeable. Biden and Sanders topped the list at 20% each, while only 4% chose Warren.

Then there are the policies. Warren endorses a Medicare for All health plan that would do away with private coverage, even though a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows only 41% of registered voters supporting a system that eliminates private health coverage.

Biden's support for a government-run option in Obamacare is much closer to the public's preference. The poll found that 67% want an option to buy health coverage through a Medicare program, while keeping the possibility of private insurance.

Warren's call for decriminalizing illegal border crossings is also widely unpopular. She might be able to finesse that position in a general election campaign, but her views on immigration generally have ventured dangerously close to open borders.

Democrats might ultimately choose someone other than Biden as their presidential nominee. But it should be their decision and not a scared response to Trump's manipulation of the truth. There is a good reason he's so intent on crushing Biden."

""We ask that you to immediately reverse course and heed the recommendation of top US military officials and faith leaders to open our doors to eligible refugees from all corners of the world,"" the letter reads. ""A generous US refugee policy spares tens of thousands from terrible fates.""

The letter, led by Sens. Jeff Merkley and Ed Markey, comes on the heels of the State Department's report to Congress that proposed a refugee cap -- which dictates how many refugees may be admitted to the US -- to 18,000 for fiscal year 2020, which begins next week.

Under Trump, the administration has slowly chipped away at the refugee cap. The ceiling for fiscal year 2019 stands at 30,000, which, at the time, was the lowest level since 1980.

The State Department announced the proposed refugee ceiling Thursday as part of a larger number of combined refugee and asylum claims expected for the next fiscal year.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) told late-night host Stephen Colbert on Thursday that his Medicare for All proposal is far from free and Americans making over $29,000 will see their taxes raised to pay for it.

Sanders has been a vocal proponent of Medicare for All, which — by some estimates — could cost over $60 trillion over a decade. Colbert asked Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) last week if Medicare for All would result in higher taxes for middle class Americans, and he posed the same question to Sanders on Thursday.

“Senator Warren was on here last week and I asked her about her plans for Medicare for All, and I’m going to ask you the question that I asked her … at the risk of being accused of trumpeting Republican talking points,” Colbert said.

“Is there an increase in taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for All, or rather, where would the tax burden go to pay for that?” the CBS host asked.

Sanders initially issued a similar answer to Warren, who repeatedly talked about overall “costs” rather than increased taxation itself.

“Under my legislation — 15 co-sponsors I believe in the Senate now — nobody in America will pay any more premiums,” Sanders said. “No more co-payments, gone. No more out-of-pocket expenses, gone. Nobody will go bankrupt… because of medical bills, that is gone.”

“Nobody in America under my bill will pay more than $200 a year in total for their prescription drugs,” he continued.

However, the socialist senator admitted that health care is not “free.”

“Now having said that, is health care free? No, it is not. So what we do is exempt the first $29,000 of a person’s income. You make less than $29,000, you pay nothing in taxes,” Sanders explained, essentially admitting that taxes will go up on middle class families from there.

“Above that, in a progressive way with the wealthiest people paying the largest percentage, people do pay more in taxes,” Sanders said. “But if I say to you, that right now you’re paying $20,000 a year in a tax called a premium for insurance companies. That’s gone.”

Sanders’ admission stands in stark contrast to Warren, who refused to explicitly state that Medicare for All will result in increased taxes for the middle class.

“Will their taxes go up?” Colbert asked after Warren refused to answer the question directly.

“I’ve listened to these answers a few times before, and I just want to make a parallel suggestion to you that you might defend the taxes perhaps that you’re not mentioning in your sentence,” he said.

“Isn’t Medicare for All like public school? There might be taxes for it, but you certainly save a lot of money sending your kids to school and do you want to live in a world where your kids aren’t educated? Do you want to live in a world where your fellow citizens are dying, even if it costs a little bit of money?” he asked.

“So, I accept your point and I believe in your point. Health care is a basic human right. We fight for basic human rights, and that’s Medicare for All. Everyone gets covered,” Warren responded, still refusing to say if she would raise taxes on the middle class to implement Medicare for All."

During Watergate, Iran-Contra, the Clinton impeachment affair, and plenty of other controversies, the White House briefing room was filled with reporters demanding answers to tough questions, pushing press secretaries who often weren’t sure how to defend their boss in the Oval Office.

Stephanie Grisham has it quite a bit easier.

Much of the country might struggle to pick Grisham out of a lineup, probably because she hasn’t held any press briefings since succeeding Sarah Huckabee Sanders three months ago. That’s not an exaggeration: the current White House press secretary has held exactly zero briefings in the White House press briefing room.

Earlier this week, Grisham sat down with the hosts of Fox & Friends and explained why no one should expect the briefings to return anytime soon.

[Grisham said] the press briefings under Sean Spicer and Sanders had become “theater,” with reporters using the opportunity to ask questions of the government as a chance to become “famous.” When Fox’s Brian Kilmeade asked Grisham if Trump “took it personal” when the press was combative with her predecessors, she confirmed it. Spicer and Sanders were not able to “get his message out there,” she said. “They weren’t being good to his people. And he doesn’t like that. He is very loyal to his people and he put a stop to it.”

For what it’s worth, there’s all kinds of evidence of Trump failing spectacularly to demonstrate loyalty toward “his people.” For that matter, it’s not the job of White House reporters to be “good” to presidential press secretaries.

But even putting that aside, as I suspect folks in the West Wing have noticed, there’s a major scandal brewing that’s likely to lead to the president’s impeachment. In theory, Stephanie Grisham would face a daily grilling, while simultaneously pushing a pro-Trump message, refuting accusations, and making every effort to shape coverage in ways that might benefit her boss.

None of that is happening. It’s … weird.

The press secretary did turn to Twitter yesterday in the hopes of discrediting some “myths” surrounding the president’s Ukraine scandal, but there were no follow-up questions because Grisham wasn’t willing to deliver a statement from her White House podium.

It led The New Yorker’s Susan Glasser to publish some tweets of her own, featuring questions the press secretary might consider answering:

“Dear [Grisham]: ‘do us a favor, though’. Care to comment? Also, in what capacity is Rudy Giuliani advising the President? Is he paying him? Using what funds? Is there a legal matter involving Trump and Ukraine and if no why is Giuliani involved? Why was US ambassador to Ukraine pushed out? What did President Trump mean when he told Ukraine’s President some things were going to happen to her? “Did the President attach any conditions to meet with the President of Ukraine? What were they and how were they communicated? Why President Trump tell an Oval Office meeting he felt Ukraine was out to get him? Also why did President Trump personally ask to hold up Ukraine military aid, according to what OMB officials told other US officials? Why did the President tell VP Pence not to go to Zelensky’s Inauguration? When was the President told about the whistleblower and by whom?”

I’d encourage White House reporters to use Glasser’s list as a guide during the next briefing, though at this point, the earliest we should expect to see another press briefing is January 2021."

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., were sexist if they kept supporting him over Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

""I actually overheard someone saying -- that I thought was an interesting point -- that basically at this point if you are still supporting Sanders as opposed to Warren, it's kind of showing your sexism because she has more detailed plans and her plans have evolved,"" strategist Emily Tisch Sussman said on Monday.

""I thought it was an interesting point and I think there might be something to it,"" she added while speaking on ""MSNBC Live.""

Her comments came as new polls showed Warren beating both Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states in the Democratic primary calendar. Sanders and Warren have been portrayed as the standard-bearers for the Democrats' far-left wing.

Sussman indicated that Sanders' candidacy was a lost cause, telling MSNBC host Craig Melvin that Warren was taking voters from Sanders and that the Vermont senator had ""peaked"" in the race.

""What we're seeing of his supporters -- there's a ceiling. There is nowhere to go -- there is no up to go,"" she added.

Nina Turner, who co-chairs Sanders' campaign, called Sussman's comments ""foolishness."" ""I’m truly trying to wrap my mind around this foolishness,"" she tweeted early Saturday, alongside an annoyed emoji.

Other women responded on Twitter Saturday, citing Sanders' support for various economic policies -- many of which Warren herself has backed.

""Not here to be vote shamed by the 1 [percent],"" Amy Vilela, the Nevada co-chair for Sanders' campaign, said. ""I am supporting the only candidate who will always put the needs of people first."" Her ""1 [percent]"" comment seemed to be a dig at the fact that Sussman's father is financier Donald Sussman."

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in the hot seat on Thursday night and quizzed him on whether the middle class will face tax hikes to fund Medicare-for-all similarly to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.

""Senator Warren was on here last week and I asked her about her plans for Medicare-for-all and I'm going to ask you the question that I asked her... at the risk of being accused of trumpeting Republican talking points,"" Colbert warned Sanders. ""Is there an increase in taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare-for-all, or rather, where would the tax burden go to pay for that?""

""Under my legislation... nobody in America will pay any more premiums,"" Sanders responded. ""No more co-payments, gone. No more out-of-pocket expenses, gone. Nobody will go bankrupt... because of medical bills, that is gone. Nobody in America under my bill will pay more than $200 a year in total for their prescription drugs.""

""Now having said that, is health care free? No, it is not,"" the 2020 hopeful continued. ""So what we do is exempt the first $29,000 of a person's income... Above that, in a progressive way with the wealthiest people paying the largest percentage, people do pay more in taxes.""

ELIZABETH WARREN SAYS SHE WOULDN'T ALLOW THE CHILD OF HER VP TO SIT ON FOREIGN COMPANY BOARD

Last week, Colbert attempted to ask Warren the same question, but struggled to get a direct answer from her.

“You keep being asked in the debates how are you going to pay for it, are you going to be raising the middle-class taxes… How are you going to pay for it? Are you going to be raising the middle-class taxes?” Colbert asked.

“So, here’s how we’re going to do this,” Warren responded. “Costs are going to go up for the wealthiest Americans, for big corporations… and hard-working middle-class families are going to see their costs going down.”

“But will their taxes go up?” Colbert pressed.

“But, here’s the thing,” Warren said.

“But, here’s the thing,” Colbert grinningly interrupted. “I’ve listened to these answers a few times before and I just want to make a parallel suggestion to you that you might defend the taxes perhaps that you’re not mentioning in your sentence.”

He continued by sharing his “parallel suggestion”: “Isn’t Medicare-for-all like public school? There might be taxes for it, but you certainly save a lot of money sending your kids to school and do you want to live in a world where your kids aren’t educated? Do you want to live in a world where your fellow citizens are dying, even if it costs a little bit of money?”"

'The Contract' was a plank of popular proposals that the Republicans pledged to pursue if the voters put them in power. Plus, it came with a caveat -- if the new Republican majority didn't follow through, then the voters should kick them out of office.

NEWT GINGRICH: SPEAKER PELOSI: THIS IS THE INVESTIGATION CONGRESS NEEDS TO DO RIGHT NOW

""The Contract gave people something worth voting for. We pledged that if you voted Republican in the 1994 election we would bring 10 points of supporting legislation to the House floor. If these legislative policies appeal to you the only way to get them is to vote Republican,"" said Gingrich in Fox Nation's new series ""Inside the Contract With America.""

A few weeks after Gingrich's gamble, Republicans won enough seats in the 1994 midterm elections to secure a majority in the House of Representatives -- overturning 40 years of Democratic-control.

'The Contract' was a revolutionary idea and it is credited with contributing to one of the most dramatic political events in American history -- the Republican Revolution. It included some proposals that were realized such as welfare reform -- and to an extent -- term limits, and others than were not such as the balanced budget.

EXPERTS SAYS CLINTON'S IMPEACHMENT WAS POLITICAL BLUNDER FOR REPUBLICANS

Liberal criticism of 'The Contract' started almost immediately.

""The Democrats played into it, they attacked it. They helped us make it a news story,"" former Republican National Committee chairman and 2017 Virginia gubernatorial nominee Ed Gillespie told Fox Nation.

In fact, shortly after the 1994 midterm election, Senator Bernie Sanders I-Vt., went on CSPAN to offer a progressive response.

""The Contract is a fraud. We think that the more the American people understand what is in the contract, which essentially amounts to very large tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country, the eventual destruction of social security, major slashes in Medicare and Medicaid, increasing military spending and cutting back on nutrition programs for hungry children and for needy senior citizens, I think as people understand what is in the contract I think they will begin to reject it,"" said Sen. Sanders.

Gingrich came up with the idea of reaching around the media to communicate directly with the American electorate and that plan included putting an advertisement in the TV Guide.

""We're in Annapolis, I think in the Spring of '94. [Former RNC Chairman Haley Barbour] and I go to an old bar that's in a Federalist era building right across from the state capital. Down in the basement. And we're sitting there talking,"" remembered Gingrich in the Fox Nation show.

Barbour recalled that he walked into this meeting without being clear on what it was all about.

""Newt's big idea was we're gonna put an ad in TV Guide. The idea was we're gonna put an insert in there about 'Contract with America'. And the message is, if you elect Republicans to run the House of Representatives if we win the House of Representative this is what we pledge we'll do,"" Barbour said.

The advertisment was printed on a page of the TV Guide that was designed to be torn out and used as a checklist to hold their elected representatives accountable.

""Here's our 10 things, tear this out of your TV Guide, post it up on your refrigerator, and as we do 'em check 'em off, done, done, done. And within a hundred days, if you don't have 10 check marks we don't deserve to be reelected,"" said Barry Johnson, former Executive Director of 'Contract with America.'

On Fox Nation's ""Deep Dive,"" Fox News contributor Liz Peek said that lawmakers should learn from the history of the 'Republican Revolution.'

""The American people are commonsensical... I actually think that in our political world today we underestimate the value of promising good governence and those aren't policies -- that's values,"" she said.

FOX NEWS HOSTS ON DEMS' IMPEACHMENT PUSH

Wall Street Journal Editorial Page member Bill McGurn agreed, ""They picked issues -- unlike Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren picking some of these issues that have no support -- they looked and said 'Where are the American people aligned most strongly with Republican principals.'""

Reflecting back on the selling of the 'Contract with America', Johnson told Fox Nation that it was a smashing success, ""[I]t got to the point where one of the industry magazines, 'Advertising Age' puts out an annual issue naming their top marketing campaigns of the year. 'The Contract with America' was the top marketing campaign of the year, and the front cover of Advertising Age had this picture of Newt and I standing on the Speaker's balcony and they did an interview with us and everything. That's just one of those little weird things that happened out of 'The Contract.'""

Aderholt: Biden ‘Out of the Picture’ — ‘Consensus’ Among House Members Is Elizabeth Warren Will Be Dem Nominee,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2019/09/27/gop-rep-aderholt-biden-out-of-the-picture-consensus-among-house-members-is-elizabeth-warren-will-be-dem-nominee/,"Allegations of President Donald Trump improperly exerting pressure on the Ukraine government for an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden and the heightened specter of Trump’s impeachment have dominated political headlines in recent days.

During an appearance on Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN during an appearance in Washington, D.C. at the Federation for American Immigration Reform’s (FAIR) Hold Their Feet to the Fire annual radio event, Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-AL) discussed the possible motivations of the renewed push against Trump as it pertained to Ukraine.

“I think they’re trying to make the president look bad,” Aderholt said. “That’s one aspect of it – but also trying to appease their Democrat base on the other side. Now what is going to be interesting, I think, is see what in the next few days and next couple of weeks what we see this does to Biden because Biden is all wrapped up in this whole thing and his son Hunter. So, I don’t know how that’s going to have an impact.”

The Alabama Republican lawmaker said given the Biden son’s involvement in the saga, Biden could be eliminated from contention for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

“I think quite honestly Biden is out of the picture,” he continued. “I’ve said for quite some time now that I don’t think he will be the nominee. And I think with this recent thing he has implicated with his son that I think this assures he will not be the nominee.”

Aderholt went on to add that among his House colleagues, there is a consensus Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) will be the nominee.

“Certainly, those on the left side of the party – they don’t like Trump obviously,” he added. “But they don’t really like Biden either. So, I think Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren – that’s who they would gravitate toward. I talk to a lot of my colleagues. I casually just ask the question about how they see this playing out. It seems like the consensus is that Elizabeth Warren is going to be the nominee.”

DNC RAISES THE BAR FOR CANDIDATES TO QUALIFY FOR NOVEMBER SHOWDOWN

The email, which was sent to the various presidential campaigns, was obtained by Fox News.

Twelve candidates in the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls say they’ve reached the qualifying criteria to make the stage at the showdown, which will be held on the campus of Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. It is the fourth round of debates for Democrats this cycle.

Those candidates – in alphabetical order – are former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Sen. Kamala Harris of California; Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

WELD, WALSH, SWING AT TRUMP IN FIRST GOP PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY DEBATE

No other presidential contenders appear likely to reach the thresholds to make the cut. To reach the stage, candidates need to hit at least 2 percent in four qualifying polls and contributions from at least 130,000 individual donors.

The debate is being hosted by CNN and The New York Times.

The first two rounds of debates in June and July – which had lower criteria to qualify – were held over two consecutive nights with 10 candidates on the stage each evening. Ten candidates faced off on one night in this month’s third round debate, for which the thresholds were raised."

At the time of his deployment in 2014, Buttigieg said, the men and women he served with didn’t know he was mayor of South Bend, Ind.

IN CROWDED DEMOCRATIC 2020 FIELD, CANDIDATES ARE MEETING WITH GROUPS WHO HOLD CLOUT

“My roommate didn’t know that I was anything besides an active-duty lieutenant,"" the candidate recalled as his bus made its way to Boone, Iowa during a four-day tour of central and eastern Iowa.

But once his fellow service members found out, he said, ""they would start calling me the honorable lieutenant.""

Five years ago, Buttigieg was among the rank and file of the United States military. Now he’s on a bus in Iowa trying to win over voters and distinguish himself in a crowded field of Democrats running for president.

“I think of a lot of them think it’s funny that someone they know is running for president,” Buttigieg said of those he served with in Afghanistan. “They’ve been encouraging.""

He added: ""I mean a lot of them are more politically conservative than I am, but they are supportive.”

Buttigieg decided to take a page from former Republican presidential candidate John McCain’s playbook by emulating the Arizona senator's famous “Straight Talk Express” bus tours -- in which he traveled with members of the media and opened himself up to questions on any topic.

It was Buttigieg’s first cup of coffee Sunday morning when he began comparing politics to football.

“I think football provides the most analogies for politics, he said. ""You’re protecting the quarterback but it’s not all about the quarterback -- because if you forget the importance of the line ,you’re in trouble.""

The campaign and reporters traveled to nine cities in four days on the Premiere Transportation coach that former President Barack Obama, legendary director Steven Spielberg, Sen. Mitt Romney, and entertainers Steve Harvey and Justin Timberlake have used. President Trump also rode on the bus at one point, according to Premiere Transportation staff.

It wasn’t typical bus seating.

The furniture allowed Buttigieg to look reporters in the eye. The bus was equipped with Wi-Fi for the press to file stories, and a flat-screen television, which allowed Buttigieg to keep an eye on football and the news. Also installed: a counter full of snacks, including chocolate chip cookies, protein bars, chips, gummy bears and coffee.

“I like sliced pickles, but other than that, my snack choices are pretty basic. I like beef jerky,” he said.

When he wasn't talking to reporters, Buttigieg was trying to make contact with Iowa voters.

“I looked at all the presidential [candidates] and I put a chart out,"" Amani Latimer, a Wisconsin voter and founder of Mamas 4 Pete, said after Buttigieg’s meet-and-greet in Dubuque. “I was, like, all over analytics, and I said this guy gets it.”

“I think he would make a great president, I mean he so’s smart,” Iowa caucusgoer Lindra Bicksler said after a campaign rally in Clinton. “He speaks seven languages and would be able to talk to leaders of other countries himself.”

While the yellow and blue bus rolled through rural Iowa, Buttigieg took a moment from talking with reporters to pull out his phone and look at the latest polls from The Des Moines Register and CNN. They put him fourth behind Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

“Oh, it’s a four-way race,” Buttigieg said.

Buttigieg said the bus tour is just one part of his strategy of connecting with voters in smaller communities, who he says are key to the Dem nomination.

“I’m not too worried about a variation like that, especially in a moment when only one in five people say they’ve made up their mind,” he said. “I think the important thing is that people know you, know what you’re about, do they like what they see -- and we’re seeing a lot of encouragement on that front.”

As voters prepare for the first-in-the-nation caucus and the first primary in New Hampshire, Buttigieg said his campaign has plans to step up outreach to voters. The bus may next head for the Granite State."

DEMS LOOK TO STREAMLINE IMPEACHMENT PROBE

WaPo: “House Democratic leaders are eyeing a fast-paced investigation into the possible impeachment of President Trump, instructing the committees handling the probe to wrap up their findings within weeks in hopes of concluding before the holiday season. Multiple Democratic lawmakers and congressional aides said there is no formal timeline for the inquiry, but the ‘need for speed,’ as one aide put it, comes as Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is under pressure from vulnerable freshmen to keep the investigation narrowly focused and disciplined. The emerging strategy of a rapid investigation focused mainly on the accusation that Trump urged Ukraine’s president to dig up dirt about a political rival comes as lawmakers prepare to leave Washington for a two-week recess. … Pelosi and other leaders huddled in a basement conference room Thursday evening with more than a dozen ‘front-liner’ members representing the toughest districts for incumbent Democrats to discuss the fledgling probe and, in the words of multiple attendees, ‘get on the same page.’”



Tim Alberta: Will impeachment shatter a badly broken Congress? - Politico: “On Monday, [Rep. Abigail Spanberger] joined with six like-minded freshman colleagues in penning a Washington Post op-ed calling for an impeachment inquiry—stunning the Democratic caucus and effectively forcing Pelosi’s hand. It would be the unlikeliest bunch of members, legislative pacifists who had labored not to be defined by opposition to Trump, leading Congress into an era-defining clash. How the impeachment proceedings affect an increasingly polarized nation is anyone’s guess. But it’s hard to imagine the coming showdown doing any more damage to an institution that, lawmakers in both parties will agree, was broken long before Donald Trump came to town.”



Snap poll shows impeachment supporters outnumber opponents - PBS: “Americans are split over whether they support an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, according to the latest poll from the PBS NewsHour, NPR and Marist. Forty-nine percent of U.S. adults said they supported the House of Representatives launching an impeachment inquiry into the president, while 46 percent of Americans said they disapproved, and 5 percent remained unsure, according to the poll. … Eighty-eight percent of Democrats agreed with the inquiry, along with 44 percent of independent voters, but among Republicans, support was drastically lower, at 6 percent. … This latest poll was conducted the day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for the House of Representatives to begin an impeachment inquiry…”



Kraushaar: Politics of impeachment now favor Democrats - National Journal: “The politics of impeachment is changing, rapidly. No one knows how this will end, but all signs are pointing to growing trouble for Republicans. The whistleblower’s well-documented allegation that Trump extorted Ukraine, an ally, for political gain is damning and direct. House Democrats are narrowly focused on digging deeper into the explosive evidence as the basis for impeachment. Administration officials connected to the alleged cover-up will be subpoenaed under oath before Congress as part of the impeachment hearings. If the White House thinks things will get better for them, they’re fooling themselves. … The larger reality is that public opinion is more fluid than anyone expected last week. Many anti-Trump pundits, expecting a repeat of our predictable tribal political realities, assumed that nothing has changed. But our politics has become so partisan that even rapid short-term movement suggests something is happening.”



Andrew Cuomo mocks ‘leftist,’ ‘unproductive’ impeachment effort - New York Daily News: “Gov. Andrew Cuomo criticized ‘leftist’ Democrats for pushing Congress into launching an impeachment inquiry of President Trump and predicted the probe would lead to government gridlock. The governor derided the ‘quote unquote inquiry’ as the work of angry radicals who forced the hand of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to mount what he suggested would ultimately be an exercise in futility. ‘There is a heightened leftist component of the Democratic Party that she was feeling pressure from,’ Cuomo said. The governor ticked off a list of legislative priorities that would likely languish until after the 2020 elections now that he said Democrats will be focused on removing Trump from power. ‘It’s a long and unproductive road,’ Cuomo said. ‘Where does it go ultimately? Nowhere.’”



TEAM TRUMP LEANS ON MUELLER MOVES

AP: “The White House is dusting off its playbook from the special counsel’s Russia investigation. Caught off guard by the speed at which a whistleblower’s claims have morphed into an impeachment inquiry, President Donald Trump and his team are scrambling to respond. They’re turning, at least for now, to some of the same strategies they used to counter special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. The basic tactics deployed by the short-staffed White House: Attempt to discredit government officials at the heart of the story. Dispatch Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and other allies to muddy the picture. Lean on Republicans in Congress to provide cover.”



Amy Walter: Impeachment won’t change the game - Cook Political Report: “We are a deeply divided, deeply polarized country. Almost everything we do — from choosing where to eat lunch (Chick-fil-A vs. Whole Foods), to picking where to live (urban/suburban vs. rural/small town) is filtered through the lens of how we identify politically. As such, we shouldn't expect views of impeachment to be any different. Opinions won't swing wildly from day to day or week to week. We also shouldn't expect to see Americans overwhelming support or overwhelmingly oppose impeachment. Like everything in this era, the final verdict on impeachment is likely to be decided on the margins by voters who are holding conflicting views on the president and the process of impeachment. It will be decided by those who may dislike Trump, but are also frustrated by the paralysis in Washington, or those who may like the agenda of the president, but are troubled by his behavior.”



Romney’s narrow road - NYT: “Mr. [Mitt] Romney’s public statements reflect what many in his party believe privately but are almost uniformly unwilling to say: that they are faced with damning revelations about the president that are difficult to explain away, and are unsure of whether there is more damaging material to come. What’s more, they are contending with a leader whose appetite for political payback for real or imagined slights is insatiable, and who is responding to the crisis with angry new threats and accusations that will only increase the pressure on them to choose a side. It amounts to an unenviable dilemma for Republicans at a consequential moment for the party. Any internal fractures over the next year could undermine both Mr. Trump’s re-election and Republican hopes for retaining their Senate majority and retaking the House.”



First GOP governors come out in support of impeachment inquiry - WaPo: “For the first time, two Republican governors have publicly supported the impeachment inquiry of President Trump, a new development in an intensifying political fracas that has so far been largely partisan. Vermont Gov. Phil Scott and Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, both outspoken critics of Trump from the Northeast, said Thursday they favored the investigation, but Scott added that he would wait for more information before calling for further action against the president.”

USA Today: “NASA has given us another historic glimpse into the wonders of space after releasing a video that shows a star-shredding black hole in a galaxy millions of light-years away. The amazing footage of the ‘cataclysmic phenomenon’ was taken by NASA’s planet-hunting Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS. Astronomers think the supermassive black hole weighs around 6 million times the sun’s mass and is located about 375 million light-years away in a galaxy of similar size to the Milky Way, NASA said. The incredible event, called a tidal disruption, is very rare and occurs once every 10,000 to 100,000 years in galaxies like the Milky Way. When a star gets too close, the intense tides of a black hole break apart the star into a stream of gas, according to NASA. As shown in the video, the tail of that stream breaks away from the black hole while other parts of it swing back around and create a halo of debris.”

JOE = JEB? BIDEN BENEFACTORS READY TO MOBILIZE MEGA PAC

NYT: “Allies of Joseph R. Biden Jr., concerned about his slipping poll numbers in the Democratic presidential primary and an onslaught of attacks from President Trump, are weighing whether to mobilize a super PAC supporting Mr. Biden and have held conversations with wealthy donors to gauge their interest in contributing money. Mr. Biden and his campaign aides have said since the start of the race that they would not welcome an outside spending effort on his behalf, and every other major Democratic candidate has sworn off super PACs for the duration of the primary. A spokesman for Mr. Biden on Thursday reiterated that he opposed super PACs and would reject any such group that attempted to support him. Yet several former staffers of Mr. Biden and political donors backing his candidacy have held conversations in recent weeks about moving ahead with a super PAC, and said Mr. Trump’s furious, and often unsubstantiated, allegations about the former vice president had convinced them it was imperative they act.”



Under fire, Biden looks to scamper left - WaPo: “Advisers to presidential candidate Joe Biden are weighing the introduction of a new tax on Wall Street, according to people familiar with the discussions, as the former vice president now stands alone among the Democratic presidential front-runners in not backing a multitrillion-dollar ‘wealth tax’ on the richest Americans. The plan under consideration from Biden’s advisers could tax financial transactions such as the sale of stocks and bonds, one of the people said. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Biden, under pressure throughout the presidential campaign to move left on a range of policy issues, has embraced several ideas to increase taxes on the rich and on corporations but so far has not gone as far as his two main rivals. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have each unveiled their own plans to impose a ‘wealth tax’ on multimillionaires and billionaires, with both also calling for significant new taxes on corporations and wealthy estates. Sanders unveiled his wealth tax earlier this week.”



Wall Street Democratic donors lay down the law on Warren - CNBC: “Democratic donors on Wall Street and in big business are preparing to sit out the presidential campaign fundraising cycle — or even back President Donald Trump — if Sen. Elizabeth Warren wins the party’s nomination. In recent weeks, CNBC spoke to several high-dollar Democratic donors and fundraisers in the business community and found that this opinion was becoming widely shared as Warren, an outspoken critic of big banks and corporations, gains momentum against Joe Biden in the 2020 race. ‘You’re in a box because you’re a Democrat and you’re thinking, ‘I want to help the party, but she’s going to hurt me, so I’m going to help President Trump,’’ said a senior private equity executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity in fear of retribution by party leaders.”



A dozen candidates, one night for next Dem debate - Politico: “The Democratic National Committee intends to hold its fourth presidential primary debate on one night in October, packing the stage with as many as 12 qualified candidates. ‘To address several inquiries we have received we are writing to let you know that, pending a final decision after the certification deadline, it is the intention of the DNC and our media partners to hold the October debate over one night on Tuesday October 15th,’ the DNC wrote in an email to campaigns on Friday.”

A LITTLE ON THE NOSE, DON’T YOU THINK?

WABC: “Officials in New Jersey are looking into multiple complaints of a mystery odor that smells like rotten fish. The Hudson Regional Health Commission said they received two complaints in Jersey City and several complaints in Bayonne on Tuesday night. The HRHC confirmed a presence of an odor, but said the source could not be traced. Inspectors went into Newark - specifically to Raymound Boulevard and Doremus Avenue, because winds were coming from that direction. They were not successful in locating the origin. ‘It's not anything were used to around here. Being a peninsula, we have water on three sides and sometimes at low tide that you can smell the bay. It was really nothing like that. It was a very nasty, almost like a foul meat type of smell,’ OEM Coordinator Edoardo Ferrante said. The New Jersey DEP has been investigating the same odor since the beginning of summer.”

""costs.""",2019-09-27,Breitbart News,Elizabeth Warren Dodges on Raising Taxes for Middle Class: It’s About Overall ‘Costs’,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/09/27/elizabeth-warren-dodges-on-raising-taxes-on-middle-class-its-about-overall-costs/,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Thursday refused to say if Medicare for All will result in higher taxes for middle class families, dodging the question and instead claiming people care more about overall “costs.”

Warren spoke to NBC News’ Ali Vitali, who asked the Massachusetts senator if Medicare for All will result in higher taxes for middle class families– a question Warren has faced several times before on both the debate stage and campaign trail. Once again, Warren did not answer the question, instead claiming that families care more about overall “costs”:

“So one of the things that a few of your opponents were talking about late last week really was this idea of middle class taxes in healthcare. So yes or no– should middle class Americans expect their taxes to go up under a Medicare for All system?” Vitali asked.

“You may remember that I’ve spent a big chunk of my life studying why middle class families go broke, and one of the number one reasons is health care,” Warren said, repeating one of her routine talking points.

“The problem is its total cost for these families, so it’s what you pay in premiums. It’s also what you paying co-pays to see a doctor, or sorry that doctor is out of network so you’ve got to pay for the whole thing,” she explained.

Because of that, Warren suggested that Americans need to change the way they view the system:

People keep reaching into their pockets and reaching into their pockets even when they have health insurance, so how we have to think about this system is yes we should expect that for giant corporations and very wealthy individuals, costs will go up, but for middle class families – for hardworking people – the costs are going to go down.

“But that’s not the same as taxes not going up,” Vitali pointed out.

Warren did not dismiss Vitali’s assertion but argued that families care more about overall “costs,” regardless of increased taxes.

“What matters to families is costs,” Warren said.

Warren faced the same question during the Democrat debate in Houston, Texas, and repeated the same lines about total “cost.”

“What we’re talking about here is what’s going to happen in families’ pockets, what’s going to happen in their budgets, and the answer is, on Medicare for All, costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals and costs are going to go up for giant corporations,” she said.

“But for hardworking families across this country costs are going to go down, and that’s how it should work under Medicare for All,” she added, refusing to ultimately say if middle class taxes would go up, regardless of overall “costs.”

Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) went after Warren for repeatedly refusing to answer the question.

“Senator Warren is known for being straightforward, and was extremely evasive when asked that question, and we’ve seen that repeatedly,” he told CNN’s The Lead last week.

“I think that if you are proud of your plan and it’s the right plan, you should defend it in straightforward terms,” he continued.

“And I think it’s puzzling that when everybody knows the answer to that question, of whether her plan and Senator Sanders’ plan will raise middle-class taxes is yes, why you wouldn’t just say so and then explain why you think that’s the better way forward,” he added."

In an article published this week, Esquire's literary editor, Amy Grace Lloyd, suggested the Trump administration has purged people like the totalitarian regime in ""The Handmaid's Tale.""

""Different. For the moment you and I are not in danger of getting arrested by the NKVD,"" said Atwood, referring to the Soviet police force that carried out mass arrests and executions under dictator Josef Stalin.

""You think Gilead is bad or that the TV series is too violent? Look up the NKVD,"" Atwood added. ""It’s important to have that perspective. People are saying Trump is re-creating Gilead. That’s not true. If it were, we’d not be having this conversation. He’s not even a particularly Gileadean figure, more like a [Babylonian king] Nebuchadnezzar of the right. That guy went mad.""

ELISABETH MOSS SAYS IT'S 'APT' TO COMPARE ANTI-ABORTION LAWS TO 'HANDMAID'S TALE'S' DYSTOPIAN SOCIETY

When Lloyd responded by complaining about ""divisiveness being promoted"" in the U.S., Atwood told her to ""suck it up!""

""Why are you so afraid?"" Atwood asked. ""No one is going to kill you right now. Anybody banging down your door? What you should be doing is figuring out who to vote for in the next election. Which candidate is going to take you the farthest he or she can from Gilead? Panic isn’t helpful.""

Since the Hulu show based on Atwood's novel premiered in April 2017, liberals have repeatedly compared Republicans and their policies to those of the villains in the story. At the 2018 White House Correspondents' Dinner, for example, comedienne Michelle Wolf compared then-White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to Aunt Lydia, the brutal overseer of Gilead's female captives. A CNN documentary similarly drew comparisons to Atwood's story -- as did Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., when she spoke out against Alabama's restrictive abortion law.

Sean Hannity dove deeper into the politics behind the impeachment push, warning of the potential ramifications that a Trump impeachment would have on the country.

(CNN) Democrats might ask themselves why President Donald Trump is so intent on smearing former Vice President Joe Biden with phony scandals. Why isn't he doing the same to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who's been climbing in the polls and has a shot at becoming the Democratic nominee for president?

The clear answer is that Biden, in his own words, could ""beat him like a drum"" -- and while Warren could win against Trump, her victory does not look like a resounding one, according to recent polls . In Trump's view, Biden poses the greatest threat and must be destroyed. And what better way than to wound Biden to the point that Democrats might think he's more trouble than he's worth?

Warren fans will point to national polls showing their candidate defeating Trump in a general election. But it's important to note that Warren has been largely spared from Trump's attacks thus far, and those polls don't take into account the campaign of calumny that would surely follow a Warren nomination. It's Biden that Trump clearly most fears.

It would not surprise me if foreign propagandists decided to take to social media to advance Warren's candidacy and hurt Biden's. This happened in 2016, when Russian trolls tried to turn fans of Bernie Sanders against Hillary Clinton. Many supporters took the bait and either voted for third party candidates or sat out the election.

Though polls suggest that Warren could defeat Trump by a few points, Biden still holds a more comfortable margin over the President. Let's not forget that poll numbers don't necessarily translate to an Electoral College victory. In 2016, Clinton lost the election even though she bested Trump by nearly 2.9 million votes nationally.

Biden is still a stronger bet against Trump in crucial swing states like Wisconsin and Ohio, compared to Warren. The most recent Wisconsin poll pitting Democrats against Trump has Biden winning by 9 points, while Elizabeth Warren is tied with the President. In Ohio, Biden is the only Democrat who can beat Trump. According to the most recent Quinnipiac poll from July, Biden leads Trump by 8 points, while Sanders and Warren both trail the President by 1.

President Trump has claimed Biden called for Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor who was ""investigating his son."" But there is no evidence Hunter Biden was under investigation. The probe was into the business dealings of the owner of a Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden sat on the board of directors.

How should Democrats handle Trump's hatchet job on Biden's integrity? For starters, they should not get sucked into arguments over Biden's guilt or innocence. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden, and Ukraine's current prosecutor general also came out in defense of the two. And making the case that the Trump children are profiting from their proximity to their father establishes a false equivalence that turns a flat-out lie into a ""what about the other side?"" discussion.

Meanwhile, other polls underscore weaknesses in the Warren campaign. For one thing, Warren seems to have a likeability problem, even in politically friendly states. A CNN/UNH Survey Center poll from July asked likely New Hampshire voters which Democrat they found most likeable. Biden and Sanders topped the list at 20% each, while only 4% chose Warren.

Then there are the policies. Warren endorses a Medicare for All health plan that would do away with private coverage, even though a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows only 41% of registered voters supporting a system that eliminates private health coverage.

Biden's support for a government-run option in Obamacare is much closer to the public's preference. The poll found that 67% want an option to buy health coverage through a Medicare program, while keeping the possibility of private insurance.

Warren's call for decriminalizing illegal border crossings is also widely unpopular. She might be able to finesse that position in a general election campaign, but her views on immigration generally have ventured dangerously close to open borders.

Democrats might ultimately choose someone other than Biden as their presidential nominee. But it should be their decision and not a scared response to Trump's manipulation of the truth. There is a good reason he's so intent on crushing Biden."

Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren are knotted up in Nevada, according to new CNN polls conducted by SSRS in the third and fourth states to cast ballots for the 2020 Democratic nomination .

Biden tops Warren by 21 points in South Carolina -- 37% of likely voters back the former vice president, 16% Warren and 11% Sanders. In Nevada, there is no clear leader, with Biden and Sanders tied at 22% of likely caucusgoers with 18% for Warren, all within the poll's margin of sampling error. In neither state does any other candidate reach double-digits.

Biden's strong standing in South Carolina rests on support from black voters. Overall, 45% of black likely primary voters back Biden, more than 30 points ahead of his closest competitor. Among white likely primary voters, however, Biden and Warren are deadlocked: 29% favor Biden, 28% Warren.

Nevada's three-way race rests on the demographic and political divides that are driving the contest nationwide. Liberal likely caucusgoers break heavily for Sanders, while moderate and conservative caucusgoers give Biden a wide edge. Those under age 50 break toward Sanders: 35% for him vs. 13% for Warren and 12% for Biden. Among those over 50, 32% back Biden, 23% Warren and 11% Sanders. Voters with college degrees are more in Warren's corner, while those without degrees split between Sanders and Biden with Warren lagging behind.

There is room in both states for these numbers to move. So far, 44% of likely caucusgoers in Nevada and 45% of likely voters in South Carolina say they've chosen a candidate and made up their mind. Another 38% in each state say they have a preference but could change their mind and 18% in Nevada and 17% in South Carolina don't have a preference yet.

Biden stands alone in South Carolina when likely voters are asked to rate their level of enthusiasm. Nearly half, 48%, would be enthusiastic about a Biden nomination, outpacing Warren's 35%, Sanders' and California Sen. Kamala Harris's 23% and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg's 19%. In Nevada, more than 4 in 10 say they would be enthusiastic about each of the top three -- 47% for Sanders, 44% for Biden and 42% for Warren -- while 22% each would be enthusiastic about a Harris or Buttigieg nomination.

In both states, however, majorities would at least be satisfied with any of these five candidates. The share saying they would be dissatisfied or upset with any of these five peaks at 37% for Buttigieg in South Carolina and 28% for Harris or Buttigieg in Nevada.

On the issues and electability

About six in 10 likely Democratic voters or caucusgoers say it's more important to nominate a candidate with a strong chance of beating President Donald Trump than it is to nominate one who shares their views on the issues. And in both states, the group that is focused on beating Trump is more apt to favor Biden over Sanders. In Nevada, they are also more apt to favor Warren than are those focused on issues, her numbers are about the same across those groups in South Carolina.

Regardless of how they rate the importance of a candidate's positions on the issues, Nevada and South Carolina Democrats seem to differ over who can best handle the top issues facing the field. On health care, South Carolina's likely voters favor Biden -- 34% say he'd do the best job on it vs. 17% for Sanders and 16% for Warren -- while those in Nevada give Sanders an edge -- 32% say the Vermonter would do the best job on health care, 25% Biden, 17% Warren.

In Nevada, there's a massive divide within likely caucusgoers over health care along ideological lines, mirroring the debate the candidates have had publicly over the merits of ""Medicare for All."" Fully 50% of liberal likely caucusgoers say they trust Sanders most on health care with 20% naming Warren and 15% Biden, while Sanders trails Biden by 11 points among moderate and conservative likely caucusgoers (31% Biden, 20% Sanders and 14% Warren). The ideological gap is narrower in South Carolina.

Biden holds a wide edge overall on each of the five issues tested in South Carolina (health care, the climate crisis, gun policy, the economy and immigration. In Nevada, however, things get tighter outside of health care. On no other issue does a single candidate earn the trust of even 25% of likely caucusgoers, with Sanders, Biden and Warren clustered near the top across all five.

Rating Trump

Looking beyond the primaries, the President's approval rating in Nevada -- likely to be a critical battleground state in 2020 -- is underwater, 51% disapprove while 41% approve. That's about the same as it was last October just before Democrats won a Senate seat there, one of two picked up from Republicans in the 2018 midterms. In South Carolina, Trump's ratings outpace his national marks, which currently hover around 40% approval, with 49% approving and 47% disapproving. In both states, there is a 90-point gap between where Republicans and Democrats stand on Trump's approval, with independents tilting negative.

The surveys were conducted from September 22 through 26, during which time House Democrats announced a formal impeachment inquiry into the President . Looking at interviews conducted before and after the announcement of the inquiry, there does not appear to be a shift in Trump's ratings.

The Republican Party in both states has canceled its Republican nominating contest for 2020. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents largely back their party's decision, though. In South Carolina, 62% approve of canceling the primary, while 52% approve of the Nevada GOP's cancellation of its caucus. But even among those Republicans and Republican-leaners who disapprove of the decision to cancel the primary or caucus, the President is still deeply popular (83% approve of his job performance in Nevada, 74% in South Carolina).

The CNN polls in Nevada and South Carolina were conducted by telephone among random samples of adults in each state. In Nevada, results among the 1,203 adults have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points, it is 7.1 points for results among the 324 likely Democratic caucusgoers. In South Carolina, results among 1,200 adults carry an error margin of 3.4 percentage points, while those among the 406 likely Democratic primary voters have an error margin of 5.9 points."

Well, maybe it's not a resounding endorsement, but it's not a diss either!

Rudolph parodied the Democratic presidential candidate on ""SNL's"" 45th season premiere, and naturally, Harris' now-famous ""that girl was me"" line got ample airtime.

In a skit set at a fictional CNN impeachment town hall, Rudolph's Harris considers herself as ""America's fun aunt,"" or ""funt,"" whose no-nonsense prosecutor past may not win her the presidency, but it does make her the ideal protagonist of a network legal drama.

Cory Booker on Sunday announced he has reached the required donor threshold to qualify for the fifth Democratic presidential debate despite his campaign running behind on a self-imposed donation fundraising goal of $1.7 million.

The New Jersey senator's announcement comes after the Democratic National Committee announced last week that candidates must meet higher donor thresholds in order to qualify for the November debates. Candidates must raise money from 165,000 separate donors -- including a minimum of 600 donors each in at least 20 states or territories, up from the current minimum of 130,000 donors.

""We have nearly 35,000 donors who have been helping us make this goal. We've raised $1.5 million plus,"" Booker told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" Sunday. ""We've actually already crossed the threshold to make the November debates of 165,000 unique donors. The surge and the momentum is great, but yeah, I still need help.""

Booker has already qualified for the October Democratic presidential debate , which will be moderated by CNN and The New York Times, but he has not yet met the polling threshold to qualify for the November stage. The DNC has not yet announced the date for that debate.

At a CNN town hall in March in Jackson, Mississippi, she talked boldly about the enduring stain of chattel slavery and her plans to address lingering racial inequality.

A month later, she got a standing ovation at the ""She The People"" conference where she set the pace on black maternal health care policy. Jesse Jackson lavished her with praise, seeming to single her out after her speech at the Rainbow Push conference in June.

And at Congressional Black Caucus event in Washington, DC, in early September, she drew the largest applause of all the candidates, two of whom were CBC members. She has also grabbed endorsements from prominent black women, such as Roxane Gay.

Yet, Warren, whose campaign feels most like a movement, has struggled to translate that appeal to black voters on the ground. On the campus of a small historically black college here this weekend that was very much evident -- she only drew a handful of black voters in a crowd of about 1,000 people. Event attendance, particularly on a Saturday afternoon in 90 degree weather, is a very rough metric -- Biden's crowd at the same venue was mostly white as well. But it's clear that Warren, like Bernie Sanders before her, is struggling with black voters. She is all the rage on black twitter, not so much elsewhere. A new CNN poll has her lagging Biden in this state among black voters by 41 points -- she notches 4% among black voters. (Sanders gets 13%).

Asked Saturday about closing this gap and why she thinks it persists, she answered:

""The way I see this is that African American women have really been the backbone of the Democratic Party for generations now. They get out there and they fight for you. What I'm doing is showing up and trying to talk to people about why I'm in this fight. About what's broken and how to fix it and how we're building a grassroots movement to get it done. And it's not just one policy, it's everywhere. Education it is. It's about our historically black colleges and universities. It's about closing the black white wealth gap by canceling a lot of the student loan debt that's out there. It's there in health care to deal with the maternal health mortality rates that hit black women so much harder than any other group. It's about housing and attacking redlining straight on. I've got a lot of plans and what I want to do talk to people about all of them. Because ultimately we have a country that keeps working better and better for those at the top and isn't working for much of anyone else and I think we got a chance to change that.""

Her very specific plans are certainly breaking through with some voters. Casey McClure, who came with her mother and father to Warren's event here with very specific reasons why she backs the Massachusetts senator.

""I'm voting for Warren because I can't afford college anymore. I also like her plan for black women so we won't die so much in labor,"" McClure, 26, said. ""And she reminds me of Obama because she gives us hope.""

McClure said she is trying to convince her dad, Willie McClure, 65, to back Warren. He seems to lean-Biden because of the Obama connection, but is still making up his mind.

""I like Warren because of the fire she brings. What she's bringing to the table is the main issues and that's what we need,"" McClure said. ""And I like Biden ... he's got this calm attitude about himself. If one of them is not elected, I'd like to see them each at least serve in administration.""

Deitra Pichey, 32, came with her brother Marcus Bigger, 34, to hear Warren. While she backs Andrew Yang, she thinks Warren has a shot with black voters.

""I think her policies definitely align with the African American community, it's just that we need to hear her more,"" Pichey said. ""She needs to go to more HBCUs to speak to our community because there's a lot of issues that affect us as a whole that people running for the Democratic nomination need to hear about.""

Bigger has settled on Warren because of her plan to forgive student loan debt.

""I think she is hitting on the right points,"" he said. ""I don't know if a lot of black voters have tuned in to hear her message.""

After her event at Clinton College, Warren went to nearby soul food restaurant where she posed for pictures and signed the wall. She will return in the coming weeks for an event with Rep. Jim Clyburn, the venerable South Carolina congressman who the Democratic candidates are all courting for an endorsement.

As in 2016, there is likely to be a generational divide among black voters, with younger voters opting for the not-Biden candidates.

Sanders got 52% of black voters under 30 in 2016, yet those voters were only about 3% of voters in a CNN analysis of 27 states with exit or entrance polls. Among black voters over age 30, it was 82% Hillary Clinton to 17% Sanders. That block of older black voters were about one-fifth of Democratic voters, giving Clinton a big base of support in 2016 that has now largely shifted to Biden.

While Biden has drawn criticism for his praise of his work with segregationist senators and his rambling answer (record players?) to a question about slavery in the last debate, there remains a reservoir of good will toward him, particularly among older black voters.

Biden's retort when people question him on issues, particularly on race, is to say that people know him. And in this state, and all across the South among black voters that carries a lot weight. Southerners figure out who you are by figuring out who your people are. And Biden still has the clearest answer.

""When people see Biden, they see Obama's VP and they feel like he can relate,"" said Tracey Easter, 44. ""He is human. We saw him lose his son. He is a good and decent man."""

Nevada is right next door to California, her home state. South Carolina has a large black population.

Instead, she’s at 5% in Nevada and 3% in South Carolina.

When you dig a little deeper, there doesn’t seem to be any untapped well of support. Just 22% of likely caucus-goers in Nevada and 23% of likely primary voters in South Carolina say they would be enthusiastic about her winning the nomination. That’s more than 20 points behind the leader in each contest.

Harris tied with Pete Buttigieg in Nevada and only statistically insignificantly ahead of him in South Carolina when it comes to enthusiasm. Both states have been among the South Bend, Indiana, mayor’s weakest.

These numbers suggest that Harris is making the right call by planting herself in Iowa. Even if these states should be stronger for her in theory, she polls about as well in Iowa. These states are not anywhere close to a backstop for Harris. What she needs is to somehow use Iowa as a catapult to improve her standing in these later contests.

Perhaps the only encouraging sign for Harris is she’s at 6% among black voters in South Carolina compared to Elizabeth Warren’s 4%. That is, she is in no worse position than Warren among a pivotal bloc of voters, even as she struggles overall. It suggests Harris has more room to grow with black voters -- if her campaign can ever get going."

(CNN) If you want to see how dramatically President Donald Trump's fortunes have turned in just four months, simply compare ""Saturday Night Live"" opening sketches from the season finale in May to the one this weekend, which kicked off the new season.

Dean Obeidallah

The May 18 season finale depicted Trump , as played by Alec Baldwin, sitting behind his desk in the Oval Office, boasting, ""I'm on cruise control for a second term, and there's nothing the Democrats in Congress can do about it."" Trump was so gleeful, he literally broke into song, singing a parody of Queen's song, "" Don't Stop Me Now .""

Soon, other Trump allies, such as ""Vice President Mike Pence"" and ""Sarah Sanders,"" who at the time was still Trump's press secretary, joined in the sketch singing Trump's praises. There was even an appearance by ""Kanye West"" cheering Trump, and ""Rudy Giuliani"" joined the fun by playing a celebratory guitar solo. And, in a line that now seems foreboding, Sanders sang, ""Just try and impeach.""

Flash forward to Saturday night, in which Trump's reversal of fortunes is captured perfectly by the cold open . Sitting behind the same desk in the Oval Office, Trump isn't celebrating -- he's freaking out. Trump calls ""Giuliani"" complaining, ""It's the greatest presidential harassment of all time."" He then adds, ""And I should know! I'm like the president of harassment.""

""Giuliani"" tries to console Trump by stating, ""Nobody's gonna find out about our illegal side dealings with the Ukraine. Or how we tried to cover up those side dealings. Or how we planned to cover up the cover up."" To which Trump asks, ""Where are you right now?"" and Giuliani responds, ""I'm on CNN right now,"" as the camera widens out to reveal he's on Chris Cuomo's set."

""I actually overheard someone saying -- that I thought was an interesting point -- that basically at this point if you are still supporting Sanders as opposed to Warren, it's kind of showing your sexism because she has more detailed plans and her plans have evolved,"" strategist Emily Tisch Sussman said on Monday.

""I thought it was an interesting point and I think there might be something to it,"" she added while speaking on ""MSNBC Live.""

Her comments came as new polls showed Warren beating both Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states in the Democratic primary calendar. Sanders and Warren have been portrayed as the standard-bearers for the Democrats' far-left wing.

Sussman indicated that Sanders' candidacy was a lost cause, telling MSNBC host Craig Melvin that Warren was taking voters from Sanders and that the Vermont senator had ""peaked"" in the race.

""What we're seeing of his supporters -- there's a ceiling. There is nowhere to go -- there is no up to go,"" she added.

Nina Turner, who co-chairs Sanders' campaign, called Sussman's comments ""foolishness."" ""I’m truly trying to wrap my mind around this foolishness,"" she tweeted early Saturday, alongside an annoyed emoji.

Other women responded on Twitter Saturday, citing Sanders' support for various economic policies -- many of which Warren herself has backed.

Guaranteed housing. Add that to the list of socialist agenda items that sound good to some, but in reality, are just big government solutions that move our nation away from freedom and closer to socialism.

His plan includes building millions of homes, social housing, community land trusts and other housing assistance programs.

SANDERS UNVEILS $2.5T 'HOUSING FOR ALL' PLAN IN LATEST PROGRAM FUNDED BY WEALTH TAXES

Sanders will also fully subsidize the Section 8 rental assistance program. Add that to an annual rent cap and what do you have? Another giant, expensive federal program.

How does he plan to pay for it? The way all these Democrats plan to pay for their radical proposals: taxation.

Sanders claims a wealth tax on the top one-tenth of 1 percent of Americans will fund his initiative.

Well folks, he and others in his party already plan to dump the burden of ""Medicare-for-all,"" free college, medical debt cancellation, and the Green New Deal on the backs of the wealthy. Do they really think the top 1 percent can afford to fund the entire nation? Total income confiscation wouldn’t pay for all those programs!

The wealthy ALREADY pay the majority of the income taxes. In fact, in 2018, the wealthiest 1,409 taxpayers paid more income tax than bottom 70 million!

Here’s the thing about wealth, Bernie. It’s MOBILE. The wealthiest Americans are not going to sit idly by as their incomes are confiscated to fund your big government pie-in-the-sky plans.

Then what? What happens when the richest Americans take their money elsewhere? Who pays for these quasi-socialist plans? Answer: We do. The middle class, the average American.

We always take the brunt of the pain because we are essentially forced to. That’s why the middle class has been driven out of places like California, for cryin' out loud.

It’s only affordable for the exorbitantly wealthy and the homeless.

In his speech outlining his new proposal, Sanders correctly noted we have an affordable housing issue in the United States. He stated that 18 million families are paying more than half their incomes on housing and utilities. He’s not wrong.

I live in California, a state that hosts 47 percent of all unsheltered people in the nation.

Yet, what do we do here in California? We add more taxes, more regulations, more control on top of already cash-strapped residents and families.

Here's another thing I know. Throwing more government and more tax dollars at a problem will not solve it. If it did, we wouldn’t be in this predicament.

Last year, Los Angeles alone spent $619 million on the homeless crisis and we have little to nothing to show for those millions.

The city's shelter-expansion project yielded just two facilities, to house 147 people, at a cost of $77 million.

Clearly, liberals don’t know how to manage money. So why should we give them more of it?

When will these socialist wannabes figure it out? Throwing tax dollars, big government, and entitlement at something does not solve the problem.

During an appearance on Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN during an appearance in Washington, D.C. at the Federation for American Immigration Reform’s (FAIR) Hold Their Feet to the Fire annual radio event, Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-AL) discussed the possible motivations of the renewed push against Trump as it pertained to Ukraine.

“I think they’re trying to make the president look bad,” Aderholt said. “That’s one aspect of it – but also trying to appease their Democrat base on the other side. Now what is going to be interesting, I think, is see what in the next few days and next couple of weeks what we see this does to Biden because Biden is all wrapped up in this whole thing and his son Hunter. So, I don’t know how that’s going to have an impact.”

The Alabama Republican lawmaker said given the Biden son’s involvement in the saga, Biden could be eliminated from contention for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

“I think quite honestly Biden is out of the picture,” he continued. “I’ve said for quite some time now that I don’t think he will be the nominee. And I think with this recent thing he has implicated with his son that I think this assures he will not be the nominee.”

Aderholt went on to add that among his House colleagues, there is a consensus Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) will be the nominee.

“Certainly, those on the left side of the party – they don’t like Trump obviously,” he added. “But they don’t really like Biden either. So, I think Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren – that’s who they would gravitate toward. I talk to a lot of my colleagues. I casually just ask the question about how they see this playing out. It seems like the consensus is that Elizabeth Warren is going to be the nominee.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday announced a new income-inequality plan that would tax companies that pay CEOs more than 50 times the pay of the median worker.

Sanders' campaign said the plan would raise $150 billion in a decade, which would be used to pay for his plan to eliminate existing medical debt.

Companies like McDonald's, JPMorgan, and Walmart would have paid hundreds of millions more in taxes if the plan had been in effect last year, the Sanders campaign said.

Read more on Business Insider's homepage.

On Monday, the Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders announced a new tax plan aimed at bridging the pay gap between the highest-paid top executives and their employees.

Sanders' Income Inequality Tax Plan would tax ""companies with exorbitant pay gaps between their executives and typical workers.""

""The American people are sick and tired of corporate CEOs who now make 300 times more than their average employees, while they give themselves huge bonuses and cut back on the healthcare and pension benefits of their employees,"" Sanders said in a statement. ""They want corporations to invest in their workers, not just dividends, stock buybacks and outrageous compensation packages to their executives.""

The plan comes on the heels of Sanders' separate wealth-tax plan to tax the nation's ultrarich.

CEO pay has become a hot topic, especially as it has been increasingly called out by economists, politicians, and even activists such as Abigail Disney, who described the former Disney CEO Bob Iger's pay as a ""moral issue"" when she testified before the House Financial Services Committee earlier this year.

Sanders' campaign said the inequality tax would raise an estimated $150 billion over the next decade. The revenue generated from the tax would be used to pay for Sanders' plan to eliminate existing medical debt.

The inequality-tax plan would increase the tax rate of companies where the CEO makes at least 50 times what the median worker does. If the CEO is not the highest-paid executive at the firm, the 50-1 ratio will be calculated using the highest-paid employee.

The plan would increase the tax rate by 0.5 percentage points for companies whose ratio falls between 50-to-1 and 100-to-1, up to a 5-point increase for companies whose pay ratio is more than 500-to-1. The tax would apply to all private and publicly held corporations with annual revenue of more than $100 million, the campaign said.

Here's how much more companies would have paid in taxes if the tax plan had been in effect last year, according to the Sanders campaign:

McDonald's would have paid up to $110.9 million more.

Walmart would have paid up to $793.8 million more.

JPMorgan Chase would have paid up to $991.6 million more.

Home Depot would have paid up to $538.2 million more.

American Airlines would have paid up to $18.8 million more.

""At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, the American people are demanding that large, profitable corporations pay their fair share of taxes,"" Sanders said. ""It is time to send a message to corporate America: If you do not end your greed and corruption, we will end it for you.""

Companies would not owe any additional taxes under the plan if they increased annual median worker pay to $60,000 and curbed CEO compensation to $3 million, the Sanders campaign said."

""It is time to send a message to corporate America: If you do not end your greed and corruption, we will end it for you.""

Corporate pay disparities have come under increasing scrutiny as politicians and individual activists — including, most notably, the heiress Abigail Disney — have called out CEO pay packages at companies that rely on low-wage workers.

The income inequality tax, which comes less than a week after Sanders released a separate wealth tax plan, would penalize companies who have large disparities in compensation between their highest paid officials and median workers. The plan would raise an estimated $150 billion over the next decade, according to a Sanders campaign statement.

The tax kicks in at half a percentage point for companies who pay their chief executive -- or their highest paid employee, if it's not the CEO -- more than fifty times their median worker and caps off at 5 percentage points for companies who pay their top executive as much as five hundred times more than the median employee. This tax applies to all private and publicly held corporations with annual revenue of more than $100 million. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires companies to disclose its CEO to median work pay ratio.

Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren are knotted up in Nevada, according to new CNN polls conducted by SSRS in the third and fourth states to cast ballots for the 2020 Democratic nomination .

Biden tops Warren by 21 points in South Carolina -- 37% of likely voters back the former vice president, 16% Warren and 11% Sanders. In Nevada, there is no clear leader, with Biden and Sanders tied at 22% of likely caucusgoers with 18% for Warren, all within the poll's margin of sampling error. In neither state does any other candidate reach double-digits.

Biden's strong standing in South Carolina rests on support from black voters. Overall, 45% of black likely primary voters back Biden, more than 30 points ahead of his closest competitor. Among white likely primary voters, however, Biden and Warren are deadlocked: 29% favor Biden, 28% Warren.

Nevada's three-way race rests on the demographic and political divides that are driving the contest nationwide. Liberal likely caucusgoers break heavily for Sanders, while moderate and conservative caucusgoers give Biden a wide edge. Those under age 50 break toward Sanders: 35% for him vs. 13% for Warren and 12% for Biden. Among those over 50, 32% back Biden, 23% Warren and 11% Sanders. Voters with college degrees are more in Warren's corner, while those without degrees split between Sanders and Biden with Warren lagging behind.

There is room in both states for these numbers to move. So far, 44% of likely caucusgoers in Nevada and 45% of likely voters in South Carolina say they've chosen a candidate and made up their mind. Another 38% in each state say they have a preference but could change their mind and 18% in Nevada and 17% in South Carolina don't have a preference yet.

Biden stands alone in South Carolina when likely voters are asked to rate their level of enthusiasm. Nearly half, 48%, would be enthusiastic about a Biden nomination, outpacing Warren's 35%, Sanders' and California Sen. Kamala Harris's 23% and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg's 19%. In Nevada, more than 4 in 10 say they would be enthusiastic about each of the top three -- 47% for Sanders, 44% for Biden and 42% for Warren -- while 22% each would be enthusiastic about a Harris or Buttigieg nomination.

In both states, however, majorities would at least be satisfied with any of these five candidates. The share saying they would be dissatisfied or upset with any of these five peaks at 37% for Buttigieg in South Carolina and 28% for Harris or Buttigieg in Nevada.

On the issues and electability

About six in 10 likely Democratic voters or caucusgoers say it's more important to nominate a candidate with a strong chance of beating President Donald Trump than it is to nominate one who shares their views on the issues. And in both states, the group that is focused on beating Trump is more apt to favor Biden over Sanders. In Nevada, they are also more apt to favor Warren than are those focused on issues, her numbers are about the same across those groups in South Carolina.

Regardless of how they rate the importance of a candidate's positions on the issues, Nevada and South Carolina Democrats seem to differ over who can best handle the top issues facing the field. On health care, South Carolina's likely voters favor Biden -- 34% say he'd do the best job on it vs. 17% for Sanders and 16% for Warren -- while those in Nevada give Sanders an edge -- 32% say the Vermonter would do the best job on health care, 25% Biden, 17% Warren.

In Nevada, there's a massive divide within likely caucusgoers over health care along ideological lines, mirroring the debate the candidates have had publicly over the merits of ""Medicare for All."" Fully 50% of liberal likely caucusgoers say they trust Sanders most on health care with 20% naming Warren and 15% Biden, while Sanders trails Biden by 11 points among moderate and conservative likely caucusgoers (31% Biden, 20% Sanders and 14% Warren). The ideological gap is narrower in South Carolina.

Biden holds a wide edge overall on each of the five issues tested in South Carolina (health care, the climate crisis, gun policy, the economy and immigration. In Nevada, however, things get tighter outside of health care. On no other issue does a single candidate earn the trust of even 25% of likely caucusgoers, with Sanders, Biden and Warren clustered near the top across all five.

Rating Trump

Looking beyond the primaries, the President's approval rating in Nevada -- likely to be a critical battleground state in 2020 -- is underwater, 51% disapprove while 41% approve. That's about the same as it was last October just before Democrats won a Senate seat there, one of two picked up from Republicans in the 2018 midterms. In South Carolina, Trump's ratings outpace his national marks, which currently hover around 40% approval, with 49% approving and 47% disapproving. In both states, there is a 90-point gap between where Republicans and Democrats stand on Trump's approval, with independents tilting negative.

The surveys were conducted from September 22 through 26, during which time House Democrats announced a formal impeachment inquiry into the President . Looking at interviews conducted before and after the announcement of the inquiry, there does not appear to be a shift in Trump's ratings.

The Republican Party in both states has canceled its Republican nominating contest for 2020. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents largely back their party's decision, though. In South Carolina, 62% approve of canceling the primary, while 52% approve of the Nevada GOP's cancellation of its caucus. But even among those Republicans and Republican-leaners who disapprove of the decision to cancel the primary or caucus, the President is still deeply popular (83% approve of his job performance in Nevada, 74% in South Carolina).

The CNN polls in Nevada and South Carolina were conducted by telephone among random samples of adults in each state. In Nevada, results among the 1,203 adults have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points, it is 7.1 points for results among the 324 likely Democratic caucusgoers. In South Carolina, results among 1,200 adults carry an error margin of 3.4 percentage points, while those among the 406 likely Democratic primary voters have an error margin of 5.9 points."

Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday announced a new income-inequality plan that would tax companies that pay CEOs more than 50 times the pay of the median worker.

Sanders' campaign said the plan would raise $150 billion in a decade, which would be used to pay for his plan to eliminate existing medical debt.

Companies like McDonald's, JPMorgan, and Walmart would have paid hundreds of millions more in taxes if the plan had been in effect last year, the Sanders campaign said.

Read more on Business Insider's homepage.

On Monday, the Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders announced a new tax plan aimed at bridging the pay gap between the highest-paid top executives and their employees.

Sanders' Income Inequality Tax Plan would tax ""companies with exorbitant pay gaps between their executives and typical workers.""

""The American people are sick and tired of corporate CEOs who now make 300 times more than their average employees, while they give themselves huge bonuses and cut back on the healthcare and pension benefits of their employees,"" Sanders said in a statement. ""They want corporations to invest in their workers, not just dividends, stock buybacks and outrageous compensation packages to their executives.""

The plan comes on the heels of Sanders' separate wealth-tax plan to tax the nation's ultrarich.

CEO pay has become a hot topic, especially as it has been increasingly called out by economists, politicians, and even activists such as Abigail Disney, who described the former Disney CEO Bob Iger's pay as a ""moral issue"" when she testified before the House Financial Services Committee earlier this year.

Sanders' campaign said the inequality tax would raise an estimated $150 billion over the next decade. The revenue generated from the tax would be used to pay for Sanders' plan to eliminate existing medical debt.

The inequality-tax plan would increase the tax rate of companies where the CEO makes at least 50 times what the median worker does. If the CEO is not the highest-paid executive at the firm, the 50-1 ratio will be calculated using the highest-paid employee.

The plan would increase the tax rate by 0.5 percentage points for companies whose ratio falls between 50-to-1 and 100-to-1, up to a 5-point increase for companies whose pay ratio is more than 500-to-1. The tax would apply to all private and publicly held corporations with annual revenue of more than $100 million, the campaign said.

Here's how much more companies would have paid in taxes if the tax plan had been in effect last year, according to the Sanders campaign:

McDonald's would have paid up to $110.9 million more.

Walmart would have paid up to $793.8 million more.

JPMorgan Chase would have paid up to $991.6 million more.

Home Depot would have paid up to $538.2 million more.

American Airlines would have paid up to $18.8 million more.

""At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, the American people are demanding that large, profitable corporations pay their fair share of taxes,"" Sanders said. ""It is time to send a message to corporate America: If you do not end your greed and corruption, we will end it for you.""

Companies would not owe any additional taxes under the plan if they increased annual median worker pay to $60,000 and curbed CEO compensation to $3 million, the Sanders campaign said."

At a CNN town hall in March in Jackson, Mississippi, she talked boldly about the enduring stain of chattel slavery and her plans to address lingering racial inequality.

A month later, she got a standing ovation at the ""She The People"" conference where she set the pace on black maternal health care policy. Jesse Jackson lavished her with praise, seeming to single her out after her speech at the Rainbow Push conference in June.

And at Congressional Black Caucus event in Washington, DC, in early September, she drew the largest applause of all the candidates, two of whom were CBC members. She has also grabbed endorsements from prominent black women, such as Roxane Gay.

Yet, Warren, whose campaign feels most like a movement, has struggled to translate that appeal to black voters on the ground. On the campus of a small historically black college here this weekend that was very much evident -- she only drew a handful of black voters in a crowd of about 1,000 people. Event attendance, particularly on a Saturday afternoon in 90 degree weather, is a very rough metric -- Biden's crowd at the same venue was mostly white as well. But it's clear that Warren, like Bernie Sanders before her, is struggling with black voters. She is all the rage on black twitter, not so much elsewhere. A new CNN poll has her lagging Biden in this state among black voters by 41 points -- she notches 4% among black voters. (Sanders gets 13%).

Asked Saturday about closing this gap and why she thinks it persists, she answered:

""The way I see this is that African American women have really been the backbone of the Democratic Party for generations now. They get out there and they fight for you. What I'm doing is showing up and trying to talk to people about why I'm in this fight. About what's broken and how to fix it and how we're building a grassroots movement to get it done. And it's not just one policy, it's everywhere. Education it is. It's about our historically black colleges and universities. It's about closing the black white wealth gap by canceling a lot of the student loan debt that's out there. It's there in health care to deal with the maternal health mortality rates that hit black women so much harder than any other group. It's about housing and attacking redlining straight on. I've got a lot of plans and what I want to do talk to people about all of them. Because ultimately we have a country that keeps working better and better for those at the top and isn't working for much of anyone else and I think we got a chance to change that.""

Her very specific plans are certainly breaking through with some voters. Casey McClure, who came with her mother and father to Warren's event here with very specific reasons why she backs the Massachusetts senator.

""I'm voting for Warren because I can't afford college anymore. I also like her plan for black women so we won't die so much in labor,"" McClure, 26, said. ""And she reminds me of Obama because she gives us hope.""

McClure said she is trying to convince her dad, Willie McClure, 65, to back Warren. He seems to lean-Biden because of the Obama connection, but is still making up his mind.

""I like Warren because of the fire she brings. What she's bringing to the table is the main issues and that's what we need,"" McClure said. ""And I like Biden ... he's got this calm attitude about himself. If one of them is not elected, I'd like to see them each at least serve in administration.""

Deitra Pichey, 32, came with her brother Marcus Bigger, 34, to hear Warren. While she backs Andrew Yang, she thinks Warren has a shot with black voters.

""I think her policies definitely align with the African American community, it's just that we need to hear her more,"" Pichey said. ""She needs to go to more HBCUs to speak to our community because there's a lot of issues that affect us as a whole that people running for the Democratic nomination need to hear about.""

Bigger has settled on Warren because of her plan to forgive student loan debt.

""I think she is hitting on the right points,"" he said. ""I don't know if a lot of black voters have tuned in to hear her message.""

After her event at Clinton College, Warren went to nearby soul food restaurant where she posed for pictures and signed the wall. She will return in the coming weeks for an event with Rep. Jim Clyburn, the venerable South Carolina congressman who the Democratic candidates are all courting for an endorsement.

As in 2016, there is likely to be a generational divide among black voters, with younger voters opting for the not-Biden candidates.

Sanders got 52% of black voters under 30 in 2016, yet those voters were only about 3% of voters in a CNN analysis of 27 states with exit or entrance polls. Among black voters over age 30, it was 82% Hillary Clinton to 17% Sanders. That block of older black voters were about one-fifth of Democratic voters, giving Clinton a big base of support in 2016 that has now largely shifted to Biden.

While Biden has drawn criticism for his praise of his work with segregationist senators and his rambling answer (record players?) to a question about slavery in the last debate, there remains a reservoir of good will toward him, particularly among older black voters.

Biden's retort when people question him on issues, particularly on race, is to say that people know him. And in this state, and all across the South among black voters that carries a lot weight. Southerners figure out who you are by figuring out who your people are. And Biden still has the clearest answer.

""When people see Biden, they see Obama's VP and they feel like he can relate,"" said Tracey Easter, 44. ""He is human. We saw him lose his son. He is a good and decent man."""

When you dig a little deeper, there doesn’t seem to be any untapped well of support. Just 22% of likely caucus-goers in Nevada and 23% of likely primary voters in South Carolina say they would be enthusiastic about her winning the nomination. That’s more than 20 points behind the leader in each contest.

Harris tied with Pete Buttigieg in Nevada and only statistically insignificantly ahead of him in South Carolina when it comes to enthusiasm. Both states have been among the South Bend, Indiana, mayor’s weakest.

These numbers suggest that Harris is making the right call by planting herself in Iowa. Even if these states should be stronger for her in theory, she polls about as well in Iowa. These states are not anywhere close to a backstop for Harris. What she needs is to somehow use Iowa as a catapult to improve her standing in these later contests.

Perhaps the only encouraging sign for Harris is she’s at 6% among black voters in South Carolina compared to Elizabeth Warren’s 4%. That is, she is in no worse position than Warren among a pivotal bloc of voters, even as she struggles overall. It suggests Harris has more room to grow with black voters -- if her campaign can ever get going."

(CNN) If you want to see how dramatically President Donald Trump's fortunes have turned in just four months, simply compare ""Saturday Night Live"" opening sketches from the season finale in May to the one this weekend, which kicked off the new season.

Dean Obeidallah

The May 18 season finale depicted Trump , as played by Alec Baldwin, sitting behind his desk in the Oval Office, boasting, ""I'm on cruise control for a second term, and there's nothing the Democrats in Congress can do about it."" Trump was so gleeful, he literally broke into song, singing a parody of Queen's song, "" Don't Stop Me Now .""

Soon, other Trump allies, such as ""Vice President Mike Pence"" and ""Sarah Sanders,"" who at the time was still Trump's press secretary, joined in the sketch singing Trump's praises. There was even an appearance by ""Kanye West"" cheering Trump, and ""Rudy Giuliani"" joined the fun by playing a celebratory guitar solo. And, in a line that now seems foreboding, Sanders sang, ""Just try and impeach.""

Flash forward to Saturday night, in which Trump's reversal of fortunes is captured perfectly by the cold open . Sitting behind the same desk in the Oval Office, Trump isn't celebrating -- he's freaking out. Trump calls ""Giuliani"" complaining, ""It's the greatest presidential harassment of all time."" He then adds, ""And I should know! I'm like the president of harassment.""

""Giuliani"" tries to console Trump by stating, ""Nobody's gonna find out about our illegal side dealings with the Ukraine. Or how we tried to cover up those side dealings. Or how we planned to cover up the cover up."" To which Trump asks, ""Where are you right now?"" and Giuliani responds, ""I'm on CNN right now,"" as the camera widens out to reveal he's on Chris Cuomo's set."

Biden appears to be losing footing in Nevada, a CNN poll found.

SSRS conducted the poll, surveying 324 likely Democrat caucus-goers September 22-26, 2019. The poll shows Sanders and Biden tied for first place with 22 percent support each. Warren fell just four points behind with 18 percent support. With a margin of error of +/- 7.1 percent, the race is locked in a dead heat.

The remaining candidates fell well outside the margin of error. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who came in fourth place, only saw five percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) and Tom Steyer (D) with four percent support each. Andrew Yang garnered three percent support, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) saw two percent support, and the remaining candidates garnered one percent support or less:

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) rolled out another aggressive tax proposal on Monday as he aims to address “income inequality” by taxing companies that demonstrate “large gaps between their CEO and median worker pay.”

Sanders is proposing to close the “income inequality” gap by punishing companies that have CEOs making 50 times more than the average employee via additional progressive corporate taxes.

“Americans are sick and tired of corporate CEOs making hundreds of times what their workers make,” Sanders tweeted.

“We say to corporate America: If you don’t end your greed and corruption, we will end it for you,” he added:

“Under the new Sanders plan, companies with large gaps between their CEO and median worker pay would see progressively higher corporate tax rates with the most unequal companies paying five percentage points more in corporate taxes,” Sanders’ plan states.

The plan does not just apply to CEOs. Rather, the ratio is based on whoever is the highest-paid employee at the company, and it penalizes them accordingly.

“You have CEOs making 500 or 1,000 times more than the median income worker — that’s a signal of a lot of what is wrong in this country,” Sanders told the Washington Post.

“We want to make clear that’s bad policy, and we will impose taxes on the most egregious examples,” he added.

The plan states:

The tax penalties would begin at 0.5 percentage points for companies that pay their top executives between 50 and 100 times more than their typical workers. The highest penalty would kick in for companies that pay top executives over 500 times worker pay. These rates, if current corporate pay patterns continue, would raise around $150 billion over 10 years.

“This plan would apply to all private and publicly held corporations with annual revenue of more than $100 million,” his plan notes.

The Sanders campaign boasts of the additional revenue the government would have generated if his progressive penalization were in effect.

McDonald’s would have paid up to $110.9 million more in taxes.

Walmart would have paid up to $793.8 million more in taxes.

JPMorganChase would have paid up to $991.6 million more in taxes.

The Home Depot would have paid up to $538.2 million more in taxes.

American Airlines would have paid up to $18.8 million more in taxes.

However, critics say Sanders’ proposal would hurt companies overall by “forcing them to hire less talented CEOs, reducing the overall competitiveness of U.S. firms,” the Washington Post reported:

Brian Riedl, a budget expert at the conservative think tank the Manhattan Institute, said such a tax could dramatically affect industries like fast food or retail that naturally pay lower wages, while leaving others — such as Silicon Valley — relatively unscathed. “I trust the market to set salaries more than I trust Bernie Sanders,” Riedl said. Kyle E. Pomerleau, chief economist at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, also questioned whether the plan would simply force large companies to reclassify employees as independent contractors as a means of avoiding the tax.

Sanders claims the revenue generated from the plan would fund his proposal to eliminate $81 billion in medical debt.

The latest progressive tax proposal comes on the heels of an “extreme wealth tax,” which Sanders rolled out last week after declaring that “billionaires should not exist”:"

The poll shows both Biden and Warren tied for first place, earning 25 percent support each among Democrat primary voters. Sanders – who has been struggling to overtake his ideological ally, Warren, came in third place with 16 percent support. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) came in fourth with seven percent, and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) dropped to fifth place with six percent support. Ten percent of respondents said they are “not sure,” and the remaining candidates garnered two percent support or less.

The margin of error is +/- 2.8 percent when adjusted for weighting and +/- 2.9 percent for registered voters.

The September 2019 Emerson poll – taken September 21-23 – told a similar story, with Biden, Warren, and Sanders dominating the top tier with a three-point spread.

The poll shows Biden with 25 percent support and Warren and Sanders closely behind with 23 percent and 22 percent support, respectively. While Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) have dominated the top of the second tier, Andrew Yang came in fourth place, earning eight percent support, followed by Buttigieg with six percent and Harris with four percent. The remaining candidates did not crack two percent support. The margin of error is +/- 4.6 percent, indicating a dead heat for first place among Biden, Warren, and Sanders.

The Economist/YouGov poll shows Sanders continuing to hold the edge with voters under 50 and Biden continuing to appeal to older voters:

Sanders continues to hold an advantage with voters under 50, with 28% support from that group of voters. Conversely, Biden continues to dominate the older vote with 42% support from those aged 50 or over. Warren competes with her rivals with both age groups, as she receives 23% support from those under 50 and 23% support among those 50 and over. Among voters who supported Sanders in 2016, 37% still support him, 23% now support Warren, 10% now support Biden and 9% now support Yang. In contrast, among those who supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, 41% now support Biden, 22% support Warren, 14% support Sanders, and 6% support Harris.

Emerson Polling also showed the top three Democrat candidates in tight head-to-head general election matchups. It showed Warren performing the best, beating President Trump 51 percent to 49 percent. Biden beat Trump 50 percent to 49 percent, and Sanders performed the worst, losing to Trump with 49 percent to Trump’s 51 percent."

Breaking: @AOC Was spotted with Bernie Sanders in Burlington Vermont earlier today. Could an endorsement be coming?? pic.twitter.com/dRTjqcq3vS — CNM (@CNMneews) September 29, 2019

The nature of their discussion remains a mystery, but it has reignited rumors of a potential endorsement on the horizon, as the Burlington Free Press noted:

INTERESTING meeting today in Burlington, VT:@BernieSanders sat down with @AOC.

The two were spotted at a diner in town and AOC’s team confirms they met. No word on what they discussed…. — Ryan Nobles (@ryanobles) September 29, 2019

The meeting follows weeks of internal frenzy for the Sanders campaign, which recently shook up its staffers in New Hampshire following concerns of Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) surge in the early primary state — one Sanders won handily against former opponent Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Shortly after, the Sanders campaign shook things up in Iowa, removing Jess Mazour as the campaign’s Iowa political director. “We’ll continue to make moves that we feel best position this campaign to win,” Shakir told the Washington Post of the move.

Both moves followed Sanders’ loss of the Working Families Party (WFP) endorsement to Warren.

“Senator Warren strikes fear into the hearts of the robber barons who rigged the system, and offers hope to millions of working people who have been shut out of our democracy and economy,” WFP National Party Director Maurice Mitchell said in a statement following the endorsement, according to Politico.

Democrat operatives — as well as former and current Sanders supporters — are worried about Sanders’ style and general ability to adapt, and those concerns are driving some to Warren instead.

As Politico reported:

As Sanders has stagnated and Warren has soared, even some of the Vermont senator’s supporters are expressing alarm. Something is off, they say privately, adding to the chorus of people in establishment political circles saying the same thing. Maybe he should explain how he’s different from Warren — he has deliberately avoided any hint of criticism of her — or commit to out-organizing her in the early nominating states. Or perhaps he needs to make nice with the media and hire more seasoned pros. Or what about going all-in on Iowa? The ideas from his volunteers, former aides, past delegates, steering committee members, and even some people within his campaign, vary. But they almost all come back to the same fundamental question, a question that has confounded the campaign since its earliest days: Can Bernie Sanders — a 78-year-old iconoclast whose entire identity is about standing firm in his beliefs, damn it — change?

Ocasio-Cortez, a fellow socialist, has yet to endorse a presidential candidate, but it is possible that the Sanders campaign is seeking one in hopes of a boost, particularly among idealistic and ultra-leftist millennial supporters.

Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are on the same page on a variety of hot-button Democrat issues — particularly the Green New Deal. Sanders rolled out the most aggressive climate change agenda of any of his competitors last month, clocking in around $16 trillion. The two socialist lawmakers are also strong advocates for Medicare for All.

While the New York lawmaker has praised Sanders in the past for wielding “enormous political courage” on behalf of others, she has stopped short of endorsing him:

One thing that is completely undeniable about Bernie Sanders is the enormous political courage he consistently wields on behalf of others. This statement is a big deal. He’s not just standing up for two members – he’s standing for the integrity of the entire US Congress. https://t.co/dZ8jPIyrLU — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) August 16, 2019

She told CNN in May that she was looking for a candidate who has a “coherent worldview and logic from which all these policy proposals are coming forward.”

The remark stands in contrast to the more measured position the socialist senator articulated last week, expressing a fear that the impeachment effort could ultimately lead to Trump finding and claiming vindication after the likely scenario of an acquittal in the Republican-led Senate.

“Here’s the dilemma that you have,” Sanders said last week, according to BuzzFeed News. “Now I don’t know — I’ll tell you that my gut is that the average Republican in the Senate and the House is totally intimidated by President Trump.”

“And at this particular point, I have my doubts, like you all. I have my doubts that any Republican, or very few, would vote against him,” he continued.

“I know and you know what [Trump] will do: ‘I am vindicated! … I am vindicated!’ And I think that is a fact that has to be taken into consideration,” Sanders said.

“But what do you do when you have a president who has acted in an unconstitutional way? If that is the findings,” Sanders continued. “Again, I don’t want to judge it. I think that is the face. But there is a process that has to take place.”

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) — who recently claimed that impeachment would be “terribly divisive” for the country — switched her position based on the transcript of the phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The conversation showed no quid pro quo or “pressure” as Democrats suspected.

“Up to this point, I have been opposed to pursuing impeachment because it will further divide our already badly divided country,” Gabbard said in a statement:

However, after looking carefully at the transcript of the conversation with Ukraine’s President, the whistleblower complaint, the Inspector General memo, and President Trump’s comments about the issue, unfortunately, I believe that if we do not proceed with the inquiry, it will set a very dangerous precedent.

“I think you read everything. I think you read text. I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved to democratic open elections, elections of USA. No, sure, we had I think good phone call. It was normal,” he told reporters at the United Nations last week.

“The American people are sick and tired of corporate CEOs who now make 300 times more than their average employees, while they give themselves huge bonuses and cut back on the health care and pension benefits of their employees,” the progressive senator from Vermont stressed Monday as he introduced his Inequality Tax Plan.

SANDERS UPS THE ANTE, PROPOSING BIGGER WEALTH TAX THAN WARREN'S PLAN

Sanders, who’s running a second campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, has made erasing income and wealth inequality central components of his White House bid. His new plan would raise taxes on companies with what he calls “exorbitant” pay gaps between their executives and workers.”

“It is time to send a message to corporate America: If you do not end your greed and corruption, we will end it for you,” he said emphatically.

If Sanders is elected and his plan enacted, tax penalties will begin at 0.5 percent for companies paying their top executives from 50 to 100 times more than their typical workers. The penalties scale up all the way to 5 percent for companies paying their top executives more than 500 times what their average workers earn.

“Some corporations where workers are making terrible wages, the CEO is making 500 or a thousand times more than their employee,” Sanders said Monday at a campaign event in New Hampshire. “Over the last 30 years, the top 1 percent has seen a $21 trillion increase in their wealth, while the bottom half of America has seen a decline in their wealth.”

The Sanders campaign said that if the senator’s campaign was in effect last year, banking giant J.P. Morgan Chase would have paid up to $991.6 million more in taxes, and Walmart $793.8 million more.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Sanders released his new tax proposal a week after he unveiled a plan to tax the wealthiest Americans to diminish income inequality and to begin to finance the steep price tags for the numerous government programs the Democratic presidential candidate is proposing.

“There should be no billionaires. We are going to tax their extreme wealth and invest in working people,” Sanders wrote on Twitter last week. His campaign also sent an email under the subject line: ""Billionaires should not exist.""

The senator’s plan followed a similar proposal earlier this year from one of his top rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination, fellow progressive lawmaker Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

The Sanders and Warren plans to boost taxes on the ultrawealthy were criticized last week by 2020 Democratic rival Andrew Yang.

The tech entrepreneur, who’s seen his campaign surge in recent months said on Twitter: “I understand the spirit and appeal of a wealth tax. It makes sense that those who enjoy vast fortunes should pay back into the system, particularly given the concentrations of wealth in our winner-take-all economy.""

But, he added, ""implementation would be impractical and problematic.”

Sanders' return to New Hampshire came days after the most recent poll in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state – from Monmouth University -- indicated the senator fading to a distant third behind longtime frontrunner former Vice President Joe Biden and Warren.

Sanders downplayed that poll during an interview Monday with NHTalkRadio.com. “We’re feeling great,” he said. The turnouts are great… I think we have a great organization here in New Hampshire.”

And he repeated he was confident that he would once again win the state that four years ago made him a household name across the country when he crushed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 New Hampshire presidential primary.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff kicked off demands for more of President Trump’s phone calls with world leaders, suggesting that the president was endangering national security.

“If those conversations with Putin or with other world leaders are sequestered in that same electronic file that is meant for covert action, not meant for this, if there’s an effort to hide those and cover those up, yes we’re determined to find out,” Schiff said on NBC’s Meet the Press.

Sanders claims a wealth tax on the top one-tenth of 1 percent of Americans will fund his initiative.

Well folks, he and others in his party already plan to dump the burden of ""Medicare-for-all,"" free college, medical debt cancellation, and the Green New Deal on the backs of the wealthy. Do they really think the top 1 percent can afford to fund the entire nation? Total income confiscation wouldn’t pay for all those programs!

The wealthy ALREADY pay the majority of the income taxes. In fact, in 2018, the wealthiest 1,409 taxpayers paid more income tax than bottom 70 million!

Here’s the thing about wealth, Bernie. It’s MOBILE. The wealthiest Americans are not going to sit idly by as their incomes are confiscated to fund your big government pie-in-the-sky plans.

Then what? What happens when the richest Americans take their money elsewhere? Who pays for these quasi-socialist plans? Answer: We do. The middle class, the average American.

We always take the brunt of the pain because we are essentially forced to. That’s why the middle class has been driven out of places like California, for cryin' out loud.

It’s only affordable for the exorbitantly wealthy and the homeless.

In his speech outlining his new proposal, Sanders correctly noted we have an affordable housing issue in the United States. He stated that 18 million families are paying more than half their incomes on housing and utilities. He’s not wrong.

The season premiere limped out of the gate on Saturday, despite boasting the acclaimed Woody Harrelson as its host, and returning favorites like beloved former cast member Maya Rudolph, Larry David (as Democrat socialist Bernie Sanders), and Baldwin impersonating President Trump.

The show has also suffered a 15 percent loss in overall viewership compared to its 2018 season. The show’s cold open featured Baldwin as a distraught Trump, calling SNL alum Kate McKinnon’s Rudy Giuliani for comfort regarding the Ukraine controversy.

“Nobody’s gonna find out about our illegal side dealings with the Ukraine,” Giuliani reassured Trump. “Or how we tried to cover up those side dealings. Or how we planned to cover up the cover up.”

“Where are you right now?” Trump asked. “I’m on CNN right now,” Giuliani responded. Trump then moved through an escalating series of calls, culminating in a conversation with Liev Schreiber — fictional Hollywood fixer Ray Donovan, of Showtime’s eponymous series.

Baldwin has previously asserted that he is done playing his parody of the POTUS, after a decline in ratings and the departure of two Saturday Night Live writers. He has even previously said he hated the role, and wished “a meteor would kill me.”

“I feel like I’m done with that now. I’m so done with that,” Baldwin told USA Today. “When [former head writers] Chris Kelly and Sarah Schneider wrote, that was new, it was fresh and the ratings were good.” It remains to be seen whether the show will recover from its latest slump, but the dependable well of puckered-lip political satire seems to be drying up."

“Thanks to this outpouring of support, we see a viable path forward to continue growing a winning campaign. I’m staying in this race -- and I’m in it to win,” Booker said.

Nine days ago the senator from New Jersey announced that if he didn’t haul in $1.7 million by the end of the month – which marks the end of the July-September third quarter of fundraising – he would likely end his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.

2020 DEMOCRATIC FIELD POISED FOR NEW PURGE, WITH CRUCIAL DEADLINES LOOMING

Booker, who declared his candidacy for the White House in early February, quickly built a formidable operation in the early voting primary and caucus states. The large staff on the ground in Iowa, New Hampshire, and other early voting states is expensive to maintain. Top Booker advisers have warned that while the campaign can continue at its current size and strength, it needs more funding if it wants to expand and compete with the top-tier Democratic nomination rivals.

Booker raised $4.5 million in the April-June second quarter of fundraising, far behind former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

“We got to a point where we saw candidates that were raising multiples of what we were raising,” Booker told reporters on Thursday during a campaign stop in New Hampshire. “We were not going to be able to stay in competition with them unless we raise significant money, so I told the truth.”

With that in mind, Booker told his supporters on Monday that “this won’t be the last mountain we have to climb on our way to the nomination -- we have a lot more money to raise to continue being competitive with the better-funded campaigns in this race. I’ll be asking more of my supporters as we move forward in this campaign together.”

And he didn’t waste any time, setting another goal of raising an additional $217,000 by the end of Monday to put him over the $2 million mark since announcing his original pitch nine days ago.

Booker announced on Twitter late in the the afternoon on Monday that he reached the $2 million mark.

The Booker campaign has pushed back against descriptions of the fundraising goal as a kind of gimmick. But the candidate himself acknowledged one of his intentions was to pump up fundraising.

Asked last week by a reporter from New Hampshire Public Radio “if this is just a gambit to raise money or are you really on the cusp of not having enough money,” Booker answered “both.”

While Booker qualified for the third and fourth round Democratic presidential primary debates, he has struggled in polling, averaging in the low to mid-single digits, far behind the top-tier contenders.

The Booker campaign highlighted on Sunday that they’ve reached the higher donor threshold to qualify for November’s fifth-round debate. To make the stage, candidates receive contributions from at least 165,000 individual donors – including a minimum of 600 donors each in at least 20 states or territories.

But Booker remains short of reaching the polling criteria."

You know, it’s interesting — if you look at some of the things that she’s talking about and some of the things the president is talking about of what the problems in the country are — they’ve actually identified a lot of the same problems. But if you listen to how they want to solve them, you couldn’t find a more stark contrast than between the two of them.”

She continued, “I think that the far-left radical ideas that she’s bringing to the table are just not going to sell in most of America. And I think that is a great thing for the president, and frankly, it’s a good thing for the country because it helps make sure that we get four more years under this president.”

Sanders went on to say she thinks a Warren presidency would be a “scary thing for America” because of how far to the left she is.

“[Democratic presidential candidates] are so beholden to this far left-wing part of the party – the AOCs and The Squad – that they’re trying to appease them,” she explained. “And I think it’s going to be impossible to come back to the middle and try to regain some of those independent voters. And some of the people like Elizabeth Warren, I don’t think she wants to come back to the middle. I think she believes that the far left side is right. I think that’s a scary thing for America if she became president.”

On the roster: Dems try to stay on offense - Thornberry out as Texodus continues - Booker beats his benchmark - Don’t get sideways with this bear



DEMS TRY TO STAY ON OFFENSE

Politico: “House Democrats are plotting an all-out offensive against President Donald Trump as they pursue an impeachment inquiry, announcing plans on Sunday to streamline their messaging operation and aid vulnerable lawmakers as they face potential blowback in their districts. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her top deputies laid out the strategy during a private conference call Sunday afternoon. The plan reflects a deepening sentiment among Democrats that Trump’s latest scandal involving Ukraine could persuade the public to support impeachment. But it also underscores longstanding concerns that an impeachment push could jeopardize some of the toss-up seats in 2020 that helped the party win the majority last year. … Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos, who leads House Democrats’ campaign arm, advised the caucus’ most vulnerable members to gauge support and test their message through polling in their respective districts…”



No recess from impeachment pressure for House Dems - NYT: “Orange County was the epicenter of the 2018 House Democratic takeover, where Republicans lost four seats in what was once the heart of Ronald Reagan conservatism in California. On Saturday night, as three of the victorious Democrats were honored at an annual political dinner, a new battle was on everyone’s minds: How to protect those gains in 2020 by selling voters on the impeachment inquiry of President Trump. At the dinner, Representative Harley Rouda warned Democrats not to ‘sit on our laurels.’ Representative Mike Levin solemnly said ‘the times have found us.’ And Representative Gil Cisneros, who came out for the inquiry only last week, plugged his campaign website twice to ask for donations and noted, ‘The Republicans are coming after me now.’ A tricky balancing act is now underway for House Democrats as they return to their districts for a two-week recess that will double as a crucial time to frame a coast-to-coast debate over impeachment and the nation’s priorities.”



Pergram: Meanwhile, back at the House - Fox News: “The House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees will continue to toil behind the scenes investigating and, eventually, crafting actual articles of impeachment. More on that in a moment. … The subpoenas are part of a two-pronged strategy by Democrats. Get the information to help tailor the articles of impeachment, or convert a refusal to comply into an impeachment article itself. House Democrats say the recess period is important to educate the public about the impeachment process and to gin up support for it.”



McConnell says ‘no choice’ but for Senate to take up impeachment - USA Today: “Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday the Senate would have ‘no choice’ but to hold a trial on whether to remove President Donald Trump from office if the House votes to put forward articles of impeachment. The Kentucky Republican told CNBC that the obligation to hold a trial is part of Senate rules and it would take a two-thirds vote of the chamber to change that. ‘I would have no choice but to take it up a based on a Senate rule on impeachment,’ McConnell said. … While the Constitution puts the responsibility of holding an impeachment trial in the hands of the Senate, there has been some speculation that McConnell might refuse to hold a trial.”



Biden wants a Giuliani ban - NYT: “Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s presidential campaign contacted top television anchors and networks on Sunday to ‘demand’ that Rudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, be kept off the air because of what they called his misleading comments about the Biden family and Ukraine. ‘We are writing today with grave concern that you continue to book Rudy Giuliani on your air to spread false, debunked conspiracy theories on behalf of Donald Trump,’ a pair of top Biden campaign advisers, Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield, wrote in the letter. ‘Giving Rudy Giuliani valuable time on your air to push these lies in the first place is a disservice to your audience and a disservice to journalism,’ the advisers wrote. The note, which was obtained by The New York Times, was sent to executives and top political anchors at ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox News and NBC, including star interviewers like Jake Tapper, Chuck Todd and Chris Wallace.”



Trump’s scorched earth attacks turn off some on his side - WaPo: “Sunday started with President Trump’s former homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, saying he was ‘deeply disturbed’ by the implications of his call to the Ukrainian president and ended with a GOP congressman, Adam Kinzinger, calling one of Trump’s tweets ‘beyond repugnant.’ While key Republicans have rallied to the president’s defense since House Democrats opened an impeachment inquiry last week, the bookends to the day underscore the riskiness of a scorched-earth defense strategy that is predicated on an insistence that Trump did absolutely nothing wrong. The president is running the smashmouth playbook he learned from Roy Cohn, his mentor and Joe McCarthy’s hatchet man. It’s worked repeatedly for Trump, from fighting the Justice Department’s investigation of racial discrimination at his family’s rental properties in the 1970s to overcoming Bob Mueller’s investigation the past two years.”



It's 1998 redux, but will the economy play along? - Politico: “The U.S. economy has sailed through a presidential impeachment before. In 1998, as the GOP-controlled House moved to impeach President Bill Clinton, the stock market soared and the economy grew nearly 5 percent. But economists and Wall Street analysts note that conditions are very different now as Democrats push toward a possible impeachment of President Donald Trump. During the Clinton impeachment, the dot com boom was making Americans exuberant about the economy. Today, the economy is slowing, consumer confidence is dipping and corporate America faces a gauntlet of worries including the trade war with China, the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement and slowing growth around the world. And now investors, consumers and corporate executives face the prospect of a Washington consumed for months by impeachment drama and the uncertain reactions of a volatile president with a penchant for lashing out under stress.”

TIME OUT: ‘JANUARY BELONGS TO KALE’

Atlantic: “January belongs to kale. This annual vegetable cycle shows up in the past decade of Google Trends data, which compiles how frequently Americans trawl the internet for information about certain terms. Since about 2011, when Gwyneth Paltrow taught the world how to make kale chips on the Ellen show, kale has entered into the cultural lexicon as a status symbol for a generation of young adults drawn to conspicuous health-consciousness. … But kale’s cultural ubiquity might not be exactly what it seems. After kale briefly overtook spinach as America’s favorite cooked green in mid-2014, Google’s measure of interest in kale has steadily declined. The green’s digital fortunes are currently back at about where they were in 2011… Search data aren’t the end-all-be-all measurement of popularity, but the more leads you follow, the more you begin to question the narrative of kale’s dominance. In fact, America might never have been that into kale in the first place.”

THORNBERRY OUT AS TEXODUS CONTINUES

Texas Tribune: “U.S. Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Clarendon, announced Monday that he will not seek reelection in 2020, making him the sixth GOP congressman from Texas to say he's retiring in recent weeks. ‘It has been a great honor for me to represent the people of the 13th District of Texas for the last 25 years,’ he said in a statement. ‘We are reminded, however, that ‘for everything there is a season,’ and I believe that the time has come for a change. Therefore, I will not be a candidate for reelection in the 2020 election.’ Thornberry joins five other Texas Republicans in Congress who are not running for reelection — U.S. Reps. Kenny Marchant, Pete Olson, Mike Conaway, Will Hurd and Bill Flores. But Thornberry's exit is somewhat different from other Republicans' shocking retirements over the summer. The last remaining Texan from the class of 1994 and the dean of the GOP delegation, Thornberry was expected by many to retire soon. He will turn over his post leading the Republican side of the House Armed Services Committee in January 2021, thanks to Republican term limits for committee chairmanships.”



BOOKER BEATS HIS BENCHMARK

Fox News: “Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker says he has reached his self-imposed fundraising goal to continue his White House bid. ‘I have some incredible news, friend. Last night at 8:16 p.m., we reached our goal of $1.7 million -- a full day ahead of the deadline we set for ourselves,’ the Democrat from New Jersey wrote in an email to supporters on Monday morning. ‘Thanks to this outpouring of support, we see a viable path forward to continue growing a winning campaign. I’m staying in this race -- and I’m in it to win,’ Booker said. … Top Booker advisers have warned that while the campaign can continue at its current size and strength, it needs more funding if it wants to expand and compete with the top-tier Democratic nomination rivals.”



The Bern has lost its glow - Politico: “With just four months until the first-in-the-nation caucuses, [Bernie] Sanders is in trouble. As he delivered his populist gospel to large crowds of camouflage-clad high schoolers, liberal arts college students, and trade union members across Iowa last week, a problematic narrative was hardening around him: His campaign is in disarray and Elizabeth Warren has eclipsed him as the progressive standard-bearer of the primary. He’s sunk to third place nationally, behind Warren and Joe Biden, and some polls of early nomination states show him barely clinging to double digits. He’s shaken up his staffs in Iowa and New Hampshire. He’s lost the endorsement of the Working Families Party, a left-wing group that backed him in 2016, to Warren. … Sanders is still a top-tier candidate, and many voters haven’t made up their minds yet. But time is starting to run short.”



Biden dials back digital ads - NYT: “Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s presidential campaign has sharply scaled back his online advertising, cutting spending so severely since August that he is now investing only a fraction of what his top rivals are on Facebook and Google, the two dominant internet platforms. In a race where many voters are following politics on their smartphones, Mr. Biden’s pullback is an unusual and potentially worrisome sign about his appeal among the Democratic activists, young people and donors who are especially engaged on social media. Candidates rarely withdraw so much money from their online campaigns unless they are seeing weak results in online fund-raising, according to interviews with digital strategists.”



Biden looks for Hispanic Caucus to break his way - Politico: “The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has largely stayed out of the presidential primary so far — partly out of respect for Julián Castro, the only Latino in the race and the brother of CHC Chairman Joaquin Castro. But with Julián languishing at the bottom of polls with around 1 percent support, at least a handful of the group’s 38 members are on the verge of announcing their support for Joe Biden, according to sources familiar with the effort. Their impact could provide an adrenaline boost in a Democratic contest where most campaigns are struggling to win over Hispanic voters — a bloc that will play a key role in early-state Nevada and on Super Tuesday. … Biden and California Sen. Kamala Harris currently lead the Democratic primary field in CHC endorsements with three apiece.”



Dems head to K Street to fund convention - Politico: “Two top operatives planning the Democratic Party’s 2020 convention in Milwaukee went to K Street last week to pitch lobbyists on their plans for the $70 million event. Against the backdrop of the Democratic primary, it was an awkward pairing — representatives for special interests meeting with top Democrats while the party’s leading presidential candidates reject corporate PAC and lobbyist cash. But Democratic National Committee officials explained during the meeting how corporations can help foot the bill for the convention, regardless of who the nominee is, addressing some lobbyists’ worries that a crusading left-wing nominee like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren could try to reject corporate money, embarrassing convention sponsors. The DNC doesn’t plan to return any corporate money that is donated to the convention regardless of the nominee, convention CEO Joe Solmonese told POLITICO.”

DON’T GET SIDEWAYS WITH THIS BEAR

NY Post: “A black bear with a discerning palate was caught on camera munching on grapes in a California vineyard – but only picking out those used for Pinot Noir, according to a report. Video shows the refined mammal stomping around Navarro Vineyards in Philo, Calif., and stopping to pick at the Pinot Noir vines – ignoring the eight other grape varieties grown at the winery. ‘He will go for the premium fruit,’ Aaron Bennett, co-owner of the family business told the Los Angeles Times. The booze-loving beast has been using the vineyard as his personal snack bar for years, but the business only recently caught the fiend in the act on security footage. ‘Navarro’s taste-tester is back to ‘get it when the gettin’ is good,’’ the business posted on Facebook last week, along with security footage of the bear. … The bear may be drawn to the specific grapes because they are grown in a remote part of the vineyard. Or maybe he just has good taste, Bennett said.”

“This made my day,"" she added. ""I have been struggling a lot this year but haven't [given] up and have been working very hard, I finally went in and got my permit and have been trying to save up to buy a car.""

Lachance, a single mom to her 8-year-old son, had been working at the KFC in Salem for a year, and walking 3 miles each way to get to the fast-food restaurant. Her dedication to the position is what inspired her boss to put Lachance up for the special award, which honors employees who go above and beyond at work.

Spicer is competing in another round of DWTS on Monday night, and he credits conservatives and Breitbart Nation for making it happen. He said conservatives sent a significant message to leftist elites.

“We made it last week, because your listeners and the people who listen to Breitbart radio, who read the stories at Breitbart.com, came out huge,” Spicer said.

“I cannot tell you how grateful and humbled I am by the number of people who took the time to text, and click on that stuff,” he continued.

Spicer told Breitbart News Sunday that conservatives sent a huge message by pushing him through to the next round.

“You can’t explain how it feels when you’re up there, and you know that you’ve been boycotted, and people have said that I should be kicked off the show because they don’t want to hear this voice,” Spicer explained.

“To know the people at Breitbart Nation took the time to go out there and text and click, it truly is something that we did together,” he said.

“I think we sent a big message because clearly – as anyone who watches the show saw – I’m not the most gifted dancer in the world,” he continued. “I can’t thank you and everyone at Breitbart Nation enough for coming out.”

Spicer echoed the remarks he made during Breitbart News Sunday last week. His appearance on DWTS is sending the message that conservatives are “human beings” and “good people” who care about the country, and they should not be closed out for holding different views.

Spicer said, “This has been a fun experience. It’s been enjoyable. But I think it’s also important that people don’t get to just shout down people on the right and don’t get to say that we get boycotted and can’t participate. We go out there. We elected a president last time, we believe in certain things and I know the people at Breitbart – who read Breitbart, have listened to it – care about this country.”

“We may not – we clearly don’t agree with the folks on the left, but I think to be told that we don’t have a voice is exactly the way that you described it. They tried to dismiss us last cycle. They tried to kick us out of restaurants. They tried to say we’re not allowed to go on shows and so to see that kind of support– and that’s obviously what carried us through,” Spicer continued.

“I think there’s a lot of folks on the left that don’t believe that people on the right have a place in what they consider their society,” Spicer continued, citing boycotts and the protests against former press secretary Sarah Sanders and former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

“It goes back to what Maxine Waters said,” Spicer said, referring to the California lawmaker’s call for “resisters” to confront and harass Trump administration officials.

“Let’s make sure we show up wherever we have to show up,” Waters said.

“If you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd, and you push back on them, and you tell them they’re not welcome anymore, anywhere,” she pressed.

“That’s what they want to do. So for us to go out there and show folks that we have a bunch of people in this country who are with us – and those are all your listeners and your subscribers and leaders– that sends a message to them,” Spicer said, adding that his stay in the competition will force political elites to realize that conservatives are still here and still have a massive voice.

“Once it starts happening – if I keep going forward – it makes them realize, ‘Well wait a second. Who the heck are these people who are voting for Spicer?’ And it’s the same thing from the last election. Who are these deplorables who went out in Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania and Iowa? That wasn’t supposed to happen. But it was because – we went and sent a message to folks,” Spicer said.

“I know what the left wanted. I know what the oddsmakers thought was going to happen, and when you defy that, we really send a message, and it’s not about me,” Spicer stressed.

“It’s about us and I really appreciate everything that all of your folks did,” he added. “You and everyone at Breitbart.”

Spicer competes again Monday night alongside his dancing partner Lindsay Arnold. Spicer told Breitbart News Sunday that he dances later in the show, but supporters can begin casting votes at 8 p.m. EST. The voting window is only open during the live show, through 10 p.m. EST.

5. Trump, unleashed: Donald Trump has spent the last week talking and tweeting almost nonstop as he tries to fight his way out of mounting allegations over his pressure campaign to get the Ukrainians to look into debunked allegations of wrongdoing against Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

And the rhetoric from Trump has gone to previously unseen heights -- even for Trump. He's accused Rep. Adam Schiff (California) of treason, he's attacked Mitt Romney in deeply personal terms -- more on that directly below -- and he's repeating, repeating, repeating long disproven lies.

All of which means that when Trump travels to Minneapolis on Thursday for a ""Keep America Great"" rally, well, look out. Trump is always at his most, well, Trump-y at these campaign rallies -- and, given the walls closing in on him in Washington, he could well use the Minnesota rally as a venting session the likes of which even longtime Trump observers rarely see.

Stay tuned. It's going to be a doozy.

4. Any other Mitt Romneys out there?: Republicans have, almost uniformly, closed ranks around Trump even as a Republicans have, almost uniformly, closed ranks around Trump even as a second whistleblower has emerged regarding the President allegedly using the power of his office for political gain during interactions over the summer with Ukraine.

Only Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) has publicly criticized Trump in any way, calling the President's urgings of China and Ukraine to investigate the Bidens ""wrong"" and ""appalling."" Trump immediately struck back, referring to Romney as a ""pompous 'ass'"" (I have no idea why he put ""ass"" in quotes) and suggesting that the 2012 Republican nominee was ""begging"" to be his secretary of state.

Any Republican who was weighing speaking out about Trump's behavior with Ukraine (and his plea for China to investigate his main rival for the 2020 nomination) now can have no illusions about what such criticism will be met with: Pure, unadulterated anger from Trump -- and likely vilification from the President's base.

Is any prominent Republican other than Romney willing to risk speaking out when that reaction is assured? Principle vs. politics, anyone?

3. Fundraising losers...: With the With the third fundraising quarter ending at the close of last month , most of the major candidates have released how much they brought in and how much they spent between July 1 and September 30.

Let's go through the losers first.

* Joe Biden: When you are a former vice president and the race's frontrunner, you need to be at or very close to the top of the money chase. Biden's $15 million raised in the third quarter is well off the pace and a significant drop-off from when Biden raised $21.5 million from April 1 to June 30 -- his first three months of active fundraising. His numbers will re-ignite the debate over whether he has real grassroots energy behind his establishment candidacy. Think about this: The mayor of South Bend, Indiana -- Pete Buttigieg -- raised $4 million more than Biden in the third quarter and has now out-raised the former vice president for six months straight.

* Cory Booker: The New Jersey senator's plea for $1.7 million in the final days of the quarter -- in order, he said, for him to remain in the race -- drew a ton of publicity. Even though Booker met his goal, he still only brought in $6 million for the entire three-month period. That likely means he will be facing another dire financial deadline in the not-too-distant future.

2. ... and fundraising winners:

* Bernie Sanders: Even as his poll numbers have stagnated somewhat, the Vermont senator's small-dollar, online fundraising network continues to deliver. Sanders topped the field in the third quarter with more than $25 million raised and has now raised more than $71 million this year. That ensures he will not only have real organizations in all of the early states but will also be able to continue fighting for the nomination for months.

* Elizabeth Warren: While Sanders edged out Warren for the top spot by about $500,000, Warren's third quarter fundraising is yet another data point proving how much momentum she has built behind her candidacy. Warren already has the best organization in Iowa, and fundraising like she put on the board over the last three months ensures her campaign will be able to fund a (TV) air assault as well.

* Andrew Yang: The tech entrepreneur raised $10 million in the third quarter, which, at least to me was the single most surprising result of the fundraising race. Yang's total put him well above what Booker, as well as Sen. Michael Bennet (Colorado) and Gov. Steve Bullock (Montana) raised, and within shouting distance of Sen. Kamala Harris (California). That's a stunner, and shows how far he's come since the year started and almost no one knew who he was.

1. The age/health debate is here: It was probably inevitable, given that the four most likely candidates to be president in 2021 are 70+ years old, but Bernie Sanders' recent heart attack has officially injected the issue of age and health into the 2020 campaign.

After several days of uncertainty, Sanders' campaign confirmed that he had suffered a heart attack on the campaign trail and, following his release from the hospital late last week, he has returned to Vermont. His campaign has canceled its events until further notice but has said Sanders will be at the next debate -- set for October 15 in Ohio.

While the relatively advanced ages of Sanders (78), Joe Biden (76) and Elizabeth Warren (70) has been a sort of low buzz in the background of the Democratic race so far, those days are now over. All three candidates had previously pledged to release their medical records before the Iowa caucuses on February 3, 2020, but the urgency of those releases is significantly higher now than it was even a week ago.

(Remember that Donald Trump was the oldest person ever elected to a first term when he won the presidency in 2016 at age 70. During the campaign, his personal physician released a letter proclaiming that Trump ""would be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency."" Trump is now 73. In January of this year, he underwent a physical which found him in ""very good health overall."")"

Whether their support will sway progressive voters, who according to recent polls have been drifting toward Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, is less clear.

It was the most crowded debate stage in the history of US presidential primaries.

Twelve candidates shared the spotlight Tuesday at the Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus. The event was hosted by CNN and The New York Times on the campus of Otterbein University.

This was the fourth Democratic debate of the campaign season, and it came three and a half months before the Iowa caucuses.

The first two debates had so many candidates that they had to be split up over two nights. But the Democratic National Committee raised the polling and fundraising thresholds that candidates need to qualify.

Those thresholds will be raised once again ahead of next month's debate in Georgia, so Tuesday might have been a make-or-break night for some of the lower-polling candidates."

Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday announced a new income-inequality plan that would tax companies that pay CEOs more than 50 times the pay of the median worker.

Sanders' campaign said the plan would raise $150 billion in a decade, which would be used to pay for his plan to eliminate existing medical debt.

Companies like McDonald's, JPMorgan, and Walmart would have paid hundreds of millions more in taxes if the plan had been in effect last year, the Sanders campaign said.

Read more on Business Insider's homepage.

On Monday, the Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders announced a new tax plan aimed at bridging the pay gap between the highest-paid top executives and their employees.

Sanders' Income Inequality Tax Plan would tax ""companies with exorbitant pay gaps between their executives and typical workers.""

""The American people are sick and tired of corporate CEOs who now make 300 times more than their average employees, while they give themselves huge bonuses and cut back on the healthcare and pension benefits of their employees,"" Sanders said in a statement. ""They want corporations to invest in their workers, not just dividends, stock buybacks and outrageous compensation packages to their executives.""

The plan comes on the heels of Sanders' separate wealth-tax plan to tax the nation's ultrarich.

CEO pay has become a hot topic, especially as it has been increasingly called out by economists, politicians, and even activists such as Abigail Disney, who described the former Disney CEO Bob Iger's pay as a ""moral issue"" when she testified before the House Financial Services Committee earlier this year.

Sanders' campaign said the inequality tax would raise an estimated $150 billion over the next decade. The revenue generated from the tax would be used to pay for Sanders' plan to eliminate existing medical debt.

The inequality-tax plan would increase the tax rate of companies where the CEO makes at least 50 times what the median worker does. If the CEO is not the highest-paid executive at the firm, the 50-1 ratio will be calculated using the highest-paid employee.

The plan would increase the tax rate by 0.5 percentage points for companies whose ratio falls between 50-to-1 and 100-to-1, up to a 5-point increase for companies whose pay ratio is more than 500-to-1. The tax would apply to all private and publicly held corporations with annual revenue of more than $100 million, the campaign said.

Here's how much more companies would have paid in taxes if the tax plan had been in effect last year, according to the Sanders campaign:

McDonald's would have paid up to $110.9 million more.

Walmart would have paid up to $793.8 million more.

JPMorgan Chase would have paid up to $991.6 million more.

Home Depot would have paid up to $538.2 million more.

American Airlines would have paid up to $18.8 million more.

""At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, the American people are demanding that large, profitable corporations pay their fair share of taxes,"" Sanders said. ""It is time to send a message to corporate America: If you do not end your greed and corruption, we will end it for you.""

Companies would not owe any additional taxes under the plan if they increased annual median worker pay to $60,000 and curbed CEO compensation to $3 million, the Sanders campaign said."

""You know, if you want to go out and buy groceries, you need identification. If you want to do almost anything you need identification.

Trump added: ""You know why? Because they cheat like hell, that's why."" Voter fraud is exceedingly rare, and there is no evidence of mass cheating by Democrats.

Friday wasn't the first time that Trump claimed Americans need identification for their grocery purchases. He said the same at a Florida rally in July 2018.

The day after the Florida rally, his then-press secretary, Sarah Sanders, told reporters that Trump was referring to purchases of ""beer or wine."" But three months after that, Trump told the conservative Daily Caller that ID is required ""if you buy, you know, a box of cereal.""

Bernie Sanders' campaign said Tuesday that the Democratic presidential contender raised $25.3 million during the third quarter, an increase of more than $7 million from his second-quarter haul.

According to the campaign, Sanders' third-quarter total came from more than 1.4 million individual donations. The campaign attributes to boost over its second-quarter total to more than $10 million raised in September alone, a total they said was a record for a single month. The average donation from those donors was $18.07, according to the campaign.

The Vermont independent senator, who sought the Democratic Party's 2016 presidential nomination, has raised about $61.5 million since launching his campaign in February.

""Bernie is proud to be the only candidate running to defeat Donald Trump who is 100 percent funded by grassroots donations — both in the primary and in the general,"" Sanders' campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a release. ""Media elites and professional pundits have tried repeatedly to dismiss this campaign, and yet working-class Americans keep saying loudly and clearly that they want a political revolution.""

The big third-quarter haul comes as Sanders has slipped behind both former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in the RealClearPolitics aggregate of several polls.

Meanwhile, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg's campaign announced Tuesday that the Democratic contender raised more than $19.1 million in the third quarter, a dip from the $24.8 million the campaign pulled in in the previous fundraising period. Buttigieg has now raised more than $51 million since the start of 2019.

The Indiana mayor finds himself in fourth place, behind Biden, Warren and Sanders, in the RealClearPolitics average."

Joe Biden (D) has been under fire in recent days after it was reported that his campaign dropped short of $1 million – $924,000 – on private jet usage in the third quarter (July 1 – September 30) alone. The expenses were attributed to the EJCR, LLC Dba Advanced Aviation Team, recent Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings show.

While Biden leads the pack, he is not alone in his exorbitant private air travel expenditures. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) reportedly spent just short of $500,000 – $479,000 – on private air travel. That is a $179,000 increase from his private air travel expenses in the previous quarter, according to the Hill.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) also put her climate change-related concerns aside, spending $253,000– $236,000 more than the $17,000 she spent in the previous three months.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) – who once described climate change as the “greatest threat to our national security” – spent $360,000 on private air travel in the third quarter. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) – who described climate change as an “existential crisis that threatens all of us” – also utilized private air travel, spending $132,000 in the third quarter. However, a campaign aide told the Hill that Warren makes an effort to offset her carbon output and gave $10,150 to Native Energy in the third quarter.

An outline of the Democrat-backed Green New Deal, released this year, lamented the existence of cows and air travel but admitted that neither could be totally eliminated.

The outline stated:

We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast, but we think we can ramp up renewable manufacturing and power production, retrofit every building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul transportation and agriculture, plant lots of trees and restore our ecosystem to get to net-zero.

The excessive air travel of the candidates calls their authenticity into question.

Warren has called climate change an “existential crisis that threatens all of us” and called for “bold action now to stop it before it’s too late”:

Climate change is an existential crisis that threatens all of us—and we need to take bold action now to stop it before it's too late. That's why we need to have a #ClimateDebate. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) August 24, 2019

Biden – who spent nearly $1 million on private jet usage in a three-month span – warned that it is going to take “leadership” to combat the “climate crisis”:

It’s critical to have a plan to combat climate change, but it’s going to take more than plans — it’s going to take leadership. I have the experience and relationships necessary to rally the world to meet the urgency of this climate crisis. #ClimateTownHall pic.twitter.com/aXvhwUDHMq — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 5, 2019

Harris has called climate change an “imminent threat to our planet,” while Buttigieg warned that the threat “isn’t theoretical”:

Climate change is an imminent threat to our planet unless we correct course. It’s within our power to do so. Now is the time. pic.twitter.com/q1mToVv6GE — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) February 18, 2019

Climate change isn't theoretical. Parts of California are on fire, in Florida they're talking about sea level rise. In South Bend I had to activate the emergency operation center twice in two years: the first time was a 1000-year flood, the next was a 500-year flood. #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/xx7SFoImuv — Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) June 28, 2019

Sanders, who unveiled a $16 trillion climate change proposal in August, called President Trump an “idiot” for not taking climate change seriously:

Donald Trump believes climate change is a hoax. Donald Trump is an idiot. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) August 10, 2019

Nevertheless, critics argue that Democrats are demonstrating that they are not taking the matter seriously, as their actions do not always coincide with their rhetoric.

For instance, Democrats came under fire last month after attending the Polk County Democrats Steak Fry, which featured thousands of steaks. While climate change alarmists argue that red meat consumption is contributing to the “crisis,” several Democrat candidates happily assisted in grilling the juicy cuts of meat, despite some of the presidential hopefuls previously floating limiting beef consumption in order to curb the looming threat:

Click to subscribe!",Bernie Sanders' heart attack suffered on the campaign trail last week thrusts a tough issue to the front of the 2020 presidential race: How old is too old to be president?,2019-10-07,CNN,Why Bernie Sanders' heart attack matters,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/07/politics/bernie-sanders-donald-trump-joe-biden/index.html,"(CNN) Bernie Sanders' heart attack suffered on the campaign trail last week thrusts a tough issue to the front of the 2020 presidential race: How old is too old to be president?

Sanders is the obvious focus of that question, after having two stents placed into an artery following a campaign appearance in Nevada -- and being forced to pull out of a CNN-sponsored town hall on LGBT issues in California later this week.

But he's not the only candidate in the Democratic field who will be affected by Sanders' heart attack in the race. While Sanders, at 78, is the oldest candidate in the contest, former Vice President Joe Biden is 76, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is 70. If any of them were elected president next November, they would become the oldest person ever elected to a first term as president. The man whose record they would break? Donald Trump, who was 70 when he won in 2016.

Given that the three frontrunners for the Democratic nod are septuagenarians, the age/health question has been a low buzz in the race from the start. But with Biden, Warren and Sanders keeping schedules that would exhaust this 43-year-old in about a day's time, there's been little to hang those worries on.

That's now changed -- in a fundamental way. While Sanders and his campaign (and his supporters) are quick to downplay how serious (or not) this heart attack was for the Vermont senator, it's hard to get away from this fact: Sanders, a 78-year-old man, had a heart attack that required surgery. While there are lots and lots of people who have this exact experience, most of them are not running for president. And no one disputes that being president -- or even running for it -- is a hugely stressful job.

(CNN) We've recently learned two things about Bernie Sanders: that he had a heart attack, and that he was not immediately forthcoming with the news. I wouldn't go so far to call this a ""cover-up,"" not in the Age of Trump, where an entire presidency is a cover-up. But it's dismaying, as it feels like political ""business as usual"" for Bernie to lack transparency, even for a few days, and even under these vulnerable conditions.

Jay Parini

Bernie is my senator, a fellow Vermonter. (Like most people around here, I call him Bernie.) I've been a supporter since he ran for mayor in Burlington some 30 years ago. In my view, no American politician has done more to advance progressive causes in the United States, pushing the Democrats from terrified middle-of-the-road positions on health care and economic inequality to a place we never dreamed we'd see in this lifetime.

He has spoken loudly for the poor, the disenfranchised. He was an early opponent of the Iraq War, unlike Joe Biden. He has a strong grasp of the existential threat posed by climate change.

But the heart attack is now a political problem — for him and the Democrats. It may not be possible for Bernie to continue pushing himself in the way he'd have to push himself to be nominated and to beat Donald Trump.

And beating Trump has become a national emergency. As recent weeks have shown, Trump is dangerously out of touch with reality, with no understanding of the constitutional separation of powers. Trump's behavior with regard to Ukraine (which is likely the tip of a proverbial iceberg) — and more blatantly, his invitation to China to interfere in America's election — makes it clear that he is willing to upend the democratic process itself, OUR democratic process, using his vast authority solely for his own, personal benefit.

351,"Tami Luhby, CNN",,Bernie Sanders often points to Canada and Europe as models for universal health care coverage.,2019-10-15,CNN,Other countries show Medicare for All doesn't have to mean getting rid of private insurance,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/15/politics/private-health-insurance-medicare-for-all-international-comparison/index.html,"But theVermont independent senator's ""Medicare for All"" plan differs substantially from the insurance systems that exist up north and across the pond. Canadians and most European countries have private insurance industries alongside their government programs.

One of the most controversial provisions of Sanders' Medicare for All proposal is that it essentially eliminates private insurance -- allowing the industry to only offer benefits for services that are not covered by the federal program, such as cosmetic surgery. More than 150 million Americans buy private policies through their employers, and tens of millions more purchase private insurance through Medicare Advantage or on the individual market exchanges.

Sanders has made Medicare for All a centerpiece of his 2020 presidential campaign. Rivals ranging from President Donald Trump to former Vice President Joe Biden, who is also seeking the Democratic nomination, have gone the other way and argue that Americans should not be forced to give up policies they like. Sanders has defended his stance, slamming the private insurance industry for putting profits over patients.

But public and private insurance co-exist in Canada and many European countries. These developed nations require that everyone have coverage -- with private insurance typically providing additional benefits, helping to pay out-of-pocket costs or allowing faster and broader access to medical providers. In some nations, such as the Netherlands and Switzerland, residents satisfy their coverage mandate with policies from private carriers.

In many developed nations outside of the US, residents expect a lot from their health systems but they are conscious of the cost, said Chris James, an economist specializing in health care for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, a consortium of 36 developed countries.

""It becomes a tricky political balance between those competing sets of demands,"" James said. ""They want more generous public provisions but they don't want to pay too much more tax.""

How health care coverage works in other countries varies widely.

Canada, for instance, has a regionally administered public health insurance program, which is paid for by provincial and federal tax revenue, according to a 2017 report from The Commonwealth Fund. Patients don't pay for hospital care and doctors' visits. However, the universal program, known as Canadian Medicare, doesn't cover outpatient prescription drugs, rehabilitation, home care, dental benefits, vision care and some other services. Some two-thirds of Canadians are covered by private plans, often through their employers, to cover these treatments. The insurers are mostly for profit.

England, meanwhile, has the very comprehensive National Health Service, paid for by taxes. Services are generally free, though there are some copayments for prescription drugs and some services, including dental care for most adults. Still, about 11% of residents sign up for private health insurance plans, which provide faster access to care, particularly elective hospital procedures, according to The Commonwealth Fund.

""They use it to jump the queue,"" said Robin Osborn, senior adviser with The Commonwealth Fund.

The system is very different in other countries, however.

In the Netherlands, residents are required to buy private insurance, which is heavily regulated and paid for by payroll taxes paid by employers, premiums paid by enrollees, annual deductibles, copayments and general taxes. Lower-income folks receive government subsidies to help them afford the cost, James said. Some 84% of the Dutch also buy additional private coverage to pay for dental care, eyeglasses, physical therapy and other services, mostly from non-profit insurers, according to The Commonwealth Fund.

Germans are also mandated to have coverage. They can choose from more than 100 non-profit ""sickness funds,"" which covers a wide array of services, including drugs, physical therapy and dental work. Most are funded through payroll contributions that are split between workers and companies. About 11% of residents, mainly younger workers with higher incomes, opt out of this program and buy private coverage, which may offer a wider range of services with lower premiums, according to The Commonwealth Fund. Some of the private insurers are non-profit, while most are for profit.

Denmark, meanwhile, has a national health care system paid for mainly by income taxes, but 42% of residents buy additional coverage to help pay for prescription drugs, dental care and physical therapy, mainly from the non-profit Danmark, according to The Commonwealth Fund. Additionally, 30% have supplemental policies from for-profit insurers to give them expanded access to private providers.

""These systems each have carved out a role for private insurance,"" Osborn said. ""The universal coverage provides a comprehensive package of benefits that is generous. The private insurance, depending on the system, often enables people to get care that is either faster, has a slightly higher level of amenities or additional benefits.""

The Sanders campaign says that private insurers in other countries are very different from the American companies Sanders is fighting against.

""For the most part, for-profit, private insurance companies do not play a large role in other countries' health care systems and, to the extent that they do play a role, they are tightly managed and kept in line by the government,"" said Warren Gunnels, senior adviser to the campaign."

Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) campaign is offering broad protections to transgender and illegal immigrant employees as part of its collective bargaining agreement, according to the Washington Examiner, which obtained a copy of the contract.

The Sanders campaign — which has touted the socialist senator as the most pro-worker candidate — became the first presidential campaign in history to unionize this year.

“Bernie Sanders is the most pro-union candidate in the field, he’ll be the most pro-union president in the White House and we’re honored that his campaign will be the first to have a unionized workforce,” Sanders’ campaign manager Faiz Shakir announced in March.

The statement added that the “majority of the campaign’s bargaining unit employees designated the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 400 to represent them as their exclusive bargaining representative.”

The Washington Examiner obtained a copy of the bargaining agreement, which contains a variety of protections for a plethora of diversity-centered issues, from transgender worker rights to implicit bias training.

The agreement allows the union to create committees designed to tackle issues such as “‘diversity, anti-harassment, microaggression, transgender worker rights, gender neutrality, inclusion, and implicit bias training,'” the Examiner reports.

The agreement specifically requires the Sanders campaign to keep track of an employee’s “gender expression” and “preferred gender pronouns” and specifies that transgender employees may use whichever bathroom they identify with. It also requires fellow employees to “refer to transgender Employees by the names they choose and the pronouns they identify with.” Additionally, “boarding materials and policy manuals” are expected to refrain from gendered language.

The agreement states in part:

In order to best balance the personal preferences of all Employees, supervisors and Employees will be encouraged to make preferred pronouns a part of introductions at meetings, but no Employee will be required to state a preference, nor shall they be discriminated against for not stating a preference at such meetings. The contract also outlines protections for individuals who are not lawfully in the United States, even requiring the campaign to provide “English as a Second Language (ESL) and literacy classes to Employees, either directly or in partnership with not-for-profit ESL providers.”

Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) campaign left the team just one day after joining over a controversial video that sexualized Martin Luther King’s “I Have a Dream” speech.

Matt Orfalea joined the Sanders campaign after making a viral 2020 Sanders video titled “Rising Up.” However, his employment was short-lived, as he resigned just a day after joining the team after controversial videos from his past surfaced– specifically, a video that sexualized MLK’s “I Have a Dream Speech.”

He explained in a Medium post published Monday that the decade-old video was aimed to demonstrate “media manipulation” but also admitted that it was a “pathetic attempt at comedy.”

“When I was about 20 yrs old, I edited MLK audio, to expose how easily media can completely misrepresent reality,” he wrote in a Medium post.

“That intention has been clearly stated in the Youtube description for 10 years. It was supposed to be a ‘reminder that media on tv or the web can be edited to twist facts/reality,'” he added.

The description of the video reads:

Martin Luther King Jr. was a great man. The real, “I Have a Dream” speech is amazing. And society is undeniably better thanks to MLK and the civil rights movement. No one should be ever be judged based on their race/ethnicity. The purpose of this video is to show people that media on the web and TV can be edited to really twist facts/reality.

“There was a time when the vulgar ridiculousness of the final product made me laugh,” Orfalea continued. Looking back at it now makes me ill. I choose not to delete it only because I want to be fully transparent. I’m sincerely sorry I ever made it.”

Orfalea also faced backlash for the content of in some of his other videos, in which he used the terms “retarded” and “gay.” He apologized profusely:

Despite my thoughtless past use of the word “retarded”, I hold absolutely no prejudice toward anyone with special needs. In fact, I live happily with my adult special needs younger brother. Likewise, many years ago in my 20’s, I referred to the cliche use of clones in youtube videos as “gay”. I am sorry to say that growing up it was a term used regularly and casually by my peers to refer to something “silly” or “lame” — not actually referring to homosexuality at all. I’ve never had any issues with anyone’s sexuality.

He added that he is “ashamed” of his “past contribution to the endless supply of dumb Youtube videos” and explained that he eventually pivoted toward more “meaningful” videos, such as the Sanders “Rising Up” video.

Orfalea ultimately said he decided to leave the Sanders campaign because he did not want a “dumb 10 year old youtube video to distract from the real issues.”

“All initial job offers are contingent on the completion of a final review of a person’s record,” Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said of Orfalea’s departure.

“That vetting process had not yet been completed. It’s clear some of Matt’s prior social media content does not reflect the campaign’s values,” he added. “We accept his resignation.”"

CNBC reports that during a livestreamed employee Q&A call this week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed a number of topics including politics. Zuckerberg was asked to respond to Senator Bernie Sanders’s comment that billionaires should not exist, and gave a surprising answer given that Zuckerberg himself is worth $69 billion.

“I understand where he’s coming from,” Zuckerberg said. “I don’t know that I have an exact threshold on what amount of money someone should have but on some level no one deserves to have that much money.”

Zuckerberg was also asked about comments he made during two separate leaked internal Q&A sessions he had with employees in July. Zuckerberg is quoted as saying: “You have someone like Elizabeth Warren that thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies … I mean, if she gets elected president then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge.”

Zuckerberg adds: “And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don’t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. I mean, that’s not the position that you want to be in when you’re, you know, I mean … It’s like, we care about our country, and want to work with our government and do good things. But look, at the end of the day, if someone’s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and fight.”

Zuckerberg stated in the recent public Q&A that he stands by his comments about Warren but added: “let’s try not to antagonize her further.” Zuckerberg was also asked about how the firm determines what counts as fake news that should be removed, Zuckerberg clarified that the main objective is to stamp out “complete and obvious hoaxes.”

“When we talk about misinformation, a lot of people focus on a statement that isn’t clear if it’s a shade of true or partially false,” he said. “There’s a lot of stuff that people say that is completely false. That’s the thing that I’m really focused on and making sure that we [stop].”

Bernie Sanders will launch his first television ad of the 2020 cycle in Iowa, the campaign announced Tuesday.

The $1.3 million buy was made public hours after Sanders revealed that he raised more than $25 million during the last three months , the biggest quarterly haul of any Democratic candidate to date.

Sanders has been slumping in recent early state polling. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden led in a recent CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom survey of likely Iowa caucusgoers; that same poll put Sanders at a distant third. But the campaign is now looking to leverage Sanders' massive and loyal small dollar donor base to hit the airwaves in an effort to turn the tide.

The ad was produced by Sanders' in-house production team, as CNN reported last week , and will appear in 30- and 60-second versions beginning on Thursday, according to a press release. It will run for the subsequent two weeks.

In a preview provided by the campaign, the spot -- titled ""Fight For Us"" -- begins with a biographical note.

""Living in a family that struggled economically powerfully influenced my life and my values,"" Sanders says in a clip taken from his campaign's first rally, in Brooklyn, New York , where he grew up.

The ad then flips through a series of images showing Sanders marching with wage workers demanding a union, rallying for his signature public policy proposal, ""Medicare for All,"" and being arrested, as a young man in early 1960s Chicago, during a civil rights protest.

""Now, our country is at a turning point,"" the narrator says as President Donald Trump and the white nationalist demonstrators from Charlottesville, Virginia, appear. ""A dangerous demagogue tearing our nation apart, hard-working people betrayed by Trump, a health care system that makes enormous profits for drug and insurance companies, and a planet on the brink of a climate disaster.""

The ad also touts Sanders' clashes with Wall Street, pharmaceutical companies -- including a clip from his July visit to Canada with diabetes patients in search of affordable insulin -- and his push to raise the minimum wage for employees at Amazon.

""In this moment, we need a fighter: Bernie Sanders,"" the minute-long version of the ad concludes. ""We know he'll fight for us as president, because he always has.""

The question of when the campaign would go on television in Iowa had rankled some top aides to the campaign, who were pushing for an earlier debut. The ad's release follows Sanders' recent ""Bernie Beats Trump"" tour of the state, which centered on counties where voters flipped from backing former President Barack Obama to President Donald Trump in 2016."

Bernie Sanders suffered a heart attack, his campaign confirmed on Friday after he departed Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center in Las Vegas.

""I want to thank the doctors, nurses, and staff at the Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center for the excellent care that they provided,"" Sanders said in a statement Friday. ""After two and a half days in the hospital, I feel great, and after taking a short time off, I look forward to getting back to work.""

Sanders is traveling back to Burlington, Vermont, on Saturday to continue his recovery, campaign spokesman Mike Casca said.

Sanders' treating physicians -- Arturo Marchand Jr., MD, and Arjun Gururaj, MD -- confirmed that the senator was diagnosed with a ""myocardial infarction"" and had two stents placed in a blocked coronary artery, noting that ""all other arteries were normal."" Myocardial infarction is the medical term for a heart attack.

They added that Sanders' hospital stay and treatment were ""uneventful with good expected progress,"" and that he had been instructed ""to follow up with his personal physician.""

Bernie Sanders raised more than $25 million over the past three months, his campaign said Tuesday morning.",2019-10-01,CNN,Bernie Sanders announces massive $25.3 million third quarter fundraising haul,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/01/politics/bernie-sanders-25-million-fundraising-third-quarter-2019/index.html,"(CNN) Sen. Bernie Sanders raised more than $25 million over the past three months, his campaign said Tuesday morning.

The haul -- up more than $7 million from his second quarter total -- underscored Sanders' continued strength with small dollar donors. The campaign announced last week that it had received contributions from more than a million people.

""Bernie is proud to be the only candidate running to defeat Donald Trump who is 100 percent funded by grassroots donations -- both in the primary and in the general,"" Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement celebrating the new figures.

He also took aim at the press coverage of the campaign, which has struggled in recent early-state polling amid internal tensions over its strategy and spending.

""Media elites and professional pundits have tried repeatedly to dismiss this campaign,"" Shakir said, ""and yet working-class Americans keep saying loudly and clearly that they want a political revolution.""

The campaign in a press release said that September had been its strongest fundraising month to date.

Average third-quarter donations

Sanders spokesman Mike Casca also told CNN on Tuesday that about 130,000 people had signed up to make monthly recurring contributions and that 99.9% of its total donor base had not yet given the individual maximum of $2,800 per election -- further signs that Sanders is well-positioned to keep up his current fundraising pace.

Individuals who listed their occupation as ""teacher"" were the most frequent donors to Sanders, according to the campaign, which said ""the three most common employers (of its contributors) were Starbucks, Amazon and Walmart.""

The average donation during the third quarter, the campaign said, was $18.07. Since entering the race in February, Sanders has raised $61.5 million, according to the statement. He also transferred an additional $2.6 million to his presidential coffers from other campaign accounts during the third quarter.

On September 19, when the campaign announced that it reached the million donor mark, it highlighted contributions from voters in counties that backed former President Barack Obama in 2012 before flipping to President Donald Trump four years later. Sanders received 81,000 donations from those potentially decisive regions, the campaign said. Sanders recently concluded his ""Bernie Beats Trump"" tour of Iowa counties that backed Obama twice before turning to Trump three years ago.

Sanders raised $18.2 million from more than a half-million donors during the first 41 days of his campaign, nearly $6 million of it coming in on the day he entered the race. His pace slowed in the second quarter, which concluded at the end of June, but still brought in another $18 million

Polling slowdown

The impressive Sanders fundraising total comes on the heels of polling that suggests his campaign is stuck in neutral, as progressive rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren steadily gains ground on former Vice President Joe Biden. Shakir told CNN last week that the campaign was prepared to refocus its efforts to Iowa and New Hampshire, where Sanders has shown signs of fading.

Despite the acknowledgment of a strategy shift, Shakir made it clear that Sanders' travels across the country, and the campaign's investment in resources beyond the early states, were key to his ability to keep his base activated -- and giving.

""We have a support network that is nationwide and is vital to our success,"" Shakir said. ""It is important that we remain engaged with them and that they continue to feel vested in our campaign."""

Bernie Sanders released a new plan on Monday to tax companies with large pay gaps between their executives and workers.

""The American people are sick and tired of corporate CEOs who now make 300 times more than their average employees, while they give themselves huge bonuses and cut back on the healthcare and pension benefits of their employees,"" the Democratic presidential candidate said of the plan. ""It is time to send a message to corporate America: If you do not end your greed and corruption, we will end it for you.""

Corporate pay disparities have come under increasing scrutiny as politicians and individual activists — including, most notably, the heiress Abigail Disney — have called out CEO pay packages at companies that rely on low-wage workers.

The income inequality tax, which comes less than a week after Sanders released a separate wealth tax plan, would penalize companies who have large disparities in compensation between their highest paid officials and median workers. The plan would raise an estimated $150 billion over the next decade, according to a Sanders campaign statement.

The tax kicks in at half a percentage point for companies who pay their chief executive -- or their highest paid employee, if it's not the CEO -- more than fifty times their median worker and caps off at 5 percentage points for companies who pay their top executive as much as five hundred times more than the median employee. This tax applies to all private and publicly held corporations with annual revenue of more than $100 million. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires companies to disclose its CEO to median work pay ratio.

Bernie Sanders wins the Democratic Party's nomination in 2020, he plans to halt all corporate donations to the party's convention next summer. This as party leaders actively court donors for millions of dollars to pay for the event scheduled to take place next July.

The pledge from Sanders is part of a multi-prong campaign finance reform package rolled out by the presidential candidate while he recovers in Burlington, Vermont, from a heart attack suffered last week during a campaign event in Nevada.

""Our grassroots-funded campaign is proving every single day that you don't need billionaires and private fundraisers to run for president,"" Sanders wrote in the press release for the plan.

""We've received more contributions from more individual contributors than any campaign in the history of American politics because we understand the basic reality that you can't take on a corrupt system if you take its money.""

The tough stance by Sanders sets the stage for a potential showdown with the Democratic National Committee and threatens to completely upend the way the made for television nominating contests are produced. The conventions, no longer a substantive deliberation by party delegates to pick a nominee, have largely become scripted coronations in glitzy sports arenas. The events, by both parties, are heavily funded by large corporations who may contribute limitlessly to the production because it falls under a soft money designation in the Federal Election code.

Elizabeth Warren raised $24.6 million over the past three months, her campaign said Friday morning, falling just short of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' massive haul.

Warren's momentum in the polls, in which she has emerged as a front-runner alongside former Vice President Joe Biden, has been mirrored by a continued rise in small dollar fundraising. She brought in only $6 million during a disappointing first quarter, then jumped to $19.1 million in the second before a breakout summer that saw her outpace Biden by more than $9 million

Earlier in the week, Sanders announced a $25.3 million third quarter total, which set the pace for the 2020 Democratic field. Warren landed just shy of that number, but is well-positioned now to expand her campaign, which has $25.7 million in cash-on-hand, according to the campaign, as the first round of caucuses and primaries approach.

Campaign manager Roger Lau, in an email to supporters, said more than 500,000 people made more than 940,000 contributions to the campaign during the third quarter. The majority of those donors -- 300,000 -- gave to Warren for the first time during that period, Lau said, for an average contribution of $26. Since she entered the race on New Year's Eve, an estimated 750,000 people have given to Warren's campaign.

Warren's impressive total underscores the power of small dollar donors in the 2020 Democratic contest. Both she and Sanders have forsworn high-dollar fundraisers, but combined, they outraised Biden, California Sen. Kamala Harris and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, all of whom have tapped wealthy donors, by $4 million this quarter: $49.9 million to $45.9 million.

368,"Gregory Krieg and Ryan Nobles, CNN",,Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday introduced a series of proposals designed to radically realign the balance of power in the American economy.,2019-10-14,CNN,Bernie Sanders wants to give workers an ownership stakes in big companies,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/14/politics/bernie-sanders-worker-ownership-plan/index.html,"The Vermont independent's agenda would guarantee workers eventually take control, through the issuance of new stock, of 20% stakes in the country's largest companies, while mandating that employees elect 45% of corporate boards of directors. The Sanders plan would also impose strict new guidelines on mega-mergers, while asking a revamped Federal Trade Commission to review deals pushed through during the Trump administration.

In an interview, Sanders -- who will make his return to the campaign trail on Tuesday at the CNN/New York Times Democratic debate in Ohio -- argued that the measures, sure to be fiercely opposed by corporate leaders and moderate political rivals, would benefit companies and workers by fostering a more engaged, loyal and productive workforce.

""If you feel that you're getting ripped off, if you feel that you're powerless, you will do in many cases as little as you possibly can to get your paycheck,"" Sanders told CNN. ""But if you're feeling good about your job, you want the company really to succeed because you prosper because your ideas are being implemented because you are treated with respect and not just being a cog in the machine.""

The plan, which the campaign touted as ""the boldest and most comprehensive corporate accountability plan in modern presidential history"" goes further than those of his 2020 Democratic primary rivals, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren . Sanders, in an interview on Sunday, made a rare direct distinction with his colleague from Massachusetts -- one that is underscored by his new push to give workers an ownership stake in their companies.

""There are differences between Elizabeth and myself,"" Sanders told ABC News . ""Elizabeth, I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I'm not.""

Warren's plan would require companies with $1 billion or more in annual revenue to empower employees to elect 40% of their boards. Sanders would up that number to 45% and lower the threshold to $100 million in revenue, while including companies with $100 million balance sheets and those that are publicly traded.

But it is the stock transfer plan that would likely have the most significant impact on the ways companies do business.

Those inside the parameters drawn up by Sanders would be required to issue new shares of stock, in increments of at least 2% per year, until the total employee ownership reaches 20%. The plan would create ""Democratic Employee Ownership Funds,"" which would be controlled by a board of trustees directly elected by workers. Stock dividends would be paid out directly from those funds.

Sanders said ""having employees directly vested in the company's success and playing a role in the decision-making process will lead to different outcomes. Outcomes that will benefit working people as opposed to stockholders driven by profit margins.""

""What you have is the motives of many of the large companies are the short-term profits and not looking long term,"" Sanders told CNN. ""If they could close on a plant today and move to China tomorrow to make a few more bucks, that is exactly what they will do. But if you have workers sitting on the board who participate in the decision-making process that is probably not the decisions that are going to be made.""

The proposal would also seek to dissuade companies from outsourcing their work overseas or automation technology. But when they do, according to the plan, the bottom-line benefits would have to be shared with employees who are dislocated by the changes.

""Champions of 'globalization' and 'automation' often claim 'everybody wins' through these practices, or that at least the gains exceed the losses,"" the plan states. ""If those claims are true, then the owners of those firms can more than afford to share their gains with the workers they displace.""

In a further effort to bolster the power of workers, and facilitate the creation of more employee-owned businesses, the Sanders plan creates a bank -- with $500 million in funds to start -- that would offer ""low-interest loans, loan guarantees, and technical assistance"" to workers who want to purchase their own businesses. That money would become available when a company is either put up for sale, shuttered or in cases when factories are closed.

Sanders plan also seeks to channel the trust-busting spirit of the early 20th century, by calling for the government to ""break up monopolies and make markets more competitive."" He would achieve that by giving added power to the FTC, which would also be charged with crafting ""bright-line"" guidelines going forward that would govern both vertical mergers, which combine companies in different sectors -- and horizontal mergers, which combine businesses operating in the same industry.

The blueprint unveiled Monday tracks with some more familiar positions, including a handful shared by most of the top tier Democratic primary candidates.

Sanders would repeal the Trump tax cuts for corporations, which would return the rate to 35% from the 21% passed by the Republican Congress in late 2017.

According to a campaign estimate, if the plan had been in place last year, tax revenue from four major corporations -- Amazon, Delta, GM and Chevron -- would have come in at nearly $9 billion.

The taxation plank of Sanders' proposal would also seek to eliminate offshore tax havens and wipe out the 20% deduction on pass-through businesses, which in theory is designed to aid smaller business owners but because of a broad interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service is often claimed by more profitable companies."

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MI) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) saw three percent support, followed by Andrew Yang (D) and Tom Steyer (D), who garnered two percent support each. The remaining candidates saw one percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.8 percent:

New Hampshire Institute of Politics Executive Director Neil Levesque highlighted the sense of “fluidity” in the race, due to the fact that “65% of Warren supporters, 72% of Biden supporters, 56% of Sanders supporters, and 73% of Buttigieg voters indicate that they expect that their choice could change between now and the primary election.”

Levesque added:

Among voters who are not firm in their choice, Warren is the 2nd choice of 26%, well ahead of Biden with 12%, Buttigieg with 11%, Sanders with 7% and Harris with 7%. This suggests that when the field begins to winnow down, Warren may in the best position to pick up other candidates’ support. However, if this turns into a two-person race, the nomination may ultimately turn on what sort of candidate Democrats want to send against Donald Trump: one that they believe would make the best president, or one that they believe has the best chance of beating him. If the former, Warren has a clear 27% to 19% advantage over Biden on the question of whom respondents think would make the best President. However, Biden is seen as the strongest nominee against Trump by 37% of voters compared to Warren with 26%. As in our April poll, Warren leads Biden among ‘extremely interested’ and ‘very liberal’ voters, at 28% – 24% and 35% – 11% respectively.

The poll spells trouble for Sanders, who has been slipping in New Hampshire, as recent polls indicate.

Reports emerged of a staffer shakeup for the Sanders campaign last month. The Sanders campaign moved presidential campaign operations state director Joe Caiazzo from New Hampshire to Massachusetts and replaced him with Shannon Jackson, who served as a senior adviser during Sanders’ 2016 presidential bid and ran his Senate reelection campaign.

While the Sanders campaign continues to reconfigure and strategize on how to win over New Hampshire as it did in 2016, the campaign reported a monstrous $25.3 million received in the third quarter, signaling that his campaign is in it for the long haul."

Bernie Sanders said Tuesday he had been ""dumb"" to ignore recent symptoms, including increased fatigue, that might have been related to the heart attack he suffered last week.",2019-10-08,CNN,Bernie Sanders: 'I was dumb' to ignore symptoms before heart attack,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/08/politics/bernie-sanders-heart-attack-symptoms/index.html,"Burlington, Vermont (CNN) Sen. Bernie Sanders said Tuesday he is prepared to change the nature of his presidential campaign after seeing a cardiologist in his hometown of Burlington, VT.

The exam served as a follow-up appointment after Sanders was hospitalized for more than two days when he suffered a heart attack last week on the campaign trail. Sanders told reporters outside of his home that he won't be able to keep up the robust schedule he and his supporters have become accustomed to during his 2016 and 2020 campaign.

""We were doing (in) some cases five or six meetings today, three or four rallies and town meetings and meeting with groups of people. I don't think I'm going to do that,"" Sanders said. ""But I certainly intend to be actively campaigning. I think we can change the nature of the campaign a bit. Make sure I have the strength to do what needs to be done.""

The admission by Sanders marks the first tangible long-term adjustment to his campaign plan going forward in the wake of the heart attack.

Later in the day, his campaign manager weighed in.

""As Bernie said, we are going to have an active campaign,"" said Faiz Shakir. ""Instead of a breakneck series of events that lap the field, we are going to keep a marathoner's pace that still manages to outrun everyone else.""

Sanders was in Nevada last week when he experienced what his campaign described the next morning as ""chest discomfort."" Sanders had two stents inserted after doctors found an arterial blockage and remained hospitalized over the next few days. On Friday, the campaign confirmed that he had suffered a heart attack. Sanders returned to Vermont this weekend and is not expected back on the campaign trail before next week's Democratic primary debate in Ohio.

While Sanders said he plans to scale things back, he gave no indication that he plans to end his bid for the White House any time soon. He did though acknowledge that his health issues may be something that voters take into account when they judge his candidacy.

""Everything that happens every day, weigh on how people feels about you, and my own view is that it's the voters who view you look at the totality of who the candidate is,"" He said. ""You look at what that candidate stands for the integrity of that candidate, the history of our candidates, I've been fighting for working families, for my entire adult life.""

""I must confess, I was dumb,"" Sanders told reporters outside his home in Burlington, Vermont. ""During this campaign, I've been doing, in some cases three or four rallies a day, running all over the state -- Iowa, New Hampshire, wherever. And yet I, in the last month of two, just was more fatigued than I usually have been.""

In his most detailed in-person comments since falling ill, Sanders expressed regret over not having sought medical attention sooner.

""I should have listened to those symptoms,"" he said. ""So if there's any message that I hope we can get out there, is that I want people to pay attention to their symptoms. And you know, when you are hurting, when you're fatigued, when you have a pain in your chest, listen to it.""

Sanders also again promised to release his full medical records.

Sanders and his campaign held an all-staff conference call on Monday afternoon. He updated his team on his recovery and discussed the next steps of the campaign, according to an aide.

The 78-year-old Vermont independent was upbeat during the discussion, the aide told CNN, and stressed that the campaign was moving forward.

""If there's anything that this event kind of tell us, it is the importance of the what our message is in this campaign,"" Sanders said, according to the aide. ""And our message is 'us, not me.' This has never been about me. It's been about millions of people, including certainly our campaign staff, working together to bring about the kind of fundamental changes this nation absolutely needs.""

Wolf, CNN",,Underpinning Elizabeth Warren's and Bernie Sanders' idea that the government should do a lot more for everyone is the fact that the government would have to take a lot more from the richest few.,2019-10-16,CNN,Democrats debate whether billionaires should exist,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/16/politics/wealth-tax-billionaires-elizabeth-warren-bernie-sanders/index.html,"(CNN) Underpinning Elizabeth Warren's and Bernie Sanders' idea that the government should do a lot more for everyone is the fact that the government would have to take a lot more from the richest few.

Their proposal for a new tax on wealth, a radical idea in a country where recent movement has been toward less taxation, got a full discussion at Tuesday's Democratic presidential debate, sponsored by CNN and The New York Times, in Westerville, Ohio.

Warren and Sanders argue that the wealthy have gotten more out of the country, so they should give more back. And income taxes, Warren says, aren't doing the job. Sanders followed her calls for a tax on wealth with one of his own.

She'd tax fortunes of more than $50 million at 2% each year and fortunes over $1 billion at 3%. She's quick to point out that the first $50 million of any fortune would be wealth tax-free, but income tax would still be due.

Sanders would place a 1% tax on fortunes over $32 million for couples ($16 million for individuals) and increase rates incrementally until the tax reached 8% on the portion of a fortune over $10 billion ($5 billion for individuals).

Where does a wealth tax come from?

Both plans owe something to the work of two French economists at UC Berkeley , Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, who are out with a new book, ""The Triumph of Injustice: How the Rich Dodge Taxes and How to Make Them Pay.""

And that sort of attitude, that the rich don't pay enough while the normal people are paying too much, has taken over the Democratic primary: It's OK for the wealthy to pay more, but not for the middle class.

Warren, for instance, was repeatedly pushed on whether many Americans would have to pay higher taxes in order to fund ""Medicare for All,"" the plan for a government-run health care system that Sanders wrote and Warren supports.

Sanders, a senator from Vermont, has admitted that taxes would go up for the middle class but has argued they would pay less overall since health care would be less expensive. Warren, however, refused to admit it Tuesday night.

""I have made clear what my principles are here. That is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hardworking middle-class families costing will go down,"" the senator from Massachusetts said instead.

When the subject later turned to her wealth tax, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas said Warren's proposal was punitive toward the wealthy.

Former Vice President Joe Biden said it would be ""demonizing wealth.""

""The way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now,"" he said.

Warren struck back at the idea that she was attacking or demonizing anything.

""I'm really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I'm punitive; look, I don't have a beef with billionaires,"" Warren said, before launching into a riff she's been perfecting for years about how the public creates wealth.

""My problem is you made a fortune in America, you had a great idea, you got out there and worked for it, good for you. But you built that fortune in America, I guarantee you built it in part using workers all of us help pay to educate,"" she said. ""You built it in part getting your goods to markets on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You built it with the help of police and firefighters all of us help pay the salaries for. You make it to the top, the top 1/10 of 1%, pitch in 2 cents so every other kid in America has a chance to make it. That's what this is about.""

Should there be billionaires?

But what's behind the idea of a wealth tax, according to the French economists, is that it would disincentivize such large fortunes. That's a large part of the point, to combat the undeniable and growing inequality that has made the US a place where the top fortunes hoard more and more of the country's wealth. Sanders has argued there should be no more billionaires, which led to an exchange Friday with Tom Steyer, himself a billionaire funding his own presidential campaign.

There would also be clear enforcement issues. The US government has never taxed wealth except when people die and their estates are taxed. It doesn't actually know how much the wealthiest families have. And inflating the size of one's wealth for the Forbes list, as President Donald Trump has been accused of doing by his former lawyer Michael Cohen , might turn into deflating wealth to further avoid the tax man.

But Warren and Sanders are certainly pushing a bold idea. The biggest problem for them is that it's impossible to see how an idea that divides Democrats would ever pass through the Senate, which is currently controlled by Republicans. But that's a larger problem with all of Warren's and Sanders' ideas.

The other ideas to combat inequality

And that leaves us with the other ideas offered to combat inequality.

Andrew Yang wants to give everyone, even the wealthy, a $1,000-per-month government paycheck , which he calls a ""freedom dividend."" He said Tuesday that a wealth tax wouldn't work. He'd prefer a value added tax like European countries have, a sort of glorified sales tax that would be paid by everyone based on how much they consume.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California, Biden and O'Rourke are pushing tax incentives that would give credits to lower-income and middle-class Americans. But while those proposals would help some Americans, they would not fundamentally alter the growing inequality in the country."

Sanders himself, who had been quiet on social media all day, tweeted late Wednesday afternoon.

""Thanks for all the well wishes. I'm feeling good.

Bernie Sanders on Thursday said he was prepared to rejoin the Democratic presidential campaign at ""full blast"" after experiencing a heart attack last week, with trips to Iowa, Nevada and New Hampshire on his post-debate itinerary.

In an interview with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Sanders described in detail the symptoms he experienced during a campaign stop in Las Vegas and, after being pressed about the gap between his diagnosis and its disclosure, insisted that he and his team had revealed the information in a responsible time frame.

""The people do have a right to know about the health of a senator, somebody who's running for president of the United States -- full disclosure,"" Sanders said, pledging again release his full medical records. ""But you know, the first concern that people had (was) to understand what was going on. Before we reveal information dribble by dribble.""

""Well, what I mean is probably next week I'm not going to do four rallies a day,"" Sanders said. ""I think I've done more rallies than any other candidate who's currently running for president of the United States. But I'm feeling great and we're going to run a vigorous campaign. We're working on our schedule right now, which is going to take us to Iowa, to Nevada, probably back to New Hampshire. We're ready to go full blast.""

Describing the heart attack itself, Sanders recalled feeling discomfort during the Las Vegas event and ""sweating profusely"" before visiting an urgent care clinic, which referred him immediately to the hospital. He traveled there by ambulance. He also again expressed regret, as he did a few days ago, about not being more sensitive to earlier symptoms.

""I should've paid more attention to some of the symptoms that were occurring. You know, when you do four rallies a day and you run all over the country, you get tired. Everybody would get tired. But I was more tired than I usually have been, had more trouble sleeping than ordinarily,"" Sanders said. ""Occasionally I'd be up there at the podium and I'd feel a little bit unsteady. You know, one time I was just lifting, literally, holding the mic up to my arm and my arm hurt. Up to my mouth and my arm hurt. I should've paid more attention to those symptoms. So I hope that people learn from my mistake.""

On Thursday, the Sanders campaign posted a pair of videos -- one featuring the candidate, direct to camera, discussing his experience and weaving into his case for ""Medicare for All.""

""So I got to tell you, that even as I sat and lied down in that hospital bed in Las Vegas, this issue of the struggle that we are engaged in just, you know, permeated my mind,"" he said. Later, he asked supporters, ""At the end of the day, if you're going to look at yourself in the mirror and you're going to say, 'look, I go around once. I have one life to live, what role do I want to play?'""

The second clip, hours later, was filmed in Sanders' backyard. It showed him swatting at pitches, batting practice-style, in front of a small backstop. The message was clear: Sanders is preparing to get back into the swing of things. His in-person return to the trail is likely to come next Tuesday, at the CNN/New York Times presidential debate in Ohio. But before then, Sanders is now planning to appear remotely, via livestream, at the United Food and Commercial Workers' forum on Sunday in Iowa.

Sanders' Thursday interview with CNN came about nine days after the 78-year-old Vermont senator experienced ""chest discomfort"" at a campaign event. Last Friday, Sanders' staff confirmed he had a myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack. Every year about 790,000 Americans have a heart attack, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

With a myocardial infarction, one of the arteries that supplies blood to the heart becomes blocked, depriving the heart of oxygenated blood. Sanders told reporters this Tuesday that he had been ""dumb"" to ignore symptoms over the ""last month or two,"" when he had been more fatigued than normal. Without oxygenated blood, the heart muscle becomes damaged. The more time that passes without blood, the greater the damage.

To correct the problem, doctors at the Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center placed two stents in Sanders' blocked artery. They noted that all the other arteries looked normal. The candidate spent two days at the hospital before heading home to recuperate at home in Burlington, Vermont.

Because this is not an open heart surgery, recovery typically takes seven to 10 days. To place the stents, doctors make a small cut in a blood vessel. Doctors thread a thin tube with a tiny balloon at the end up to the blocked artery. They then use the tool to open up the blockage so blood can flow again to the heart. The stents -- in Sanders case there were two -- remain in place to keep that artery open after the balloon is removed.

The doctors who treated him, Dr. Arturo Marchand Jr. and Dr. Arjun Gururaj said that his stay and treatment were ""uneventful with good expected progress.""

Sanders, who was speaking from Burlington, apologized again for missing Thursday night's Democratic presidential town hall on LGBTQ issues, which is being co-hosted by the Human Rights Campaign and CNN.

Asked about the pair of pending Supreme Court decisions related to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, Sanders promised, if elected, to do ""everything that's humanly possible"" to guarantee the protections at stake. He also argued that the ""intent"" of civil rights laws should be clear and include LGBTQ Americans.

""I'm very worried about the right wing in this country now using the argument of freedom of religion to force discrimination,"" Sanders said.

""We all believe in freedom of religion. We're all proud Americans, everybody has the right to practice their own religion. But we cannot now use the argument that it is my religious belief that, if you're gay, I will not sell you a cake,"" he said. ""And it worries me very much that there is a strong movement trying to bring -- under the guise of freedom of religion, racism, sexism, homophobia back into this country."""

It doesn't take much reading in between the lines to conclude this: Sanders is scaling back his campaigning to protect his health. Which makes all the sense in the world! After all, he is a 78-year-old man who just had a heart attack. Keeping up a wildly hectic campaign schedule -- speech after speech in multiple states in the course of a week or even a few days -- is hugely difficult and stressful for anyone, much less someone in his position.

But this is politics. And while Sanders' announcement makes perfect sense from a health perspective, it will only fuel questions about whether he is up to the job he is running for.

Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren .

The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents 1.4 million workers, is among the largest in the country. Over the last month or so, nearly a dozen candidates have sat down on-camera to make their cases to union voters. Nine hopefuls, including former Vice President Joe Biden, have signed a pledge promising their support on issues Teamsters members recently voted to prioritize ahead of the primary.

""I think the candidates are trying to resonate and talk about what issues are important to working people more than what they did last time (in 2016),"" Teamsters General President James P. Hoffa said in an interview. ""And I think they're doing a good job.""

Hillary Clinton finished nine percentage points ahead of President Donald Trump (51% to 42%) with union households in 2016. Democrats will hope that margin widens come 2020. Warren, Biden and Sanders have all actively sought labor support and appeared on picket lines with striking United Automobile Workers members. Sanders in particular has made labor a focal point of his campaign, and been a fixture alongside workers protesting for higher wages and a union.

To be eligible for the Teamsters' official backing, candidates -- including Trump -- must agree to a three-point pledge assuring their support for labor-friendly trade deals, federal efforts to enhance and protect collective bargaining rights, and legislative action to protect endangered pension funding. Union members can track the process on a new website launched late Thursday. The candidates are also being asked to promise official neutrality should their staffs, as a number have already done, move to unionize.

The Teamsters also announced plans to hold a candidate forum on December 7 in Iowa.

When the union chose Clinton over Trump in 2016, the announcement came in late August. Hoffa didn't specify when a choice would be made this time around, suggesting it might not come until, or after, the Democratic National Convention next summer in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The process, which is meant to more deeply engage candidates and rank-and-file union members, will culminate with Hoffa delivering a recommendation -- based in part on a survey of local leaders -- to the general executive board.

Hoffa pointed to the fluid nature of the crowded race, and the increased attention on labor issues, as reasons the Teamsters might take their time in picking a horse. So far, most major unions have been slower to jump behind a single candidate.

""This is changing so fast. You know, who would have imagined that Bernie would have a heart attack, who would imagined the controversy with regard to Biden and his son,"" Hoffa said. ""Those are unknown things. And there's always unknown things that happen in campaigns, especially when you have a long time like this.""

There are, however, already a number of clear divides among the candidates publicly vying for Teamster support. Most notable is their backing -- or opposition -- to ""Medicare for All"" single-payer health care, the signature proposal of Sanders' campaign. A number of labor leaders and some vocal union members have expressed concern over a move to Medicare for All.

Hoffa is among the skeptics.

""The Teamsters have health care for all. And I just think we have to educate (the candidates) on that issue. I can't believe they would say that we're going to give up our insurance,"" he said. ""That's something we would be very, very strong on. That's just not something that we would concede.""

Still, he spoke warmly of his and the union's relationship with all of the leading candidates -- and the efforts of union members to engage them on the trail. According to the union, Teamsters have made more than 100 contacts with candidates over the last three months, asking them 95 questions. Twenty Teamsters locals in 14 states, with a focus on the early-voting hubs, have taken active roles. Midwestern swing states like Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania will also see a burst of door-knocking, phone calls, text messaging and other digital outreach.

""I'm very heartened because I happen to know all these candidates. One way or another, over the years, we got to talk -- when Biden was vice president, Warren in the Senate. Bernie we've known for years and (New Jersey Sen. Cory) Booker we've known forever,"" Hoffa said. ""And all these people come together with a lot of experience and it's a very talented group of people."""

The ad -- titled ""Makes More Sense"" -- highlights Buttigieg's Medicare for All Who Want It health care plan, a middle-of-the-road approach that would not force people onto government health coverage but would offer a public option for people who choose to enroll. That is a key distinction between Buttigieg's plan and the sweeping overhaul that would be instituted under a full Medicare for All program.

The ad represents an escalation by the South Bend, Indiana, mayor's campaign, after he's mostly kept his Medicare for All critiques nameless and primarily focused on policy.

Buttigieg's ad uses reporters and media figures to describe the differences between the plans, including CNN political commentator Joe Lockhart saying, ""Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren believe that we have to force ourselves into Medicare for all, where private insurance is abolished.""

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who will deliver to him one of the most sought-after endorsements in progressive politics.",2019-10-19,CNN,'Bernie's Back': Sanders rallies in New York with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez by his side,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/19/politics/bernie-sanders-aoc-new-york-rally/index.html,"New York (CNN) Sen. Bernie Sanders returns to the campaign trail Saturday in New York City for a rally with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who will deliver to him one of the most sought-after endorsements in progressive politics.

Ocasio-Cortez told Sanders she would back him in a phone call while he was still in a Nevada hospital after a heart attack less than three weeks ago, aides to both confirmed, and news of her decision has been greeted as a welcome -- and validating -- shot of adrenaline inside his campaign.

The ""Bernie's Back"" rally in Queensbridge Park, just outside the border of the congressional district Ocasio-Cortez was elected to represent last November, comes days after word that she and ""Squad"" ally Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota would endorse Sanders. Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan is expected to join them soon, potentially at an event later this month in her home district.

""This is a young woman who a year ago nobody knew who she was. And in one year, in the United States Congress she has been a leader on major issue after major issue, including the Green New Deal, including issues of housing, including issues of addressing the crisis of student debt,"" the Vermont independent said. ""So she is really an inspiration to people not only in New York but all over this country and I'm very, very proud that she is now a part of our campaign.""

Sanders made his in-person return to the primary stage at Tuesday's CNN/The New York Times debate in Ohio . While Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, his fellow Senate progressive and leader in a number of recent polls, seemed to be at the center of every skirmish and the focal point of increasingly blunt attacks from the contest's centrist candidates, Sanders delivered one of his sharpest debate performances -- a showing that, at least for now, has seemed to quiet concerns over his health.

Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez have campaigned together before, during the summer of 2018, for progressive Democratic primary candidates. Saturday's rally, though, will be something entirely different -- as Ocasio-Cortez, who had publicly weighed endorsing either Sanders or Warren, commits herself to the 78-year-old's second crusade for the Democratic nomination.

Her endorsement will underscore an argument the campaign has been making for months, which contends that Sanders is uniquely positioned to forge, as his campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, described it earlier this week, ""the multiracial working class coalition we need to win.""

Ari Rabin-Havt, Sanders' chief of staff, told CNN after the debate -- just a few hours after The Washington Post first reported on the endorsement -- that Ocasio-Cortez's decision would give new fuel to the ""movement"" that Sanders hopes will sweep him into the White House.

""This isn't about Bernie Sanders. This is about us,"" Rabin-Havt said. ""And this is what these endorsements are about. These are people who want a movement for change in this country. A movement for 'Medicare for All,' a movement for a Green New Deal, a movement on these issues. And you know, when Bernie Sanders says, 'Not me, us,' I think that message resonates with members of Congress who believe strongly in a movement.""

The endorsement, Justice Democrats Executive Director Alexandra Rojas said on the eve of the New York rally, is ""significant in the sense that it shows that the Bernie campaign is important to progressives and Democratic voters.""

""I know that Justice Democrats and myself (in this role) wouldn't even exist if it hadn't been for Bernie's 2016 presidential run,"" Rojas said. ""He has a young, racially diverse, totally working-class base of support, which is the same people that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez represents. She looks so much more like the grassroots base of the Democratic Party than Chuck Schumer, than Nancy Pelosi. And I think that's why the endorsement was so important for Bernie.""

Ocasio-Cortez had indicated in previous months that she could hold off in choosing a presidential candidate to support until later in the year, or even into the primaries, which begin in February with the Iowa caucuses. But rumors that she might get involved sooner heated up after a late September visit to Burlington, Vermont, where she, Sanders and a couple of close aides met for dinner, according to a source familiar with discussions, and then again the next day for brunch.

Shakir said Tuesday night that those conversations, while they did not lead to any kind of firm commitment, were ""a very key step in the process.""

""And then we, obviously, our teams worked together on a lot of details,"" Shakir said, referencing a rollout that had begun earlier that day when the campaign began teasing the appearance of a ""special guest"" at the New York rally."

(CNN) Bernie Sanders' recent heart attack, and his announcement Tuesday that he would be changing "" the nature of the campaign a bit,"" would be the October surprise for the Democratic party -- except that it happened a year too early.

But Sanders' health scare may still upend what has already been a volatile primary season.

Indeed, commentators and strategists have already begun their dissection, on the merits, of whether Sanders should continue his campaign. But what gets lost in their noise is the essential humanity that comes with experiencing disease and illness.

Sen. Sanders underwent coronary angioplasty in Las Vegas . It is a fairly common procedure in 2019; tens of thousands of people survive heart attacks and lead productive and meaningful lives.

Still, what befell Sanders, 78, is not to be taken lightly. Questions about his readiness for office will dog his campaign when it resumes.

The more important question, however, is whether our society should have expectations of pristine health for any leader.

Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders shares a laugh as he warms up before a softball game on August 19 in Dyersville, Iowa.

What is crystal clear is that one's health should never be used as a disqualifier for making a significant contribution to society. Therefore, the suggestion that Sanders should stand down and endorse another candidate because of a health condition that many Americans live and work with is not only callous, but carries a bitter flavor of discrimination.

Indeed it scans as ableism , a shameful undercurrent that has pervaded discussions of the 2020 election, along with ageism

Such tactics have been perfected by President Donald Trump in recent years. He has not only attacked his political rivals by deriding their energy level background and appearance , but he mocked a journalist with a physical disability. If the Democratic Party, and the political establishment at large, is so quick to dismiss Sanders due to illness, it will inadvertently weaponize disease in a way that President Trump and others will be only too happy to leverage.

The fact is, this expectation of immaculate health for our political leadership is unrealistic and naïve -- an American obsession reflected in presidents' long history of sanitizing their medical conditions. For example, John F. Kennedy's treatment for Addison's disease , a potentially debilitating illness, was hushed up but did not materially affect his presidency in any way. Franklin D. Roosevelt took pains to disguise his paralysis, which nonetheless became an inspiration to differently-abled people.

Taken in a contemporary context, the discussions about physical fitness for office gather primarily around the issue of age. It is therefore important to highlight that, given significant advancements in medical technology, people today are living longer. Indeed, communities everywhere are quickly learning to adapt to the new reality: an aging population, often bringing with it disability and chronic disease, but not necessarily the diminishing ability to contribute to society

It's also important to be mindful of the dangerous erosion of compassion and empathy within society that has entered our political discourse. This has the potential to infect the way in which we perceive, discuss and approach illness.

By creating a culture in which sickness is seen as weakness or unworthiness, we will perpetuate a paradigm of marginalization. This can already be found across the country and around the world. We cannot allow this, because there is more at stake than simply next year's election.

As physicians, one of our most important roles is that of the patient advocate. Our responsibility as health care providers is to ensure that those whose voices have been stifled or suppressed are represented and amplified. But not only do we have a duty to advocate for our individual patients, we must also advocate for the health of our society. This includes identifying discrimination, naming and defining it so that we can ensure that our communities are inoculated against this corrosive attitude.

Sen. Sanders' illness will shine a spotlight on how the political establishment approaches the universality of disease. In a hyper-polarized environment, it's not hard to imagine that partisan rhetoric will eventually monopolize the analysis of what Sanders' heart disease means for 2020. As a society, we should resist the temptation to judge how this series of events -- along with the advancing age of other candidates -- affects electability.

Instead, we should endeavor to use this moment as an opportunity to reflect on our common humanity. We should focus on how the very fact that all of us experience illness should become unifying instead of dividing. Ultimately, we should challenge ourselves to have a broader discussion about health while actively creating an environment of tolerance, acceptance and inclusion."

* Late Friday afternoon, Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaign said the Vermonter was hospitalized following a heart attack in Las Vegas last week. There is no reason to believe this will derail the 78-year-old senator’s presidential campaign, though he is now at home recuperating.

* The latest Fox News poll in South Carolina shows Joe Biden with a sizable lead over his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination. The results showed the former vice president with 41%, followed by Elizabeth Warren at 12% and Bernie Sanders at 10%.

* Fox News yesterday also released its latest poll out of Wisconsin, where Biden leads Warren by a much narrower margin, 28% to 22%, with Sanders not far behind with 18%. The same survey showed each of the top contenders for the Democratic nomination leading Donald Trump in Wisconsin in hypothetical match-ups, with Biden enjoying the largest advantage (nine points) and Warren enjoying the smallest lead over the president (four points).

* The Warren presidential campaign announced late last week that it has fired its national organizing director, Rich McDaniel, after an investigation into “multiple complaints regarding inappropriate behavior.”

* As of this morning, it appears that Sen. Cory Booker and Tom Steyer have qualified to participate in the Democratic presidential primary debate in November, bringing the new total of participants to seven. In contrast, 12 candidates are slated to appear in next week’s debate.

* Biden wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post, responding to Trump’s offensive against him, and it concluded, “[T]o Trump and those who facilitate his abuses of power, and all the special interests funding his attacks against me: Please know that I’m not going anywhere. You won’t destroy me, and you won’t destroy my family. And come November 2020, I intend to beat you like a drum.”

* Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power told reporters on Friday that if Warren is elected president, Power isn’t ruling out the possibility of running for her seat.

* And in a curious tweet, later promoted by Donald Trump, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel suggested donor support is most important indicator of the president’s public standing, arguing, “Dollars are the real polls right now.”"

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has been hospitalized with serious heart problems, what had already been a bad week for former Vice President Joe Biden has just gotten even worse.

I’ll get to the why of that in a bit, but let’s first take a look at all the other bad news.

The Polls

As I have said since the beginning, the only polls I’m going to take seriously are post-Labor Day, after summer is over and people are actually paying attention to the race. It was and still is my belief that while enjoying the summer months, Democrat voters parked their votes on tried-and-true Uncle Joe but that this could change after people started to tune in.

Well, tuning in, they are, and Biden’s slide is very real and may not have yet reached bottom.

According to the Real Clear Politics poll of polls, Biden went from a double-digit national lead ten days ago to just a two-point lead today.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is climbing, is attracting the crowds, while Slow Joe falls and can hardly attract flies.

In the all-important early primary states, Biden is losing in Iowa, is only three points up in New Hampshire (Warren leads in the two most recent polls), and only two points up in Nevada. (Warren and Biden are tied in the latest poll.)

Biden’s firewall in South Carolina remains strong — he’s up by 22 points, but if he loses New Hampshire and Iowa, he will have to make history to win the Democrat nomination.

The Picture

Last month, Joe Biden told us, “I’ve never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.”

That is a flat-out lie.

This entire scandal revolves around Biden’s son Hunter, who made more than $50,000 a month — a month! — for sitting on the board of a Ukrainian oil company. The problem, of course, is that Hunter has no experience whatsoever in that field and that when Hunter scored that sweet gig, then-President Obama had put Joe Biden in charge of dealing with Ukraine.

What’s more, once a Ukrainian prosecutor began to look into Hunter’s company, Joe threatened to withhold crucial U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired — which he was.

Now, liars in the media, serial liars like Jake Tapper, are lying about this — saying the prosecutor was not looking into Hunter Biden’s company when Daddy Joe forced him out, but this very same prosecutor has signed an affidavit under penalty of perjury saying that he was.

Anyway, back to the lie…

To begin with, we know Daddy Joe spoke to Hunter about his shady, overseas business dealings because in an interview with the New Yorker, Hunter said they spoke about his shady, overseas business dealings.

But now, we have nothing less than photographic proof…

Look at this, y’all… An actual photograph of then-Vice President Joe Biden and his ne’er-do-well son out golfing with a board member of the company that hired No-Experience-Hunter.

That’s whatchoo call a clean bust.

The Pulmonary

While we all hope and pray Bernie Sanders makes a full and speedy recovery, the political reality of the matter is still the political reality of the matter.

While on the campaign trail, Bernie felt chest pains, was rushed to the hospital, and surgery was performed to implant two heart stents. Bernie is still in the hospital, his presidential campaign is suspended, as is his political advertising.

This is a serious and significant development, but not just for Bernie.

Bernie Sanders is 78-years-old.

Joe Biden will be 77 next month.

And let’s not forget that until today’s news, Bernie was by far the most robust and energetic of the two.

After all, it was Joe Biden’s eye that filled with blood on TV just a few weeks ago, and it was Joe Biden’s teeth that came loose during a national debate last month, and it has been Joe Biden taking it easy on the campaign trail, going on vacation, disappearing for days at a time, etc.

If Democrats are smart, they will remember the lesson of 2016 when an obviously frail, sickly, and weak Hillary Clinton collapsed into a van at that September 11 memorial event.

While I have always made fun of Bernie’s age, I have also always used him as an example of what a robust 78-year-old looks like, how it is possible to be virile and vibrant into your late seventies. In fact, I have used Bernie as an example to explain just how frail and old Joe Biden looks by comparison.

Nothing terrifies Democrats more than the idea of Trump’s second term, and Bernie’s health scare will probably serve as a reality check that will have them rethinking their support for these pushing-80 candidates. What they are imagining right now is what a catastrophe this would have been had Bernie won the general election.

Naturally, then, these thoughts are going to turn to Slow Joe and the fact that if this happened to Bernie, there is an even bigger chance it will happen to Joe, who was never as energetic or full of fire as Bernie.

This reality check could also hurt Warren, who is 70. If she wins the nomination, she will be 71 and the oldest presidential nominee (from either party) in history.

Sure, Warren seems spry and energetic but … so did Bernie.

Regardless, this has been a very bad week for Quid Pro Joe … and it is only Wednesday.

1. President Trump

The revelations keep coming in the impeachment inquiry into President Trump's relationship with Ukraine. Trump's former special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, yesterday released text messages exchanged with a Ukrainian aide to President Volodymyr Zelensky. The text messages, sent before the July 25 call at the center of the impeachment inquiry, provide a tangible link between the call and Trump's request that Ukraine investigate his political interests.

Trump doubled down on his actions , saying in a tweet that he has the ""absolute right"" as president to ask other countries to investigate ""corruption."" He also told reporters at the White House that China should also launch in investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden (the subjects of Trump's interest in Ukraine communications); there is no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens. Meanwhile, a satirical video about the Bidens that Trump tweeted out has been removed from Twitter after a copyright complaint . The video featured a long-running internet joke involving a song by Canadian rock band Nickelback.

2. Paris knife attack

Four people were killed yesterday in a knife attack at the Paris police headquarters . Three officers and an administrative worker were killed by a fellow staff member, a 45-year-old man who had been an employee since 2003 at the police station, which is on the same small island as Notre Dame Cathedral. The attacker was shot dead by police. Authorities don't have a motive yet, but the man's wife was taken into custody, and it's unclear if she was present at the scene. A lockdown has since been lifted in the area of the attack, but the incident has left the city shaken. French President Emmanuel Macron and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo both extended condolences, and Hidalgo says the victims will be formally honored soon.

3. Haiti

A humanitarian crisis is growing in Haiti as anti-government gatherings have shut down schools and resulted in fuel shortages and lack of safe water. Today, protesters are calling for a large gathering in the city's capital of Port-au-Prince to demand the resignation of President Jovenel Moise. Haitians have been calling for Moise to resign for several months over a long list of complaints, including soaring inflation and alleged corruption, but recent demonstrations have caused a different kind of crisis . The United Nations this week said its humanitarian efforts have been impacted by the protests, affecting access to medical care and choking off fuel and water supplies. The UN also said some schools have been closed for the past two weeks, leaving about 2 million children without access to education.

US Sen. Bernie Sanders says he's planning to leave the hospital this weekend and will be back in action in time for the next Democratic primary debate. The 78-year-old presidential contender had an unscheduled heart procedure this week after doctors discovered a blockage in one artery, and his campaign said he would be off the trail for a bit to recover. There is no word yet on when exactly Sanders will return to his busy 2020 schedule, but campaign surrogates will fan out across the country this weekend, headlining events in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. According to one aide, the mood inside Sanders' campaign headquarters is ""business as usual.""

5. Eastern Equine Encephalitis

A rare, mosquito-borne virus continues to threaten parts of the northeastern US. A fourth person has died in Michigan after contracting Eastern Equine Encephalitis, bringing the nationwide total to 11 deaths . That's an unusual uptick: On average, the country sees five to 10 cases of the virus in an entire year, and 30% of those cases are typically fatal. Connecticut's Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz has attributed the spread of the virus to climate change, citing the number of infections in nearby states and their timing so late in the year. The CDC says people in impacted areas should use insect repellant and avoid the outdoors after dark to lessen their risk.

Sanders has canceled events related to his 2020 presidential campaign as he recovers from a heart attack.

Sanders had accepted an invitation from the Human Rights Campaign Foundation to appear at the event, but has canceled events related to his 2020 presidential campaign last week after a heart attack in Nevada. His campaign told CNN that the senator will still participate at its primary debate on October 15 in Westerville, Ohio.

The October 10 event in Los Angeles will air from 7:30 p.m. to 12 a.m. ET and feature Democratic presidential candidates appearing back-to-back throughout the evening and taking questions from audience members and a CNN moderator.

The town hall, which HRC bills as the ""Power of our Pride,"" will air exclusively on the CNN television and digital platforms and coincides with the 31st anniversary of National Coming Out Day on October 11.

Bernie Sanders on how his sweeping health care plan -- which Warren has endorsed -- would be paid for.

""She's reviewing the revenue options suggested by the 2016 Bernie campaign along with other revenue options. But she will only support pay-fors that meet the principles she has laid out in multiple debates,"" a Warren campaign aide said in a statement provided to CNN.

The campaign aide also said that the total cost of Medicare for All is unknown and that estimates vary by trillions of dollars. They did not provide details on what ""other revenue options"" the campaign is studying, and declined to comment on whether Warren may eventually put out her own details on paying for Medicare for All.

A new study by the Urban Institute , released Wednesday, said that federal spending on health care would increase by roughly $34 trillion under a single-payer plan similar to Medicare for All. That's in line with earlier studies that pegged the cost at around $32 trillion.

While Sanders has not detailed how he would raise the revenue needed to pay for Medicare for All, he included a variety of options when he released his 2016 campaign proposal and his updated bill in April. Among those listed in his most recent iteration are a 4% levy on employees, exempting the first $29,000 in income for a family of four. He also suggests imposing new taxes on employers, hiking the marginal tax rate on those making above $10 million, boosting the estate tax and establishing a wealth tax.

Warren's campaign statement comes on the heels of a contentious presidential debate Tuesday night in Ohio, where Warren was asked no less than half a dozen times on stage about whether Sanders' signature health care platform would raise taxes on the middle class and how she would like to pay for it.

Every time, the Massachusetts Democrat -- standing squarely center stage as a new front-runner in the 2020 Democratic race for President -- refused to state that taxes would, in fact, go up for some Americans under her colleague's plan. Instead, she stuck to a well-rehearsed response about how costs would go up for corporations and the wealthy and come down for middle class families. She pledged that as President, she would not sign a health care bill into law unless it lowered costs for average Americans.

Sanders has also stressed that while he would impose taxes on the middle class, they would see their overall costs go down because they would no longer have to pay premiums, deductibles or co-payments when they seek care.

Warren's repeated dodges on questions about whether Medicare for All would result in higher taxes are notably out of character for the senator, whose candidacy for the White House has gained steady political momentum in large part thanks to her abundance of policy plans and a knack for explaining and advocating for those ideas clearly out on the campaign trail.

Less than four months out from the Iowa caucuses, Warren's support for Medicare for All has stood out as a rarity. Even as she has unveiled policy plans at a rapid clip since launching her campaign on New Year's Eve, on the issue of health care, Warren has chosen to hold back from releasing a proposal of her own. Instead, she has stuck to publicly backing Sanders' Medicare for All -- a bill that she co-sponsored in the Senate -- and has not said that she will release a comprehensive health care plan of her own in the 2020 race.

""I'm with Bernie,"" Warren has previously said when asked about her vision on health care.

Tuesday's debate laid bare the political risks of Warren's backing of Sanders' Medicare for All, and foreshadowed that she is likely to continue confronting questions and criticism about tax hikes that could result from Sanders' proposal.

South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg summed up Warren's predicament this way: ""Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this."" Former Vice President Joe Biden accused Warren of being ""vague.""

Minnesota Sen. Klobuchar also joined the chorus, imploring her Senate colleague to acknowledge what Sanders himself had said earlier in the evening: ""I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up.""

""At least Bernie is being honest here, saying how he's going to pay for this -- taxes are going to go up,"" Klobuchar said. ""Sorry Elizabeth, you haven't said that. We owe it to the American people to tell them where we will send the invoice.""

The grilling continued well after the debate ended. In an interview with CNN anchors and analysts later that spanned close to 20 minutes, Warren was again pressed multiple times to acknowledge that Sanders' Medicare for All plan would result in tax hikes for some American families. Once again, she stuck to her script.

""My commitment is: I will not sign a bill into law that raises costs on middle class families,"" Warren said.

There have been earlier signs that Warren and her campaign were leaving open wiggle room on Medicare for All.

At a town hall in Keene, New Hampshire, last month, Warren referred to Medicare for All as a ""framework,"" saying: ""Right now, what we've got in Medicare for All is a framework and it doesn't have the details.""

The senator's senior adviser on the campaign, Joe Rospars , echoed that sentiment in a recent podcast interview, saying that some significant details have yet to be filled in on Sanders' Medicare for All plan.

""The question of the pay-for is: There's still a lot of details still to be filled in, in terms of both Bernie's bill that's out there but also the other versions of it, other candidates have their specific plans,"" Rospars said.

A veteran of Barack Obama's presidential campaigns, Rospars also said that he believes it's the ""overall cost"" of Medicare for All that most voters are focused on.

""I think there's a kind of disingenuousness to the — well, let's talk about taxes part of it,"" he said."

Bernie Sanders on his right and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to his left, for the next presidential debate, which will also feature a new face and a returning candidate among the dozen Democrats onstage vying for their party's nomination.

The stakes are incredibly high for the candidates participating in the CNN/New York Times Democratic presidential debate on October 15, as several candidates will likely need a breakout performance to remain competitive in this crowded primary field. For businessman Tom Steyer , it will be his first presidential debate, while Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard returns to the stage after failing to qualify for the September debate.

In all, 12 Democratic hopefuls will appear on the same stage for the debate: Biden, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, Gabbard, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, Sanders, Steyer, Warren and businessman Andrew Yang.

The Democratic National Committee's fourth sanctioned primary debate will air live at 8 p.m. ET from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, a northeast suburb of the state capital, Columbus. CNN anchors Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper and New York Times national editor Marc Lacey will serve as the debate moderators.

The 12 campaigns were required to submit paperwork to the DNC Wednesday morning certifying that their respective candidate achieved the fundraising and polling thresholds required to participate in the October debate. To receive an invitation to this debate, candidates needed to attain at least 2% in four separate DNC-approved polls and receive contributions from at least 130,000 unique donors, including at least 400 donors from 20 different states.

Biden was bested in the money race last quarter by Sanders, who reported raising $25 million, and Buttigieg, who raked in $19 million.

But Biden's July to September fundraising haul is higher than the $11.6 million raised by California Sen. Kamala Harris, the $10 million raised by businessman Andrew Yang, and the $6 million brought in by New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. Author Marianne Williamson raised $3 million and Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet raised $2.1 million last quarter.

In an interview with The Daily Beast’s Marlow Stern, Robbins bemoaned how Democratic Party figures such as Super PAC leader David Brock “attack and marginalize people on the left for not falling in line” and not supporting the establishment’s preferred candidate.

“These are the people knocking on doors that could make a difference in an election, and to be marginalizing them and attacking them because they support a candidate that you don’t like, for me, is not very wise,” he said of Bernie Sanders supporters.

“I don’t understand it. I just want to say that if you want to talk about unity and stopping this movement toward fascism, you can’t be attacking people that could change things,” he continued.

Stern also pressed him about his donation in 2006 to Republican candidates such as Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, which he argued was motivated by his opposition to the Iraq War.

“Um … yeah, I think we’re all allowed to make a mistake or two. And by the way, none of them would give refunds. Honestly, there’s no … I made a mistake,” he said. “I think it had something to do with the Democratic candidates they were running against having supported the Iraq War, and I must have read an article suggesting that these people were moderates and blah blah. ”

“It is a strange blurp but … how many years ago was that?” he continued. “Thirteen years ago and we’re still talking about it? I don’t get it.”

The 60-year-old actor remains a committed supporter of Bernie Sanders’s bid to the Democratic presidential nomination, while also working on projects surrounding prison reform.

Never shy about his feelings towards Donald Trump, he last year declared without evidence at an awards ceremony that America had placed a “child abuser” in the White House, while also likening him to a “petulant, overgrown child monster.”

“Somehow we have willingly chosen to go backward to a world full of ignorance and distrust,” he said at the time. “This new revolution has to come from our hearts.”

That haul likely will land Bullock, a red state Democrat who pledged to stay in the race until the Iowa caucuses in February, on the low end of 2020 Democrats.

Bullock's campaign doubled its number of individual contributions, and the average online contribution was $24, according to the campaign.

Bullock has so far failed to gain any traction in the Democratic presidential primary. Bullock did not meet either the donor or polling thresholds set by the Democratic National Committee for the September debate and consistently polls at the bottom of the 19 Democrats running for the party's nomination."

The debate will air live exclusively on MSNBC, and will livestream on NBC News and MSNBC digital platforms and on The Washington Post's web and mobile apps, according to the DNC. The venue, format and moderators will be announced at a future date.

The candidates who have met the thresholds to qualify for the November debate so far include: Former Vice President Joe Biden, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, billionaire Tom Steyer, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and businessman Andrew Yang.

Last month, the DNC raised the polling and donor thresholds required to qualify for the November debate. Candidates will have to reach 3% in at least four DNC-approved polls of Democratic voters nationally or in one of the four early-voting states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. The change is a 1 percentage point increase over the threshold for the September and October debates. Candidates also have a new option of reaching at least 5% in two polls of the early-voting states.

Candidates hoping to qualify need contributions from at least 165,000 individuals, coming from at least 600 unique donors in 20 or more states. The deadline for qualifying polls and donations for the November debate will be November 13 at 11:59 p.m., according to the DNC.

Elizabeth Warren, said Wednesday his 2020 rival has been ""more specific and forthcoming about the number of selfies she's taken"" than about laying out details of how she'd pay for ""Medicare for All.""

""Not only is it important to have 'yes-or-no' answers to 'yes-or-no' questions at a time when people are so frustrated with Washington speak, but also there's still been no explanation for a multitrillion-dollar hole in this plan,"" the South Bend, Indiana, mayor told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""I have a lot of respect for Senator Warren, but last night she was more specific and forthcoming about the number of selfies she's taken than about how this plan is going to be funded. And that's a real problem, especially when there's a better way to deliver health care coverage to everybody.""

Buttigieg was among several Democratic presidential candidates who took aim at Warren during the fourth Democratic primary debate hosted CNN and The New York Times on Tuesday night. He has criticized Warren over her support for Medicare for All and criticized her again during the debate for not directly answering a ""yes-or-no"" question on how she would fund such a proposal.

Warren supports Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' proposed plan, which would create a national government-run health care program and eliminate the private insurance industry -- something several candidates criticized during the debate.

Buttigieg, who has fashioned himself as a centrist candidate as the Democratic Party has veered leftward, was among the Democrats onstage Tuesday night who challenged Warren, who has emerged as a front-runner in the 2020 field. The Massachusetts senator was constantly on defense throughout the debate, underscoring a marked shift in the Democratic race that has been underway for many weeks: while former Vice President Joe Biden has remained strong in the polls, the other candidates in the race clearly now see Warren as the real competition.

Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden lead the crowded Democratic primary field, with 28% and 25% support each from likely Democratic voters, according to a Monmouth University national poll out Wednesday.

Warren and Biden are followed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders with 15%, California Sen. Kamala Harris and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 5% each, and businessman Andrew Yang and author Marianne Williamson with 2%. No one else received over 1% in the poll.

Patrick Murray, Monmouth University's polling director, acknowledged that their August poll -- which found Warren, Sanders, and Biden in a three-way tie -- was an outlier compared with other polling conducted around the same time. But the new Monmouth poll confirms other recent polling suggesting a far tighter race for the Democratic nomination.

It, along with a late-September Quinnipiac University poll , is the second recent national poll to show Warren and Biden topping the field and within the margin of error of each other, and the third to show Warren in the mid- to upper-20s in support.

While eight in 10 registered Republicans and Republican-leaning independent voters say Donald Trump ought to be re-elected President in 2020, 15% said someone else should be in office.

Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday met swift criticism from her 2020 Democratic rivals after she would not explicitly state that, under the ""Medicare for All"" plan she supports, many middle class families will see a tax hike.",2019-10-16,CNN,Warren comes under fire from 2020 Democratic rivals over 'Medicare for All',https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/15/politics/warren-medicare-for-all-debate/index.html,"(CNN) Elizabeth Warren got a taste of the front-runner life during a heated debate on Tuesday in Ohio , as the moderate candidates onstage bombarded her throughout the night and, during an especially pointed exchange, assailed the Massachusetts senator over her refusal to directly explain how she would fund ""Medicare for All.""

The question during the CNN/New York Times debate that set off the onslaught was a familiar one: Would Warren raise taxes on middle class Americans to pay for a single-payer health care program? Warren's response, too, was consistent with what she's said in the past -- but didn't provide a clear answer.

""My view on this and what I have committed to is, costs will go down for hard-working middle-class families,"" Warren said, again stressing that taxes on ""the wealth and big corporations"" would fulfill the bulk of the financing before pledging that she would ""not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle class families.""

But the stage was not satisfied. And with that, a nearly three-hour storm began -- and it was Warren most often standing under the angriest clouds.

South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg , who was aggressive throughout the night, called Warren ""evasive"" and, addressing her directly, said: ""Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this."" Sen. Amy Klobuchar , who repeatedly pivoted to Warren when asked a question, also took direct aim at her Senate colleague's murky explanation.

""We owe it to the American people,"" she said, ""to tell them where we will send the invoice.""

Sen. Bernie Sanders , who has been careful not directly criticize his progressive ally, defended Medicare for All after Buttigieg zeroed in on the policy itself -- but added, as he's stated before, that taxes would go up nearly across the board in order to pay for the plan.

""As somebody who wrote the damn bill, let's be clear: Under the Medicare for All bill I wrote, premiums are gone, copayments are gone, deductibles are gone. All out-of-pocket expenses are gone,"" Sanders said, before adding, ""But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up"" mostly for the wealthy, but also for some middle class Americans.

Sanders, as he's done on the trail, argued that the implementation of Medicare for All would, despite those tax hikes, mean that most Americans would be paying significantly less overall. Warren makes the same point, but her consistent demurrals when faced with the tax question -- on the campaign trail, when it's been posed by voters at rallies, and on the debate stage -- set up Medicare for All critics for a predictable pile-on.

But the scrap over health care was only a modest preview of what was coming for Warren, who has topped the field in a number of recent polls of early-voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire. Lower-performing rivals like former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and Sen. Kamala Harris gave the debate a feeling, at times, of being a referendum on Warren.

After the debate, Warren's campaign described the incoming volleys as more evidence of the candidate's growing stature and prospects.

""Elizabeth Warren has built momentum by running a campaign of substance, identifying problems facing the country and laying out her plans for big structural change to fix them,"" communications director Kristen Orthman said. ""She took heat tonight as a result of that momentum, but she stayed focused on what's broken and how she plans to fix it with a government and an economy that works for the people.""

Former Vice President Joe Biden was more tempered than some others in his language, but he also accused Warren of being ""vague"" in her discussion of Medicare for All and, as he livened up as the debate pushed into its third hour, claimed to the be the only one the stage who had accomplished anything ""big.""

Warren answered that suggestion with a sharply confident reminder of her work in crafting and establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

""Following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people,"" Warren recalled. ""And all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, don't even try because you will never get it passed.""

Biden jumped in after Warren finished to talk about his role in seeing that it did, telling her: ""I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it, so let's get those things straight, too.""

Warren answered his aggressive claims with a deadpan: ""I am deeply grateful to President Obama,"" she said, ""who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law.""

Harris picked a more narrow line of attack, pushing Warren -- who has been critical of Facebook's ad policy, which doesn't vet candidate's claims -- to follow her lead and demand Twitter suspend President Donald Trump's account.

""Sen. Warren, I just want to say that I was surprised to hear that you did not agree with me that, on this subject of what should be the rules around corporate responsibility for these big tech companies,"" Harris said.

Warren responded by implicitly belittling the ambition of Harris' demand: ""I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter,"" she said. ""I want to push him out of the White House. That's our job.""

When Harris continued pushing, asking Warren to ""join me in saying that his Twitter account should be shut down,"" Warren turned her down with a flat ""no.""

In a Democratic primary campaign that has yet to see a candidate rewarded for explicitly attacking a particular rival, the attempts to wallop Warren are as likely to backfire as cut her down.

O'Rourke zeroed in after the wealth tax plans by Warren and Sanders became a point of contention, with businessman Andrew Yang saying the policy ""makes a lot of sense in principle,"" but questioned whether and how it would work in practice.

""Sometimes I think that Sen. Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other,"" O'Rourke said, ""instead of lifting people up and making sure this country comes together around those solutions.""

""I'm really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I'm punitive,"" Warren said. ""Look, I don't have a beef with billionaires,"" before reprising an argument that she's been making for years: that the wealthiest Americans owed a financial -- and moral -- debt to the country that helped facilitate their success.

Ultimately, it was Sen. Cory Booker who sought to pull Warren out of the barrel and tsk-tsk his rivals over both the tone and text of their criticisms.

""I have seen this script before. It didn't work in 2016 and it will be a disaster for us in 2020,"" Booker said, warning Democrats against ""tearing each other down because we have different plans."""

China has certainly been in the news. Beijing’s repression of Hong Kong continues. Last week, China reached a preliminary trade deal with the U.S. — arguably the most important economic news in weeks. And the NBA finds itself embroiled in controversy over allegedly kowtowing to Chinese repression. And yet the hosts of the debate said nothing and asked nothing about the issue.

China was mentioned — briefly — by a few candidates.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) brought up China in attacking former Vice President Joe Biden’s record on trade. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg claimed (incorrectly) that “In a place like china, the people of Hong Kong rise up for democracy and don’t get a peep of support from the president.” (President Donald Trump told the United Nations last month: “The world fully expects that the Chinese government will honor its binding treaty, made with the British and registered with the United Nations, in which China commits to protect Hong Kong’s freedom, legal system, and democratic ways of life.”)

Sen. Amy Kloubuchar claimed that Trump’s withdrawal from the Iran deal gave power to China and Russia (though his supporters would say the opposite, since China and Russia back Iran). Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX) claimed Trump offered China favorable trade terms in exchange for looking into Hunter Biden’s business dealings in the country while his father was in office.

But from the moderators: zero.

CNN seems to be ignoring news about the China trade deal. Last week, it all but ignored the news, declining to provide pool coverage of President Trump’s news conference with the Chinese vice premier from the Oval Office.

The moderators mentioned the scandal involving Hunter Biden, but only in context of Ukraine — not China.
