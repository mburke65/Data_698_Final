Research Question:
Do publications negatively portray certain candidates more than other candidates?
Introduction:
A news organization’s role in society is to gather, write and distribute key information to the masses. Depending on the new organization’s specialty, its journalists aim is to keep the public informed on foreign and domestic issues and events. Given its expansive audiences, news media organizations have long been utilized to influence public perception on important issues and help propagate many political initiatives.
Freedom of the press, the first amendment in the United States Constitution, is a key pillar in American democracy. The amendment and has played an important role in politics since its creation as its intended purpose is to help the American people make informed and educated decisions without government intervention. Thus, the role of American news organizations is to help cultivate the opinions of the American society. Given this power, a news organization plays a significant role in each election cycle based on how it covers each candidate and political party. This project aims to assess whether news organizations have abused this influence by negatively portraying certain candidates in the United States 2020 presidential primary. 
A news organization goal in the presidential primary is to create a custom tailored image for each candidate through its delivered content. The tailoring of this portrayal can be obvious like the content’s tone and verbiage to very subtle like embedded images and the frequency of coverage. 
The frequency of coverage alone can greatly affect society’s perceptions on a candidate or political party. Name recognition is cited as having a very large influence on each election and respective primary. When news coverage is mainly centered on a singular or selection of candidates, other candidates and their proposed policy changes can be virtually invisible to the American people. Being for-profit institutions, disproportionate candidate coverage may have more to do with revenue than intentional institutional bias of its journalists. Clicks, up votes, comments, re-tweets, citing and republication tends to favor the more polarizing candidates.
Catering to the partisan audience is another way a news organization can influence its readership during an election period and may affect how a news outlet portrays certain candidates and political parties. Based on a study by the Paw Institute, the perceived political slant of a news organization aligns with the political affiliation of its consumers. This facilitation of ideological bias by its consumers may influence how a story is politicalized and sensationalized by the new organization’s employed journalists. Bias can become a self-perpetuating system, sustained by both the consumers and the new organizations. During an election or primary, this partisan coverage can force a new organization to place emphasis on the candidates that are winning, losing, or posing the largest threat to the organization’s desired candidate.
The pictures that a journalist or editor uses are intentionally selected to fit the connotation of the accompanying article. Visuals can evoke feelings ranging from fear and despair to happiness and acceptance. As people tend to be more visually inclined, the reader can be influenced to feel a certain way about the highlighted issue. The inclusion of candidate visuals for articles is a tactic many news organizations use in elections and primaries to influence its consumers.
