Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (D-VT) on Thursday, saying they do not “represent the Democratic Party.”

Neil Bluhm, a billionaire casino magnate and former Obama bundler, made the comment during a ritzy fundraiser hosted on Biden’s behalf at his Chicago, Illinois home. The former vice president did not correct Bluhm, according to The Chicago Sun Times, choosing instead to deliver a standard stump speech about Americans needing to be more optimistic.

NEW: Pool report today from a @JoeBiden fundraiser revealed that Biden donor and event host, casino magnate Neil Bluhm, told donors that @BernieSanders and @ewarren “don’t represent the Democratic Party” that he supports. — Ryan Nobles (@ryanobles) September 19, 2019

Shortly after Bluhm’s comments broke on social media, the Sanders campaign responded by rebuking the billionaire donor and, in effect, Biden as well.

“Mr. Bluhm is right — the Democratic Party I represent is the party of the working class, not billionaires. That’s why we’re going to win,” the Sanders campaign said in a statement.

In a statement to @CNN in response to this report @BernieSanders said: “Mr Bluhm is right — the Democratic Party I represent is the party of the working class, not billionaires. That's why we're going to win.” https://t.co/Ti9gSCJCpi — Ryan Nobles (@ryanobles) September 19, 2019

Bluhm’s criticism and the response it triggered underscores the internal divisions plaguing the Democratic Party ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Biden, despite having one of the most left-wing platforms of any Democrat frontrunner, is considered a moderate in comparison to the rest of the field. The image stems from the triangulation Biden has done over the span of his more than 40-year political career, especially on issues important to progressives like race, financial deregulation, and criminal justice.

The former vice president has also done little to appease the increasingly powerful left-wing of his party by aligning himself with the establishment in opposition to radical proposals like Medicare for All. Even Biden’s attempts to find common ground with progressives on climate change — by calling for an outright ban on coal — has been met with derision for not going far enough.

Sanders and Warren, on the other hand, are seen as progressive firebrands pushing the Democratic Party away from the Neoliberal policies of Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and towards the more centralized economies of Northern Europe. Along those lines, Warren and Sanders have championed a series of policies — ranging from free higher education, increased Wall Street regulation, and higher taxes on the wealthy, among others — to remake the American economy.

The divergence between the former vice president and Sanders and Warren has been no clearer than on the issue of Medicare for All. Biden has consistently attacked the universal healthcare plan, which is authored by Sanders, as overly ambitious and impossible to implement. The former vice president, who is trumpeting his own healthcare proposal centered on strengthening Obamacare and providing a public health insurance option, has also lambasted the proposal’s backers for not being upfront about its costs and consequences.

“Bernie’s been very honest about it. He said you’re going to have to raise taxes on the middle class. He said it’s going to end all private insurance. I mean, he’s been straightforward about it. And he’s making his case,” Biden told CNN in July, adding other Democrats have not been as transparent.

Sanders, Warren, and their allies have responded to such criticisms by accusing Biden of parroting Republican talking points on Medicare for All.

“The charge that he’s making is exactly what the Republicans are saying,” Sanders told the New York Times in July while excoriating Biden for siding with “insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industries” on the issue.

Many, however, have noted that the battle for Medicare for All is really just a proxy battle between the establishment, which is averse to change, and the grassroots. Biden, himself, seemed to hint at this when he promised at a June fundraiser that “nothing would fundamentally change” if he was elected president."

(CNN) I've been hearing a new conversation in coffee shops and happy hours around the country. One friend makes their prediction of who will win in November 2020, and the other nods in agreement. But then the voices become hushed as the second person asks, ""But do you really think the other side will accept the results?""

We've experienced the peaceful transfer of power for 230 years, including the constitutionally messy outcomes in 1876, 1888, 2000 and, well, 2016 for that matter. No tanks rolled through the streets and no shadow governments operated from underground bunkers even when the guy with the most votes didn't end up in the White House.

So why in 2019 do so many Americans -- across party lines -- believe that if their candidate loses next year it can only be because the election was rigged?

Here's one place we can look: For the third time in his presidency, Donald Trump has an 86-point gap between what Republicans and Democrats think about him, according to the latest Gallup approval poll . Ninety-one percent of Republicans approve of his job performance to date, while only 5% of Democrats feel the same.

We are still 14 months away from Election Day. But Americans on both sides appear primed and ready to vote.

Just four years ago , only 32% of voters said they were ""extremely interested"" in the 2016 election. But this week, that same poll shows 59% are extremely interested this time around. And if you only include self-identified partisans, the number jumps into the 60s.

And with stakes this high, Democratic voters appear to be grappling with their own dilemma: vote for a candidate who best exemplifies their visceral loathing for Donald Trump or vote for the candidate who is most likely to beat him?

Current polling shows the race for the Democratic nomination is tightening between Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren. But that doesn't mean voters are picking between them.

The polls are pretty clear that Democratic and Democratic-leaning independent voters would prefer to vote for Elizabeth Warren. They think she's won every debate so far. And as the 20,000 people who showed up to her New York City rally this week can attest, she leads Biden in voter enthusiasm by double digits.

But nearly half of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters believe that Biden is best positioned to beat Trump. Barely 1 in 10 think that of Warren.

If history is any indication, there's every reason to suspect the partisan divide heading into 2020 will get worse. After all, that 86% gap just means we have 14% more to go.

All of this is a big problem for Elizabeth Warren.

As David Leonhardt noted in the New York Times this week, Warren has struggled to win blue collar workers (you remember: the ones that gave Trump his narrow wins in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania?) in her own state of Massachusetts since 2012. She underperformed even her fellow down ballot Democrats in the last election. Voters on both sides of the aisle in these swing states are tuned in and eager to vote, but Biden out performs her in a head to head with Donald Trump in Wisconsin by 9 points , for instance.

Of course, Joe Biden has his own lurking shadows. Unlike Elizabeth Warren, who has developed her following based on her progressive appeal and solid debate performances, Biden's standing with the Democratic electorate seems largely driven by fear—fear of losing again to Donald Trump. If she can assuage that fear—or if another candidate can prove more viable—Joe Biden could be looking at a swift and total collapse.

We've got a long way to go in this race, but the growing partisan divide around Donald Trump and the fear of losing to him in 2020 means electability will only grow in importance to Democratic primary voters. And that's bad news right now for every candidate whose name doesn't rhyme with Schmiden.

In interviews with the Albuquerque Journal, a handful of Hispanic voters said they backed Trump’s immigration agenda of ending illegal immigration, building a wall, and reducing legal immigration to raise U.S. wages.

“I believe in the wall,” Marcella Trujillo Melendez, a Trump supporter, told the Albuquerque Journal. “I believe in security. This is my country, and I want it to be safe.”

“The most important thing to me is that I believe he truly loves America,” Melendez continued. “I believe that he knows his job. His job is to put America first. He’s not the president of the world.”

Poll after poll has found that though Hispanic Americans continue to vote by a majority for Democrats, especially those who were born outside the U.S., they side with Trump on the key issue of immigration — that is, they want less immigration, not more, and do not believe American taxpayers should be subsidizing illegal immigration.

For example, the latest Harvard/Harris Poll found that Hispanic Americans, along with black Americans, are vastly opposed to plans put forward by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and former Vice President Joe Biden to increase overall immigration to the U.S.

When ranked, Hispanic Americans listed increasing immigration as their second most unpopular issue, which would make them less likely to vote for a presidential candidate.

On the most extreme open borders plans endorsed by many elected Democrats, such as giving illegal aliens the right to vote, Hispanic Americans opposed the initiative by a majority of 73 percent.

Even with mainstream Democrat policies like providing taxpayer-funded welfare benefits to illegal aliens, temporary foreign visa workers, and legal immigrants who have yet to obtain green cards, Hispanic Americans align themselves with Trump.

A majority of 56 percent of Hispanic Americans said they support denying green cards to legal immigrants who are found to be a burden on taxpayers because of their use of welfare. Another 65 percent of Hispanic Americans said illegal aliens should not be allowed to take welfare.

With his agenda of less immigration and increased border controls, Trump won more Hispanic Americans in the 2016 election than failed GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney did in 2012. For the first time in U.S. history, due to immigration, Hispanic Americans are set to outpace black Americans as the largest voting minority in the 2020 presidential election.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) responded to a letter on Thursday, which accused some of his supporters of making “hateful, violent and racist threats” toward people associated with the Working Families Party, which endorsed his rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).

Black leaders – including Black Lives Matter leaders, like co-founder Patrisse Cullors – signed a letter, which condemned the “hateful, violent, and racist threats” from people who identify as Sanders supporters. A draft of the letter, obtained by Splinter News, claimed that Sanders supporters have called black leaders “Uncle Tom,” “Slave,” and “Cunt.” The alleged threats followed Sanders’ loss of the WFP endorsement, according to the letter.

The letter, via Splinter, reads in part:

The WFP made a decision, with its members and supporters and staff, and there is now conflict over the substance of that decision. But let’s also be clear — the WFP is under new leadership. For the first time in its history, Maurice Mitchell, a Black man with decades of experience building movements and strengthening our democracy, alongside Nelini Stamp, a working class, woman of color and a gifted organizer with a long list of accomplishments, are now at the helm of the Party, where they should be. And apparently, some folks aren’t happy about it. These incredible leaders who led an organization to take a risk by lifting up the leadership of Black, Latinx, Asian and Pacific Islander and white communities in coalescing around a candidate with enough time to engage their communities deeply ahead of the 2020 election, are being threatened on a daily basis, by self-identified Sanders supporters, with hateful, violent and racist threats. “Uncle Tom.” “Slave.” “Cunt.” These kinds of threats have no place in our movements, and are reminiscent of the threats Black people would receive when daring to vote even though the white supremacists would try and discourage Black people from doing so. The virulent, racist attacks on these leaders are unacceptable and dangerous. What do we do when racism and sexism is present in progressive movements? What is the prospect of strengthening democracy when old habits just won’t die? Many of us, the undersigned, are no stranger to these kinds of attacks—too many of us receive threats like these ones every day because we dare to organize our people towards freedom. But if we hope to take back this democracy, if we dare to struggle for electoral justice, if we really want a world where Black lives do in fact matter, all of us must take a stand against these real and persistent threats. … We refuse to concede to white terror from the Left as well as the Right. We can argue about the differences between Sanders and Warren, but not if we can’t be distinguished from our real opposition.

The leaders continued, demanding the Sanders campaign “unequivocally denounce the racism in its ranks, and issue a public statement separating themselves from these abhorrent attacks.” They also urged Democrats across the board – both Sanders supporters and Warren supporters – to come together to “defeat one of the most serious threats to peace and justice in our lifetimes.”

“We cannot wait to make justice real amongst the resisters — our lives literally depend on each other,” the leaders added in the letter.

In a tweet on Thursday afternoon, Sanders seemingly responded to the letter’s call for swift condemnation.

“This campaign condemns racist bullying and harassment of any kind, in any space,” Sanders tweeted. “We are building a multiracial movement for justice — that’s how we win the White House”:

This campaign condemns racist bullying and harassment of any kind, in any space. We are building a multiracial movement for justice — that’s how we win the White House. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 19, 2019

National co-chair for the Sanders campaign, Nina Turner, also condemned the alleged threats outlined in the letter.

“Anyone directing racist, sexist &otherwise personally derogatory tweets/messages towards @MauriceWFP or anyone on his team @WorkingFamilies is a coward and is not in alignment w/ @BernieSanders or our collective mission,” she wrote:

The Sanders campaign signaled concern after losing the WFP endorsement to Warren, shaking up campaign staff in both New Hampshire and Iowa.

“Senator Warren strikes fear into the hearts of the robber barons who rigged the system, and offers hope to millions of working people who have been shut out of our democracy and economy,” WFP’s National Party Director Maurice Mitchell said of the Massachusetts senator following the coveted endorsement."

Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) formally announced his Senate bid on social media Saturday despite Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) endorsement of incumbent Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA).

“Big news: I’m running for US Senate,” Kennedy announced in a social media post. “This isn’t a time for waiting, for sitting on the sidelines, or for playing by rules that don’t work anymore. This is the fight of our lives, the fight of my generation — and I’m all in”:

Big news: I'm running for US Senate. This isn't a time for waiting, for sitting on the sidelines, or for playing by rules that don't work anymore.

I hope you'll join me at https://t.co/7zwvI9aujq pic.twitter.com/WVkNLwCJbg — Joe Kennedy (@joekennedy) September 21, 2019

The Massachusetts congressman told supporters last month that he was seriously considering to launch a senatorial bid against Democrat incumbent Markey, who has been endorsed by his fellow Massachusetts senator, Warren.

“Over the past few weeks I’ve begun to consider a run for the U.S. Senate. This isn’t a decision I’m approaching lightly and — to be completely candid — I wasn’t expecting to share my thoughts so soon,” Kennedy wrote in an August 26 post.

“Family is my first consideration with any big decision like this. Lauren and I have two little kids under the age of four. We’re incredibly lucky to have the support and resources that we do, but like every young family, we struggle daily to balance it all,” he continued.

“I haven’t reached a decision yet — that’s the truth,” he added. “I’m thinking about what I have to offer Massachusetts voters, what is most important in this political moment, and what kind of party Democrats need to be building for the future.”

Some speculated that Kennedy was torn due to Warren’s shining endorsement of Markey:

BREAKING: Ed Markey endorsed by Elizabeth Warren. ""We need Ed Markey in the Senate now more than ever."" — Ed Markey (@EdMarkey) August 19, 2019

However, Warren has refused to criticize her former law student. When asked about the potentially complicated situation, she said:

I endorsed Sen. Markey back in February. I couldn’t ask for a better partner in the Senate than Ed Markey. He is a good friend. Joe Kennedy is also a good friend. I have worked with him since he was a student of mine. Both he and his wife were my students. I have worked with him as a congressman. I have nothing but the highest respect for him and I have no criticism.

Despite Warren’s endorsement of Markey, Kennedy has signaled strong support for Warren’s presidential bid, telling the Boston Herald that he is “wholeheartedly behind her.”

“If I didn’t think Senator Warren was not only a great senator and would make a good president, I wouldn’t be here. I’m wholeheartedly behind her,” he said.

His formal announcement comes days after freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) signaled support for Markey, calling the 73-year-old lawmaker the “generational change we’ve been waiting for.”

“Generational change doesn’t mean ‘elect whoever is younger,’” she added, clarifying that generational change is about the “issues.”"

New: The @BernieSanders campaign announces he will join striking @UAW workers at GM's Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Plant next Wednesday. — Adam Kelsey (@adamkelsey) September 20, 2019

“Throughout the campaign, Sanders has stood on multiple picket lines with workers and has used his email and text lists to urge his supporters to stand with striking workers across the country,” his campaign stated.

“In August, he released his Workplace Democracy Plan, which would double union membership during his term and give workers unprecedented protections in the workplace,” it continued.

However, one of Sanders’ visits will occur Wednesday, days after presidential rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) visit with the striking auto workers. She is expected to join the United Auto Workers “on the picket line outside GM’s Detroit-Hamtramck plant on Sunday,” according to Reuters.

Sanders, for his part, has told GM to “end the greed, sit down with the UAW and work out an agreement that treats your workers with the respect and the dignity they deserve,” Reuters reports.

Warren and Sanders have been attempting to assert themselves as the most pro-worker candidates. Both contenders have made time for protesting workers on the campaign trail, joining food workers in a minimum wage protest at Reagan National Airport over the summer:

Warren delivered a strong pro-union message on Labor Day, declaring that unions will “rebuild the middle class.”

“Unions built the middle class—and unions will rebuild the middle class,” Warren wrote. “If we want more good American jobs, then we need stronger unions and more power in the hands of the people”:

Sanders faced a stumbling block last month after proclaiming that his Medicare for All plan would “absolutely” erase union-negotiated health benefits:

The Washington Post followed up with a piece indicating that the Sanders campaign modified positions by noting that unions would continue to hold some capacity of negotiating powers via the National Labor Relations Board. However, the Sanders campaign was livid, with members of his campaign calling the report “100 percent wrong” and “bullshit”:

This headline from the Wash Post is 100% wrong – know how I know? Medicare for All is a Senate bill with exact text and co-sponsors. The text hasn’t changed.

Nonetheless, the debate over union health benefits remains a point of contention and a political talking point frontrunner Joe Biden (D) has tried to use to his advantage:"

Mason, who works at one of the sharpest sportsbooks (perhaps with the exception of New England Patriots lines), on Thursday tweeted a screenshot of his shop’s odds and said that it is “interesting” that Yang “has the best chance of beating” Trump if Yang somehow gets his party’s nomination.

Interesting… According to the odds, @AndrewYang has the best chance of beating @realDonaldTrump. Head-to-head matchups: pic.twitter.com/7tBtkipJSv — Dave Mason (@DaveMasonBOL) September 19, 2019

Trump is the biggest underdog (+150) when matched up against Yang, and the president is actually the biggest favorite (-200) against former Vice President Joe Biden, according to Betonline’s odds. Trump is a slight underdog against Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and a potential race between Trump and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is essentially a tossup (-120).

Yang, who has called himself Trump’s “kryptonite,” has been making the case on the stump that he actually gives Democrats obsessed with ousting the president the best chance of defeating Trump because, in addition to progressives, Yang also brings in disaffected Trump voters and some libertarians into the fold as well.

As Breitbart News has noted, Trump revealed at a campaign rally that the “only thing” the president worries “about is that some total unknown that nobody’s ever heard of comes along” and gets the nomination. Yang and his allies believe Yang is that non-establishment politician who can give the Trump campaign the most trouble.

Forbes has also speculated that Yang “just might be that unknown” Trump fears because the entrepreneur “seems to be the only Democratic candidate thus far that understands the psychology of persuasion.”

After a recent Emerson New Hampshire poll found that only Biden did better against Trump in a potential general election battle in the Granite State (Yang beat Trump by eight percentage points in the poll), the hashtag “#YangBeatsTrump” trended for days.

Yang is in sixth place in polling average, but he is still well behind Biden, Sanders, and Warren in every state and national poll."

Fellow presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) not only praised the march but pointed to Amazon Employees For Climate Justice, a group of Amazon employees who say it is their “responsibility to ensure our business models don’t contribute to the climate crisis,” as a model for how large corporations can help combat so-called global warming.

“Climate change is an existential threat—and we are already facing the effects. The youth-led #ClimateStrike and the solidarity strikes from groups like @AMZNforClimate show that our country is ready to fight for the big, structural change we’ll need to tackle the climate crisis,” tweeted Warren.

Tens of thousands of people around the world skipped school Friday as part of a coordinated global strike, one of the largest environmental protests in history.

More than 2,500 strikes and other activities are planned in 156 countries for Friday and September 27th as part of the Global Climate Strike — a show of opposition toward what organizers say is government inaction in fighting climate change.

Major American cities including Washington, D.C., Boston, Seattle, Minneapolis, Miami, Los Angeles, and Denver will hold events — but the largest is expected to take place in New York City, where the United Nations Climate Action Summit is set for Monday. The high-level summit will evaluate plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris climate agreement.

An estimated 1.1 million students were allowed to skip school after the city announced they wouldn’t be penalized for missing school if they attended the strike.

The strikes are an offshoot of the Fridays for the Future movement, which was started by now-famous 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. Students worldwide participated in strikes from school every Friday to demand their governments solve the climate crisis.

Greta sailed to the United States on a racing sailboat. She and other young activists will speak at 12 p.m. EDT Friday. Thunberg is also scheduled to speak at the U.N. summit Monday.

She testified in Congress earlier this week and will lead a demonstration at New York City’s Foley Square on Friday afternoon before attending Monday’s climate summit.

“I don’t want you to listen to me. I want you to listen to the scientists and I want you to unite behind the science,” she told lawmakers Wednesday at a joint session of the House climate crisis committee and House foreign affairs subcommittee. “And then I want you to take real action.”

Booker reiterated his support for nuclear energy, which he highlighted in CNN’s special climate town hall Sep. 4, saying that the emissions-free technology was the only realistic way for the country to achieve the goals of the “Green New Deal.”

HuffPost reported:

In a wide-ranging interview with HuffPost, the Democratic presidential hopeful said he once shared progressives’ skepticism of nuclear power but became convinced that reaching net-zero emissions from the utility sector by 2030 was impossible without the source that generates more power than all forms of renewables combined. … “As much as we say the Republicans when it comes to climate change must listen to science, our party has the same obligation to listen to scientists,” Booker said. “The data speaks for itself.” … “If we had a president who was going to pull us out of nuclear, we’d be more reliant on fossil fuels,” Booker said. “It’s as simple as that.”

As Breitbart News reported, Booker told the CNN town hall that “people who think we can get” to zero emissions by 2030 “without nuclear being part of the blend just aren’t looking at the facts.”

Of the frontrunners for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, only former vice president Joe Biden has not ruled out nuclear energy. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) both reject it. Businessman Andrew Yang is the only other Democratic candidate, aside from Booker, who has fully embraced nuclear energy.

Alek Skarlatos, who was one of three Americans who stopped an attempted terrorist attack while in France, implored attendees to stand up for liberty.

“I think that socialism is leading us in the absolutely wrong direction for this country. I think that everyone in this country has a right to defend themselves. And I mean, I carry a gun on me everyday,” said Skarlatos, who served in the Army National Guard and is now running for Congress in Oregon’s 4th Congressional District.

“This next election is going to be incredibly important, to take a stand against socialism simply because the Democrats have gotten increasingly more socialist. Even if you just look at the presidential candidates, you have Beto O’Rourke saying, ‘We’re going to come take your AR-15s, your AK-47s.’ That’s something that not even Democrats — just going back to last cycle — would never admit publicly. Now we know what their true agenda is,” he said.

“It’s all about personal liberty, and not using our taxpayer dollars to pay for other people’s lives,” he argued.

“Politicians are training my generation to accept the idea of wealth distribution by saying, ‘You have a lot of debt, these evil rich people, the one percent, the millionaires and billionaires,’ as Bernie likes to say, they have all the money and we’re going to give it to you because you deserve it, you just have to give us power,” she added.

Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) was among members of the House Freedom Caucus to address the crowd.

“Free enterprise says you have the right to decide what you’re going to do with your God given talents, and you have the right, with the money that you’re able to earn, to determine how you are going to best take care of your family,” he said.

He warned that socialists were trying to take away Americans’ power by allowing non-citizens voting rights.

“Socialism is an anathema to freedom and liberty. It is an anathema to free enterprise. And it guarantees one thing — that’s economic failure and poverty,” he said.

Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ), another member of the House Freedom Caucus, spoke at the rally. “You see all the Democratic nominees for president running right now. They want to take from you, to redistribute wealth, we should never stand for that.”

Reps. Jody Hice (R-GA) and Louie Gohmert (R-TX) also addressed the crowd.

Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), noted that although the Tea Party movement does not get as much attention as it once did, it “remains strong.”

“The spirit of the Constitution lives on in our hearts. It’s made a difference in who we elect. And for many of us it makes a big difference — all the difference — in how we vote,” he said.

“Socialism, my friends, is not compatible with the U.S. Constitution. It doesn’t belong on U.S. soil, let’s keep it out,” he added.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) delivered an impassioned rebuke of Democrat candidates’ economic plans, which he said would raise taxes for Americans.

“You see them embracing positions as they gallop to the left, further and further and further left, every one of them is saying we’re going to raise your taxes. Every one of them is saying we are going to triple the price of gas at the gas pump,” he said.

“Every one of them is supporting open borders. And not only that, they’re saying we got to provide free taxpayer health care for every illegal alien in America,” he said. “You want to know what those Democrats are all about, they’re all about socialism.”

Cruz, whose father was born in Cuba, urged Americans to look at how socialism worked in other countries:

Look at Venezuela. Look at Cuba. Look at Nicaragua. Did you know that in 1950 Venezuela was the fourth wealthiest country on the face of the earth? … Today people are literally starving in the streets, they’re eating from trashcans. And what are the people’s nationalist Democrats who are running now say, ‘Let’s bring more of that here.’

Conservative host and author Mark Levin also spoke to the crowd. (Credit: Matt Perdie / Breitbart News)

“The greatest enemy poverty has ever seen in the history of humanity is the American free enterprise system,” he added.

Jennifer Zeng, who escaped socialist China and is a member of the Falun Gong, a group persecuted in China, shared a gripping story of being arrested four times in China, imprisoned in a labor camp, and tortured.

She said labor camp prisoners were forced to squat outside in the hot sun with their hands behind their head. If any fainted, they would be prodded with an electric rod so they would regain consciousness and continue squatting, she said. She said they were also forced into slave labor for products that would be exported, including to the U.S.

“I never wanted to live in any sort of socialism again. But here in the U.S. I’m starting to feel that it has followed me…the majority of young Americans are attracted by it,” she said, adding:

The [Chinese Communist Party] controls everything…it can make all the rules, it can take away people’s liberty, property, and dignity, and persecute them at will,” she said. “Socialists promise heaven on earth but always end up giving you a one-way ticket to hell.”

Mark Levin, a popular conservative personality and author, fired up the crowd towards the end of the rally.

“We are here today because we believe in one word. Liberty. Socialism is the opposite of liberty. Under socialism you surrender your heart, your soul, and your mind to Elizabeth Warren, to Bernie Sanders, and Corey Booker, and the rest of them,” he said. He continued:

When I hear them pushing their leftwing progressive agenda…telling us this country was founded in slavery, they’re very confused, they must be talking about Red China, they must be talking about the Red Soviet Union and Russia, they must be talking about modern day Iran and North Korea. Look around you, this is liberty. You’re free to move. Mobility! You’re free to speak! You’re free to start your own press enterprise! You are free people! In the vast majority of the world, people are not free, they’re starving, they don’t have a roof over their head. They have nothing and not one damn one of those countries is capitalist. That’s what the framers of the Constitution gave us — life, liberty, happiness and prosperity, and I’ll be damned if we’re going to swap Elizabeth Warren for James Madison, and I’ll be damned if we’re going to swap Bernie Sanders for George Washington, and I’ll be damned if we’re going to swap any one of them for any of our founders and framers of the Constitution.

Levin also blasted the mainstream media, arguing that they are doing more harm to a free press than the government could ever do.

“We don’t have a free press. We have a modern mass media filled with progressives and ideologues and Democrats and social activists who have done more to destroy freedom of the press more than any government to do,” he said.

“We, average Americans, we live better than any human beings lived on the planet before,” he said. “This election is a choice between … capitalism and socialism. It’s a choice between liberty and tyranny.”

“This can be lost. And in most societies it is lost. … that is left to us,” he warned. “We are here to tell the press and the Congress that we are not going anywhere.”

He finished with a message to President Trump: “Stand strong, keep in the fight, we back you. Because you stand between us and them.”

Instead of trying to cover up Harris’s obvious frustration with her position in the presidential race, her campaign decided to expand on her salty quote, with her communications director Lily Adams promoting a shirt quoting her boss:

The Harris campaign sent out a fundraising email with the subject “‘I’m f**king moving to Iowa’ – Kamala Harris,” according to the Washington Examiner.

“She cut to the chase!” the body of the email stated, according to the Examiner. “We’re doubling our organizers on the ground in Iowa and Kamala is ramping up her time on the trail there, beginning today in Cedar Rapids.”

Despite the campaign’s attempts to add an element of levity to Harris’s remarks, she confirmed to reporters that she is, in fact, torn and frustrated.

“I cannot only be in Iowa, because South Carolina is also a state that is very important, that I care about,” she said.

“Until we have campaign finance reform, I need to fundraise,” she continued. “So it can be frustrating, frankly, to have to make these decisions that feel like a trade-off, but I plan to spend as much time as I can.”

Harris’s remarks follow weeks of a downward trend in the polls, both nationally and in key primary states. An Iowa poll released Wednesday showed Harris dropping to sixth place in the Hawkeye State, having just five percent support:

(CNN) Donald Trump has every reason to be concerned about taking on former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 election, especially given that a Fox News poll released this week found him trailing Biden by a whopping 14 points if the election were held now. But Trump's greatest threat may in fact come from Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who leads Trump by six points in the poll.

Per a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll released Saturday, Warren has for the first time taken the lead among likely caucusgoers in that key first primary state, climbing seven points since June. And Warren appears poised to rise further if other Democrats drop out or falter in the race, given that the poll finds she's the top second choice among all other Democratic candidates. Twenty percent would choose Warren as a second choice while Biden and Bernie Sanders are each only the second choice of 10%

Dean Obeidallah

Biden still currently leads Warren in the Real Clear Politics average of polls on a national level by a little over ten points . But Warren has been slowly building support in a way that may not only lead her to win the nomination, but to win the White House come 2020.

Why? It's simple: Warren is increasingly exciting people about her candidacy. This is backed by a new NBC/WSJ poll released Sunday which finds that among all the 2020 Democratic candidates, she is now the top-tier candidate who the largest amount of registered voters (17%) are "" enthusiastic "" about. While that number has grown from just 8 percent in March, the percentage of voters who are enthusiastic about Trump has remained the same at 26%. Biden, however, has seen the opposite trend. In March, 17% of voters were enthusiastic about him, but now the former VP has slipped to 12%. That's not good. Enthusiasm should only be growing the more people see a candidate in debates and on the campaign trail.

True, enthusiasm is an intangible factor that can come and go, often quickly. But it's enthusiasm that inspires people to not just vote, but to get friends to vote. It's that passion that animates people to knock on doors for a candidate, make phone calls, give money and attend events."

Elizabeth Warren is challenging Joe Biden's dominance in the race for the Democratic nomination, standing at 22% to the former vice president's 20% in a new CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll of likely Iowa caucusgoers.

Warren's improved standing overall in the Iowa poll comes on the heels of a stronger showing in recent national polls and is bolstered by an increasing positive favorability rating (75% have a favorable view, the best in the field, and she is one of only four candidates who have improved their net favorability since the June CNN/DMR poll), as well as a growing percentage of likely caucusgoers who say she is either their first choice, second choice or someone they are actively considering. All told, 71% are at least considering Warren's candidacy, ahead of the next best candidate on that score by 11 points (Biden at 60%). Her supporters are also more enthusiastic than those behind Biden (32% of her backers are extremely enthusiastic vs. 22% for the former vice president).

The Massachusetts senator appears to be gaining ground primarily at the expense of Sanders. She holds the support of 32% of those who say they caucused for Sanders in 2016 (Sanders himself stands at 25% among that group), stands at 48% among those who consider themselves ""very liberal,"" and for the first time in CNN/DMR polling on the race, has edged ahead of Sanders among those under age 35 (27% back Warren, 22% Sanders).

Biden's core backers remain behind him in largely the same way they were in the previous poll. Among seniors, he is the first choice of 35%, about the same as earlier this year. And he remains above 30% support with moderate and conservative likely caucusgoers.

The freshman Democrat’s comments came after 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Sen.

Despite calls from Ocasio-Cortez and Warren, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has taken a more cautious approach, calling impeachment “a divisive approach.”

Pelosi added that Democrats should look at all the facts before deciding to move forward with impeachment proceedings.

The increase in Democrat calls for impeachment comes from an August whistleblower complaint from a U.S. intelligence official amid efforts from Democrats to learn more about Trump’s ties with Ukraine. These same Democrats are trying to get ahold of the complaint.

Trump acknowledged that he had talked with the Ukranian president about an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden while speaking with reporters on trips to Texas and Ohio on Saturday.

“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption– all of the corruption taking place– and largely the fact that we don’t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” Trump said."

That remains true today.

What I've done is gathered Iowa caucuses' polls taken closest to this point in non-incumbent nomination processes since 1980. I then ran a simple model that controlled how high the best polling candidate was and figured out how often a candidate should win given where they were polling at this point. Keep in mind, these are rough odds.

What we see is that if history holds, someone in Warren's polling position should win about 30% of the time. That means, there's something like a 70% chance someone other than Warren wins the Iowa caucuses.

Someone in Biden's polling position should win about 25% of the time.

Someone at around 10%, like Buttigieg and Sanders, have about a 10% chance of winning.

Everyone else has less than a 10% chance of winning. Even Harris, who is at 6% in our poll, has something like a 7% chance of winning.

If you add up the top 5, their cumulative chance of winning is only between 80% and 85%. That means, there's still a 15% to 20% chance that someone not in the top 5 wins Iowa.

(CNN) I've been hearing a new conversation in coffee shops and happy hours around the country. One friend makes their prediction of who will win in November 2020, and the other nods in agreement. But then the voices become hushed as the second person asks, ""But do you really think the other side will accept the results?""

We've experienced the peaceful transfer of power for 230 years, including the constitutionally messy outcomes in 1876, 1888, 2000 and, well, 2016 for that matter. No tanks rolled through the streets and no shadow governments operated from underground bunkers even when the guy with the most votes didn't end up in the White House.

So why in 2019 do so many Americans -- across party lines -- believe that if their candidate loses next year it can only be because the election was rigged?

Here's one place we can look: For the third time in his presidency, Donald Trump has an 86-point gap between what Republicans and Democrats think about him, according to the latest Gallup approval poll . Ninety-one percent of Republicans approve of his job performance to date, while only 5% of Democrats feel the same.

We are still 14 months away from Election Day. But Americans on both sides appear primed and ready to vote.

Just four years ago , only 32% of voters said they were ""extremely interested"" in the 2016 election. But this week, that same poll shows 59% are extremely interested this time around. And if you only include self-identified partisans, the number jumps into the 60s.

And with stakes this high, Democratic voters appear to be grappling with their own dilemma: vote for a candidate who best exemplifies their visceral loathing for Donald Trump or vote for the candidate who is most likely to beat him?

Current polling shows the race for the Democratic nomination is tightening between Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren. But that doesn't mean voters are picking between them.

The polls are pretty clear that Democratic and Democratic-leaning independent voters would prefer to vote for Elizabeth Warren. They think she's won every debate so far. And as the 20,000 people who showed up to her New York City rally this week can attest, she leads Biden in voter enthusiasm by double digits.

But nearly half of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters believe that Biden is best positioned to beat Trump. Barely 1 in 10 think that of Warren.

If history is any indication, there's every reason to suspect the partisan divide heading into 2020 will get worse. After all, that 86% gap just means we have 14% more to go.

All of this is a big problem for Elizabeth Warren.

As David Leonhardt noted in the New York Times this week, Warren has struggled to win blue collar workers (you remember: the ones that gave Trump his narrow wins in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania?) in her own state of Massachusetts since 2012. She underperformed even her fellow down ballot Democrats in the last election. Voters on both sides of the aisle in these swing states are tuned in and eager to vote, but Biden out performs her in a head to head with Donald Trump in Wisconsin by 9 points , for instance.

Of course, Joe Biden has his own lurking shadows. Unlike Elizabeth Warren, who has developed her following based on her progressive appeal and solid debate performances, Biden's standing with the Democratic electorate seems largely driven by fear—fear of losing again to Donald Trump. If she can assuage that fear—or if another candidate can prove more viable—Joe Biden could be looking at a swift and total collapse.

We've got a long way to go in this race, but the growing partisan divide around Donald Trump and the fear of losing to him in 2020 means electability will only grow in importance to Democratic primary voters.

Every Sunday, I will outline the 5 BIG storylines you need to know to understand the upcoming week on the campaign trail.

5. The race to make the next debate: The October 1 deadline to qualify for the fourth Democratic debate -- set for October 15 and sponsored by CNN and The New York Times -- is rapidly approaching, and with it the last chance, seemingly, for any lower-tier candidates to make the case that they shouldn't be counted out just yet. (Missing one debate is bad enough. Missing two is a political death sentence.)

At the moment, the field is at 11, with wealthy businessman Tom Steyer making the October debate after narrowly missing the September set-to. The only other candidate who appears to be on the cusp of qualification is Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who, with the CNN-Des Moines Register Iowa poll released over the weekend, now has three of the four polls that she needs showing her at 2% or higher. (Gabbard has already met the fundraising threshold with 130,000 unique donors.)

Spiritual guru Marianne Williamson has met the fundraising qualification but has only a single poll that shows her at 2%. (She didn't even rate 1% in the CNN-DMR poll .)

The largest the debate field will grow then, realistically, is 12. Which means that eight candidates currently running won't be on the debate stage for the second straight month. Which should tell them all something.

4. Can Kamala come back?: Amid a series of terrible polling results reflective of her summer struggles, California Sen. Kamala Harris is going all in on Iowa to save herself. ""We want to make sure we have a strong top three finish,"" Amid a series of terrible polling results reflective of her summer struggles, California Sen. Kamala Harris is going all in on Iowa to save herself. ""We want to make sure we have a strong top three finish,"" said her campaign manager, Juan Rodriguez.

So, will it work? Harris has her work cut out for her, according to the new CNN-Des Moines Register Iowa poll. She's at 6%, good for 5th place, at the moment but that is largely stagnant from where she's been in the state since December 2018. (She was at 5% then.)

Harris is generally well-liked in the state -- 63% favorable/24% unfavorable -- but her unfavorables have tripled since March and her favorables have only bumped up marginally (58% in March). And those who feel strongly favorable toward Harris (26%) -- usually a good measure of energy behind a candidate -- runs behind her main rivals like Elizabeth Warren (44%), Pete Buttigieg (33%), Joe Biden (29%) and Bernie Sanders (26%).

Harris does have time, as there are still 134 days before the February 3, 2020 caucuses. But she has been stuck in the same place in Iowa for months. Which means she needs a jump-start. And soon.

3. Booker over and out?: Cory Booker may be the next high-profile candidate out of the 2020 race, according to a memo from his campaign manager first reported by NBC. The memo suggested that unless the New Jersey senator can raise $1.7 million in the next 10 days, he will run out of money and be forced from the race.

The campaign insisted the move was not a fundraising ploy, but it worked either way! As of Sunday morning, Booker had raised just over $300,000 in the first 24 hours of the fundraising push. Of course, $300K -- while good! -- is not $1.7 million. And you can't just keep warning that you are going to drop out of the race unless people give you more money for the remainder of the contest. The sky can only be falling once (or maybe twice!)

""I don't believe people should stay in this just to stay in it,"" Booker said in Iowa on Saturday. ""You either have a trajectory to win or not. And right now, we don't raise $1.7 million, we won't be able to make the investments necessary.""

Booker may get his $1.7 million this time. But without significant poll improvements, it's hard to see how he can keep raising the money he is going to need to compete with the big girls and boys. He will, for sure, stay in the race until the next debate -- October 15 in Ohio and sponsored by CNN. But is there a path beyond that?

2. Elizabeth Warren, Iowa front-runner: Warren has been the hottest candidate in the 2020 race for the past few months now. And it's showing up not just in national polling but now also in the crucial state of Iowa.

The Des Moines Register/CNN/MediaCom Iowa poll released Saturday night showed Warren at 22% and at the top of the pack although followed closely by Joe Biden at 20%. No one else in the field was terribly close to the top two, with Bernie Sanders at 11% in third place and Pete Buttigieg in fourth with 9%.

While the topline numbers are good for Warren, the trend lines are even better. She gained 7 points from the June DMR/CNN poll and has almost tripled her support in the state from a December 2018 poll. Biden, meanwhile, has lost support in each of the four DMR/CNN polls between December 2018 and now. And Sanders dropped 5 points from just June until now.

Warren's favorable numbers in the poll also make clear how much energy and passion is beyond her candidacy presently. Three-quarters of those polled had a favorable view of her, including a whopping 44% who had a ""very favorable"" opinion. That compares very favorably to the 29% who view Biden very favorably and the 26% who feel that same way about Sanders.

Couple all of those data points with the fact that Warren has, by far, the best ground organization in Iowa, and you have to make her the favorite in the Hawkeye State today.

1. Trump vs. Biden vs. Ukraine: It's only September, but we're already getting a look at what a general election fight between Trump and Biden would look like. Faced with a whistleblower complaint from the intelligence community about a series of interactions between himself and the Ukrainians, Trump is trying to push the attention to Biden and his son, Hunter, vis a vis Ukraine.

Fact checkers have already debunked Trump's claims about there being something nefarious in Biden's trip to the Ukraine in 2016 and his son's work for a natural gas company in the country, and there is no evidence of wrongdoing by either. Biden has pushed back aggressively. ""Every single outlet that's looked at this said there's nothing there there,"" he told the Iowa Starting Line . ""And me, nor anyone in my family did anything inappropriate. And every major outlet has acknowledged that. I just find it very Trump-like.""

It is very ""Trump-like!"" Because, facts be damned, Trump has and will continue to use his media megaphone -- press gaggles + Twitter -- to push the idea that something was going on in Ukraine with the two Bidens. And if past is prologue, he won't stop -- no matter what fact-checkers or his advisers tell him.

On the one hand, this fight is good for Biden. Electability is his strongest argument to Democratic voters -- and the more Trump hits Biden, the more the former vice president can seek to bypass the primary and begin running the general election. On the other, it's reminder that whether Biden or some other Democrat is the nominee, we can expect Trump to say and do literally anything in pursuit of a second term."

Trump, while speaking with reporters before departing the White House for events in Texas and Ohio, continued to defend his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky , but said the 2020 Democratic presidential primary candidate was discussed in the exchange.

""We had a great conversation. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption -- all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son (adding to the corruption),"" Trump told reporters.

CNN previously reported Trump pressed Zelensky in the call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation . That call was also part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

Trump previously branded criticism of the call a ""Ukranian Witch Hunt,"" while Biden accused the President of abusing his power to ""smear"" him. On Sunday, the President said he hopes officials release details of the call, but slammed the whistleblower responsible for filing a complaint.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a strong warning later Sunday to the Trump administration, which has refused to hand over the whistleblower complaint, saying it ""will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness"" if the resistance persists.

The warning, shared in a letter to all House members, comes following a refusal last week by acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire to turn over the complaint to Congress. In her letter, Pelosi, a California Democrat, said if the administration's refusals continue, it would constitute a ""serious possible breach of constitutional duties by"" Trump and would take Congress ""into a whole new stage of investigation.""

Pelosi set a deadline for Maguire to turn over the full whistleblower complaint to the House Intelligence Committee during his scheduled appearance Thursday.

The Democratic leader's letter threatens investigation at a time when the White House is already facing House inquiries on multiple fronts and a continuing impeachment investigation by the House Judiciary Committee. The Trump administration has so far split on how to handle the details of the call, but any House-led investigation into the President's Ukraine contact could meet significant resistance from the White House, as it has stonewalled many of the congressional probes already in motion.

Pressure to impeach

Weighing in on the controversy earlier Sunday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said that impeachment ""may be the only remedy"" to Trump's refusal to make public the complaint and phone call transcript.

""If the President is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit that is providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that conduct represents,"" the California Democrat told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union,"" stopping short of calling on Congress to immediately launch proceedings.

Schiff, who has so far resisted joining other Democrats in calling for impeachment, told Tapper he has been ""very reluctant"" to push for proceedings against the President because he sees it as a ""remedy of last resort,"" but also said Sunday that the President doesn't have the authority ""to engage in underhanded discussions."" The chairman's apparent edging toward impeachment follows pressure from others in his party -- including from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- to start proceedings.

On Friday, Warren, who is vying for her party's presidential nomination, tweeted that ""Congress is complicit"" in failing to start impeachment proceedings against Trump after news broke that he had allegedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden.

Echoing Warren's sentiments, Ocasio-Cortez suggested in a tweet on Saturday that her party's ""refusal to impeach"" Trump was an even bigger scandal than what she said was the President's ""lawbreaking behavior.""

Asked by Tapper Sunday about Trump keeping conversations with foreign leaders private, Schiff said: ""Well not if those conversations involve potential corruption or criminality or leverage being used for political advantage against our nation's interest.""

""This would be, I think, the most profound violation of the presidential oath of office, certainly during this presidency, which says a lot, but perhaps during just about any presidency. There is no privilege that covers corruption. There is no privilege to engage in underhanded discussions,"" he said, adding that he's not certain that the call is the subject of the complaint.

White House split on releasing calls

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko told reporters on Saturday that he didn't think Trump had tried pressuring Zelensky during the July call, but stopped short of saying the subject of Biden's son wasn't raised.

The President on Sunday described his conversation with the Ukrainian president as ""warm and friendly"" and repeatedly urged reporters to look instead at Biden and Democrats, who he said -- without providing evidence -- have ""done some very bad things.""

But while the President suggested he was open to releasing the conversation, telling reporters: ""I hope they can put it out,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said there's no evidence such an action ""would be appropriate"" at this time.

""We don't release transcripts very often. It's the rare case,"" Pompeo said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" ""Those are private conversations between world leaders, and it wouldn't be appropriate to do so except in the most extreme circumstances. There's no, there's no evidence that would be appropriate here at this point.""

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin also weighed in, telling Tapper Sunday that he thinks releasing the transcript ""would be a terrible precedent,"" arguing that ""conversations between world leaders are meant to be confidential.""

That's a problem for Bernie Sanders.,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/22/politics/union-health-care-medicare-for-all/index.html,"(CNN) Health care benefits are really important to many union workers -- important enough to give up pay raises or even to walk off the job to keep the coverage they've negotiated.

Now the future of those benefits is at the heart of an emerging split among 2020 Democratic candidates over how to remake American health care. Former Vice President Joe Biden says union members shouldn't have to give up their employer plans if they like them, while Sen. Bernie Sanders is arguing that union workers would still come out ahead under ""Medicare for All,"" which would shift all Americans into a government-run plan.

The fight puts Sanders, a declared democratic socialist, at odds with some in the labor movement, where many union workers already have insurance with pretty good benefits. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is also seeking the nomination, is in a similar situation because of her support for both Medicare for All and organized labor.

Already, there's a growing divide among unions as to whether to back Sanders' universal coverage proposal. National Nurses United, the largest union of registered nurses, are very vocal supporters of Medicare for All. But the International Association of Fire Fighters opposes eliminating employer-based coverage

Still other unions, such as the Service Employees International Union, say they support all efforts to expand coverage to more people.

Roughly 10.5% of workers -- or 14.7 million people -- were union members in 2018, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's about half the share that were unionized 35 years earlier.

Some 95% of union workers had access to employer medical benefits in 2019, compared to 68% of non-union workers, according to the bureau's data. And they were more likely to participate in the plans, with 84% of union staffers signing up, compared to 54% of their non-union counterparts.

""Bargaining for health benefits is a distinguishing characteristic that labor unions hold out as an important variable as to why you would want to be a union member,"" said David Brenner, national director of multi-employer consulting at Segal Consulting, a leader in the field.

The quality of their health plans varies widely, experts said. Unions that cover a lot of lower-wage employees, such as custodians or nurse's aides, may have more basic benefits and have to pay more for them. But other unions, including those in the construction, auto industry and some hotel trades, have more generous policies -- with low premiums, deductibles and co-pays. A few have even set up their own health clinics for members to get care.

Many health packages are so comprehensive that unions feared getting hit with the Affordable Care Act's Cadillac tax, which would have slapped a levy on the value of employer-provided coverage above a certain threshold. Companies and unions quickly banded together to fight it, fearing they'd have to curtail workers' health benefits. The implementation date has been delayed twice, and the House recently voted to repeal the provision

The United Auto Workers, who are currently striking against General Motors, are among the unions with high-quality plans. Members pay only about 3% of the total cost of their health care, while salaried staffers have to cover about one-third, according to GM.

Until recently, the automaker had been seeking to shift more of the bill to the UAW workforce. But GM has dropped its request for major changes in the health care plan. Talks are now hung up on other issues, including pay, the use of temporary workers and a union demand to shift work from Mexico to facilities slated to close in the US.

However, GM has also stopped paying for health insurance for the striking workers, who will have to sign up for COBRA. The UAW's strike fund is picking up the cost. Sanders took the opportunity earlier this week to note that union members wouldn't have to fear losing their benefits during strikes under Medicare for All.

Medical benefits is a central component of most contract negotiations. Health care is a major expense for most companies, and they have been pushing more of the cost onto non-union employees for years. They want organized labor to contribute more too.

But union workers are willing to make sacrifices to shield their health care coverage, including curtailing raises or other benefits.

""In an awful lot of cases, workers are forgoing any increase in wages in order to keep their deductibles from going even higher,"" said Tom Leibfried, legislative representative for the AFL-CIO, a federation of 55 national and international labor unions that represent 12.5 million people.

There's also a growing trend of contract talks breaking down in part over health benefits, said Alex Colvin, dean of Cornell University's ILR School, formerly known as the School of Industrial and Labor Relations. Health coverage was among the issues in United Steelworkers' strike against National Grid in Massachusetts and the teachers' strike in West Virginia last year.

""There's a lot more labor unrest and the cost of health care is one of the drivers of that,"" Brenner said.

Health care is important to union workers for several reasons, said Shaun Richman, program director at the SUNY Empire State College's School of Labor Studies who also was a deputy director of organizing for the American Federation of Teachers.

""You can take a higher raise to the bank, but when your kid gets sick, the peace of mind of good health insurance is important,"" Richman said. Also, ""it's a badge of honor of maintaining the health insurance and not taking concessions on it.""

Recognizing that he needs unions' support, Sanders issued a Workplace Democracy plan last month that would require companies to pass along savings resulting from Medicare for All to workers in the form of raises or other benefits. Unions would be allowed to maintain their clinics and provide supplemental coverage, as long as it doesn't duplicate the benefits available under Medicare for All.

A Warren aide told CNN recently that the campaign is talking with labor leaders about how unions with negotiated health care plans will be guaranteed a chance to rework their agreements during a Medicare for All transition.

That may not be enough for some unions, though.

""There has to be a role for the hard-fought, high-quality plans that we've negotiated,"" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told Fox News earlier this month. ""If there isn't some way for us to have our plans integrated into the system, then we would have a hard time supporting it."""

“Family is my first consideration with any big decision like this. Lauren and I have two little kids under the age of four. We’re incredibly lucky to have the support and resources that we do, but like every young family, we struggle daily to balance it all,” he continued.

“I haven’t reached a decision yet — that’s the truth,” he added. “I’m thinking about what I have to offer Massachusetts voters, what is most important in this political moment, and what kind of party Democrats need to be building for the future.”

Some speculated that Kennedy was torn due to Warren’s shining endorsement of Markey:

BREAKING: Ed Markey endorsed by Elizabeth Warren. ""We need Ed Markey in the Senate now more than ever."" — Ed Markey (@EdMarkey) August 19, 2019

However, Warren has refused to criticize her former law student. When asked about the potentially complicated situation, she said:

I endorsed Sen. Markey back in February. I couldn’t ask for a better partner in the Senate than Ed Markey. He is a good friend. Joe Kennedy is also a good friend. I have worked with him since he was a student of mine. Both he and his wife were my students. I have worked with him as a congressman. I have nothing but the highest respect for him and I have no criticism.

Despite Warren’s endorsement of Markey, Kennedy has signaled strong support for Warren’s presidential bid, telling the Boston Herald that he is “wholeheartedly behind her.”

“If I didn’t think Senator Warren was not only a great senator and would make a good president, I wouldn’t be here. I’m wholeheartedly behind her,” he said.

His formal announcement comes days after freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) signaled support for Markey, calling the 73-year-old lawmaker the “generational change we’ve been waiting for.”

“Generational change doesn’t mean ‘elect whoever is younger,’” she added, clarifying that generational change is about the “issues.”"

“Throughout the campaign, Sanders has stood on multiple picket lines with workers and has used his email and text lists to urge his supporters to stand with striking workers across the country,” his campaign stated.

“In August, he released his Workplace Democracy Plan, which would double union membership during his term and give workers unprecedented protections in the workplace,” it continued.

However, one of Sanders’ visits will occur Wednesday, days after presidential rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) visit with the striking auto workers. She is expected to join the United Auto Workers “on the picket line outside GM’s Detroit-Hamtramck plant on Sunday,” according to Reuters.

Sanders, for his part, has told GM to “end the greed, sit down with the UAW and work out an agreement that treats your workers with the respect and the dignity they deserve,” Reuters reports.

Warren and Sanders have been attempting to assert themselves as the most pro-worker candidates. Both contenders have made time for protesting workers on the campaign trail, joining food workers in a minimum wage protest at Reagan National Airport over the summer:

Warren delivered a strong pro-union message on Labor Day, declaring that unions will “rebuild the middle class.”

Sanders faced a stumbling block last month after proclaiming that his Medicare for All plan would “absolutely” erase union-negotiated health benefits:

The Washington Post followed up with a piece indicating that the Sanders campaign modified positions by noting that unions would continue to hold some capacity of negotiating powers via the National Labor Relations Board. However, the Sanders campaign was livid, with members of his campaign calling the report “100 percent wrong” and “bullshit”:

Times change, and now the GM strike, which began on September 15, is just a footnote in the news. Or, actually, we should say, it was just small beer, until both Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders announced that they would visit the Michigan picket line. Maybe soon, another dozen or so Democrat presidential candidates will show up, too, along with the usual traveling circus of roving reporters, talking heads, and publicity-seeking celebrities.

Yes, times change—and they never stop changing.

Yet even if the GM strike is now firmly in the news, the fact remains that GM today is just a shadow of what it once was. It’s only the 13th-largest company in the U.S. by revenues and the 32nd-largest in the world. And if one measures GM by market capitalization—that is, the total value of its stock—it’s even further back in the pack; its market cap is $54 billion, whereas top-ranked Microsoft is worth $1.06 trillion, or 20 times as much.

For its part, the UAW, too, has shrunk dramatically; its membership has declined by nearly three-fourths over the last four decades, from 1.5 million in 1979 to 400,000 today.

By now, these sorts of statistics—the rise of tech, the decline of manufacturing, including manufacturing employment—have become familiar. Yet still, as a nation, we haven’t yet figured out how to make sure workers get a fair piece of the pie. How are people—with or without unions—going to make a living in the 21st century?

Perhaps we can gain perspective on this question by learning more about how leaders thought about jobs and economic justice in the 20th century. Yes, times and technology have changed, and yet human beings are still human beings. And as American citizens, they have political rights and legitimate needs—and these, as we shall see, have been sorely neglected in recent decades.

When Workers Were Strong—Maybe Too Strong

Let’s go back to November 21, 1945, when the UAW struck GM. That strike was a front-page big deal, with vast national repercussions. For context, we can recall that this strike came just three months after the end of World War II; in the new post-war era, both business and labor, unleashed from most wartime controls, were eager to get back to peacetime manufacturing and working.

So if GM wanted to sell more cars, its workers wanted more pay; specifically, the union wanted a 30 percent raise. GM said “no,” and the strike was on; some 320,000 employees hit the picket lines. (We might note that in those days, the GM strikers represented .56 percent of the nation’s total employment. We can pause to observe that more than half of one percent for just one firm is a lot; by comparison in 2019, the GM strike involves only 48,000 workers, or .003 percent—less than a thirtieth of one percent—of America’s employed today.)

In March 1946, four months after the labor action began, the two sides reached a settlement; GM workers got a 17.5 percent raise.

Yet the GM strike was just an overture; 1945-46 saw a nationwide wave of strikes as electrical workers, meatpackers, steel workers, oil workers, railroad engineers, theatrical craftsmen—4.3 million workers total—went off the job. That was roughly eight percent of the workforce.

Needless to say, all these strikes put a burden on the economy, as well as on the social order. In particular, in those days, as the first chill winds of the Cold War were being felt, J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI had well-founded concerns about communist influence—even outright pro-Soviet activity—within some unions. In the meantime, in addition, evidence abounded of mob influence and hooliganism within some unions.

So the challenge to the nation was serious—that is, balancing the rights of workers alongside the overall public interest in law-abiding prosperity.

This need to find the proper balance meant re-examining a key piece of legislation that had been passed in the New Deal decade of the 1930s, namely, the National Labor Relations Act, better known as the Wagner Act.

The Wagner Act was called the “Magna Carta for labor” for a reason; just as the Magna Carta (Great Charter) back in 1215 had guaranteed rights for Englishman, so, too, did the Wagner Act guarantee rights for labor, including:

The exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other mutual aid or protection.

That is, collective bargaining. Unions.

It’s interesting to recall the breadth of support for the Wagner Act at the time of its passage; back in ’35, in the middle of the Depression, majorities in both parties agreed that something had to be done to empower workers. Thus the U.S. Senate approved the measure by a vote of 63 to 12, with a dozen Republicans joining in support, while the House passed the bill without even bothering with a recorded vote. On July 5, 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed it into law, describing it “to be necessary as an act of both common justice and economic advance.”

The Wagner Act was broadly popular because it was based on an obvious point: To achieve a fair bargain, both sides in a negotiation need to have bargaining power.

To put that another way, if Big Business was the new economic reality, then labor needed to be big, too. After all, if labor wasn’t strong enough to stand up to business, then business would rule, perhaps in the manner of European fascism.

In other words, as is the risk with any one-sided regime, a lopsided power equation in favor of business could lead to tyranny. And that, in turn, could produce a backlash, some sort of violent revolt. Indeed, it’s worth recalling that in 1935, the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia was a recent memory; no right-thinking American wanted to see the red tide coming here.

So the Wagner Act was, in reality, a moderate compromise, aimed at fending off radicalism from either the right or the left. Indeed, it echoed the checks and balances written into the Constitution; the whole idea was to guarantee that business would have to bargain with labor. The economist John Kenneth Galbraith would later describe the system as the interplay of “countervailing forces”: Big Business checked by Big Labor—and vice versa.

Harry Truman Confronts the Labor Crisis

As a senator in 1935, Harry Truman had voted for the Wagner Act, and yet now, as president in 1945, he saw that the reform needed reform; labor’s Magna Carta had given the unions too free a rein—and so it was time to rein them in.

In Year of Decisions, the first volume of his memoirs, Truman wrote, “By the autumn of 1945, the labor situation was assuming serious proportions … The increasing labor difficulties of the postwar period were the subject of many discussions with the Cabinet in meetings in October and November.”

This labor unrest was ironic, because, of course, Truman and the Democrats in charge of Congress were generally pro-labor. And yet as we all have discovered, even a good thing is often in need of tinkering—and if necessary, a full overhauling.

Being the energetic man that he was, Truman took action; he invited the leaders of labor and management—including the heads of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the American Federation of Labor, and the Congress of Industrial Organizations—to meet with him in Washington to “work out a new approach to toward solving the industrial crisis.”

We might pause over those last two words, “industrial crisis.” As Truman further wrote, “The country needed a national wage policy, effective mediation machinery, and other remedial legislation which would protect the rightful interests of labor, of management, and of the public.”

Mindful of these goals, Truman began to formulate a series of reforms to the Wagner Act, such as mandatory cooling off periods and a ban on secondary strikes. He was even willing, if need to be, to send in federal troops to operate trains and mines; Truman was pro-labor, yes, but he was pro-public interest, first.

On November 5, 1945, Truman addressed the assembled leaders of business and labor in the Labor Department’s main auditorium—a bit of signaling there. Yet still, in his speech, the president spoke bluntly to both sides: “Failure to produce any workable recommendations on how to avoid work stoppages would mean legislation by Congress.” In other words, if you guys in the private sector can’t figure this out, elected officials will have to step in.

Unfortunately, the negotiations proved to be just more confrontations; even as they were sitting in the same room together, under the watchful eye of Team Truman, business and labor leaders couldn’t agree on anything important.

Indeed, to Truman’s dismay, the single most difficult figure proved to be a labor man, John L. Lewis, president of the mighty United Mine Workers. In that period, Truman summoned Lewis to the White House on no less than six occasions, warning him that “precipitous strikes” could lead the opposition congressional Republicans pushing “punitive measures against labor.” Indeed, when the mine workers defied a federal court’s back-to-work order, Truman’s Justice Department hauled Lewis himself into court, finding him guilty of civil and criminal contempt.

Beyond his exasperation with Lewis, Truman was concerned that if he and his fellow Democrats couldn’t take labor to the higher ground of constructive compromise, the Republicans would take labor to the abyss of annihilation. That is, whereas Democrats wanted to reform the Wagner Act, many Republicans, grown more militant since the ’30s, were now seeking its outright repeal.

Truman was nothing if not vivid in a letter he wrote to another labor leader on December 11, 1945: “I am going to need all the help and cooperation I can possibly get to keep labor from getting its throat slit in this Congress.” [emphasis added]

Yet in the end, Truman’s mediation efforts, valiant as they were, were not successful. The gap between Big Business and Big Labor was simply too wide to be easily or quickly bridged.

As a result, in November 1946, the opposition Republicans, surfing a wave of outrage against the antics of Lewis and other labor barons, won a smashing victory in the midterm elections. For the first time since 1930, the GOP had control of both chambers of Congress; indeed, it seemed that Truman himself would be a dead duck in the 1948 election.

The centerpiece of the Republican agenda for the 80th Congress, convening in January 1947, was braking, or even breaking, the power of labor.

Thus the Taft-Hartley Act was passed in June 1947; Truman vetoed the legislation, and his veto was overridden, with many Democrats joining in the overriding.

Yet soon after its enactment, Taft-Hartley began causing regrets. If the Wagner Act was seen as too pro-labor, Taft-Hartley was seen as too anti-labor. Seizing on this revised sentiment, and preparing for his own campaign to win a second term in the White House, Truman set about rallying labor and the party of labor, the Democrats, against the anti-labor Republicans. Prominent in the Democrat Party’s 1948 platform: “We advocate the repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act.”

Truman had gauged the shifting public sentiment correctly; the Missourian won a smashing comeback victory in 1948. In fact, not only was he victorious, but Democrats also recaptured the House and the Senate. So we can see: The “loyal opposition” in Congress had badly overplayed its hand; the country wanted the New Deal to be reformed, not repealed. (Here at Breitbart News earlier this year, I detailed Truman’s big win, considering ways in which Donald Trump could apply the same sort of anti-“loyal opposition” strategy in 2020.)

The following year, 1949, good to his word, Truman sought the repeal of Taft-Hartley. And yet he failed in his effort, largely because Southern Democrats, representing states where unions were weak, were figuring out that they could gain economically by attracting factories from the unionized North. (Taft-Hartley gave each state the option of being either a “union shop” state, or a “right to work”—that is, anti-union—state.)

Today, the “right to work” movement has spread widely; 27 states—including, amazingly enough, Michigan—have “right to work” laws on their books.

In Truman’s time, the Democrat Party was split between its Northern and Southern wings. And so, thus divided, the House of Labor started to crumble. It’s fair to say that Taft-Hartley doomed mass unionization in the U.S.

When Workers Are Weak—Labor’s Long Slide

So if we’ve seen unions when they were at their peak of optimism—critics would say arrogance—now, we can look at unions in their valley of doubt.

As we have seen, the basic idea behind labor unions is bargaining power—the power of collective bargaining.

Since the Taft-Hartley legislation of 1947, workers and their unions have always had to confront the reality that if they bargain too hard, the company can simply move to a less-expensive right-to-work state. It took a few decades before the full effect of this dynamic became obvious, but by the ’60s and ’70s, it was obvious to all.

Indeed, the percentage of private-sectors workers in unions has fallen from more than a third in the 1950s to less than seven percent today. (And free trade agreements, making it easy for companies relocate out of the U.S. altogether, have only exacerbated this trend.)

As a result, workers are in a weaker position today; they have lost their bargaining power. To be sure, there are plenty of laws on the books concerning working conditions—and plenty of trial lawyers eager to sue over some breach, real or imagined—and yet for most jobs, statutes concerning actual wages that must be paid are scant and inadequate. And that’s why there are so few strikes in the private sector; workers have learned, the hard way, that they must take what the bosses are offering.

Some Painful Numbers for Working People

Moreover, that’s why, according to the Pew Research Center, real wages (that is, adjusted for inflation) for most Americans have stagnated for the last half-century. Yes, it’s true that in many ways, the standard of living is vastly higher than it was in the 1960s, as new inventions have flooded the market, making goods both better and cheaper.

Yet still, some key variables, such as the cost of college and the cost of housing, have skyrocketed, leaving many workers today demonstrably worse off than their predecessors. And in any case, there’s nothing like a big fat paycheck.

The pro-labor Economic Policy Institute (EPI) makes a further point, focusing on the hurtful impact that ebbing bargaining power has had on workers, even as the overall economy has sailed along. According to EPI data, from 1948 to 1979, increases in wages and increases in productivity closely paralleled one another: In those three decades, productivity rose 108 percent, while compensation rose 93 percent. That wasn’t a perfect one-to-one ratio, but it was close enough. And it seemed only fair: If workers were working better, they should be sharing in the gains. And unions were there to make sure that the sharing occurred.

Yet since 1979, according to EPI, productivity and compensation have gone their separate ways: Productivity has risen 69 percent, while compensation has risen just 11 percent. To put it another way, productivity went up more than six times faster than compensation. EPI’s message is clear: In the absence of unions, the gain-sharing imperative on business was also absent.

So where did the added value of those productivity increases go, if not to workers? Short answer: Much of the added value went to corporate investors; that’s one reason why the Dow Jones average sits above 27,000. Indeed, over the last four decades, the stock market is up more than 3,200 percent; by contrast, the federal minimum wage is up 250 percent.

Furthermore, a close look at data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve provides an even more startling look at labor’s long slide. In 1947, the year Taft-Hartley passed, compensation (defined as wages and salary accruals) accounted for 49.4 percent of GDP; that is, workers got a smidge less than half of the national output. Interestingly, the workers’ share of GDP rattled around in a narrow three-point band for the next two decades, never going below 48.8 percent and peaking, in 1969, at 51.6 percent.

Yet then came that long slide in labor incomes. Taft-Hartley obviously played a role, but so, too, did other forces, such as globalization, outsourcing, and mass immigration. By 2011, during the Obama administration, worker compensation as a percentage of GDP had fallen to 42 percent; in the last seven years, it has ticked up slightly, to 43 percent.

Hmm. From 51.6 percent of GDP in 1969 to 43 percent in 2018. Over time, ordinary folks must have noticed that fall in their share of the nation’s wealth. Indeed, now we can start to see why economic populists in decades past—Dick Gephardt in the ’80s, Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan in the ’90s—found such resonance, even if they never reached the White House. It was not until Trump that anyone could put it all together, although the anger had long been smoldering.

So again, who got those shifting 8.6 percentage points of the national wealth? They went to many places, including government, private investment, and the trade deficit. And oh yes, during the same half century, corporate profits rose from about five percent of GDP to ten percent. Yes, you read that right: Much of the change in the national share going to compensation has simply been a shift from workers to corporations—workers down more than eight points and corporate profits up five points. (Of course, it’s also true that wealth to corporations is wealth to shareholders, and many workers are shareholders, either through direct investments, or indirectly, through pension funds. But still, few workers think of themselves as investors; that’s why they call themselves workers—because they can’t rely on their capital to live, and so they have to rely, instead, on their labor.)

If we step back and consider the fate of workers’ wages over the last five decades, 1969 to 2018, we see that the change has been profound; it explains, for example, why the financiers of Manhattan are so rich and the workers of Milwaukee are so hard-pressed. After all, that decline in compensation—again, from the high of 51.6 percent down to 43 percent—amounts to a decline of 8.6 percentage points. For the U.S. economy, that’s more than one dollar in 12.

To put that 8.6-point number another way, since U.S. GDP is $21.3 trillion, 8.6 percent of that is more than $1.8 trillion. So now maybe we can better see why workers have been angry for so long: They’ve been on the losing end of that long slide—in effect, a $1.8 trillion pay cut, just in 2018.

Of course, during this long slide, most Republicans have typically cheered; they might not have even realized the income shift, but they certainly noticed the partisan shift. After all, Big Labor was once the mainstay of the Democrat Party, and so the shrinking of labor has shrunk the Democrats; the party of Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson is no longer winning giant landslides in the way that the party of Franklin D. Roosevelt did in the ’30s and ’40s, or that of Lyndon Johnson did in 1964. (Of course, it’s also no longer the party of Jefferson and Jackson—or, for that matter, of FDR and LBJ.)

On the other hand, the new Democrat Party is hardly a weakling; it has won the presidency in four of the last seven elections—and won the national popular vote in six of the last seven. So while it’s true that the Democrats aren’t winning giant landslides anymore, they have proven themselves capable of winning decent-sized landslides. In 1992, for example, Bill Clinton won 370 electoral votes, and in 1996, he won 379. In 2008, Barack Obama won 365, and in 2012, he won 365. In the meantime, no Republican—including Trump—has scored more than any of those electoral-vote totals since 1988.

Moreover, in lesser elections, the Democrats are doing well enough. They boast 54 percent of seats in the House of Representatives, possess 47 percent of seats in the U.S. Senate, and hold 46 percent of governorships—and own as well nearly 100 percent of big-city mayorships.

Yet ominously for the nation, the new Democrat Party has changed: It seems that even Harry Truman-type Democrats have gone away. Truman’s old Senate seat is now held by a Republican, Josh Hawley.

Today’s Democrat Party is mostly free of the influence of industrial union halls, which were once themselves thick with American flags and military veterans.

Instead, today’s Democrats are more in the mold of either Hillary Clinton or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; that is, they are oriented toward de luxe financialism or relentless radicalism—and often embrace both views at the same time.

Indeed, as their center of gravity has shifted from union halls to university campuses, today’s Democrats are ever more likely to delve into exotic isms, going even further afield from lunch-bucket and kitchen-table concerns. (Although, of course, there are plenty of self-declared socialists in the Democrat Party today; so it’s hardly the case that economic concerns have disappeared, even if most Americans rightfully fear a Hugo Chavez-like policy agenda. Socialism, of course, makes Truman-style populism look pretty darn good.)

Still, the leftward ideological transformation of the Democrat Party might be helping the Republicans in some places—it’s getting easier to portray Democrats as “loony left”—and yet it also means that there will be hell to pay when the Democrats next win.

The Party That Works for Workers Will Win with Workers

Of course, in the short run, there’s not much to be done about these changes. What matters more for the right is getting its own house in order, and that requires a franker understanding of who, exactly, is voting Republican these days.

To that end, more Republicans might take a close look at the 2014 manifesto that helped inspire Donald Trump to run for president: Rick Santorum’s Blue Collar Conservatives: Recommitting to an America That Works.

In addition, majority-minded Republicans might study The Republican Workers Party: How the Trump Victory Drove Everyone Crazy, and Why It Was Just What We Needed, published last year by F. H. Buckley. That phrase, Republican Workers Party, is a keeper.

In this vein of Main Street Republicanism, it was heartening to see the September 17 headline in Politico: “White House intervenes in General Motors strike: The effort would effectively put the White House on the side of the United Auto Workers.” (Yes, the formal UAW structure is still strongly aligned with the Democrats, but as Breitbart News has noted, in 2017 and again in 2019, the actual auto workers are now mostly Republican—although, of course, it’s always possible to make them more Republican.)

Yet of course, if the Democrats, starting with Sanders and Warren, choose, once again, to worry about auto workers and the working class in general—and if they can demonstrate that they’re truly sincere and not just using workers for props—well, who knows what will happen in 2020, and beyond.

In addition, over the long run, if we’re feeling philosophical, we might give ourselves time to think about how America would be different today if labor unions hadn’t been so profoundly sundered by Taft-Hartley, way back in the fateful decade of the ’40s.

That is, what if the Democrats were still following practical-minded middle-of-the-roaders, such as Harry Truman? As we have seen, back in the ’40s, Truman did not succeed in saving the unions from the start of their long slide—but at least he gave it his best shot.

Harry Truman, Meet Your Senatorial Successor, Josh Hawley

And as we think back on Truman, we might also think ahead. We might look, for instance, to the man now sitting in Truman’s Senate seat, Josh Hawley. Just on September 18, in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, Hawley outlined his vision of standing up for ordinary folks: “If the conservative movement wants to have a future, it’s going to have to commit itself to being the movement of working people. If we do that, if conservatives do that, if there’s a core group that will do that, then the rest of D.C., the lobbyists, they will follow along. It’s going to have to be people-driven change.”

So what, exactly, does Hawley have in mind? How, precisely, is he going to seek to raise the standard of living in Missouri—and everywhere else? Hawley hasn’t yet fleshed out the details, but hey, let’s give him space; he’s only been in the Senate for nine months, and he’s spent most of that time on a worthy mission, namely, taking on Big Tech—and on that subject, he’s provided plenty of details.

Yet even so, he had more to say to Breitbart News, and what he said is encouraging:

We have to stay focused on the issues that actually matter to real people and have to challenge the leadership class. So, as the Democrats turn towards socialism, is that a problem? Yeah, it is, but it just goes to show you that they have no idea how to respond to the needs of working people. We can’t just reject their crazy ideas. We also have to push forward with an agenda that actually benefits what I call the “American middle,” which is the middle of our society, people that really sustain our society. So it’s going to be a pro-worker agenda, it has to get wages up, we have to get manufacturing going again, we have to get healthcare costs down, to get folks new opportunities to get skills and jobs training, break up the monopoly of higher education, and take on the monopolists in the economy and their sweetheart deals with government.

Hawley has his own ideas, and yet we can recognize some Trumanesque themes.

And Truman, let’s not forget, spent nearly eight years in the White House."

Devin Nunes (R-CA), the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, discussed the mounting controversy involving former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden and Ukraine.

Nunes told host Maria Bartiromo he saw it as the end of the elder Biden’s 2020 presidential bid.

“I mean, look, there’s a lot. Look, the left knows that Biden’s son is a problem for him,” he said. “This is why, when Hillary Clinton was running, these stories first originated — first originated back when Hillary Clinton was trying to make sure that Biden didn’t get in the race.”

“So, now that these have been resurrected, I don’t know who came up with the scheme,” Nunes continued. “Maybe there really is — this whistle-blower is not a partisan. I mean, we want to — we want to hear from that whistle-blower. But it sure looks like the scheme has backfired. And this — like I said, I think this is probably the end of Biden’s campaign.”

“End of his campaign?” Bartiromo replied.

“I really do. I don’t think — I mean, not that he’s — he’s still formidable,” Nunes answered. “He still has a bloc of support. But if you look, his lead is basically down to zero. If you look at what happened in Iowa now, it looks like Elizabeth Warren is in the lead.”

Their participation follows weeks of climate change alarmism from presidential candidates and activists across the globe. Several of the presidential hopefuls have floated limiting beef consumption – particularly, in recent weeks.

Yang told the audience at CNN’s 7-hour climate change town hall this month that “it’s good for the environment, it’s good for your health if you eat less meat.”

“I think it would be healthy on both an individual and a societal level for us to move in that direction,” he said.

Klobuchar also signaled support of reshaping dietary guidelines to reduce beef consumption, as did Harris, who said the government should find the balance between creating incentives and banning “certain behaviors.”

As Breitbart News reported:

Harris said she would support changing the government dietary guidelines and the food pyramid to reduce the amount of red meat in American diets. She also supported the idea of putting climate impact labels on food. “I’ve always believed that we should, you know, expand what’s on those cans of those things you buy in the grocery store,” she said. “We should expand the list. And included in that should be a measure of the impact on the environment.” Mayor Pete Buttigieg called for more “balance” in American meat production but was careful to say he was not in favor of abolishing the cow. He argued that government intervention like a carbon tax would encourage Americans have “more balanced diet” and a “more balanced footprint.” … O’Rourke cited a similar solution, arguing that a carbon tax would balance out the carbon emissions by the meat industry. “I think we just have to be more responsible in the way that we do it and the best way to do that is to allow the markets to respond by setting a price on carbon in every single part of our economy, every facet of American life,” he said.

In August, Sanders signaled that he would consider a “meat tax” in order to help combat climate change.

“Germany has imposed a meat tax in hopes of limiting this consumption,” a woman at a Q&A session at a town hall event in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, said.

“What are your plans to stop these large corporations from further usurping natural resources and polluting the planet?” she asked.

“Thank you for the question, and it’s a good question. All I can say is if we believe, as I do and you do, that climate change is real, we’re gonna have to tackle it in every area, including agriculture,” Sanders said.

Their participation in the Steak Fry comes one day after Friday’s global climate strike, which several of the candidates adamantly praised:

In total, about 46,000 United Auto Workers (UAW) members are on strike against GM to ensure new hires are paid higher wages and provided with better healthcare benefits after accepting concessions on these fronts a decade ago.

Last week, union workers were notified that their healthcare payments had been halted by GM because of the strike. Though GM executives have claimed that cutting off healthcare payments for union workers during a strike is standard practice, typically union workers’ healthcare plans continue but the UAW pays the costs.

This time around, though, GM’s cutting off of healthcare payments means union workers will have to re-enroll in their healthcare plans once the strike is over. In the meantime, vision and dental healthcare payments will not be covered during the strike.

In an interview with Payday Report, UAW Local 1005 Chairman Al Tiller explained how GM’s cutting off of healthcare payments for union workers led to one worker’s child going without cancer treatment.

“We’re supposed to have our benefits until the end of the month,” Tiller said. “The company decided they were going to cut them yesterday before the union was ready to take over with our strike fund. We had a couple members sick that couldn’t get treated. We got a member with … kid has cancer, went to get his treatment and couldn’t get it. So we don’t have $10,000 to put down and get reimbursed for it. We’re on strike.”

“They cut our benefits and its affecting our families, our kids,” Tiller continued. “This isn’t a company that cares about people. This is a company that cares about the dollar. And there’s another example right there. They don’t care about this kid with cancer and his treatment, they just want us to pay for it.”

In an op-ed published last week, Patrick Anderson, a 25-year GM employee, said he and his fellow American workers are striking because “we’re done sacrificing.”

Anderson wrote:

[Mary Barra] probably never experienced what my child experienced in my 25 years in the auto industry with GM. Because I have had to work in six plants in three states, my family has moved twice, and my child has changed schools and watched her father worry about what uncertainty was going to come next thanks to GM. I can’t help but think that maybe if her family had to experience what my family has gone through, then maybe she would be handling the workforce decisions differently. [Emphasis added] The fact is that when GM was down, we sacrificed. Now that GM is thriving, the company is trying to hurt us with reduced wages, cuts to health care and fewer benefits. [Emphasis added]

The strike comes as GM CEO Mary Barra idled the 78-year-old Warren Transmission plant, leaving about 335 American workers laid off from their jobs. In the long-run, analysts predict that the plant’s closure will leave 16,000 American workers laid off from their jobs in the region.

The Warren, Michigan layoffs came after 1,600 American workers were laid off in Lordstown, Ohio, where GM idled their assembly plant. That plant’s closure, alone, could leave more than 8,000 Americans in supporting industries in the area laid off.

Meanwhile, Barra continues earning about $22 million a year — a less than half a percent pay cut despite mass layoffs in the U.S. GM made more than $8 billion in profits last year after taxes.

As Breitbart News’ John Carney noted, the UAW strike against GM is just one component of growing signs that economic power is increasingly in the hands of employees rather than employers in President Trump’s “Buy American, Hire American” economy.

(CNN) Donald Trump has every reason to be concerned about taking on former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 election, especially given that a Fox News poll released this week found him trailing Biden by a whopping 14 points if the election were held now. But Trump's greatest threat may in fact come from Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who leads Trump by six points in the poll.

Per a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll released Saturday, Warren has for the first time taken the lead among likely caucusgoers in that key first primary state, climbing seven points since June. And Warren appears poised to rise further if other Democrats drop out or falter in the race, given that the poll finds she's the top second choice among all other Democratic candidates. Twenty percent would choose Warren as a second choice while Biden and Bernie Sanders are each only the second choice of 10%

Dean Obeidallah

Biden still currently leads Warren in the Real Clear Politics average of polls on a national level by a little over ten points . But Warren has been slowly building support in a way that may not only lead her to win the nomination, but to win the White House come 2020.

Why? It's simple: Warren is increasingly exciting people about her candidacy. This is backed by a new NBC/WSJ poll released Sunday which finds that among all the 2020 Democratic candidates, she is now the top-tier candidate who the largest amount of registered voters (17%) are "" enthusiastic "" about. While that number has grown from just 8 percent in March, the percentage of voters who are enthusiastic about Trump has remained the same at 26%. Biden, however, has seen the opposite trend. In March, 17% of voters were enthusiastic about him, but now the former VP has slipped to 12%. That's not good. Enthusiasm should only be growing the more people see a candidate in debates and on the campaign trail.

True, enthusiasm is an intangible factor that can come and go, often quickly. But it's enthusiasm that inspires people to not just vote, but to get friends to vote. It's that passion that animates people to knock on doors for a candidate, make phone calls, give money and attend events."

Yes, Warren tops the field in the CNN-DMR poll with 22% support, followed by former Vice President Joe Biden at 20% (the poll has a four-point margin of error, putting the two essentially in a tie). Warren and Biden are followed distantly by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at 11%.

But that doesn't tell the whole story: The topline numbers are actually the least good thing for Warren in the poll.

Consider this:

* Warren gained 7 points from the June DMR/CNN poll and has almost tripled her support in the state from a December 2018 poll. Biden, meanwhile, has lost support in each of the four DMR/CNN polls between December 2018 and now. And Sanders dropped 5 points from just June until now.

* Her favorable numbers in the poll also make clear how much energy and passion is behind her candidacy presently. Three-quarters of those polled had a favorable view of her, including a whopping 44% who had a ""very favorable"" opinion. That compares very favorably to the 29% who view Biden very favorably and the 26% who feel that same way about Sanders.

* Warren is the first or second choice of 42% of those polled. That's well in front of Biden (30% first/second combined), Sanders (21%), South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (18%) and California Sen. Kamala Harris (16%).

Any one of those three data points would suggest that this poll may have only caught the start of Warren's rise in Iowa. All three together suggest she is well positioned to take off like a rocket ship in the state. Not only does she already have a broad-base of support in the state (as evidence by the topline numbers) but she also has significant passion among those who are for her and remains well-liked -- and a possible voting option -- for those who say she is their second choice at the moment.

That's not even taking into account Warren's grassroots operation, which is widely regarded as the best -- by a lot -- of any campaign in Iowa. Wrote the Des Moines Register on Sunday:

""Elizabeth Warren's slow but steady rise in the first-in-the-nation caucus state is as much a result of her robust organizational presence here as it is a response to the Massachusetts senator's many plans and policies, Iowa experts say ... the (poll) results were not surprising, said several Iowa Democrats who have watched Warren build out a team that is widely credited with having the most sophisticated organizational presence in the state.""

Add it all up and you get this: With 133 days left before the February 3 caucuses, Warren is the clear Iowa front-runner. There's simply no one else who can make anywhere near as strong a case -- either by polling or staff or both -- as Warren in the state.

Now, OF COURSE, 133 days is a long time in politics. Things can change. If past is prologue, there will be a handful of up and downs within the top tier between now and February 3. But it's very clear from the polling trends that Iowa is now Warren's to lose."

Elizabeth Warren is challenging Joe Biden's dominance in the race for the Democratic nomination, standing at 22% to the former vice president's 20% in a new CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll of likely Iowa caucusgoers.

Warren's improved standing overall in the Iowa poll comes on the heels of a stronger showing in recent national polls and is bolstered by an increasing positive favorability rating (75% have a favorable view, the best in the field, and she is one of only four candidates who have improved their net favorability since the June CNN/DMR poll), as well as a growing percentage of likely caucusgoers who say she is either their first choice, second choice or someone they are actively considering. All told, 71% are at least considering Warren's candidacy, ahead of the next best candidate on that score by 11 points (Biden at 60%). Her supporters are also more enthusiastic than those behind Biden (32% of her backers are extremely enthusiastic vs. 22% for the former vice president).

The Massachusetts senator appears to be gaining ground primarily at the expense of Sanders. She holds the support of 32% of those who say they caucused for Sanders in 2016 (Sanders himself stands at 25% among that group), stands at 48% among those who consider themselves ""very liberal,"" and for the first time in CNN/DMR polling on the race, has edged ahead of Sanders among those under age 35 (27% back Warren, 22% Sanders).

Biden's core backers remain behind him in largely the same way they were in the previous poll. Among seniors, he is the first choice of 35%, about the same as earlier this year. And he remains above 30% support with moderate and conservative likely caucusgoers.

That remains true today.

What I've done is gathered Iowa caucuses' polls taken closest to this point in non-incumbent nomination processes since 1980. I then ran a simple model that controlled how high the best polling candidate was and figured out how often a candidate should win given where they were polling at this point. Keep in mind, these are rough odds.

What we see is that if history holds, someone in Warren's polling position should win about 30% of the time. That means, there's something like a 70% chance someone other than Warren wins the Iowa caucuses.

Someone in Biden's polling position should win about 25% of the time.

Someone at around 10%, like Buttigieg and Sanders, have about a 10% chance of winning.

Everyone else has less than a 10% chance of winning. Even Harris, who is at 6% in our poll, has something like a 7% chance of winning.

Every Sunday, I will outline the 5 BIG storylines you need to know to understand the upcoming week on the campaign trail. And they're ranked -- so the No. 1 story is the most important of the coming week.

5. The race to make the next debate: The October 1 deadline to qualify for the fourth Democratic debate -- set for October 15 and sponsored by CNN and The New York Times -- is rapidly approaching, and with it the last chance, seemingly, for any lower-tier candidates to make the case that they shouldn't be counted out just yet. (Missing one debate is bad enough. Missing two is a political death sentence.)

At the moment, the field is at 11, with wealthy businessman Tom Steyer making the October debate after narrowly missing the September set-to. The only other candidate who appears to be on the cusp of qualification is Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who, with the CNN-Des Moines Register Iowa poll released over the weekend, now has three of the four polls that she needs showing her at 2% or higher. (Gabbard has already met the fundraising threshold with 130,000 unique donors.)

Spiritual guru Marianne Williamson has met the fundraising qualification but has only a single poll that shows her at 2%. (She didn't even rate 1% in the CNN-DMR poll .)

The largest the debate field will grow then, realistically, is 12. Which means that eight candidates currently running won't be on the debate stage for the second straight month. Which should tell them all something.

4. Can Kamala come back?: Amid a series of terrible polling results reflective of her summer struggles, California Sen. Kamala Harris is going all in on Iowa to save herself. ""We want to make sure we have a strong top three finish,"" Amid a series of terrible polling results reflective of her summer struggles, California Sen. Kamala Harris is going all in on Iowa to save herself. ""We want to make sure we have a strong top three finish,"" said her campaign manager, Juan Rodriguez.

So, will it work? Harris has her work cut out for her, according to the new CNN-Des Moines Register Iowa poll. She's at 6%, good for 5th place, at the moment but that is largely stagnant from where she's been in the state since December 2018. (She was at 5% then.)

Harris is generally well-liked in the state -- 63% favorable/24% unfavorable -- but her unfavorables have tripled since March and her favorables have only bumped up marginally (58% in March). And those who feel strongly favorable toward Harris (26%) -- usually a good measure of energy behind a candidate -- runs behind her main rivals like Elizabeth Warren (44%), Pete Buttigieg (33%), Joe Biden (29%) and Bernie Sanders (26%).

Harris does have time, as there are still 134 days before the February 3, 2020 caucuses. But she has been stuck in the same place in Iowa for months. Which means she needs a jump-start. And soon.

3. Booker over and out?: Cory Booker may be the next high-profile candidate out of the 2020 race, according to a memo from his campaign manager first reported by NBC. The memo suggested that unless the New Jersey senator can raise $1.7 million in the next 10 days, he will run out of money and be forced from the race.

The campaign insisted the move was not a fundraising ploy, but it worked either way! As of Sunday morning, Booker had raised just over $300,000 in the first 24 hours of the fundraising push. Of course, $300K -- while good! -- is not $1.7 million. And you can't just keep warning that you are going to drop out of the race unless people give you more money for the remainder of the contest. The sky can only be falling once (or maybe twice!)

""I don't believe people should stay in this just to stay in it,"" Booker said in Iowa on Saturday. ""You either have a trajectory to win or not. And right now, we don't raise $1.7 million, we won't be able to make the investments necessary.""

Booker may get his $1.7 million this time. But without significant poll improvements, it's hard to see how he can keep raising the money he is going to need to compete with the big girls and boys. He will, for sure, stay in the race until the next debate -- October 15 in Ohio and sponsored by CNN. But is there a path beyond that?

2. Elizabeth Warren, Iowa front-runner: Warren has been the hottest candidate in the 2020 race for the past few months now. And it's showing up not just in national polling but now also in the crucial state of Iowa.

The Des Moines Register/CNN/MediaCom Iowa poll released Saturday night showed Warren at 22% and at the top of the pack although followed closely by Joe Biden at 20%. No one else in the field was terribly close to the top two, with Bernie Sanders at 11% in third place and Pete Buttigieg in fourth with 9%.

While the topline numbers are good for Warren, the trend lines are even better. She gained 7 points from the June DMR/CNN poll and has almost tripled her support in the state from a December 2018 poll. Biden, meanwhile, has lost support in each of the four DMR/CNN polls between December 2018 and now. And Sanders dropped 5 points from just June until now.

Warren's favorable numbers in the poll also make clear how much energy and passion is beyond her candidacy presently. Three-quarters of those polled had a favorable view of her, including a whopping 44% who had a ""very favorable"" opinion. That compares very favorably to the 29% who view Biden very favorably and the 26% who feel that same way about Sanders.

Couple all of those data points with the fact that Warren has, by far, the best ground organization in Iowa, and you have to make her the favorite in the Hawkeye State today.

1. Trump vs. Biden vs. Ukraine: It's only September, but we're already getting a look at what a general election fight between Trump and Biden would look like. Faced with a whistleblower complaint from the intelligence community about a series of interactions between himself and the Ukrainians, Trump is trying to push the attention to Biden and his son, Hunter, vis a vis Ukraine.

Fact checkers have already debunked Trump's claims about there being something nefarious in Biden's trip to the Ukraine in 2016 and his son's work for a natural gas company in the country, and there is no evidence of wrongdoing by either. Biden has pushed back aggressively. ""Every single outlet that's looked at this said there's nothing there there,"" he told the Iowa Starting Line . ""And me, nor anyone in my family did anything inappropriate. And every major outlet has acknowledged that. I just find it very Trump-like.""

It is very ""Trump-like!"" Because, facts be damned, Trump has and will continue to use his media megaphone -- press gaggles + Twitter -- to push the idea that something was going on in Ukraine with the two Bidens. And if past is prologue, he won't stop -- no matter what fact-checkers or his advisers tell him.

On the one hand, this fight is good for Biden. Electability is his strongest argument to Democratic voters -- and the more Trump hits Biden, the more the former vice president can seek to bypass the primary and begin running the general election. On the other, it's reminder that whether Biden or some other Democrat is the nominee, we can expect Trump to say and do literally anything in pursuit of a second term."

Trump, while speaking with reporters before departing the White House for events in Texas and Ohio, continued to defend his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky , but said the 2020 Democratic presidential primary candidate was discussed in the exchange.

""We had a great conversation. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption -- all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son (adding to the corruption),"" Trump told reporters.

CNN previously reported Trump pressed Zelensky in the call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation . That call was also part of a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

Trump previously branded criticism of the call a ""Ukranian Witch Hunt,"" while Biden accused the President of abusing his power to ""smear"" him. On Sunday, the President said he hopes officials release details of the call, but slammed the whistleblower responsible for filing a complaint.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a strong warning later Sunday to the Trump administration, which has refused to hand over the whistleblower complaint, saying it ""will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness"" if the resistance persists.

The warning, shared in a letter to all House members, comes following a refusal last week by acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire to turn over the complaint to Congress. In her letter, Pelosi, a California Democrat, said if the administration's refusals continue, it would constitute a ""serious possible breach of constitutional duties by"" Trump and would take Congress ""into a whole new stage of investigation.""

Pelosi set a deadline for Maguire to turn over the full whistleblower complaint to the House Intelligence Committee during his scheduled appearance Thursday.

The Democratic leader's letter threatens investigation at a time when the White House is already facing House inquiries on multiple fronts and a continuing impeachment investigation by the House Judiciary Committee. The Trump administration has so far split on how to handle the details of the call, but any House-led investigation into the President's Ukraine contact could meet significant resistance from the White House, as it has stonewalled many of the congressional probes already in motion.

Pressure to impeach

Weighing in on the controversy earlier Sunday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said that impeachment ""may be the only remedy"" to Trump's refusal to make public the complaint and phone call transcript.

""If the President is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit that is providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that conduct represents,"" the California Democrat told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union,"" stopping short of calling on Congress to immediately launch proceedings.

Schiff, who has so far resisted joining other Democrats in calling for impeachment, told Tapper he has been ""very reluctant"" to push for proceedings against the President because he sees it as a ""remedy of last resort,"" but also said Sunday that the President doesn't have the authority ""to engage in underhanded discussions."" The chairman's apparent edging toward impeachment follows pressure from others in his party -- including from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- to start proceedings.

On Friday, Warren, who is vying for her party's presidential nomination, tweeted that ""Congress is complicit"" in failing to start impeachment proceedings against Trump after news broke that he had allegedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden.

Echoing Warren's sentiments, Ocasio-Cortez suggested in a tweet on Saturday that her party's ""refusal to impeach"" Trump was an even bigger scandal than what she said was the President's ""lawbreaking behavior.""

Asked by Tapper Sunday about Trump keeping conversations with foreign leaders private, Schiff said: ""Well not if those conversations involve potential corruption or criminality or leverage being used for political advantage against our nation's interest.""

""This would be, I think, the most profound violation of the presidential oath of office, certainly during this presidency, which says a lot, but perhaps during just about any presidency. There is no privilege that covers corruption. There is no privilege to engage in underhanded discussions,"" he said, adding that he's not certain that the call is the subject of the complaint.

White House split on releasing calls

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko told reporters on Saturday that he didn't think Trump had tried pressuring Zelensky during the July call, but stopped short of saying the subject of Biden's son wasn't raised.

The President on Sunday described his conversation with the Ukrainian president as ""warm and friendly"" and repeatedly urged reporters to look instead at Biden and Democrats, who he said -- without providing evidence -- have ""done some very bad things.""

But while the President suggested he was open to releasing the conversation, telling reporters: ""I hope they can put it out,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said there's no evidence such an action ""would be appropriate"" at this time.

""We don't release transcripts very often. It's the rare case,"" Pompeo said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" ""Those are private conversations between world leaders, and it wouldn't be appropriate to do so except in the most extreme circumstances. There's no, there's no evidence that would be appropriate here at this point.""

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin also weighed in, telling Tapper Sunday that he thinks releasing the transcript ""would be a terrible precedent,"" arguing that ""conversations between world leaders are meant to be confidential.""

As summer turns to fall, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden have separated themselves from the pack. The gold standard poll in Iowa showed Warren with 22% support and Biden with 20% of likely Democratic caucus-goers.

The new reality left more than a dozen other Democrats scrambling to keep the primary from turning into a two-person race -- with New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker offering an extraordinary admission that he might have no path forward.

Their weekend of retail politicking took place amid a national firestorm over reports that President Donald Trump had pressed the Ukrainian president to investigate the business dealings of Biden's son, Hunter Biden, in the country.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

Warren arrived in Iowa newly at war with Democratic leaders in Congress. She declared -- first in a fundraising email, then in her speech in front of 12,000 Democrats at the Polk County Steak Fry on Saturday -- that "" Congress is complicit "" in Trump's actions because the Democratic-led House has failed to begin impeachment proceedings.

""What the President has now demonstrated is that he thinks it's pretty clear he doesn't have to follow the law, and in fact can continue to commit high crimes and misdemeanors,"" Warren told reporters in Cedar Rapids. ""He can go back to the well on exactly what he did before. And that is invite and profit from foreign interference in our election. It's time for Congress to step up and begin serious impeachment proceedings against this man.""

Biden, meanwhile, was at times testy with reporters over the news. It's the sort of clash that Biden has relished -- one that gave him the opportunity to go toe-to-toe with Trump as if the general election had already arrived.

But Biden was also insistent that the focus should remain on Trump improperly inviting foreign interference in a US election -- not on Biden and his son.

""Trump did a terrible thing,"" he said Sunday in Kansas City, Kansas -- his first stop after two days in Iowa. ""Focus on the violation of the Constitution this President has engaged in.""

But as he campaigned in Iowa -- a climate change speech and an LGBTQ forum in Cedar Rapids on Friday, then a Steak Fry appearance Saturday -- there were signs of trouble, including a poll that showed Warren as the second choice of 20% of Democrats surveyed to Biden's 10% -- a potentially important factor given Iowa's unique caucus rules that will force those backing candidates with less than 15% support to move on to their second choices.

He also faced criticism over his response to the moderator at the LGBTQ forum.

Lyz Lenz, an Iowa-based journalist and author, had asked Biden a pointed question about his voting record and his reference to Vice President Mike Pence as a ""decent guy.""

Biden paused and responded: ""You're a lovely person."" Then, on the way off the stage, Lenz tweeted, Biden ""said to me dryly, 'You're a real sweetheart.' ""

""It's 2019 -- we shouldn't be calling professional women sweethearts,"" Lenz told CNN backstage.

In Iowa, Warren and Biden appear to be the dominant forces a little more than four months from the Democratic caucuses. But there remains room for movement.

The poll found that just 20% of likely caucus-goers have a first-choice candidate and say they are unlikely to be persuaded to support someone else.

That reality was underscored at the Polk County Steak Fry on Saturday: While many of the 12,000 tickets organizers said they sold to the event were purchased by campaigns that brought their own supporters in, many attendees who had purchased their own tickets or gotten them from their local Democratic parties said in interviews that they were still considering multiple candidates.

Harper Folsom, a 23-year-old student from Manchester, Iowa, said her top two candidates are Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro -- but she also likes Biden, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and Booker.

""I think it's important to have the most diverse amount of voices that we can,"" she said.

Still, many of the Steak Fry attendees said they are ready for the field to winnow -- and the CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll found evidence of who voters have already broadly dropped from the lists of candidates they are considering.

Only eight candidates are even viewed favorably by a clear majority of likely Democratic caucusgoers: Warren and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have by far the highest net favorability rating, followed by California Sen. Kamala Harris, Booker, Biden, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, O'Rourke and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Entrepreneur Andrew Yang is viewed favorably by just four percentage points more of those polled than see him unfavorably. And the rest of the field -- including Castro, billionaire investor Tom Steyer and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, all of whom might qualify for the party's October presidential debate -- is viewed unfavorably by a majority of likely Democratic caucusgoers.

Some candidates seeking a way out of the low single digits are turning to desperate measures.

Booker campaign manager Addisu Demissie started Saturday morning with a memo featuring an unusual and startling admission : If Booker couldn't raise $1.7 million by the end of the month, he'd have no path forward and would need to exit the race.

The tactic appeared to work, at least initially. Demissie tweeted Sunday morning that Saturday had been Booker's biggest online fundraising day of the campaign, hauling in $300,000.

Other candidates were looking for a break-out at the Steak Fry in front of a crowd so large that it would have accounted for 5% of the total turnout in Iowa's record-breaking 2008 Democratic caucuses.

As Warren lingered at the Steak Fry for hours to greet and take pictures with attendees, Castro jumped into the line, and the two had a warm exchange.

Harris' campaign has mastered the art of the entrance . She walked into the Steak Fry dancing alongside a marching drumline.

O'Rourke had one of the day's most memorable moments when he repeated his call for mandatory assault-style rifle buy-backs. He also took a jab at Democratic leaders in Washington, saying they should not ""live in fear"" of Trump and the National Rifle Association, days after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, had said no other members of the party agree with O'Rourke's position.

""This is how we free ourselves from fear. We decide what we believe in and we fight like hell to achieve it -- and we don't let anyone, whether it's the NRA, the corporations, or the political action committees, or even our fellow Democrats tell us what is possible and what is not possible,"" O'Rourke said. ""We the people decide what is possible in this country.""

""I thought Beto really got people motivated,"" said Ray Johnson, a 67-year-old consumer protection worker in West Des Moines.

He and his wife said they were also considering backing O'Rourke, as well as Warren and Buttigieg, and said they were most concerned with who will defeat Trump. Johnson said he likes Biden, but thinks Democrats need someone younger who can excite voters.

Buttigieg, meanwhile, is seeking to leverage the eye-popping $25 million he raised in the last fundraising quarter in Iowa, where he is already on the air with television ads.

His campaign bought the second-most tickets to the Steak Fry after Biden, and turned in the day's most raucous appearance as a light rain fell in Des Moines.

Then, Buttigieg started a four-day bus tour of Iowa -- with reporters in tow and allowed to ask the candidate questions at any point.

At the Steak Fry, Nikki Lunden, a 41-year-old warehouse worker from Iowa City, said Buttigieg is her favorite candidate -- but most importantly, she wants to support ""who's going to win it.""

Robert Hein, who had driven from Minnesota -- a Super Tuesday state -- with his wife Amy, said he was ""thinking maybe somebody young might be the better choice"" after hearing former President Jimmy Carter say there should be an ""age limit"" for the presidency that would exclude Biden. He said he was already impressed by Buttigieg and left even more so.

He said Biden represents ""a guarantee that we can get Trump out of there.""

""But the more I listen to these folks, I think there are a good number of them who have a good shot at beating him in November,"" he said."

Omar's office confirmed the comments to CNN.

The comments from the progressive congresswoman were made as a number of the 2020 Democratic candidates pitched themselves this weekend in the first-in-the-nation caucus state as the best contender to take on President Donald Trump. Biden, the pack's centrist front-runner, has faced tough criticism from his fellow candidates for his record, which some have knocked as not being progressive enough.

That's a problem for Bernie Sanders.,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/22/politics/union-health-care-medicare-for-all/index.html,"(CNN) Health care benefits are really important to many union workers -- important enough to give up pay raises or even to walk off the job to keep the coverage they've negotiated.

Now the future of those benefits is at the heart of an emerging split among 2020 Democratic candidates over how to remake American health care. Former Vice President Joe Biden says union members shouldn't have to give up their employer plans if they like them, while Sen. Bernie Sanders is arguing that union workers would still come out ahead under ""Medicare for All,"" which would shift all Americans into a government-run plan.

The fight puts Sanders, a declared democratic socialist, at odds with some in the labor movement, where many union workers already have insurance with pretty good benefits. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is also seeking the nomination, is in a similar situation because of her support for both Medicare for All and organized labor.

Already, there's a growing divide among unions as to whether to back Sanders' universal coverage proposal. National Nurses United, the largest union of registered nurses, are very vocal supporters of Medicare for All. But the International Association of Fire Fighters opposes eliminating employer-based coverage

Still other unions, such as the Service Employees International Union, say they support all efforts to expand coverage to more people.

Roughly 10.5% of workers -- or 14.7 million people -- were union members in 2018, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's about half the share that were unionized 35 years earlier.

Some 95% of union workers had access to employer medical benefits in 2019, compared to 68% of non-union workers, according to the bureau's data. And they were more likely to participate in the plans, with 84% of union staffers signing up, compared to 54% of their non-union counterparts.

""Bargaining for health benefits is a distinguishing characteristic that labor unions hold out as an important variable as to why you would want to be a union member,"" said David Brenner, national director of multi-employer consulting at Segal Consulting, a leader in the field.

The quality of their health plans varies widely, experts said. Unions that cover a lot of lower-wage employees, such as custodians or nurse's aides, may have more basic benefits and have to pay more for them. But other unions, including those in the construction, auto industry and some hotel trades, have more generous policies -- with low premiums, deductibles and co-pays. A few have even set up their own health clinics for members to get care.

Many health packages are so comprehensive that unions feared getting hit with the Affordable Care Act's Cadillac tax, which would have slapped a levy on the value of employer-provided coverage above a certain threshold. Companies and unions quickly banded together to fight it, fearing they'd have to curtail workers' health benefits. The implementation date has been delayed twice, and the House recently voted to repeal the provision

The United Auto Workers, who are currently striking against General Motors, are among the unions with high-quality plans. Members pay only about 3% of the total cost of their health care, while salaried staffers have to cover about one-third, according to GM.

Until recently, the automaker had been seeking to shift more of the bill to the UAW workforce. But GM has dropped its request for major changes in the health care plan. Talks are now hung up on other issues, including pay, the use of temporary workers and a union demand to shift work from Mexico to facilities slated to close in the US.

However, GM has also stopped paying for health insurance for the striking workers, who will have to sign up for COBRA. The UAW's strike fund is picking up the cost. Sanders took the opportunity earlier this week to note that union members wouldn't have to fear losing their benefits during strikes under Medicare for All.

Medical benefits is a central component of most contract negotiations. Health care is a major expense for most companies, and they have been pushing more of the cost onto non-union employees for years. They want organized labor to contribute more too.

But union workers are willing to make sacrifices to shield their health care coverage, including curtailing raises or other benefits.

""In an awful lot of cases, workers are forgoing any increase in wages in order to keep their deductibles from going even higher,"" said Tom Leibfried, legislative representative for the AFL-CIO, a federation of 55 national and international labor unions that represent 12.5 million people.

There's also a growing trend of contract talks breaking down in part over health benefits, said Alex Colvin, dean of Cornell University's ILR School, formerly known as the School of Industrial and Labor Relations. Health coverage was among the issues in United Steelworkers' strike against National Grid in Massachusetts and the teachers' strike in West Virginia last year.

""There's a lot more labor unrest and the cost of health care is one of the drivers of that,"" Brenner said.

Health care is important to union workers for several reasons, said Shaun Richman, program director at the SUNY Empire State College's School of Labor Studies who also was a deputy director of organizing for the American Federation of Teachers.

""You can take a higher raise to the bank, but when your kid gets sick, the peace of mind of good health insurance is important,"" Richman said. Also, ""it's a badge of honor of maintaining the health insurance and not taking concessions on it.""

Recognizing that he needs unions' support, Sanders issued a Workplace Democracy plan last month that would require companies to pass along savings resulting from Medicare for All to workers in the form of raises or other benefits. Unions would be allowed to maintain their clinics and provide supplemental coverage, as long as it doesn't duplicate the benefits available under Medicare for All.

A Warren aide told CNN recently that the campaign is talking with labor leaders about how unions with negotiated health care plans will be guaranteed a chance to rework their agreements during a Medicare for All transition.

That may not be enough for some unions, though.

""There has to be a role for the hard-fought, high-quality plans that we've negotiated,"" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told Fox News earlier this month. ""If there isn't some way for us to have our plans integrated into the system, then we would have a hard time supporting it."""

Many strikes are over quickly. In 2007, the last national strike against GM lasted only a few days. Another UAW strike against Chrysler that year was resolved in a matter of hours. To protect its strike fund, the UAW doesn't start parceling out strike benefits to members until Day 8.

The strike benefits will cost the union about $12.5 million a week. The UAW is also paying for members' health insurance during the strike, making Cobra payments on their behalf. The union had nearly $800 million in its strike fund at the end of last year, meaning that it could go about a year paying strike benefits before it would deplete the fund. The fund is built up over time by UAW member dues, which can come to about 2-1/2 hours pay per month.

Negotiators from the union andwere back at it on Monday morning, after holding talks throughout the weekend. The two sides report making some progress but say they remain far apart on many key issues. The strike began in the early hours of Monday, September 16.

The union is pressing the company to agree to relocate some vehicles built at plants in Mexico to the two US assembly plants that are slated to close. The union said GM builds far more vehicles in Mexico than rivalsof

GM said it has put forward ""solutions"" for the two plants — in Lordstown, Ohio and Detroit — and is offering to invest $7 billion in its American operations to create or keep 5,400 hourly jobs. A person familiar with the company's offer said it is proposing to build an electric truck in the Detroit plant and lithium batteries for electric vehicles in Lordstown. But that work probably wouldn't begin for several years, meaning the plants would be dark until then.

GM announced plans to close those facilities , as well as transmission plants in Warren, Michigan, and Baltimore in November. The four plants employed about 3,000 hourly workers when those closings were announced. GM said it has found other jobs for about 2,300 of those workers, but many people had to relocate.

The union and company are also reportedly still not in agreement on GM's use of temporary hourly workers, as well as about wages and benefits.

The strike is the longest national strike against GM in more than 20 years, one or two plants have been the target of longer strikes in the past. This strike has shut all of GM's 31 US factories spread across nine states, mostly in the center of the country, as well as 21 other facilities, idling nearly 50,000 hourly workers. It is the largest strike against a private sector business since the 2007 strike against GM.

The $250 benefits are much less than the pay that union members are losing because of the strike. GM says that hourly workers earn an average of $90,000 a year, although that includes profit sharing and overtime. To qualify for the strike pay, workers must walk the picket line or do other things related to the strike.

The strike benefits also are subject to income tax. The union will issue 1099 forms to members if their benefits cross the $600 mark.

There is pressure on GM to reach a settlement sooner rather than later. Moody's credit rating agency has said that if the strike goes on for more than one-to-two weeks, ""the financial burden of a strike will become more material."" That could be bad news for GM since it's credit rating rating is currently only one step above junk bond status . If it was downgraded into junk bond status, it could raise the cost of its borrowing in the future.

GM's debt was downgraded into junk bond status in 2005, several years before it ended up in bankruptcy court and in need of a federal bailout in 2009. It took until 2013 for it to shake that rating, and have its debt classified as ""investment grade.""

-- Update: This story has been updated to better reflect what Moody's credit rating statement could mean for GM.

-- Correction: An earlier version of the headline incorrectly stated how much the strikers will get paid from the UAW strike fund."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is surging in the polls, particularly in the Midwest. But voters continue to be skeptical of her personality, as a new focus group of female swing voters in a Wisconsin small town revealed.

The focus group, conducted by Engagious/Focus Pointe Global and reported by Axios, included “included 7 women who flipped from Barack Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016, and 2 who switched from Mitt Romney to Hillary Clinton.”

As Axios noted, while the focus group preferred Warren’s policies, they were put off by her personality.

While some described Warren as “nice,” and “confident,” they did not feel stirred by her or passionate about her.

“I like what she had to say but I still think she’s a sorry bitch,” one said. “I just — the way she acts, and some of the things — I just don’t care for her.”

Another disagreed with the use of the word “bitch” but said Warren said sounded “fake,” even if her ideas were good.

Warren has struggled to convince even her own voters of her electability. At a town hall meeting last month in Franconia, New Hampshire — the first to spark national attention to the growing size of Warren’s crowds — one attendee told Breitbart News that while she liked Warren, she could not see her beating President Donald Trump.

Though the Engagious/FPG data is accompanied by a warning that it is not a statistically representative sample, the information provides clues about what messages are currently resonating with the Democratic electorate.

Axios reports that the results “reflected the doubts that some people have about women in leadership,” but seven of the nine women said they did not know anyone who refused to vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016 because of her gender. Six said that they would vote for Trump if the presidential election were to be held again tomorrow.

Two-thirds (six of nine) also said that it was worth some economic pain to fight China for fairer terms of trade.

A recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll came to a slightly different conclusion — namely, that voters nationwide did not like Trump’s personality, but were also skeptical of the left-wing policies being offered by most Democrats.

Wisconsin was a key to Trump’s victory in 2016; Clinton avoided campaigning there, while Trump made several visits to the state in the last days of the election. Democrats will hold their 2020 convention in Milwaukee.

Biden, who has largely remained the frontrunner as several national polls indicate, fell to second place with 20 percent support. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) followed in a distant third with 11 percent support. The margin of error is +/- four percent.

The Des Moines Register added that “no other candidate reaches double digits,” with Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) coming in fourth place with nine percent support, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) dropping to fifth place with six percent support, and Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) garnering three percent support each.

In the most recent Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll out of Iowa, Warren took the lead with 22 percent of Democrat primary voters for the first time. Former Vice President Joe Biden, meanwhile, fell to second place with 20 percent, while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) trailed in third with 11 percent.

When Democrat primary voters were asked who their second choice for president would be, Warren gained 20 percent of voters for a combined first and second choice tally of 42 percent. Biden, on the other hand, is only the second choice for about ten percent of voters, while Sanders about doubles his prospects.

Warren had led hugely against her Democrat contenders in an Iowa Starting Line-Change Research poll from August. In that poll, Warren surged past Biden and Sanders by 11 points, earning nearly 30 percent of support overall.

Since the second Democrat presidential primary debate on September 12, Warren’s Real Clear Politics average of Iowa polls leads all other candidates with 23 percent. Biden comes in with 20.3 percent average post-debate in Iowa, while Sanders garners 12 percent.

Warren’s surge in Iowa, though, has been met with confrontation from some farmers in the agricultural state who vehemently oppose the Green New Deal, which she has endorsed. In one conversation, an Iowa farmer confronted Warren over her support for the plan, which he said would cripple his industry because of its goals to eliminate cows.

It’s not just Iowa where Warren is surging. Across the country, Warren has steadily climbed over Biden and Sanders to take the lead.

The latest Civiqs/DataProgress poll conducted this month put Warren at 30 percent with likely Democrat primary voters. Biden fell to second place with 24 percent and Sanders trailed with 14 percent.

In an Economist/YouGov poll taken in the second week of September, Warren tied with Biden nationally with each taking 26 percent of Democrat primary voters. Sanders, at third, came in at 16 percent.

Even in California, where Biden has led the pack in most statewide polls, Warren took the lead in the latest Change Research poll, getting 25 percent compared to Biden’s 23 percent. At stake in California for 2020 Democrats are about 416 delegates.

Warren’s recent taking the lead in key Democrat primary states and polls has come after embarrassing mishaps in which she formally apologized to Native Americans for spending years claiming to be Native American herself. Those critics, though, have been reluctant to accept her apology, as Breitbart News noted.

The flops on the campaign trail are far from being in the past for Warren. Last week, she exaggerated for the third time the size of her campaign rally crowds. After holding a rally in Washington Square in New York City, the Warren campaign claimed 20,000 people were at the event. New York City Parks confirmed that Washington Square can only hold a maximum of 10,000 people.

Similarly, in August, Warren’s campaign claimed that 12,000 people were in attendance at her rally on the campus of Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota. The maximum capacity of the venue, though, is about 3,000 people, and with crowd spillover, there could not have been more than 6,000 attendees.

In New Hampshire, Warren’s campaign claimed there were 700 people in attendance at a rally on a farm. Breitbart News was there and judged the crowd at about “over 300.”

Built mostly on the perception of a grassroots populist campaign, Warren’s run for president has seen her take on multinational corporations for outsourcing American jobs and promising an economic patriotist agenda even while using billionaire donor money and pleasing the donor class by taking a mass illegal and legal immigration position.

Despite her anti-establishment messaging, Warren has reportedly been in talks with Democrat Party establishment figures like failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and has received praise from former Senator Harry Reid. One Democrat strategist told NBC News that Clinton has been impressed with Warren’s campaign thus far.

Not so long ago, a United Auto Workers strike against General Motors was a big deal. Of course, not so long ago, General Motors was a big company—in fact, the biggest company in not only the U.S., but in the whole wide world.

Times change, and now the GM strike, which began on September 15, is just a footnote in the news. Or, actually, we should say, it was just small beer, until both Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders announced that they would visit the Michigan picket line. Maybe soon, another dozen or so Democrat presidential candidates will show up, too, along with the usual traveling circus of roving reporters, talking heads, and publicity-seeking celebrities.

Yes, times change—and they never stop changing.

Yet even if the GM strike is now firmly in the news, the fact remains that GM today is just a shadow of what it once was. It’s only the 13th-largest company in the U.S. by revenues and the 32nd-largest in the world. And if one measures GM by market capitalization—that is, the total value of its stock—it’s even further back in the pack; its market cap is $54 billion, whereas top-ranked Microsoft is worth $1.06 trillion, or 20 times as much.

For its part, the UAW, too, has shrunk dramatically; its membership has declined by nearly three-fourths over the last four decades, from 1.5 million in 1979 to 400,000 today.

By now, these sorts of statistics—the rise of tech, the decline of manufacturing, including manufacturing employment—have become familiar. Yet still, as a nation, we haven’t yet figured out how to make sure workers get a fair piece of the pie. How are people—with or without unions—going to make a living in the 21st century?

Perhaps we can gain perspective on this question by learning more about how leaders thought about jobs and economic justice in the 20th century. Yes, times and technology have changed, and yet human beings are still human beings. And as American citizens, they have political rights and legitimate needs—and these, as we shall see, have been sorely neglected in recent decades.

When Workers Were Strong—Maybe Too Strong

Let’s go back to November 21, 1945, when the UAW struck GM. That strike was a front-page big deal, with vast national repercussions. For context, we can recall that this strike came just three months after the end of World War II; in the new post-war era, both business and labor, unleashed from most wartime controls, were eager to get back to peacetime manufacturing and working.

So if GM wanted to sell more cars, its workers wanted more pay; specifically, the union wanted a 30 percent raise. GM said “no,” and the strike was on; some 320,000 employees hit the picket lines. (We might note that in those days, the GM strikers represented .56 percent of the nation’s total employment. We can pause to observe that more than half of one percent for just one firm is a lot; by comparison in 2019, the GM strike involves only 48,000 workers, or .003 percent—less than a thirtieth of one percent—of America’s employed today.)

In March 1946, four months after the labor action began, the two sides reached a settlement; GM workers got a 17.5 percent raise.

Yet the GM strike was just an overture; 1945-46 saw a nationwide wave of strikes as electrical workers, meatpackers, steel workers, oil workers, railroad engineers, theatrical craftsmen—4.3 million workers total—went off the job. That was roughly eight percent of the workforce.

Needless to say, all these strikes put a burden on the economy, as well as on the social order. In particular, in those days, as the first chill winds of the Cold War were being felt, J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI had well-founded concerns about communist influence—even outright pro-Soviet activity—within some unions. In the meantime, in addition, evidence abounded of mob influence and hooliganism within some unions.

So the challenge to the nation was serious—that is, balancing the rights of workers alongside the overall public interest in law-abiding prosperity.

This need to find the proper balance meant re-examining a key piece of legislation that had been passed in the New Deal decade of the 1930s, namely, the National Labor Relations Act, better known as the Wagner Act.

The Wagner Act was called the “Magna Carta for labor” for a reason; just as the Magna Carta (Great Charter) back in 1215 had guaranteed rights for Englishman, so, too, did the Wagner Act guarantee rights for labor, including:

The exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other mutual aid or protection.

That is, collective bargaining. Unions.

It’s interesting to recall the breadth of support for the Wagner Act at the time of its passage; back in ’35, in the middle of the Depression, majorities in both parties agreed that something had to be done to empower workers. Thus the U.S. Senate approved the measure by a vote of 63 to 12, with a dozen Republicans joining in support, while the House passed the bill without even bothering with a recorded vote. On July 5, 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed it into law, describing it “to be necessary as an act of both common justice and economic advance.”

The Wagner Act was broadly popular because it was based on an obvious point: To achieve a fair bargain, both sides in a negotiation need to have bargaining power.

To put that another way, if Big Business was the new economic reality, then labor needed to be big, too. After all, if labor wasn’t strong enough to stand up to business, then business would rule, perhaps in the manner of European fascism.

In other words, as is the risk with any one-sided regime, a lopsided power equation in favor of business could lead to tyranny. And that, in turn, could produce a backlash, some sort of violent revolt. Indeed, it’s worth recalling that in 1935, the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia was a recent memory; no right-thinking American wanted to see the red tide coming here.

So the Wagner Act was, in reality, a moderate compromise, aimed at fending off radicalism from either the right or the left. Indeed, it echoed the checks and balances written into the Constitution; the whole idea was to guarantee that business would have to bargain with labor. The economist John Kenneth Galbraith would later describe the system as the interplay of “countervailing forces”: Big Business checked by Big Labor—and vice versa.

Harry Truman Confronts the Labor Crisis

As a senator in 1935, Harry Truman had voted for the Wagner Act, and yet now, as president in 1945, he saw that the reform needed reform; labor’s Magna Carta had given the unions too free a rein—and so it was time to rein them in.

In Year of Decisions, the first volume of his memoirs, Truman wrote, “By the autumn of 1945, the labor situation was assuming serious proportions … The increasing labor difficulties of the postwar period were the subject of many discussions with the Cabinet in meetings in October and November.”

This labor unrest was ironic, because, of course, Truman and the Democrats in charge of Congress were generally pro-labor. And yet as we all have discovered, even a good thing is often in need of tinkering—and if necessary, a full overhauling.

Being the energetic man that he was, Truman took action; he invited the leaders of labor and management—including the heads of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the American Federation of Labor, and the Congress of Industrial Organizations—to meet with him in Washington to “work out a new approach to toward solving the industrial crisis.”

We might pause over those last two words, “industrial crisis.” As Truman further wrote, “The country needed a national wage policy, effective mediation machinery, and other remedial legislation which would protect the rightful interests of labor, of management, and of the public.”

Mindful of these goals, Truman began to formulate a series of reforms to the Wagner Act, such as mandatory cooling off periods and a ban on secondary strikes. He was even willing, if need to be, to send in federal troops to operate trains and mines; Truman was pro-labor, yes, but he was pro-public interest, first.

On November 5, 1945, Truman addressed the assembled leaders of business and labor in the Labor Department’s main auditorium—a bit of signaling there. Yet still, in his speech, the president spoke bluntly to both sides: “Failure to produce any workable recommendations on how to avoid work stoppages would mean legislation by Congress.” In other words, if you guys in the private sector can’t figure this out, elected officials will have to step in.

Unfortunately, the negotiations proved to be just more confrontations; even as they were sitting in the same room together, under the watchful eye of Team Truman, business and labor leaders couldn’t agree on anything important.

Indeed, to Truman’s dismay, the single most difficult figure proved to be a labor man, John L. Lewis, president of the mighty United Mine Workers. In that period, Truman summoned Lewis to the White House on no less than six occasions, warning him that “precipitous strikes” could lead the opposition congressional Republicans pushing “punitive measures against labor.” Indeed, when the mine workers defied a federal court’s back-to-work order, Truman’s Justice Department hauled Lewis himself into court, finding him guilty of civil and criminal contempt.

Beyond his exasperation with Lewis, Truman was concerned that if he and his fellow Democrats couldn’t take labor to the higher ground of constructive compromise, the Republicans would take labor to the abyss of annihilation. That is, whereas Democrats wanted to reform the Wagner Act, many Republicans, grown more militant since the ’30s, were now seeking its outright repeal.

Truman was nothing if not vivid in a letter he wrote to another labor leader on December 11, 1945: “I am going to need all the help and cooperation I can possibly get to keep labor from getting its throat slit in this Congress.” [emphasis added]

Yet in the end, Truman’s mediation efforts, valiant as they were, were not successful. The gap between Big Business and Big Labor was simply too wide to be easily or quickly bridged.

As a result, in November 1946, the opposition Republicans, surfing a wave of outrage against the antics of Lewis and other labor barons, won a smashing victory in the midterm elections. For the first time since 1930, the GOP had control of both chambers of Congress; indeed, it seemed that Truman himself would be a dead duck in the 1948 election.

The centerpiece of the Republican agenda for the 80th Congress, convening in January 1947, was braking, or even breaking, the power of labor.

Thus the Taft-Hartley Act was passed in June 1947; Truman vetoed the legislation, and his veto was overridden, with many Democrats joining in the overriding.

Yet soon after its enactment, Taft-Hartley began causing regrets. If the Wagner Act was seen as too pro-labor, Taft-Hartley was seen as too anti-labor. Seizing on this revised sentiment, and preparing for his own campaign to win a second term in the White House, Truman set about rallying labor and the party of labor, the Democrats, against the anti-labor Republicans. Prominent in the Democrat Party’s 1948 platform: “We advocate the repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act.”

Truman had gauged the shifting public sentiment correctly; the Missourian won a smashing comeback victory in 1948. In fact, not only was he victorious, but Democrats also recaptured the House and the Senate. So we can see: The “loyal opposition” in Congress had badly overplayed its hand; the country wanted the New Deal to be reformed, not repealed. (Here at Breitbart News earlier this year, I detailed Truman’s big win, considering ways in which Donald Trump could apply the same sort of anti-“loyal opposition” strategy in 2020.)

The following year, 1949, good to his word, Truman sought the repeal of Taft-Hartley. And yet he failed in his effort, largely because Southern Democrats, representing states where unions were weak, were figuring out that they could gain economically by attracting factories from the unionized North. (Taft-Hartley gave each state the option of being either a “union shop” state, or a “right to work”—that is, anti-union—state.)

Today, the “right to work” movement has spread widely; 27 states—including, amazingly enough, Michigan—have “right to work” laws on their books.

In Truman’s time, the Democrat Party was split between its Northern and Southern wings. And so, thus divided, the House of Labor started to crumble. It’s fair to say that Taft-Hartley doomed mass unionization in the U.S.

When Workers Are Weak—Labor’s Long Slide

So if we’ve seen unions when they were at their peak of optimism—critics would say arrogance—now, we can look at unions in their valley of doubt.

As we have seen, the basic idea behind labor unions is bargaining power—the power of collective bargaining.

Since the Taft-Hartley legislation of 1947, workers and their unions have always had to confront the reality that if they bargain too hard, the company can simply move to a less-expensive right-to-work state. It took a few decades before the full effect of this dynamic became obvious, but by the ’60s and ’70s, it was obvious to all.

Indeed, the percentage of private-sectors workers in unions has fallen from more than a third in the 1950s to less than seven percent today. (And free trade agreements, making it easy for companies relocate out of the U.S. altogether, have only exacerbated this trend.)

As a result, workers are in a weaker position today; they have lost their bargaining power. To be sure, there are plenty of laws on the books concerning working conditions—and plenty of trial lawyers eager to sue over some breach, real or imagined—and yet for most jobs, statutes concerning actual wages that must be paid are scant and inadequate. And that’s why there are so few strikes in the private sector; workers have learned, the hard way, that they must take what the bosses are offering.

Some Painful Numbers for Working People

Moreover, that’s why, according to the Pew Research Center, real wages (that is, adjusted for inflation) for most Americans have stagnated for the last half-century. Yes, it’s true that in many ways, the standard of living is vastly higher than it was in the 1960s, as new inventions have flooded the market, making goods both better and cheaper.

Yet still, some key variables, such as the cost of college and the cost of housing, have skyrocketed, leaving many workers today demonstrably worse off than their predecessors. And in any case, there’s nothing like a big fat paycheck.

The pro-labor Economic Policy Institute (EPI) makes a further point, focusing on the hurtful impact that ebbing bargaining power has had on workers, even as the overall economy has sailed along. According to EPI data, from 1948 to 1979, increases in wages and increases in productivity closely paralleled one another: In those three decades, productivity rose 108 percent, while compensation rose 93 percent. That wasn’t a perfect one-to-one ratio, but it was close enough. And it seemed only fair: If workers were working better, they should be sharing in the gains. And unions were there to make sure that the sharing occurred.

Yet since 1979, according to EPI, productivity and compensation have gone their separate ways: Productivity has risen 69 percent, while compensation has risen just 11 percent. To put it another way, productivity went up more than six times faster than compensation. EPI’s message is clear: In the absence of unions, the gain-sharing imperative on business was also absent.

So where did the added value of those productivity increases go, if not to workers? Short answer: Much of the added value went to corporate investors; that’s one reason why the Dow Jones average sits above 27,000. Indeed, over the last four decades, the stock market is up more than 3,200 percent; by contrast, the federal minimum wage is up 250 percent.

Furthermore, a close look at data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve provides an even more startling look at labor’s long slide. In 1947, the year Taft-Hartley passed, compensation (defined as wages and salary accruals) accounted for 49.4 percent of GDP; that is, workers got a smidge less than half of the national output. Interestingly, the workers’ share of GDP rattled around in a narrow three-point band for the next two decades, never going below 48.8 percent and peaking, in 1969, at 51.6 percent.

Yet then came that long slide in labor incomes. Taft-Hartley obviously played a role, but so, too, did other forces, such as globalization, outsourcing, and mass immigration. By 2011, during the Obama administration, worker compensation as a percentage of GDP had fallen to 42 percent; in the last seven years, it has ticked up slightly, to 43 percent.

Hmm. From 51.6 percent of GDP in 1969 to 43 percent in 2018. Over time, ordinary folks must have noticed that fall in their share of the nation’s wealth. Indeed, now we can start to see why economic populists in decades past—Dick Gephardt in the ’80s, Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan in the ’90s—found such resonance, even if they never reached the White House. It was not until Trump that anyone could put it all together, although the anger had long been smoldering.

So again, who got those shifting 8.6 percentage points of the national wealth? They went to many places, including government, private investment, and the trade deficit. And oh yes, during the same half century, corporate profits rose from about five percent of GDP to ten percent. Yes, you read that right: Much of the change in the national share going to compensation has simply been a shift from workers to corporations—workers down more than eight points and corporate profits up five points. (Of course, it’s also true that wealth to corporations is wealth to shareholders, and many workers are shareholders, either through direct investments, or indirectly, through pension funds. But still, few workers think of themselves as investors; that’s why they call themselves workers—because they can’t rely on their capital to live, and so they have to rely, instead, on their labor.)

If we step back and consider the fate of workers’ wages over the last five decades, 1969 to 2018, we see that the change has been profound; it explains, for example, why the financiers of Manhattan are so rich and the workers of Milwaukee are so hard-pressed. After all, that decline in compensation—again, from the high of 51.6 percent down to 43 percent—amounts to a decline of 8.6 percentage points. For the U.S. economy, that’s more than one dollar in 12.

To put that 8.6-point number another way, since U.S. GDP is $21.3 trillion, 8.6 percent of that is more than $1.8 trillion. So now maybe we can better see why workers have been angry for so long: They’ve been on the losing end of that long slide—in effect, a $1.8 trillion pay cut, just in 2018.

Of course, during this long slide, most Republicans have typically cheered; they might not have even realized the income shift, but they certainly noticed the partisan shift. After all, Big Labor was once the mainstay of the Democrat Party, and so the shrinking of labor has shrunk the Democrats; the party of Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson is no longer winning giant landslides in the way that the party of Franklin D. Roosevelt did in the ’30s and ’40s, or that of Lyndon Johnson did in 1964. (Of course, it’s also no longer the party of Jefferson and Jackson—or, for that matter, of FDR and LBJ.)

On the other hand, the new Democrat Party is hardly a weakling; it has won the presidency in four of the last seven elections—and won the national popular vote in six of the last seven. So while it’s true that the Democrats aren’t winning giant landslides anymore, they have proven themselves capable of winning decent-sized landslides. In 1992, for example, Bill Clinton won 370 electoral votes, and in 1996, he won 379. In 2008, Barack Obama won 365, and in 2012, he won 365. In the meantime, no Republican—including Trump—has scored more than any of those electoral-vote totals since 1988.

Moreover, in lesser elections, the Democrats are doing well enough. They boast 54 percent of seats in the House of Representatives, possess 47 percent of seats in the U.S. Senate, and hold 46 percent of governorships—and own as well nearly 100 percent of big-city mayorships.

Yet ominously for the nation, the new Democrat Party has changed: It seems that even Harry Truman-type Democrats have gone away. Truman’s old Senate seat is now held by a Republican, Josh Hawley.

Today’s Democrat Party is mostly free of the influence of industrial union halls, which were once themselves thick with American flags and military veterans.

Instead, today’s Democrats are more in the mold of either Hillary Clinton or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; that is, they are oriented toward de luxe financialism or relentless radicalism—and often embrace both views at the same time.

Indeed, as their center of gravity has shifted from union halls to university campuses, today’s Democrats are ever more likely to delve into exotic isms, going even further afield from lunch-bucket and kitchen-table concerns. (Although, of course, there are plenty of self-declared socialists in the Democrat Party today; so it’s hardly the case that economic concerns have disappeared, even if most Americans rightfully fear a Hugo Chavez-like policy agenda. Socialism, of course, makes Truman-style populism look pretty darn good.)

Still, the leftward ideological transformation of the Democrat Party might be helping the Republicans in some places—it’s getting easier to portray Democrats as “loony left”—and yet it also means that there will be hell to pay when the Democrats next win.

The Party That Works for Workers Will Win with Workers

Of course, in the short run, there’s not much to be done about these changes. What matters more for the right is getting its own house in order, and that requires a franker understanding of who, exactly, is voting Republican these days.

To that end, more Republicans might take a close look at the 2014 manifesto that helped inspire Donald Trump to run for president: Rick Santorum’s Blue Collar Conservatives: Recommitting to an America That Works.

In addition, majority-minded Republicans might study The Republican Workers Party: How the Trump Victory Drove Everyone Crazy, and Why It Was Just What We Needed, published last year by F. H. Buckley. That phrase, Republican Workers Party, is a keeper.

In this vein of Main Street Republicanism, it was heartening to see the September 17 headline in Politico: “White House intervenes in General Motors strike: The effort would effectively put the White House on the side of the United Auto Workers.” (Yes, the formal UAW structure is still strongly aligned with the Democrats, but as Breitbart News has noted, in 2017 and again in 2019, the actual auto workers are now mostly Republican—although, of course, it’s always possible to make them more Republican.)

Yet of course, if the Democrats, starting with Sanders and Warren, choose, once again, to worry about auto workers and the working class in general—and if they can demonstrate that they’re truly sincere and not just using workers for props—well, who knows what will happen in 2020, and beyond.

In addition, over the long run, if we’re feeling philosophical, we might give ourselves time to think about how America would be different today if labor unions hadn’t been so profoundly sundered by Taft-Hartley, way back in the fateful decade of the ’40s.

That is, what if the Democrats were still following practical-minded middle-of-the-roaders, such as Harry Truman? As we have seen, back in the ’40s, Truman did not succeed in saving the unions from the start of their long slide—but at least he gave it his best shot.

Harry Truman, Meet Your Senatorial Successor, Josh Hawley

And as we think back on Truman, we might also think ahead. We might look, for instance, to the man now sitting in Truman’s Senate seat, Josh Hawley. Just on September 18, in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, Hawley outlined his vision of standing up for ordinary folks: “If the conservative movement wants to have a future, it’s going to have to commit itself to being the movement of working people. If we do that, if conservatives do that, if there’s a core group that will do that, then the rest of D.C., the lobbyists, they will follow along. It’s going to have to be people-driven change.”

So what, exactly, does Hawley have in mind? How, precisely, is he going to seek to raise the standard of living in Missouri—and everywhere else? Hawley hasn’t yet fleshed out the details, but hey, let’s give him space; he’s only been in the Senate for nine months, and he’s spent most of that time on a worthy mission, namely, taking on Big Tech—and on that subject, he’s provided plenty of details.

Yet even so, he had more to say to Breitbart News, and what he said is encouraging:

We have to stay focused on the issues that actually matter to real people and have to challenge the leadership class. So, as the Democrats turn towards socialism, is that a problem? Yeah, it is, but it just goes to show you that they have no idea how to respond to the needs of working people. We can’t just reject their crazy ideas. We also have to push forward with an agenda that actually benefits what I call the “American middle,” which is the middle of our society, people that really sustain our society. So it’s going to be a pro-worker agenda, it has to get wages up, we have to get manufacturing going again, we have to get healthcare costs down, to get folks new opportunities to get skills and jobs training, break up the monopoly of higher education, and take on the monopolists in the economy and their sweetheart deals with government.

Hawley has his own ideas, and yet we can recognize some Trumanesque themes.

And Truman, let’s not forget, spent nearly eight years in the White House."

Nunes told host Maria Bartiromo he saw it as the end of the elder Biden’s 2020 presidential bid.

“I mean, look, there’s a lot. Look, the left knows that Biden’s son is a problem for him,” he said. “This is why, when Hillary Clinton was running, these stories first originated — first originated back when Hillary Clinton was trying to make sure that Biden didn’t get in the race.”

“So, now that these have been resurrected, I don’t know who came up with the scheme,” Nunes continued. “Maybe there really is — this whistle-blower is not a partisan. I mean, we want to — we want to hear from that whistle-blower. But it sure looks like the scheme has backfired. And this — like I said, I think this is probably the end of Biden’s campaign.”

“End of his campaign?” Bartiromo replied.

“I really do. I don’t think — I mean, not that he’s — he’s still formidable,” Nunes answered. “He still has a bloc of support. But if you look, his lead is basically down to zero. If you look at what happened in Iowa now, it looks like Elizabeth Warren is in the lead.”

According to the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, when all American voters are asked to rank 12 policies from best to worst, a plan to provide taxpayer-funded healthcare to all illegal aliens — endorsed by Democrat front-runners like Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) — ranks as the least popular among the bunch.

The Journal notes:

Of 12 policy ideas tested in the poll, providing government-sponsored health care to undocumented immigrants was the least popular among the broader electorate, with 62% rejecting it. In a June Democratic debate, all 10 candidates on the stage, including Messrs. Biden and Sanders, raised their hands when asked who backed the idea. In the new survey, it was supported by 64% of Democratic primary voters but only 36% of voters overall. [Emphasis added]

As Breitbart News estimated, providing free healthcare to every illegal alien in the U.S. would cost up to $66 billion a year or $660 billion over a decade to American taxpayers. Already, Americans are forced to subsidize illegal aliens’ medical costs to the sum of almost $20 billion a year.

The Urban Institute’s Linda Blumberg, a health insurance expert, told the New York Times that such a policy providing free healthcare for every foreign national who crosses the U.S.-Mexico border or overstays a visa would drive a migration of “people with serious health problems” to the country.

Similar polls conducted in recent months found that American anywhere between 60 to 63 percent of swing voters oppose offering free healthcare to illegal aliens, as well as 55 to 59 percent of all U.S. voters.

The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll of 900 registered voters was conducted between September 13 and 16 with a margin of error of +/- 3.27 percentage points.

Ilhan Omar (D-MN) declared over the weekend that former Vice President Joe Biden doesn’t have what it takes to achieve “systemic” social change — yet another indication that his 2020 bid faces heavy skepticism from the Democrat Party’s progressive wing.

“There are few people who fit into the kind of progress that we all want to see in this country,” Omar said in an interview with the Guardian on Saturday. “And I would say he is not one of them.”

“I think it has been very clear to many of the people who have been creating the kind of movement that is exciting generations, that we want somebody who really has a plan that is going to tackle a lot of the systematic challenges that we have, and he doesn’t,” she added.

Omar’s criticism of Biden came after delivering a keynote address at the Iowa People’s Presidential Forum, an event organized by several progressive organizations, in which she argued the United States needs a president who “realizes we are not just fighting for one election; we are fighting for the very soul of our democracy and what society we want to become.”

Several Democrat presidential candidates —including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg — attended the gathering.

The far-left “Squad” member is not the only lawmaker in the four-person clique to raise concerns about Biden’s bid for the White House. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), an author of the Green New Deal, has repeatedly taken aim at Biden’s climate change proposal for fossil fuels to be eliminated by 2050. However, according to the New York Democrat, the former Veep’s plan is too little, too late.

“Scientifically, anything that is less than helping us cut carbon emissions in half by 2030 is going to be too late,” she said. “It’s a start, and I think that what that has shown is a dramatic shift in the right direction, but we need to keep pushing for a plan that is at the scale of the problem.”

Ocasio-Cortez also previously knocked Biden’s performance at the first Democratic presidential debate, saying it “raised questions” about his capacity to be commander-in-chief.

“I think Joe Biden, his performance on the stage, kind of raised some questions in respect to that,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “But I don’t want to say just because someone is 79, they can’t or shouldn’t run for president. I don’t want to… use a number as a proxy for capacity,” she told The New Yorker radio hour in July."

Their participation follows weeks of climate change alarmism from presidential candidates and activists across the globe. Several of the presidential hopefuls have floated limiting beef consumption – particularly, in recent weeks.

Yang told the audience at CNN’s 7-hour climate change town hall this month that “it’s good for the environment, it’s good for your health if you eat less meat.”

“I think it would be healthy on both an individual and a societal level for us to move in that direction,” he said.

Klobuchar also signaled support of reshaping dietary guidelines to reduce beef consumption, as did Harris, who said the government should find the balance between creating incentives and banning “certain behaviors.”

As Breitbart News reported:

Harris said she would support changing the government dietary guidelines and the food pyramid to reduce the amount of red meat in American diets. She also supported the idea of putting climate impact labels on food. “I’ve always believed that we should, you know, expand what’s on those cans of those things you buy in the grocery store,” she said. “We should expand the list. And included in that should be a measure of the impact on the environment.” Mayor Pete Buttigieg called for more “balance” in American meat production but was careful to say he was not in favor of abolishing the cow. He argued that government intervention like a carbon tax would encourage Americans have “more balanced diet” and a “more balanced footprint.” … O’Rourke cited a similar solution, arguing that a carbon tax would balance out the carbon emissions by the meat industry. “I think we just have to be more responsible in the way that we do it and the best way to do that is to allow the markets to respond by setting a price on carbon in every single part of our economy, every facet of American life,” he said.

In August, Sanders signaled that he would consider a “meat tax” in order to help combat climate change.

“Germany has imposed a meat tax in hopes of limiting this consumption,” a woman at a Q&A session at a town hall event in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, said.

“What are your plans to stop these large corporations from further usurping natural resources and polluting the planet?” she asked.

“Thank you for the question, and it’s a good question. All I can say is if we believe, as I do and you do, that climate change is real, we’re gonna have to tackle it in every area, including agriculture,” Sanders said.

The DNC is raising both the fundraising threshold as well as the polling standards, making it even more difficult for presidential hopefuls to lay out their vision on the national debate stage in November. In order to qualify, a candidate will have to report at least 165,000 individual donors, up from 130,000. The DNC is also requiring 600 unique donors in at least 20 states.

Candidates will have two ways to qualify for the debate via polling, either receiving five percent support in two early primary and caucus state polls – which includes Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina – or receiving three percent support in four early primary and caucus state polls or national polls.

While details of the November date are to be determined, any polls released “between Sept. 13 and midnight seven days before the debate” will count, the New York Times added, noting that “at least eight candidates have already met the 165,000-donor threshold.”

Candidates have until October 1 to qualify for next month’s debate at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. In order to qualify, a candidate must garner at least two percent in four DNC-approved polls and report 130,000 individual donors, up from the 65,000 required for the first debate. Eleven candidates have qualified, including Tom Steyer (D). He will be joined by:

Joe Biden (D)

Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D)

Andrew Yang (D)

Both Marianne Williamson (D) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) are still vying to get on the October debate stage, needing three polls and two polls, respectively.

The increased threshold is likely to draw critiques from low-tier candidates, who slammed the DNC’s requirements in the past.

“Here’s the situation: there’s a whole bunch of different polls that have come out. The DNC has only recognized some of them as being qualifying polls for the debate,” Gabbard told Tucker Carlson in August.

“The whole thing gets a little bit confusing. You’ve gotta jump way down into the weeds of the numbers and statistics, but I think the bigger problem is that whole process really lacks transparency,” she added.

“The DNC’s process is stifling debate at a time when we need it most,” Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) declared last month. “And it will NOT help us beat Donald Trump. If we wanted to be the party that excluded people, we’d be Republicans”:

“If the DNC had followed the process they announced in February and kept to the promised 17 [sic] qualifying polls, the lineup of the upcoming third debate might be very different,” Williamson’s communications director Patricia Ewing said prior to the third Democrat debate in Houston, Texas."

In total, about 46,000 United Auto Workers (UAW) members are on strike against GM to ensure new hires are paid higher wages and provided with better healthcare benefits after accepting concessions on these fronts a decade ago.

Last week, union workers were notified that their healthcare payments had been halted by GM because of the strike. Though GM executives have claimed that cutting off healthcare payments for union workers during a strike is standard practice, typically union workers’ healthcare plans continue but the UAW pays the costs.

This time around, though, GM’s cutting off of healthcare payments means union workers will have to re-enroll in their healthcare plans once the strike is over. In the meantime, vision and dental healthcare payments will not be covered during the strike.

In an interview with Payday Report, UAW Local 1005 Chairman Al Tiller explained how GM’s cutting off of healthcare payments for union workers led to one worker’s child going without cancer treatment.

“We’re supposed to have our benefits until the end of the month,” Tiller said. “The company decided they were going to cut them yesterday before the union was ready to take over with our strike fund. We had a couple members sick that couldn’t get treated. We got a member with … kid has cancer, went to get his treatment and couldn’t get it. So we don’t have $10,000 to put down and get reimbursed for it. We’re on strike.”

“They cut our benefits and its affecting our families, our kids,” Tiller continued. “This isn’t a company that cares about people. This is a company that cares about the dollar. And there’s another example right there. They don’t care about this kid with cancer and his treatment, they just want us to pay for it.”

In an op-ed published last week, Patrick Anderson, a 25-year GM employee, said he and his fellow American workers are striking because “we’re done sacrificing.”

Anderson wrote:

[Mary Barra] probably never experienced what my child experienced in my 25 years in the auto industry with GM. Because I have had to work in six plants in three states, my family has moved twice, and my child has changed schools and watched her father worry about what uncertainty was going to come next thanks to GM. I can’t help but think that maybe if her family had to experience what my family has gone through, then maybe she would be handling the workforce decisions differently. [Emphasis added] The fact is that when GM was down, we sacrificed. Now that GM is thriving, the company is trying to hurt us with reduced wages, cuts to health care and fewer benefits. [Emphasis added]

The strike comes as GM CEO Mary Barra idled the 78-year-old Warren Transmission plant, leaving about 335 American workers laid off from their jobs. In the long-run, analysts predict that the plant’s closure will leave 16,000 American workers laid off from their jobs in the region.

The Warren, Michigan layoffs came after 1,600 American workers were laid off in Lordstown, Ohio, where GM idled their assembly plant. That plant’s closure, alone, could leave more than 8,000 Americans in supporting industries in the area laid off.

Meanwhile, Barra continues earning about $22 million a year — a less than half a percent pay cut despite mass layoffs in the U.S. GM made more than $8 billion in profits last year after taxes.

As Breitbart News’ John Carney noted, the UAW strike against GM is just one component of growing signs that economic power is increasingly in the hands of employees rather than employers in President Trump’s “Buy American, Hire American” economy.

The actor-activist hosted the LGBTQ presidential forum in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Friday, which featured all of the Democrat presidential candidates except Sanders.

The 38-year-old star spoke to the Guardian following the forum and criticized Sanders for skipping the event.

“I was disappointed to not see all of the candidates here. I was further disappointed to hear this was not the only LGBTQ event Bernie was making other commitments for,” Ross said. “You don’t show up for both of our LGBTQ events? That’s obviously telling us all we need to know.”

The Pose actor claimed access to inside information, which purportedly revealed that Sanders’ prior commitments included visiting historically black colleges and universities as well as an “old black barbershop”:

I’m going to risk being super real here for a second. When you’re on the campaign trail, what’s happening a lot – and what a lot of these candidates have to avoid – is being seen as looking for a photo op. To be seen in certain communities and spaces. I heard that he was not only visiting the [Historically Black Colleges and Universities] but also visiting an old black barbershop.

“Found out Bernie has a prior commitments to visit HBCUs in North Carolina and Prestige Barber College (a black barbershop) and will be touring the civil rights museum,” Ross tweeted last week, alongside a sarcastic GIF of The Office’s Michael Scott:

Ross told the Guardian that it is a struggle to “get folks in my own black community to understand that being black and being LGBTQ are not mutally exclusive”:

What I hope Bernie would learn is you don’t have to pander to just one aspect of the black community. If he would have been at the LGBTQ forum tonight, he would have seen we were talking about issues affecting people of color. I think it was a huge misstep on his part. And I’m not here for any of the excuses. I say: ‘Make it up to me. Make it up to us.'”

Several social media users disagreed with the former model’s critique of Sanders.

“To question Bernie Sanders stance on lgbtq rights is the most ridiculous thing ever and shows your bias against him,” one user wrote.

“I don’t think he skipped this forum because he doesn’t believe in equal rights for all,” another said.

“Except you decided to focus on one candidate who has the most robust background on this issue. Also, he was at a HBCU which was already scheduled. To think sanders is weak on LGBTQ is frankly laughable,” another added.

The backlash continued to escalate, leading Ross to announce a break from social media “for a while.”

This would not be the first time Sanders has experienced accusations of harassment and intimidation related to his supporters. Black leaders signed a letter last week, which detailed alleged “hateful, violent, and racist threats” from people who identify as Sanders supporters. The alleged harassment followed the socialist senator’s loss of the Working Families Party (WFP) endorsement.

As Breitbart News reported:

A draft of the letter, obtained by Splinter News, claimed that Sanders supporters have called black leaders “Uncle Tom,” “Slave,” and “Cunt.” The alleged threats followed Sanders’ loss of the WFP endorsement, according to the letter. … The leaders continued, demanding the Sanders campaign “unequivocally denounce the racism in its ranks, and issue a public statement separating themselves from these abhorrent attacks.” They also urged Democrats across the board – both Sanders supporters and Warren supporters – to come together to “defeat one of the most serious threats to peace and justice in our lifetimes.” “We cannot wait to make justice real amongst the resisters — our lives literally depend on each other,” the leaders added in the letter.

Sanders followed up with a tweet, which read, “This campaign condemns racist bullying and harassment of any kind, in any space. We are building a multiracial movement for justice — that’s how we win the White House.”

Elizabeth Warren is now at the top tier of the 2020 field in the crucial Iowa caucuses. That notion drastically undersells how strong a position Warren is actually in.

Yes, Warren tops the field in the CNN-DMR poll with 22% support, followed by former Vice President Joe Biden at 20% (the poll has a four-point margin of error, putting the two essentially in a tie). Warren and Biden are followed distantly by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at 11%.

But that doesn't tell the whole story: The topline numbers are actually the least good thing for Warren in the poll.

Consider this:

* Warren gained 7 points from the June DMR/CNN poll and has almost tripled her support in the state from a December 2018 poll. Biden, meanwhile, has lost support in each of the four DMR/CNN polls between December 2018 and now. And Sanders dropped 5 points from just June until now.

* Her favorable numbers in the poll also make clear how much energy and passion is behind her candidacy presently. Three-quarters of those polled had a favorable view of her, including a whopping 44% who had a ""very favorable"" opinion. That compares very favorably to the 29% who view Biden very favorably and the 26% who feel that same way about Sanders.

* Warren is the first or second choice of 42% of those polled. That's well in front of Biden (30% first/second combined), Sanders (21%), South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (18%) and California Sen. Kamala Harris (16%).

Any one of those three data points would suggest that this poll may have only caught the start of Warren's rise in Iowa. All three together suggest she is well positioned to take off like a rocket ship in the state. Not only does she already have a broad-base of support in the state (as evidence by the topline numbers) but she also has significant passion among those who are for her and remains well-liked -- and a possible voting option -- for those who say she is their second choice at the moment.

That's not even taking into account Warren's grassroots operation, which is widely regarded as the best -- by a lot -- of any campaign in Iowa. Wrote the Des Moines Register on Sunday:

""Elizabeth Warren's slow but steady rise in the first-in-the-nation caucus state is as much a result of her robust organizational presence here as it is a response to the Massachusetts senator's many plans and policies, Iowa experts say ... the (poll) results were not surprising, said several Iowa Democrats who have watched Warren build out a team that is widely credited with having the most sophisticated organizational presence in the state.""

Add it all up and you get this: With 133 days left before the February 3 caucuses, Warren is the clear Iowa front-runner. There's simply no one else who can make anywhere near as strong a case -- either by polling or staff or both -- as Warren in the state.

Now, OF COURSE, 133 days is a long time in politics. Things can change. If past is prologue, there will be a handful of up and downs within the top tier between now and February 3. But it's very clear from the polling trends that Iowa is now Warren's to lose."

In a close race for third place, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders received 12% in the poll, followed by South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg with 10%.

This is the fourth qualifying poll to show Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard with 2% support or higher, meaning she has now met both the polling and fundraising requirements to join the other 11 candidates who have qualified for the October Democratic presidential debate hosted by CNN and The New York Times.

California Sen. Kamala Harris got 3%, and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Gabbard, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, investor Tom Steyer and businessman Andrew Yang received 2% each. All other candidates received 1% or less in the New Hampshire poll.

In July, CNN's poll with the University of New Hampshire found Biden, Warren and Sanders clustered at the top of the field, with 24% for Biden, and 19% each for Warren and Sanders.

Warren saw a significant jump in support from Monmouth's last poll of New Hampshire in May, mirroring other recent polling showing her increasing her backing in Iowa and nationally. She is up 19 percentage points since the spring in the new poll, while Biden dropped 11 percentage points, and Sanders dipped 6 percentage points.

Since May, Warren's support among those who describe themselves as liberal has increased 28 percentage points, while Sanders' has dropped 13 percentage points and Biden's down 7.

Likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire continue to prioritize beating President Donald Trump (61%) over voting for someone they agree with completely but who would have a hard time beating him (27%).

But most seem to think they can have it all if their choice wins the nomination. Almost 7 in 10 likely Democratic voters in New Hampshire said their candidate is the one they agree with the most, and over half (52%) said their candidate has the best chance against the president.

Warren holds the best favorability rating with 74% of likely New Hampshire voters who have a favorable opinion of the Massachusetts senator, 19% unfavorable. Biden's is down since May, with 66% who said they had a favorable opinion, 24% unfavorable, while Sanders receives 63% favorable, 28% unfavorable.

The Monmouth University Poll was conducted by telephone from September 17 to 21, 2019 with 401 New Hampshire voters who are likely to vote in the Democratic presidential primary in February 2020. Results among likely Democratic primary voters have a margin of error of +/- 4.9 percentage points."

In a rare strategy memo sent as part of a fundraising email to supporters Tuesday morning, Warren's campaign manager, Roger Lau , announced an eight-figure TV and digital campaign in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.

The memo shared three examples of ads, all featuring the theme of rooting out corruption, that the campaign plans to launch, though it did not clarify which of the three would run online, on television or both, and exactly when the ads would begin to air.

Lau noted that the campaign's biggest expense at the moment is staff but said he expects that to soon become media spending, with a bigger bulk of the expenditure going towards digital ads than TV.

""At the start of this campaign, we laid out how Elizabeth is going to win the primary and the general election -- by identifying the deep problems the country faces, creating plans to solve them, and building a grassroots movement to win in 2020 and make big, structural change in 2021 and beyond,"" Lau wrote.

As summer turns to fall, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden have separated themselves from the pack. The gold standard poll in Iowa showed Warren with 22% support and Biden with 20% of likely Democratic caucus-goers.

The new reality left more than a dozen other Democrats scrambling to keep the primary from turning into a two-person race -- with New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker offering an extraordinary admission that he might have no path forward.

Their weekend of retail politicking took place amid a national firestorm over reports that President Donald Trump had pressed the Ukrainian president to investigate the business dealings of Biden's son, Hunter Biden, in the country.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

Warren arrived in Iowa newly at war with Democratic leaders in Congress. She declared -- first in a fundraising email, then in her speech in front of 12,000 Democrats at the Polk County Steak Fry on Saturday -- that "" Congress is complicit "" in Trump's actions because the Democratic-led House has failed to begin impeachment proceedings.

""What the President has now demonstrated is that he thinks it's pretty clear he doesn't have to follow the law, and in fact can continue to commit high crimes and misdemeanors,"" Warren told reporters in Cedar Rapids. ""He can go back to the well on exactly what he did before. And that is invite and profit from foreign interference in our election. It's time for Congress to step up and begin serious impeachment proceedings against this man.""

Biden, meanwhile, was at times testy with reporters over the news. It's the sort of clash that Biden has relished -- one that gave him the opportunity to go toe-to-toe with Trump as if the general election had already arrived.

But Biden was also insistent that the focus should remain on Trump improperly inviting foreign interference in a US election -- not on Biden and his son.

""Trump did a terrible thing,"" he said Sunday in Kansas City, Kansas -- his first stop after two days in Iowa. ""Focus on the violation of the Constitution this President has engaged in.""

But as he campaigned in Iowa -- a climate change speech and an LGBTQ forum in Cedar Rapids on Friday, then a Steak Fry appearance Saturday -- there were signs of trouble, including a poll that showed Warren as the second choice of 20% of Democrats surveyed to Biden's 10% -- a potentially important factor given Iowa's unique caucus rules that will force those backing candidates with less than 15% support to move on to their second choices.

He also faced criticism over his response to the moderator at the LGBTQ forum.

Lyz Lenz, an Iowa-based journalist and author, had asked Biden a pointed question about his voting record and his reference to Vice President Mike Pence as a ""decent guy.""

Biden paused and responded: ""You're a lovely person."" Then, on the way off the stage, Lenz tweeted, Biden ""said to me dryly, 'You're a real sweetheart.' ""

""It's 2019 -- we shouldn't be calling professional women sweethearts,"" Lenz told CNN backstage.

In Iowa, Warren and Biden appear to be the dominant forces a little more than four months from the Democratic caucuses. But there remains room for movement.

The poll found that just 20% of likely caucus-goers have a first-choice candidate and say they are unlikely to be persuaded to support someone else.

That reality was underscored at the Polk County Steak Fry on Saturday: While many of the 12,000 tickets organizers said they sold to the event were purchased by campaigns that brought their own supporters in, many attendees who had purchased their own tickets or gotten them from their local Democratic parties said in interviews that they were still considering multiple candidates.

Harper Folsom, a 23-year-old student from Manchester, Iowa, said her top two candidates are Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro -- but she also likes Biden, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and Booker.

""I think it's important to have the most diverse amount of voices that we can,"" she said.

Still, many of the Steak Fry attendees said they are ready for the field to winnow -- and the CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll found evidence of who voters have already broadly dropped from the lists of candidates they are considering.

Only eight candidates are even viewed favorably by a clear majority of likely Democratic caucusgoers: Warren and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have by far the highest net favorability rating, followed by California Sen. Kamala Harris, Booker, Biden, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, O'Rourke and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Entrepreneur Andrew Yang is viewed favorably by just four percentage points more of those polled than see him unfavorably. And the rest of the field -- including Castro, billionaire investor Tom Steyer and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, all of whom might qualify for the party's October presidential debate -- is viewed unfavorably by a majority of likely Democratic caucusgoers.

Some candidates seeking a way out of the low single digits are turning to desperate measures.

Booker campaign manager Addisu Demissie started Saturday morning with a memo featuring an unusual and startling admission : If Booker couldn't raise $1.7 million by the end of the month, he'd have no path forward and would need to exit the race.

The tactic appeared to work, at least initially. Demissie tweeted Sunday morning that Saturday had been Booker's biggest online fundraising day of the campaign, hauling in $300,000.

Other candidates were looking for a break-out at the Steak Fry in front of a crowd so large that it would have accounted for 5% of the total turnout in Iowa's record-breaking 2008 Democratic caucuses.

As Warren lingered at the Steak Fry for hours to greet and take pictures with attendees, Castro jumped into the line, and the two had a warm exchange.

Harris' campaign has mastered the art of the entrance . She walked into the Steak Fry dancing alongside a marching drumline.

O'Rourke had one of the day's most memorable moments when he repeated his call for mandatory assault-style rifle buy-backs. He also took a jab at Democratic leaders in Washington, saying they should not ""live in fear"" of Trump and the National Rifle Association, days after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, had said no other members of the party agree with O'Rourke's position.

""This is how we free ourselves from fear. We decide what we believe in and we fight like hell to achieve it -- and we don't let anyone, whether it's the NRA, the corporations, or the political action committees, or even our fellow Democrats tell us what is possible and what is not possible,"" O'Rourke said. ""We the people decide what is possible in this country.""

""I thought Beto really got people motivated,"" said Ray Johnson, a 67-year-old consumer protection worker in West Des Moines.

He and his wife said they were also considering backing O'Rourke, as well as Warren and Buttigieg, and said they were most concerned with who will defeat Trump. Johnson said he likes Biden, but thinks Democrats need someone younger who can excite voters.

Buttigieg, meanwhile, is seeking to leverage the eye-popping $25 million he raised in the last fundraising quarter in Iowa, where he is already on the air with television ads.

His campaign bought the second-most tickets to the Steak Fry after Biden, and turned in the day's most raucous appearance as a light rain fell in Des Moines.

Then, Buttigieg started a four-day bus tour of Iowa -- with reporters in tow and allowed to ask the candidate questions at any point.

At the Steak Fry, Nikki Lunden, a 41-year-old warehouse worker from Iowa City, said Buttigieg is her favorite candidate -- but most importantly, she wants to support ""who's going to win it.""

Robert Hein, who had driven from Minnesota -- a Super Tuesday state -- with his wife Amy, said he was ""thinking maybe somebody young might be the better choice"" after hearing former President Jimmy Carter say there should be an ""age limit"" for the presidency that would exclude Biden. He said he was already impressed by Buttigieg and left even more so.

He said Biden represents ""a guarantee that we can get Trump out of there.""

""But the more I listen to these folks, I think there are a good number of them who have a good shot at beating him in November,"" he said."

Ilhan Omar indicated this weekend that she doesn't think Joe Biden should get her party's presidential nomination, arguing that the former vice president isn't progressive enough to excite voters.

""There are few people who fit into the kind of progress that we all want to see in this country,"" Omar said after she gave a keynote address at a candidates forum in Iowa, according to a report from The Guardian published Saturday. ""And I would say (Biden) is not one of them.""

""I think it has been very clear to many of the people who have been creating the kind of movement that is exciting generations, that we want somebody who really has a plan that is going to tackle a lot of the systematic challenges that we have, and he doesn't,"" the Minnesota lawmaker added, according to the paper.

Omar's office confirmed the comments to CNN.

The comments from the progressive congresswoman were made as a number of the 2020 Democratic candidates pitched themselves this weekend in the first-in-the-nation caucus state as the best contender to take on President Donald Trump. Biden, the pack's centrist front-runner, has faced tough criticism from his fellow candidates for his record, which some have knocked as not being progressive enough.

Mitt Romney said Sunday that it ""would be troubling in the extreme"" if President Donald Trump pressured Ukraine's president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden amid an ongoing controversy over a call Trump had with the foreign leader that was part of a whistleblower complaint.

In a tweet, Romney, who was his party's presidential nominee in 2012, also said it was ""critical"" for the facts surrounding the call to emerge.

""If the President asked or pressured Ukraine's president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out,"" Romney, who represents Utah, wrote in the tweet.

The comments from the prominent GOP senator are some of the strongest to come from his party, whose members have largely remained silent following news last week that a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General was concerned in part with a July 25 call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. On Sunday, after Trump acknowledged that he discussed Biden during the call but maintained that the conversation was ""warm and friendly,"" congressional Democrats urged an investigation into the matter, with some calling for Trump's impeachment.

CNN previously reported Trump pressed Zelensky in the call to investigate Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, in the past, has cautioned against impeaching Trump. Her comments on Tuesday came shortly before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry into the President. ""The actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the President's betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,"" Pelosi said in doing so.

Trump faces outrage over reports that he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July phone call to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son, Hunter. Trump on Sunday said that he did indeed discuss Biden with Zelensky -- at a time when the country was awaiting the aid package from the United States -- but he denied doing anything improper. The call is also the subject of a whistleblower complaint.

(CNN) The Democratic National Committee just announced the debate criteria for November. As expected, it has modestly raised the bar again, asking for candidates to meet a slightly higher polling and donor threshold than the last debates. But like my elderly cat when we got a slightly taller box spring, some candidates just can't make the leap.

And yet, we are hearing a lot of meowing of protest from the field. Candidates have said they are being forced to adjust their campaign strategies away from winning votes to meet these benchmarks; party insiders are saying the benchmarks are excluding highly credentialed voices in favor of celebrity candidates; and down-ballot Democrats are complaining the donor threshold is taking much-needed money away from their races.

But first, let's be clear that Democratic primary voters want to narrow the field. Generally speaking, a larger and more fractured field tends to benefit some front-runners (Joe Biden) while disadvantaging others (Elizabeth Warren). And, of course, no candidate left off the stage is going to praise a system that torpedoed his campaign, but even those candidates know they can't get their message across with 24 people on the stage. This is all to say, there is no solution to make everyone happy.

The Republican National Committee experienced much the same problem in 2016 and some of us would argue blew it in far more epic fashion. (Full disclosure: I worked for Carly Fiorina during 2016 and was watching the March debate from my hotel room as a handful of dudes tossed around not-so-veiled references to the size of their penises .) My point being that we should at least give the DNC credit for trying to trim the fat with a scalpel instead of the RNC's machete that arbitrarily set and reset qualifications each month based solely on poll numbers.

Even so, I am not the first to point out that there's something wrong here . Polling and fundraising don't measure whether someone will be a good president -- or even a good candidate. And incentivizing your candidates to spend money to meet those thresholds doesn't move the ball down the field for the party or the eventual nominee.

And of course, there's the absurdity of putting that much stock in national name recognition whereby the only way for your candidate to get exposure to tens of millions of viewers during the debate is to have high national poll numbers, which more often than not are simply a reflection of name recognition among voters who have already been exposed to that candidate. Captain Yossarian would be proud.

It's almost as if you'd be better off if you'd starred on a hit reality TV show for years instead of served as a governor or run a Fortune 50 company.

Defenders of the system, though, would say it's working. We started with 20 debaters, and by November, we may be down to eight

But here's the problem. If we had whittled the field too quickly in 1991, there would have been no President Clinton. By July of 1991, he had a polling average of only 1.7% -- in a tie for 13th place with Jay Rockefeller. As Nate Silver has pointed out , in two of the past nine cycles, the eventual Democratic nominee was not even in the top 10 by July -- and both Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton went on to win the presidency the next year.

So here's an alternative I'm proposing to the DNC:

The top three polling candidates according to an average of qualifying national polls get an automatic ticket to the stage. In the end, this is still our closest approximation to votes. But why should this be coupled with fundraising? If you're a great, progressive candidate who has managed to capture the support of 20% of your party's supporters without creating an enormous money machine, you have perhaps all the more reason to be on that stage.

Any candidate with a million individual donors gets a ticket. The goal of this metric isn't to reward a big fundraising haul but to measure support that may not be showing up in the polls. The threshold, therefore, must be meaningful and high. Bernie Sanders is the only candidate to hit this number so far. But by way of example, if Sanders were polling at only 2% nationwide, would the DNC really want to exclude a guy with a million high-enthusiasm Democratic voters who presumably has a uniquely powerful message that is resonating with those who have heard it?

Any candidate with more than 15% support when the same polling averages are weighted for name recognition would be on the stage. Silver has a nice chart on adjusted polling averages here. But in short, if two candidates both have 5% in the latest poll but Candidate A's names is familiar to 80% of voters and Candidate B is known by only 30% of voters, we would assume Candidate B would poll higher than Candidate A if all voters knew who both of them were. So you would ""weight"" that poll by multiplying their support as if they had the same name recognition as the most well-known candidate (Biden). Suddenly, Candidate B would have a weighted polling average just over 15%. Side note: It boggles my mind why this hasn't already happened. If voters haven't heard your message because you're, let's say, the governor of Montana without a lot of national airtime, why would the party want to limit your only chance to reach a broader audience with how you've succeeded in implementing progressive policies? And on the flip side, if you are a celebrity politician with near-universal name recognition among voters but only 4% support in a poll, do we really need to hear more?

These rules would have ensured Clinton made the stage in 1991. Ironically, it also would have excluded Biden in 2007 (along with Dennis Kucinich, Wesley Clark and Chris Dodd, among others).

And what of 2020? Of course, it's impossible to say for sure because the candidates would have run their campaigns differently if the DNC rules had been, well, different. Like those who talk about the popular vote versus the Electoral College, you can't rerun the game with different rules and assume the same inputs.

But as of July, the field would have been narrowed to Biden, Sanders, Kamala Harris, Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke. And given how close Cory Booker and Andrew Yang would have been to the cutoff, it seems fair to assume they would have tweaked their strategies to get to an adjusted 5% as well.

Funny enough, it's the same eight who will probably be on the stage come November. But it sure sounds a lot fairer, doesn't it?"

Many strikes are over quickly. In 2007, the last national strike against GM lasted only a few days. Another UAW strike against Chrysler that year was resolved in a matter of hours. To protect its strike fund, the UAW doesn't start parceling out strike benefits to members until Day 8.

The strike benefits will cost the union about $12.5 million a week. The UAW is also paying for members' health insurance during the strike, making Cobra payments on their behalf. The union had nearly $800 million in its strike fund at the end of last year, meaning that it could go about a year paying strike benefits before it would deplete the fund. The fund is built up over time by UAW member dues, which can come to about 2-1/2 hours pay per month.

Negotiators from the union andwere back at it on Monday morning, after holding talks throughout the weekend. The two sides report making some progress but say they remain far apart on many key issues. The strike began in the early hours of Monday, September 16.

The union is pressing the company to agree to relocate some vehicles built at plants in Mexico to the two US assembly plants that are slated to close. The union said GM builds far more vehicles in Mexico than rivalsof

GM said it has put forward ""solutions"" for the two plants — in Lordstown, Ohio and Detroit — and is offering to invest $7 billion in its American operations to create or keep 5,400 hourly jobs. A person familiar with the company's offer said it is proposing to build an electric truck in the Detroit plant and lithium batteries for electric vehicles in Lordstown. But that work probably wouldn't begin for several years, meaning the plants would be dark until then.

GM announced plans to close those facilities , as well as transmission plants in Warren, Michigan, and Baltimore in November. The four plants employed about 3,000 hourly workers when those closings were announced. GM said it has found other jobs for about 2,300 of those workers, but many people had to relocate.

The union and company are also reportedly still not in agreement on GM's use of temporary hourly workers, as well as about wages and benefits.

The strike is the longest national strike against GM in more than 20 years, one or two plants have been the target of longer strikes in the past. This strike has shut all of GM's 31 US factories spread across nine states, mostly in the center of the country, as well as 21 other facilities, idling nearly 50,000 hourly workers. It is the largest strike against a private sector business since the 2007 strike against GM.

The $250 benefits are much less than the pay that union members are losing because of the strike. GM says that hourly workers earn an average of $90,000 a year, although that includes profit sharing and overtime. To qualify for the strike pay, workers must walk the picket line or do other things related to the strike.

The strike benefits also are subject to income tax. The union will issue 1099 forms to members if their benefits cross the $600 mark.

There is pressure on GM to reach a settlement sooner rather than later. Moody's credit rating agency has said that if the strike goes on for more than one-to-two weeks, ""the financial burden of a strike will become more material."" That could be bad news for GM since it's credit rating rating is currently only one step above junk bond status . If it was downgraded into junk bond status, it could raise the cost of its borrowing in the future.

GM's debt was downgraded into junk bond status in 2005, several years before it ended up in bankruptcy court and in need of a federal bailout in 2009. It took until 2013 for it to shake that rating, and have its debt classified as ""investment grade.""

-- Update: This story has been updated to better reflect what Moody's credit rating statement could mean for GM.

-- Correction: An earlier version of the headline incorrectly stated how much the strikers will get paid from the UAW strike fund."

Warren’s renewed call for impeachment follows reports of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) holding a 4 p.m. Democrat caucus meeting on Tuesday to discuss impeachment. While Pelosi has been hesitant to pursue the matter – telling Democrats during a caucus-wide call in August the public, “isn’t there on impeachment” – her Democrat colleagues appear to be using the alleged “whistleblower” case to push the inquiry, as the Mueller investigation turned out to be a bust:

The alleged whistleblower, who did not even directly hear the purported conversations from Ukrainian leaders, claimed the president urged officials to reopen inquiries into Hunter Biden’s business dealings. As Breitbart News reported, “it is not clear what law, if any, Trump would have broken by urging the Ukrainian government to re-open the case.”

While estimates slightly vary, Democrats are short of a pro-impeachment majority in the House, with 175 in support out of the 235 member caucus. Democrats need 218 votes in the House to make it a reality. Even so, the inquiry would likely flop in the Republican-led Senate, requiring a two-thirds majority – or 67 senators – to vote in favor of impeaching the president.

Warren has increased her calls for impeachment in recent days, arguing that Congress should have taken swift action following the release of the Mueller report, despite the former special counsel not finding any evidence of collusion or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.

“After the Mueller report, Congress had a duty to begin impeachment,” Warren wrote last Friday.

“By failing to act, Congress is complicit in Trump’s latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in US elections. Do your constitutional duty and impeach the president,” she continued, accusing Trump of continuing to commit crimes:

A president is sitting in the Oval Office, right now, who continues to commit crimes. He continues because he knows his Justice Department won't act and believes Congress won’t either. Today’s news confirmed he thinks he’s above the law. If we do nothing, he’ll be right. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 20, 2019

The focus group, conducted by Engagious/Focus Pointe Global and reported by Axios, included “included 7 women who flipped from Barack Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016, and 2 who switched from Mitt Romney to Hillary Clinton.”

As Axios noted, while the focus group preferred Warren’s policies, they were put off by her personality.

While some described Warren as “nice,” and “confident,” they did not feel stirred by her or passionate about her.

“I like what she had to say but I still think she’s a sorry bitch,” one said. “I just — the way she acts, and some of the things — I just don’t care for her.”

Another disagreed with the use of the word “bitch” but said Warren said sounded “fake,” even if her ideas were good.

Warren has struggled to convince even her own voters of her electability. At a town hall meeting last month in Franconia, New Hampshire — the first to spark national attention to the growing size of Warren’s crowds — one attendee told Breitbart News that while she liked Warren, she could not see her beating President Donald Trump.

Though the Engagious/FPG data is accompanied by a warning that it is not a statistically representative sample, the information provides clues about what messages are currently resonating with the Democratic electorate.

Axios reports that the results “reflected the doubts that some people have about women in leadership,” but seven of the nine women said they did not know anyone who refused to vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016 because of her gender. Six said that they would vote for Trump if the presidential election were to be held again tomorrow.

Two-thirds (six of nine) also said that it was worth some economic pain to fight China for fairer terms of trade.

A recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll came to a slightly different conclusion — namely, that voters nationwide did not like Trump’s personality, but were also skeptical of the left-wing policies being offered by most Democrats.

Wisconsin was a key to Trump’s victory in 2016; Clinton avoided campaigning there, while Trump made several visits to the state in the last days of the election. Democrats will hold their 2020 convention in Milwaukee.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, meanwhile, fell to second place with 20 percent, while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) trailed in third with 11 percent.

When Democrat primary voters were asked who their second choice for president would be, Warren gained 20 percent of voters for a combined first and second choice tally of 42 percent. Biden, on the other hand, is only the second choice for about ten percent of voters, while Sanders about doubles his prospects.

Warren had led hugely against her Democrat contenders in an Iowa Starting Line-Change Research poll from August. In that poll, Warren surged past Biden and Sanders by 11 points, earning nearly 30 percent of support overall.

Since the second Democrat presidential primary debate on September 12, Warren’s Real Clear Politics average of Iowa polls leads all other candidates with 23 percent. Biden comes in with 20.3 percent average post-debate in Iowa, while Sanders garners 12 percent.

Warren’s surge in Iowa, though, has been met with confrontation from some farmers in the agricultural state who vehemently oppose the Green New Deal, which she has endorsed. In one conversation, an Iowa farmer confronted Warren over her support for the plan, which he said would cripple his industry because of its goals to eliminate cows.

It’s not just Iowa where Warren is surging. Across the country, Warren has steadily climbed over Biden and Sanders to take the lead.

The latest Civiqs/DataProgress poll conducted this month put Warren at 30 percent with likely Democrat primary voters. Biden fell to second place with 24 percent and Sanders trailed with 14 percent.

In an Economist/YouGov poll taken in the second week of September, Warren tied with Biden nationally with each taking 26 percent of Democrat primary voters. Sanders, at third, came in at 16 percent.

Even in California, where Biden has led the pack in most statewide polls, Warren took the lead in the latest Change Research poll, getting 25 percent compared to Biden’s 23 percent. At stake in California for 2020 Democrats are about 416 delegates.

Warren’s recent taking the lead in key Democrat primary states and polls has come after embarrassing mishaps in which she formally apologized to Native Americans for spending years claiming to be Native American herself. Those critics, though, have been reluctant to accept her apology, as Breitbart News noted.

The flops on the campaign trail are far from being in the past for Warren. Last week, she exaggerated for the third time the size of her campaign rally crowds. After holding a rally in Washington Square in New York City, the Warren campaign claimed 20,000 people were at the event. New York City Parks confirmed that Washington Square can only hold a maximum of 10,000 people.

Similarly, in August, Warren’s campaign claimed that 12,000 people were in attendance at her rally on the campus of Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota. The maximum capacity of the venue, though, is about 3,000 people, and with crowd spillover, there could not have been more than 6,000 attendees.

In New Hampshire, Warren’s campaign claimed there were 700 people in attendance at a rally on a farm. Breitbart News was there and judged the crowd at about “over 300.”

Built mostly on the perception of a grassroots populist campaign, Warren’s run for president has seen her take on multinational corporations for outsourcing American jobs and promising an economic patriotist agenda even while using billionaire donor money and pleasing the donor class by taking a mass illegal and legal immigration position.

Despite her anti-establishment messaging, Warren has reportedly been in talks with Democrat Party establishment figures like failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and has received praise from former Senator Harry Reid. One Democrat strategist told NBC News that Clinton has been impressed with Warren’s campaign thus far.

Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) has qualified for the fourth Democrat presidential primary debate, making her the twelfth 2020 White House hopeful to satisfy the Democrat National Committee’s (DNC) requirements.

Gabbard garnered 2 percent support in a Monmouth University poll in New Hampshire published Tuesday, placing her at four DNC-sanctioned surveys where she enjoyed at least two percent support. The Hawaii congresswoman hit the other DNC debate threshold, which requires candidates score over 130,000 campaign donors.

In addition to Gabbard, other 2020 White House hopefuls participating in the October debate are: former vice president Joe Biden, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Cory Booker (D-NJ), South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Rep. Robert Francis “Beto” Rourke, billionaire climate crusader Tom Steyer, and technology entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

The next debate, co-hosted by the New York Times and CNN, is scheduled for October 15th in Westerville, Ohio.

News of Gabbard’s inclusion in the fourth debate comes one day after the DNC announced intensified requirements for candidates to clinch a spot at the fifth debate in November. White House hopefuls will need to garner at 3 percent or higher in four polls or at least 5 percent in a pair of early-state polls as well as enjoys the support of 165,000 campaign donors."

Many Americans are frightened by the left-wing vision promoted by Democrats, said Olsen.

“I think it’s clear that a lot of [Democrat] policies — and particularly the stridency with which they are promoted — scare a lot of people, even the people who don’t like President Trump,” assessed Olsen.

LISTEN:



Olsen continued, “[Full-wokeness] would mobilize every Trump supporter to make sure they get out and vote, because the combination of economic policies and the cultural stridency unites every wing of the Trump coalition.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) record of supporting “full-woke” positions will become a political liability in a presidential election, determined Olsen.

“I have a hard time seeing how Warren can avoid that,” speculated Olsen. “She might want to campaign on the economy, but on the other hand, she’s already gone full-woke. She’s already called for reparations. She’s already said that the border should be decriminalized, [and] that there should be no such thing as illegal immigration. She’s already embraced radical positions on abortion.”

Olsen added, “It’s very hard to see how [Elizabeth Warren] avoids talking about that, because you know that the president and Republicans will remind her over and over and over again. I think she’s already stepped into that, so to speak, and it’s going to be hard for her to extricate herself.”

Trump’s greatest political threat is from a Democrat nominee who escapes “full-wokeness,” said Olsen.

“The most formidable opponent [for Donald Trump] is anyone who doesn’t scare the middle,” Olsen stated. “Right now, [Joe Biden] is avoiding full-wokeness. He’s talking about things in a way where he goes part of the way, but he doesn’t go all the way there.”

Joe Biden may move further left over the course of the Democrats’ presidential nomination process, noted Olsen.

“It’s not clear that the Biden we’re seeing now is the Biden we’re going to see in February,” Olsen said. “Will he move left — and sharply left — to get himself the nomination? I don’t know. And I think that if Biden does, then that — plus his notable penchant for gaffes and his obvious inability to maintain a steady debate performance across an entire two hours — will eventually be questions that voters will consider.”

Mansour highlighted a recent focus group of female swing voters examining Warren’s political appeal, inviting Olsen’s analysis on the Massachusetts senator’s likability.

Warren’s “demeanor,” arraigned Olsen, is unappealing to a broad swathe of the electorate.

“I’ve been watching the Democratic debates, and the thing that strikes me — as a former graduate of a well-ranked law school — is how much she reminds me of what she actually is, which is a law professor,” Olsen expressed.

Olsen continued, “The same demeanor of ‘the professor’s always right,’ staring straight out as if you were looking at a class with 200 students in it, and conducting the sort of pointed discussion that really doesn’t admit of discussion.”

Olsen went on, “Unfortunately, the election is not a classroom where students have to agree with you or be quiet. … In an election, people decide whether or not they like the person at the front of the room, and it doesn’t surprise me that a lot of people who don’t already agree with her positions — not just the populist positions, but the whole demeanor of ‘everything is awful and needs to be thrown upside down’ — [don’t] find her terribly attractive, particularly people who don’t have college degrees.”

According to the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, when all American voters are asked to rank 12 policies from best to worst, a plan to provide taxpayer-funded healthcare to all illegal aliens — endorsed by Democrat front-runners like Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) — ranks as the least popular among the bunch.

The Journal notes:

Of 12 policy ideas tested in the poll, providing government-sponsored health care to undocumented immigrants was the least popular among the broader electorate, with 62% rejecting it. In a June Democratic debate, all 10 candidates on the stage, including Messrs. Biden and Sanders, raised their hands when asked who backed the idea. In the new survey, it was supported by 64% of Democratic primary voters but only 36% of voters overall. [Emphasis added]

As Breitbart News estimated, providing free healthcare to every illegal alien in the U.S. would cost up to $66 billion a year or $660 billion over a decade to American taxpayers. Already, Americans are forced to subsidize illegal aliens’ medical costs to the sum of almost $20 billion a year.

The Urban Institute’s Linda Blumberg, a health insurance expert, told the New York Times that such a policy providing free healthcare for every foreign national who crosses the U.S.-Mexico border or overstays a visa would drive a migration of “people with serious health problems” to the country.

Similar polls conducted in recent months found that American anywhere between 60 to 63 percent of swing voters oppose offering free healthcare to illegal aliens, as well as 55 to 59 percent of all U.S. voters.

The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll of 900 registered voters was conducted between September 13 and 16 with a margin of error of +/- 3.27 percentage points.

Ilhan Omar (D-MN) declared over the weekend that former Vice President Joe Biden doesn’t have what it takes to achieve “systemic” social change — yet another indication that his 2020 bid faces heavy skepticism from the Democrat Party’s progressive wing.

“There are few people who fit into the kind of progress that we all want to see in this country,” Omar said in an interview with the Guardian on Saturday. “And I would say he is not one of them.”

“I think it has been very clear to many of the people who have been creating the kind of movement that is exciting generations, that we want somebody who really has a plan that is going to tackle a lot of the systematic challenges that we have, and he doesn’t,” she added.

Omar’s criticism of Biden came after delivering a keynote address at the Iowa People’s Presidential Forum, an event organized by several progressive organizations, in which she argued the United States needs a president who “realizes we are not just fighting for one election; we are fighting for the very soul of our democracy and what society we want to become.”

Several Democrat presidential candidates —including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg — attended the gathering.

The far-left “Squad” member is not the only lawmaker in the four-person clique to raise concerns about Biden’s bid for the White House. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), an author of the Green New Deal, has repeatedly taken aim at Biden’s climate change proposal for fossil fuels to be eliminated by 2050. However, according to the New York Democrat, the former Veep’s plan is too little, too late.

“Scientifically, anything that is less than helping us cut carbon emissions in half by 2030 is going to be too late,” she said. “It’s a start, and I think that what that has shown is a dramatic shift in the right direction, but we need to keep pushing for a plan that is at the scale of the problem.”

Ocasio-Cortez also previously knocked Biden’s performance at the first Democratic presidential debate, saying it “raised questions” about his capacity to be commander-in-chief.

“I think Joe Biden, his performance on the stage, kind of raised some questions in respect to that,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “But I don’t want to say just because someone is 79, they can’t or shouldn’t run for president. I don’t want to… use a number as a proxy for capacity,” she told The New Yorker radio hour in July."

The DNC is raising both the fundraising threshold as well as the polling standards, making it even more difficult for presidential hopefuls to lay out their vision on the national debate stage in November. In order to qualify, a candidate will have to report at least 165,000 individual donors, up from 130,000. The DNC is also requiring 600 unique donors in at least 20 states.

Candidates will have two ways to qualify for the debate via polling, either receiving five percent support in two early primary and caucus state polls – which includes Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina – or receiving three percent support in four early primary and caucus state polls or national polls.

While details of the November date are to be determined, any polls released “between Sept. 13 and midnight seven days before the debate” will count, the New York Times added, noting that “at least eight candidates have already met the 165,000-donor threshold.”

Candidates have until October 1 to qualify for next month’s debate at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. In order to qualify, a candidate must garner at least two percent in four DNC-approved polls and report 130,000 individual donors, up from the 65,000 required for the first debate. Eleven candidates have qualified, including Tom Steyer (D). He will be joined by:

Joe Biden (D)

Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ)

Julián Castro (D)

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA)

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN)

Beto O’Rourke (D)

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)

Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D)

Andrew Yang (D)

Both Marianne Williamson (D) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) are still vying to get on the October debate stage, needing three polls and two polls, respectively.

The increased threshold is likely to draw critiques from low-tier candidates, who slammed the DNC’s requirements in the past.

“Here’s the situation: there’s a whole bunch of different polls that have come out. The DNC has only recognized some of them as being qualifying polls for the debate,” Gabbard told Tucker Carlson in August.

“The whole thing gets a little bit confusing. You’ve gotta jump way down into the weeds of the numbers and statistics, but I think the bigger problem is that whole process really lacks transparency,” she added.

“The DNC’s process is stifling debate at a time when we need it most,” Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) declared last month. “And it will NOT help us beat Donald Trump. If we wanted to be the party that excluded people, we’d be Republicans”:

“If the DNC had followed the process they announced in February and kept to the promised 17 [sic] qualifying polls, the lineup of the upcoming third debate might be very different,” Williamson’s communications director Patricia Ewing said prior to the third Democrat debate in Houston, Texas."

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) declared on Tuesday that “billionaires should not exist” as part of the rollout of his massive proposal to redistribute wealth in America via an “extreme wealth” tax, which he claims will “reduce the outrageous level of inequality that exists in America today.”

Sanders unveiled his plan to redistribute wealth in the U.S. via an “extreme wealth tax,” which the socialist senator says will apply to the “top 0.1 percent.” While Sanders’ plan is reminiscent of Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) proposed wealth tax, it goes even further, taxing more individuals at even higher rates.

For example, Sanders proposes to implement a one percent tax on couples with a net worth over $32 million. The percentage increases alongside the value of assets:

The tax rate would increase to 2 percent on net worth from $50 to $250 million, 3 percent from $250 to $500 million, 4 percent from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent from $1 to $2.5 billion, 6 percent from $2.5 to $5 billion, 7 percent from $5 to $10 billion, and 8 percent on wealth over $10 billion.

“These brackets are halved for singles,” Sanders explains.

The socialist senator admits the goal of his ultra-progressive redistribution proposal, boasting that — under his plan — the wealth of billionaires “would be cut in half over 15 years” and declaring that “billionaires should not exist”:

Billionaires should not exist. https://t.co/hgR6CeFvLa — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 24, 2019

There is no justice when three billionaires are able to own more wealth than the bottom half of the entire country. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 24, 2019

There should be no billionaires. We are going to tax their extreme wealth and invest in working people. Read the plan: https://t.co/RJDLvX5H4c — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 24, 2019

Sanders’ proposal would also spur the creation of a “national wealth registry” and provide an “increase in IRS funding” in order to manage a swell of new audits.

It states:

In order to ensure that the wealthy are not able to evade the tax, the proposal includes a number of key enforcement policies. First, it would create a national wealth registry and significant additional third party reporting requirements. Second, it includes an increase in IRS funding for enforcement and requires the IRS to perform an audit of 30 percent of wealth tax returns for those in the 1 percent bracket and a 100 percent audit rate for all billionaires. Third, the wealth tax includes a 40 percent exit tax on the net value of all assets under $1 billion and 60 percent over $1 billion for all wealthy individual seeking to expatriate to avoid the tax. Finally, the wealth tax proposal will include enhancements to the international tax enforcement and anti-money laundering regime including the strengthening of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.

The presidential candidate argues the U.S. already taxes inherited wealth via the estate tax and says his proposal is constitutional, citing two Yale law professors, Bruce Ackerman and Anne Alstott, who have expressed support for the radical concept. Sanders adds that it is “not radical” to ask the wealthy to “pay their fair share.”

His proposal is expected to result in $4.5 trillion over the next decade, according to University of California, Berkeley, economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. Nonetheless, that number does not come close to paying for his expansive, expensive proposals, such as his $16 trillion Green New Deal proposal or Medicare for All, which could — by some estimates — cost the U.S. over $60 trillion over the next decade alone.

Sanders’ ideological ally, Warren, has also introduced a wealth tax, although it does not go as far. She proposes implementing a two percent wealth tax on those with $50 million in assets, as opposed to Sanders’ $32 million. Warren’s plan increases the tax to three percent for those with assets of $1 billion or greater, with no distinction between couples or single filers. She, like Sanders, plans to fund her costly proposals via the wealth tax, although Saez and Zucman estimate that her proposal would result in $2.6 trillion over the next decade, $1.9 trillion less than Sanders’ proposal.

“If we make the top 0.1% pay their fair share in taxes, their quality of life would not change at all,” Sanders tweeted following the announcement of his redistribution scheme.

“But we would be able to invest in housing, child care and health care and improve the lives of millions of working people,” he added:"

With zero legislative accomplishments since retaking the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections, after nearly a year filled with contentious investigations, hearings, and the coming opening of a formal impeachment inquiry, Democrats are betting it all on a quixotic mission to try to take out Trump with impeachment.

A problem they face is that they need 218 votes to pass articles of impeachment out of the House, and an even-steeper 67-vote threshold in the U.S. Senate to convict and remove the president from office. At this stage, Democrats do not even have 218 votes despite their 235-seat majority–they are somewhere, at best for the pro-impeachment crowd, somewhere around 175 pro-impeachment votes but with growing momentum. In the Senate, there is next to zero chance that 20 Republicans would join all 47 Democrats to vote to convict Trump on impeachment charges.

But Democrats, after failing to take on major legislative issues like infrastructure, healthcare, paid family leave, or anything else for that matter, are now pushing forward with opening official impeachment proceedings against Trump.

Via @mikedebonis and @rachaelmbade, Pelosi is now ""discussing the creation of a select committee to conduct the possible impeachment of President Trump.” https://t.co/PIxMZZeDzt — Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) September 24, 2019

A House Democrat tells me it's ""very likely"" that Pelosi will announce a formal impeachment inquiry this afternoon and signal her own support for impeachment. — Jennifer Bendery (@jbendery) September 24, 2019

The Democrats spent all year conducting hearings and investigations related to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, only to fail–as the Special Counsel Robert Mueller probe also failed–to find any evidence of collusion or conspiracy between Trump and his campaign and the Russians. Mueller’s investigation and the Democrat-led investigations also failed to uncover evidence of obstruction of justice by Trump, leaving Democrats empty-handed heading into the August recess back in July.

But now, after the emergence of complaints by a supposed “whistleblower” against Trump with regard to a conversation he had with Ukraine’s newly-elected leader about former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden’s business dealings in the Eastern European NATO ally nation, Democrats have reinvigorated their push for impeachment. They are buoyed by a swelling of support from members in key battleground House districts and renewed energy from top Democrats in leadership, including in particular House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has reportedly told her friends that she views impeachment as inevitable now.

It remains unclear exactly what the Democrats would be impeaching Trump for. The content of the supposed “whistleblower” complaint about Trump’s call with Ukraine’s new president Volodymyr Zelensky remains private, as does the transcript of the call. The president has said he is considering releasing the call transcript, but has not done so yet–and he expressed concerns that releasing a call transcript could produce a chilling effect among world leaders who wish to have honest and frank conversations with the president of the United States.

But on Tuesday afternoon, after news broke that Pelosi was moving forward with impeachment, Trump announced via Twitter he has ordered the release of the call transcript in full:

I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019

….You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019

What’s more, the supposed “whistleblower” technically does not qualify as a whistleblower under the federal law that provides protection to such individuals, despite the media and leftists referring to the person as such, and the person apparently did not even bear witness to the call itself. Even if Trump did what was alleged, it is unclear how that would amount to an illegal act worthy of impeachment and conviction of a U.S. president, as several Republicans like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) have said.

Nonetheless, impeachment is less of a legal question and more of a political matter. Polling shows impeaching Trump remains very unpopular nationwide, and with 31 Democrats sitting in districts in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016–13 of which he won by more than six percent–with even more than that filling out a broader ring of vulnerable members nearing 50, Democrats could imperil their chances of holding their majority if they go through with this process.

To hit the threshold necessary to impeach Trump–218 votes–Pelosi would need to force several self-portrayed “moderate” Democrats in these approximately 50 battleground districts to support impeachment by voting for it. That prospect, getting these Democrats who go home to the district and campaign on doing things to help their constituents–to actually vote for anti-Trump craze mania has Republicans nationally salivating.

Pelosi has held off the left side of her conference all year on impeachment, arguing it would be a perilous political mission that would endanger Democrats and embolden Trump. But with the rise of the so-called “Squad” led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), a New York socialist, Pelosi has allowed the growth of these rising leftist forces in her conference all year, to the point where Ocasi0-Cortez has taken the driver’s seat in pushing the party’s agenda, the other side of the Democrat conference be damned.

Over the weekend, Ocasio-Cortez ripped Democrats for holding back on impeachment–ginning up the left side of the conference, firing up the Democrat base, and forcing Pelosi into action:

At this point, the bigger national scandal isn’t the president’s lawbreaking behavior – it is the Democratic Party’s refusal to impeach him for it. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 22, 2019

It is one thing for a sitting president to break the law. It’s another to let him. The integrity of our democracy isn’t threatened when a president breaks the law. It‘s threatened when we do nothing about it. The GOP’s silence & refusal to act shouldn’t be a surprise. Ours is. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 22, 2019

Now that Pelosi has jumped at the behest of the 29-year-old socialist freshman from New York and her fellow “Squad” members Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), Ocasio-Cortez is ripping Pelosi for only doing a committee–saying she wants instead a straight-up impeachment vote.

Yes, this is an emergency. We don’t have the luxury of time w/ another committee. Judiciary has been investigating& putting the pieces together for months. Impeachment belongs there. We must honor jurisdiction, historical precedent,& work done + allow Judiciary to move forward. https://t.co/CM0gXN7T1i — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 24, 2019

The complexity of how to structure impeachment proceedings is meaningless in the broader scheme of things politically, Republicans argue, because now in the GOP’s view the Democrat Party–and all of its members–have officially jumped the shark by going for broke on Trump impeachment, facts be damned.

Two supposedly “moderate” New York Democrats who joined the impeachment brigade this week, Reps. Antonio Delgado (D-NY) and Sean Patrick Maloney (D-NY), are already under fire back home in their district as Empire State Republicans hammer away at them for siding with the lunacy of Ocasio-Cortez.

New York GOP chairman Nick Langworthy said in a statement:

By joining the impeachment mob, Antonio Delgado and Sean Patrick Maloney just abandoned their constituents in favor of AOC and the Squad. The radical left’s endless obsession with trying to take out President Trump and derail his agenda will be rejected by the voters who want their representatives to focus on making their lives better, not their own power. This reckless decision will rightfully go down as the one that cost them their seats.

They are hardly alone. Two Virginia Democrat freshman women, Reps. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) and Elaine Luria (D-VA)–both freshman Democrats representing battleground House districts who co-signed an op-ed with five others nationwide in the Washington Post on Monday evening signaling their openness to impeaching Trump–are under fire in Virginia now for abandoning their constituents in favor of impeachment.

“Both Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger were already critically endangered heading into 2020, by publicly joining the left-wing impeachment jihad they are clearly angling for post-Elected office job opportunities,” John Findlay, the executive director of the Virginia Republican Party, told Breitbart News on Tuesday. “The Republican Party of Virginia already has field staff on the ground this year in preparation for 2020 and will only be expanding our presence as next November approaches.”

Another co-signer of their op-ed, Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA)–a freshman Democrat who represents Pennsylvania’s sixth congressional district, another battleground–is facing criticism already for siding with the radical efforts to impeach Trump while not delivering on substantive policy matters.

“Representative Chrissy Houlahan has gone Washington as she continues to prove that she cares more about partisan politics than finding solutions to the challenges we face here in Pennsylvania,” John Emmons, a conservative businessman running for the GOP nomination in Pennsylvania’s sixth district for the shot to take on Houlahan next November, told Breitbart News on Tuesday. “She’d rather go after the President and try to get onto CNN than get to work for the people of her district. The voters of PA-06 deserve so much better out of their Member of Congress.”

Rep. Jason Crow (D-CO), a freshman who co-signed the op-ed and represents a battleground district in Colorado after defeating a GOP incumbent in 2018, took a hit in Colorado for signing onto impeachment.

“From his call for impeachment to his extreme voting record, Jason Crow has put his constituents on the backburner and placed his personal ambitions ahead of the interests of working people,” Colorado GOP spokesman Kyle Kohli told Breitbart News. “Colorado’s 6th district won’t forget how Crow sided with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Nancy Pelosi over them.”

In Michigan, one of the op-ed’s cosigners, Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), and another fellow freshman Democrat, Rep. Haley Stevens (D-MI), joined the impeachment charade this week as well–and also are paying for it.

Michigan GOP chairwoman Laura Cox said in a statement:

Today, Elissa Slotkin and Haley Stevens decided to join with Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the most radical members of their party by jumping on the impeachment bandwagon. For nearly three years, Democrats and their allies in the media have conducted a witch-hunt against President Trump in an attempt to undo the results of the 2016 election. Time and time again their accusations have been proven false, and I find it shameful that Slotkin and Stevens have chosen to put their political ambitions ahead of the real issues facing their constituents.

These are just a taste of the lines of attack Republicans have ready for the Democrats if they continue wallowing deeper into this mess. The extent to which the impeachment fight, along with other national trends heading into next year’s presidential and congressional elections, could affect the outcome of the 2020 elections could be monstrous.

“By pushing for impeachment, Democrats and their allies in the media are making a major strategic mistake,” Andy Surabian, a GOP strategist and former White House official who advises the president’s son Donald Trump, Jr., told Breitbart News. “They’re literally walking directly into a buzz saw and don’t even seem to realize it.”

What’s more, while they draw attention to the Biden-Ukraine corruption questions, Biden continues slipping in the polls in the Democrat primary. Biden’s team has attempted to frame this battle as a sign that Trump is worried about facing the former Vice President head-to-head, while avoiding answering questions about what he did as Vice President in Ukraine in connection with getting a prosecutor investigating a company on whose board his son served fired in exchange for releasing U.S. taxpayer-funded aid and then bragging about it at a public event.

But in reality, the intense scrutiny is waking the country–including many Democrat voters who may not have known much about Hunter Biden’s business dealing in Ukraine or in China or elsewhere and how much of a liability they could be to his father politically.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)–a leftist socialist rising star on the hard edge of her party far outside the mainstream–has surged past Biden in polling in several states including Iowa, New Hampshire, and California. She is virtually or statistically tied with Biden in a number of national polls as well and has seen her numbers increase even in Biden strongholds like Nevada–leaving South Carolina as basically the only early state refuge for the one-time Democrat frontrunner.

If Warren is able to sustain this surge into winning the nomination, while Biden keeps slipping and falling away–all while Trump powers his way through this mess as he has done several times before with other Democrat-driven scandals–the 2020 election could end up becoming a Warren-versus-Trump referendum of socialism-versus-capitalism where the Democrat Party’s new extremist wing takes center stage with no accomplishments to point to since they won the House majority back–all part of why they are going for impeachment in the first place, because they have no other path to beat Trump, some Republicans argue, so they are going for broke with this strategy.

“Despite an all-out assault on President Trump, he still has a higher approval rating than Obama did at this point in time,” Steve Guest of the Republican National Committee said. “This round of baseless calls for impeachment is the Democrats’ acknowledgment of their inability to beat President Trump at the ballot box so they’ll try impeachment instead.”"

The actor-activist hosted the LGBTQ presidential forum in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Friday, which featured all of the Democrat presidential candidates except Sanders.

The 38-year-old star spoke to the Guardian following the forum and criticized Sanders for skipping the event.

“I was disappointed to not see all of the candidates here. I was further disappointed to hear this was not the only LGBTQ event Bernie was making other commitments for,” Ross said. “You don’t show up for both of our LGBTQ events? That’s obviously telling us all we need to know.”

The Pose actor claimed access to inside information, which purportedly revealed that Sanders’ prior commitments included visiting historically black colleges and universities as well as an “old black barbershop”:

I’m going to risk being super real here for a second. When you’re on the campaign trail, what’s happening a lot – and what a lot of these candidates have to avoid – is being seen as looking for a photo op. To be seen in certain communities and spaces. I heard that he was not only visiting the [Historically Black Colleges and Universities] but also visiting an old black barbershop.

“Found out Bernie has a prior commitments to visit HBCUs in North Carolina and Prestige Barber College (a black barbershop) and will be touring the civil rights museum,” Ross tweeted last week, alongside a sarcastic GIF of The Office’s Michael Scott:

Ross told the Guardian that it is a struggle to “get folks in my own black community to understand that being black and being LGBTQ are not mutally exclusive”:

What I hope Bernie would learn is you don’t have to pander to just one aspect of the black community. If he would have been at the LGBTQ forum tonight, he would have seen we were talking about issues affecting people of color. I think it was a huge misstep on his part. And I’m not here for any of the excuses. I say: ‘Make it up to me. Make it up to us.'”

Several social media users disagreed with the former model’s critique of Sanders.

“To question Bernie Sanders stance on lgbtq rights is the most ridiculous thing ever and shows your bias against him,” one user wrote.

“I don’t think he skipped this forum because he doesn’t believe in equal rights for all,” another said.

“Except you decided to focus on one candidate who has the most robust background on this issue. Also, he was at a HBCU which was already scheduled. To think sanders is weak on LGBTQ is frankly laughable,” another added.

The backlash continued to escalate, leading Ross to announce a break from social media “for a while.”

This would not be the first time Sanders has experienced accusations of harassment and intimidation related to his supporters. Black leaders signed a letter last week, which detailed alleged “hateful, violent, and racist threats” from people who identify as Sanders supporters. The alleged harassment followed the socialist senator’s loss of the Working Families Party (WFP) endorsement.

As Breitbart News reported:

A draft of the letter, obtained by Splinter News, claimed that Sanders supporters have called black leaders “Uncle Tom,” “Slave,” and “Cunt.” The alleged threats followed Sanders’ loss of the WFP endorsement, according to the letter. … The leaders continued, demanding the Sanders campaign “unequivocally denounce the racism in its ranks, and issue a public statement separating themselves from these abhorrent attacks.” They also urged Democrats across the board – both Sanders supporters and Warren supporters – to come together to “defeat one of the most serious threats to peace and justice in our lifetimes.” “We cannot wait to make justice real amongst the resisters — our lives literally depend on each other,” the leaders added in the letter.

Sanders followed up with a tweet, which read, “This campaign condemns racist bullying and harassment of any kind, in any space. We are building a multiracial movement for justice — that’s how we win the White House.”

Warren's national numbers are up since the September primary debate. She comes in with an average of 23% in debate qualifying polls taken after the debate.

This is the fourth qualifying poll to show Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard with 2% support or higher, meaning she has now met both the polling and fundraising requirements to join the other 11 candidates who have qualified for the October Democratic presidential debate hosted by CNN and The New York Times.

California Sen. Kamala Harris got 3%, and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Gabbard, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, investor Tom Steyer and businessman Andrew Yang received 2% each. All other candidates received 1% or less in the New Hampshire poll.

In July, CNN's poll with the University of New Hampshire found Biden, Warren and Sanders clustered at the top of the field, with 24% for Biden, and 19% each for Warren and Sanders.

Warren saw a significant jump in support from Monmouth's last poll of New Hampshire in May, mirroring other recent polling showing her increasing her backing in Iowa and nationally. She is up 19 percentage points since the spring in the new poll, while Biden dropped 11 percentage points, and Sanders dipped 6 percentage points.

Since May, Warren's support among those who describe themselves as liberal has increased 28 percentage points, while Sanders' has dropped 13 percentage points and Biden's down 7.

Likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire continue to prioritize beating President Donald Trump (61%) over voting for someone they agree with completely but who would have a hard time beating him (27%).

But most seem to think they can have it all if their choice wins the nomination. Almost 7 in 10 likely Democratic voters in New Hampshire said their candidate is the one they agree with the most, and over half (52%) said their candidate has the best chance against the president.

Warren holds the best favorability rating with 74% of likely New Hampshire voters who have a favorable opinion of the Massachusetts senator, 19% unfavorable. Biden's is down since May, with 66% who said they had a favorable opinion, 24% unfavorable, while Sanders receives 63% favorable, 28% unfavorable.

The poll shows Warren at 27% and Biden at 25% among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, and is the first major national poll to show Warren in this strong a position since polling in Iowa and New Hampshire also found the two knotted at the top of the field. Although the difference between the candidates' numbers is within the poll's margin of error, the Massachusetts Democrat's new ranking is the first time a candidate other than the former vice president has topped the pack since Quinnipiac started posing the question in March.

The two candidates also saw change in support from the poll's August results, when Biden was at 32% and Warren was at 19%.

The poll reflects a tightening Democratic race as well as Warren's increasing consolidation of the progressive vote and making inroads among black voters. Her support among that crucial demographic bloc has climbed dramatically in recent months, from 4% in July to 8% in August to 19% now. Biden's support among black voters, meanwhile, has dipped from 53% to 40% over the same time. The numbers signal a potential softening in a key base for Biden's campaign, as well as an ability for Warren to grow support beyond white college-educated liberals.

In the new poll, Warren and Biden are followed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (16%), South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (7%) and California Sen. Kamala Harris (3%). All other candidates got 2% or lower in the poll.

The 30-second spot -- titled ""Your Choice"" -- heralds Buttigieg's ""Medicare for All Who Want It"" plan that would not force people onto government health coverage but instead would offer a public option for people who choose to enroll, a key distinction with the sweeping overhaul that would be instituted under a fully Medicare for All program.

""Providing every single American with quality health insurance isn't just my plan, it's our cause,"" Buttigieg says straight to the camera . ""Now, I go about it in a very different way than my competitors.""

The South Bend, Indiana, mayor goes on to tout how his plan ""gives everybody access to Medicare. Everybody. But, if you're happy with the private insurance you've got my plan would let you stick with it -- if you want.""

""Now, others say it's Medicare for All, or nothing,"" Buttigieg says, a not-so-subtle nod to Sanders, Warren and other pro-Medicare for All Democrats. ""I approve this message to say, the choice should be yours.""

Bernie Sanders is preparing to renew his focus on early-voting states Iowa and New Hampshire, as frustrations grow inside his presidential campaign over slumping poll numbers and a series of taxing clashes between lower level staff and national leadership.

The campaign's in-house production team recently began shooting its first television ads of the 2020 cycle in Iowa, likely quieting at least one source of dissent among some senior aides, who have been pushing for Sanders to get on the air.

But concerns over the trajectory of Vermont independent's second presidential bid as new evidence emerges that Sen. Elizabeth Warren is beginning to peel away at his base are becoming more pronounced, along with a realization that a failure to launch in Iowa and New Hampshire could spell the campaign's early doom.

Sanders began his 2020 run dedicated to hammering away at the argument that he, more than any other Democrat, was best positioned to deny President Donald Trump a second term. But Sanders is no longer running as the party's lone progressive populist, as he did in 2016. Warren's emergence in that space, and the sense among some Democrats that she is a better bet to successfully unite the party than Sanders or Biden has altered the shape of the race.

The new dynamic came into sharp relief last weekend, when a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom survey showed Warren surging into the top tier in Iowa with former Vice President Joe Biden. Sanders, who was well off the pace in third, trailed her in the state by more than 10 points, 22% to 11%.

Perhaps more worrying to some Sanders supporters, the Massachusetts progressive also overtook her colleague from Vermont with what has traditionally been his most reliable bloc of support: voters under 35, among whom Warren now leads in Iowa, 27% to Sanders' 22%.

Asked by a reporter on Sunday about the poll, Sanders said the campaign's internal numbers painted a different picture. But even if the senator and his staff have reason to believe the Iowa race is closer than the most recent polling indicates, interviews with two senior aides to Sanders revealed growing concerns that the Hawkeye State and New Hampshire could be at risk of slipping away.

The twin sources of frustration and internal debate, both aides told CNN, was a schedule that too often takes Sanders away from the early voting states and a perception among staff, especially in Iowa, that the campaign has been wrong-headed in its decision to put off investing there in television ads.

""It can't be this national campaign anymore. He's got to go on TV in Iowa. He's got to park himself in Iowa. He's got to show that he's the underdog fighting back,"" one of the aides told CNN.

The aide, who said that staff in Iowa has been ""screaming for Bernie to get on TV"" there, suggested that Sanders had overestimated his strength in Iowa and New Hampshire.

""I think there was initially this sense of, which candidates always want to do, they want to expand,"" the aide said. ""And so I think there was a sense in the campaign, probably a little bit wrongly, that he had an Iowa and New Hampshire base and was going to focus on South Carolina and Nevada and California and expanding. And I think what this is showing is he's got to just go back to basics.""

In an interview, campaign manager Faiz Shakir brushed off criticism that Sanders has spent too much time building a national brand, along with the suggestion that it had cost him in those early states. He pointed to Sanders' recent travels in Oklahoma, North Carolina and Colorado as evidence that the campaign is prepared for the long haul.

""We have four fingers in the air,"" Shakir said, referencing the start of the fourth quarter of 2019. ""We are ready to finish strong and, with that, comes an adjustment in the time and attention we pay to certain parts of the map and that includes Iowa and New Hampshire.""

But Shakir conceded that the shrinking calendar meant the campaign's margin for error was diminishing too.

""The arguments that we have framed up for the public, they need to come through clearly in this next period of time,"" he said of Sanders' efforts in Iowa. ""I think delivering that message is absolutely critical here in the fourth quarter. We have put ourselves in a position to do very well.""

A second senior aide also indicated that a move to focus more on Iowa and New Hampshire was imminent. That doesn't mean Sanders plans to eschew future trips to join striking union workers outside those states, as he did this week, but that Iowa, where he kicked off his ""Bernie Beats Trump"" tour on Monday, is soon likely to serve as a de facto base of operations.

Shakir also told CNN that Sanders, after parting ways earlier this year with the firm that made his ads in 2016, has personally decided to use the campaign's in-house team to produce his first round of television spots. The group, a fixture on the trail with the Sanders, began shooting elements for its first TV ad this week. Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have already begun to run ads in the state. Warren on Tuesday announced a planned eight-figure TV and digital ad buy in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.

""We have a major advantage over other campaigns in that we have a lot more cash on hand,"" Shakir said of the campaign's approach to ad expenditures. ""You can use it correctly, or you can squander it. We are trying to stick to our strategy and make sure we are using our resources wisely.""

The back-and-forth over the campaign's media strategy has been pointed, but both of the senior aides who spoke to CNN touched on a more fundamental source of internal tension: the increasingly public disconnect between state level operations, most notably seen in New Hampshire, and the campaign's national leadership.

Those conflicts have been stoked, the aides said, by mostly lower level staffers, many of them Sanders loyalists from 2016 who have bristled at the 2020 leadership's tone and more exacting standards.

A progressive consultant familiar with the campaign's operation in New England told CNN that unsettled Sanders diehards pushed, successfully, for the ouster of former New Hampshire state director Joe Caiazzo, who was reassigned to Massachusetts. Caiazzo, who declined to comment, has been replaced by Shannon Jackson, a more familiar face who managed Sanders' 2018 Senate race.

According to a new poll from Monmouth released Tuesday, the campaign is facing increased headwinds in New Hampshire, where Warren -- as she did in Iowa -- has surged into the top-tier with Biden. Sanders, again, sits third with 12% to Warren's 27%.

The progressive consultant also said the campaign's internal politics were complicating efforts to broaden its appeal and forge alliances with outside grassroots groups.

""It's very confusing,"" the progressive consultant said of communications with the campaign. ""I have talked to people that hear from all of them -- that hear from (senior adviser) Chuck Rocha, that hear from (senior adviser) Jeff Weaver and that hear from Faiz. But my understanding is that if you want to get to Bernie, it's not Faiz that you go through. It's Weaver or (deputy campaign manager) Ari Rabin-Havt.""

For new groups only beginning to make sense of the progressive firmament, the process of sorting out the campaign hierarchy can be a turn-off -- especially when Warren's team has developed a reputation for proactively seeking out those less seasoned activists.

One of the senior Sanders aides conceded that the growing pains have been, at times, sharper than many expected. In 2016, the aide said, the absence at times of a coherent national operation meant that field staff had much more autonomy. The shakeup in New Hampshire, and lower level changes in Iowa, were largely instigated by internal arguments rooted in differing ideas about how to run a successful campaign without betraying the spirit of Sanders' first run.

Shakir conceded that there is a level of angst between staff at the local level and the national office. But he insisted that the decisions being made are part of a desire to see the vision of the candidate executed.

In the end, he argued, the campaign team -- from top to bottom -- needs to trust in Sanders' judgment.

""We all take our leadership and follow the direction of Bernie Sanders and he drives the strategy, and the argument of how we are going to win people over,"" Shakir said. ""I think to the extent that there's other people on campaign who have different views, I respect and appreciate that.

""But ultimately I believe strongly that we all take our guidance from the top -- and he is the one driving this train."""

The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, in the past, has cautioned against impeaching Trump. Her comments on Tuesday came shortly before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry into the President. ""The actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the President's betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,"" Pelosi said in doing so.

Trump faces outrage over reports that he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July phone call to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son, Hunter. Trump on Sunday said that he did indeed discuss Biden with Zelensky -- at a time when the country was awaiting the aid package from the United States -- but he denied doing anything improper. The call is also the subject of a whistleblower complaint.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

(CNN) The Democratic National Committee just announced the debate criteria for November. As expected, it has modestly raised the bar again, asking for candidates to meet a slightly higher polling and donor threshold than the last debates. But like my elderly cat when we got a slightly taller box spring, some candidates just can't make the leap.

And yet, we are hearing a lot of meowing of protest from the field. Candidates have said they are being forced to adjust their campaign strategies away from winning votes to meet these benchmarks; party insiders are saying the benchmarks are excluding highly credentialed voices in favor of celebrity candidates; and down-ballot Democrats are complaining the donor threshold is taking much-needed money away from their races.

But first, let's be clear that Democratic primary voters want to narrow the field. Generally speaking, a larger and more fractured field tends to benefit some front-runners (Joe Biden) while disadvantaging others (Elizabeth Warren). And, of course, no candidate left off the stage is going to praise a system that torpedoed his campaign, but even those candidates know they can't get their message across with 24 people on the stage. This is all to say, there is no solution to make everyone happy.

The Republican National Committee experienced much the same problem in 2016 and some of us would argue blew it in far more epic fashion. (Full disclosure: I worked for Carly Fiorina during 2016 and was watching the March debate from my hotel room as a handful of dudes tossed around not-so-veiled references to the size of their penises .) My point being that we should at least give the DNC credit for trying to trim the fat with a scalpel instead of the RNC's machete that arbitrarily set and reset qualifications each month based solely on poll numbers.

Even so, I am not the first to point out that there's something wrong here . Polling and fundraising don't measure whether someone will be a good president -- or even a good candidate. And incentivizing your candidates to spend money to meet those thresholds doesn't move the ball down the field for the party or the eventual nominee.

And of course, there's the absurdity of putting that much stock in national name recognition whereby the only way for your candidate to get exposure to tens of millions of viewers during the debate is to have high national poll numbers, which more often than not are simply a reflection of name recognition among voters who have already been exposed to that candidate. Captain Yossarian would be proud.

It's almost as if you'd be better off if you'd starred on a hit reality TV show for years instead of served as a governor or run a Fortune 50 company.

Defenders of the system, though, would say it's working. We started with 20 debaters, and by November, we may be down to eight

But here's the problem. If we had whittled the field too quickly in 1991, there would have been no President Clinton. By July of 1991, he had a polling average of only 1.7% -- in a tie for 13th place with Jay Rockefeller. As Nate Silver has pointed out , in two of the past nine cycles, the eventual Democratic nominee was not even in the top 10 by July -- and both Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton went on to win the presidency the next year.

So here's an alternative I'm proposing to the DNC:

The top three polling candidates according to an average of qualifying national polls get an automatic ticket to the stage. In the end, this is still our closest approximation to votes. But why should this be coupled with fundraising? If you're a great, progressive candidate who has managed to capture the support of 20% of your party's supporters without creating an enormous money machine, you have perhaps all the more reason to be on that stage.

Any candidate with a million individual donors gets a ticket. The goal of this metric isn't to reward a big fundraising haul but to measure support that may not be showing up in the polls. The threshold, therefore, must be meaningful and high. Bernie Sanders is the only candidate to hit this number so far. But by way of example, if Sanders were polling at only 2% nationwide, would the DNC really want to exclude a guy with a million high-enthusiasm Democratic voters who presumably has a uniquely powerful message that is resonating with those who have heard it?

Any candidate with more than 15% support when the same polling averages are weighted for name recognition would be on the stage. Silver has a nice chart on adjusted polling averages here. But in short, if two candidates both have 5% in the latest poll but Candidate A's names is familiar to 80% of voters and Candidate B is known by only 30% of voters, we would assume Candidate B would poll higher than Candidate A if all voters knew who both of them were. So you would ""weight"" that poll by multiplying their support as if they had the same name recognition as the most well-known candidate (Biden). Suddenly, Candidate B would have a weighted polling average just over 15%. Side note: It boggles my mind why this hasn't already happened. If voters haven't heard your message because you're, let's say, the governor of Montana without a lot of national airtime, why would the party want to limit your only chance to reach a broader audience with how you've succeeded in implementing progressive policies? And on the flip side, if you are a celebrity politician with near-universal name recognition among voters but only 4% support in a poll, do we really need to hear more?

These rules would have ensured Clinton made the stage in 1991. Ironically, it also would have excluded Biden in 2007 (along with Dennis Kucinich, Wesley Clark and Chris Dodd, among others).

And what of 2020? Of course, it's impossible to say for sure because the candidates would have run their campaigns differently if the DNC rules had been, well, different. Like those who talk about the popular vote versus the Electoral College, you can't rerun the game with different rules and assume the same inputs.

But as of July, the field would have been narrowed to Biden, Sanders, Kamala Harris, Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke. And given how close Cory Booker and Andrew Yang would have been to the cutoff, it seems fair to assume they would have tweaked their strategies to get to an adjusted 5% as well.

Funny enough, it's the same eight who will probably be on the stage come November. But it sure sounds a lot fairer, doesn't it?"

Warren’s renewed call for impeachment follows reports of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) holding a 4 p.m. Democrat caucus meeting on Tuesday to discuss impeachment. While Pelosi has been hesitant to pursue the matter – telling Democrats during a caucus-wide call in August the public, “isn’t there on impeachment” – her Democrat colleagues appear to be using the alleged “whistleblower” case to push the inquiry, as the Mueller investigation turned out to be a bust:

The alleged whistleblower, who did not even directly hear the purported conversations from Ukrainian leaders, claimed the president urged officials to reopen inquiries into Hunter Biden’s business dealings. As Breitbart News reported, “it is not clear what law, if any, Trump would have broken by urging the Ukrainian government to re-open the case.”

While estimates slightly vary, Democrats are short of a pro-impeachment majority in the House, with 175 in support out of the 235 member caucus. Democrats need 218 votes in the House to make it a reality. Even so, the inquiry would likely flop in the Republican-led Senate, requiring a two-thirds majority – or 67 senators – to vote in favor of impeaching the president.

Warren has increased her calls for impeachment in recent days, arguing that Congress should have taken swift action following the release of the Mueller report, despite the former special counsel not finding any evidence of collusion or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.

“After the Mueller report, Congress had a duty to begin impeachment,” Warren wrote last Friday.

“By failing to act, Congress is complicit in Trump’s latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in US elections. Do your constitutional duty and impeach the president,” she continued, accusing Trump of continuing to commit crimes:

A president is sitting in the Oval Office, right now, who continues to commit crimes. He continues because he knows his Justice Department won't act and believes Congress won’t either.

In a memo to supporters, campaign manager Roger Lau wrote the campaign will grow its presence in Flordia, Texas, California, Illinois, Maine, and Georgia, as well as hire additional staff to help support Democrats running in competitive state legislature races in Michigan and Minnesota.

“Remember: this election is about more than just beating Donald Trump — he’s just the worst symptom of a corrupt system,” Lau wrote. “If we want to make big, structural change, we need to make sure Democrats control the U.S. House and Senate and win important gubernatorial and state legislative races across the country,” explained Lau.

Further, the campaign said it hopes to increase resources for volunteers with a canvassing app to enable them to converse with voters.

“This is how we dream big, fight hard, and win. We’ve got a plan to make sure Elizabeth is the next president of the United States. And when she’s in the Oval Office — when our plans go from big ideas to reality with the help of this grassroots movement — I want you to know that you helped make it happen,” Lau continued.

The announcement comes as the Warren campaign readies an eight-figure ad buy in New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina, and Nevada.

“At the start of this campaign, we laid out how Elizabeth is going to win the primary and the general election — by identifying the deep problems the country faces, creating plans to solve them, and building a grassroots movement to win in 2020 and make big, structural change in 2021 and beyond,” Lau said of the television blitz.

Meanwhile, Warren has solidified her status as the frontrunner in the Democrat presidential primary contest this week, two newly-released polls show.

Twenty-five percent said they prefer former Vice President Joe Biden. Although Warren’s edge falls within the survey’s margin of error, Biden’s formidable lead over the rest of the field has crumbled since the last Quinnipiac national poll in August, which showed him with 32 percent support and Warren with 19 percent support.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has overtaken Joe Biden and zoomed into first place nationally, according to polling from the far-left Quinnipiac.

Since polling of the 2020 Democrat primary began, and since he announced his candidacy, former Vice President Joe Biden had held a stubbornly wide lead against all comers.

That lead is now gone.

Thanks to a 15 point swing, Quinnipiac now has Warren leading Biden 27 to 25 percent. That is an eight point jump since August for Warren and a seven point collapse for Biden.

The only other contender who’s close is Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VA), with 16 points.

Still chugging along in single digits, despite more positive news coverage than anyone not named Barry Obama, is South Bend, IN, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, with just seven percent support.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) is DOA with just three percent support. She has lost four points, more than half of her support, since August.

The Quinnipiac poll, which surveyed 1,337 registered voters between September 19-23, does not appear to be an outlier. An Emerson poll conducted between September 19-23 of 462 Democrat primary voters, showed Biden with 25 percent national support, while Warren nips at his heels at 23 percent. Sanders is right there with 22 percent, which basically makes the national race a three-way tie.

In those two most recent national polls, Robert Francis “Paddy” O’Rourke, has hit bottom with 1 and 2 percent support, which puts him behind some guy named Andrew Yang.

In the Real Clear Politics poll of national Democrat primary polls, Biden enjoys an eight point lead over his rivals. But that lead was once closer to 20 points. Over the summer, the erosion has been slow and steady.

The same is true in the early primary states.

In the latest two polls out of Iowa, where the first voting begins in that state’s caucus on February 3, Warren leads by eight and two points.

In New Hampshire, which votes on February 11, Warren is ahead by two points in the latest poll.

In Nevada, the third primary state, Biden’s lead has slipped to just four points.

What’s happening in the fourth primary state, South Carolina, which is supposed to be Biden’s firewall, we just don’t know. There hasn’t been any polling there since early August. The older polls show Biden with a 20-plus point lead.

Does all of this mean Warren is the new frontrunner?

No.

What it means is what I’ve been saying all along: summer is over and the race has officially begun.

Over the summer, as rank-and-file Democrats did what all Americans do — fish, swim, camp, run the kids around, vacation, go to the movies, barbecue, picnic — they parked their votes on Biden. But now that the kids are back in school, they are taking a closer look at who’s out there and, finally, they are seeing that Joe Biden is no longer Joe Biden.

While Biden was never anything close to a good campaigner, now that he’s 188 years-old, he is even worse. Already, his eyes has exploded, his teeth have come loose, and he’s lost his train of thought too many times to count. Joe Biden is an old, old man. He’s frail when a president must be virile.

On top of that, unlike Trump, no one has to lie to prove Biden is a racist.

So now that the race has finally begun, people are giving Warren a serious look. In the past, though, whenever she has been under the spotlight, Warren has dissolved into a puddle of neuroses, so we will have to see how she does now. What’s more, she has a huge problem with attracting black voters, which might have something to do with this whiter-than-white woman having spent decades impersonating an American Indian in order to advance her academic and political careers.

During her own five days in the sun over the summer, Kamala Harris completely melted down, but there is still a chance voters might give her a second shot.

Whatever happens, an objective look at the Democrat field tells you why House Democrats are pursuing impeachment of President Trump. This is a very weak and extreme group, and Democrats know that without a recession, Trump will probably win a second term against any one of these extremists.

Once again, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) failed to crack into the top tier of candidates in her home state, garnering just 11 percent of the vote. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) came in fifth place with seven percent support, followed by Andrew Yang (D) with four percent support, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) with two percent support, and Beto O’Rourke with two percent support. The margin of error was not immediately available:

113,John Nolte,"These Woke Puritans on the left claim to be all about racial sensitivity, about opposing white privilege, about not offending people of color.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) engaged in the most dishonest and shameless act of cultural appropriation imaginable, and the so-called Woke Movement is giving her a total pass.

These Woke Puritans on the left claim to be all about racial sensitivity, about opposing white privilege, about not offending people of color. They’re so rabid they swarm to attack nobody high schoolers who wear “problematic” prom dresses, white college kids who wear dreadlocks, even children who trick-or-treat as an Indian chief or an Eskimo or a Mexican bandit or an Arab.

This is supposed to be the New Sensitivity, right?

We’re supposed to be “perfecting” our society into something more pure and decent, right?

Well, then, explain to me just how in the hell a kid in a sombrero is “problematic” and not a 70-year-old white woman who spent decades wearing the equivalent of “redface” to advance herself?

For decades, Elizabeth Warren committed the most audacious act of cultural appropriation I have ever seen in a national politician. For decades, Warren pretended to be a Cherokee Indian, and to this day, even though her DNA test proves she’s has no more native blood (and probably less) than the average white American, she still hasn’t admitted she is not part Cherokee.

To everyday Americans, it’s her cheating that galls us; it’s someone pretending to be someone she’s not as a means to gain an advantage that galls us.

The Puritan Wokesters, though, if they actually were who they say they are, if they actually stood for what they say they stand for, should be apoplectic over Cherokee Warren, because what she did is not only outrageous, is not only a privileged white woman stealing a cultural identity purely for mercenary purposes, but you also have to ask yourself how many real-life people of color were not hired or promoted or given an opportunity because Cherokee Warren had already filled that slot?

What more proof is there that the Woke Movement is a total fraud filled with partisan liars. Here Warren is surging in the Democrat primary to a point where the Democrat presidential nomination is probably hers to lose. The latest polls show her up in both Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two primary states, and so far she has paid zero price from the Woke Police for decades and decades and decades of cultural appropriation.

Look at it this way…

If your child dresses as a Cherokee Indian this Halloween, the Woke-tards will be coming after you and him.

But Elizabeth Warren can spend decades pretending to be a Cherokee Indian as a means to get rich and famous and powerful, and these same people refuse to utter a peep.

Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) has qualified for the fourth Democrat presidential primary debate, making her the twelfth 2020 White House hopeful to satisfy the Democrat National Committee’s (DNC) requirements.

Gabbard garnered 2 percent support in a Monmouth University poll in New Hampshire published Tuesday, placing her at four DNC-sanctioned surveys where she enjoyed at least two percent support. The Hawaii congresswoman hit the other DNC debate threshold, which requires candidates score over 130,000 campaign donors.

In addition to Gabbard, other 2020 White House hopefuls participating in the October debate are: former vice president Joe Biden, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Cory Booker (D-NJ), South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Rep. Robert Francis “Beto” Rourke, billionaire climate crusader Tom Steyer, and technology entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

The next debate, co-hosted by the New York Times and CNN, is scheduled for October 15th in Westerville, Ohio.

News of Gabbard’s inclusion in the fourth debate comes one day after the DNC announced intensified requirements for candidates to clinch a spot at the fifth debate in November. White House hopefuls will need to garner at 3 percent or higher in four polls or at least 5 percent in a pair of early-state polls as well as enjoys the support of 165,000 campaign donors."
115,Robert Kraychik,"Many Americans are frightened by the left-wing vision promoted by Democrats, said Olsen.

Many Americans are frightened by the left-wing vision promoted by Democrats, said Olsen.

“I think it’s clear that a lot of [Democrat] policies — and particularly the stridency with which they are promoted — scare a lot of people, even the people who don’t like President Trump,” assessed Olsen.

LISTEN:



Olsen continued, “[Full-wokeness] would mobilize every Trump supporter to make sure they get out and vote, because the combination of economic policies and the cultural stridency unites every wing of the Trump coalition.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) record of supporting “full-woke” positions will become a political liability in a presidential election, determined Olsen.

“I have a hard time seeing how Warren can avoid that,” speculated Olsen. “She might want to campaign on the economy, but on the other hand, she’s already gone full-woke. She’s already called for reparations. She’s already said that the border should be decriminalized, [and] that there should be no such thing as illegal immigration. She’s already embraced radical positions on abortion.”

Olsen added, “It’s very hard to see how [Elizabeth Warren] avoids talking about that, because you know that the president and Republicans will remind her over and over and over again. I think she’s already stepped into that, so to speak, and it’s going to be hard for her to extricate herself.”

Trump’s greatest political threat is from a Democrat nominee who escapes “full-wokeness,” said Olsen.

“The most formidable opponent [for Donald Trump] is anyone who doesn’t scare the middle,” Olsen stated. “Right now, [Joe Biden] is avoiding full-wokeness. He’s talking about things in a way where he goes part of the way, but he doesn’t go all the way there.”

Joe Biden may move further left over the course of the Democrats’ presidential nomination process, noted Olsen.

“It’s not clear that the Biden we’re seeing now is the Biden we’re going to see in February,” Olsen said. “Will he move left — and sharply left — to get himself the nomination? I don’t know. And I think that if Biden does, then that — plus his notable penchant for gaffes and his obvious inability to maintain a steady debate performance across an entire two hours — will eventually be questions that voters will consider.”

Mansour highlighted a recent focus group of female swing voters examining Warren’s political appeal, inviting Olsen’s analysis on the Massachusetts senator’s likability.

Warren’s “demeanor,” arraigned Olsen, is unappealing to a broad swathe of the electorate.

“I’ve been watching the Democratic debates, and the thing that strikes me — as a former graduate of a well-ranked law school — is how much she reminds me of what she actually is, which is a law professor,” Olsen expressed.

Olsen continued, “The same demeanor of ‘the professor’s always right,’ staring straight out as if you were looking at a class with 200 students in it, and conducting the sort of pointed discussion that really doesn’t admit of discussion.”

Olsen went on, “Unfortunately, the election is not a classroom where students have to agree with you or be quiet. … In an election, people decide whether or not they like the person at the front of the room, and it doesn’t surprise me that a lot of people who don’t already agree with her positions — not just the populist positions, but the whole demeanor of ‘everything is awful and needs to be thrown upside down’ — [don’t] find her terribly attractive, particularly people who don’t have college degrees.”

The transcript does not provide a “smoking gun,” as Democrat candidates proclaim. Rather, it shows Trump asking the Ukranian leader to further look into the 2016 election meddling roots — something Democrats, given their self-described goals of ensuring election security, would be in favor of.

Trump said:

I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike… I guess you have one of your wealthy people… The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you’re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.

Biden’s son was not mentioned until after the fact:

… I just want to let you know that’s the other thing, There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you ·can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.

As the Wall Street Journal’s Kimberley Strassel explained:

He smeared Ilhan Omar. He smeared San Francisco. He denied the existence of an obvious delay in military aid to Ukraine. He denied that the name of the Democratic Party is the Democratic Party. He confused champion mountain climbers by claiming that champion mountain climbers had tried and failed to climb his border wall.

President Donald Trump made 79 false claims last week, mixing some fresh false accusations and pointlessly false anecdotes into his usual stew of repeat favorites.

Seventy-nine false claims is down from 90 the week prior to last , Trump's highest total since we started counting at CNN on July 8, but it was still his fourth-most-dishonest of these 11 weeks. His weekly average since July 8 is now 59 false claims.

Trump made 29 of last week's 79 false claims at his campaign rally in New Mexico. He made 13 more in his White House meeting and press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, seven on Twitter. The rest came in a smattering of events, interviews and exchanges with reporters.

Twenty-seven of the false claims were about the economy, 15 about Democrats.

The most egregious false claim: The Ukraine delay

Facing difficult questions about why he delayed military aid to Ukraine, Trump and his allies have tested out a variety of possible explanations. At one point last week, though, Trump decided to just deny the very existence of the delay.

""I didn't delay anything,"" he told reporters . ""We paid the military aid, to the best of my knowledge.""

The money was paid, but that payment very clearly came after a delay. By this week, Trump was openly defending the delay he had said did not happen.

""I'd withhold again and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine, because they're not doing it,"" he said -- which is also not true.

The most revealing false claim: Maligning Omar, again

This time, Trump amplified a tweet from a conservative commentator, Terrence K. Williams. Posting a video of Omar dancing, Williams accused her of partying on the anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

The most absurd false claim: The name of the Democratic Party

For sheer weirdness, it is hard to top Trump's story about the mountain climbers and the border wall. But we say his claim about the Democratic Party did it.

Some of Trump's false claims are so bizarre that it's almost embarrassing to check them. When you do, some of his supporters will inevitably accuse you of humorlessness or pettiness.

Whatever: this is a comprehensive tally, and we must do our solemn duty. Thus, we must point out that ... the name of the Democratic Party is the Democratic Party.

We must do so because Trump has repeatedly and solemnly insisted that the actual name is the ""Democrat Party.""

He said last week, again, that he is not only using ""Democrat Party"" because it sounds worse but because that is the party's official name. He urged the Democrats to make a change to the nicer ""Democratic Party,"" in which case he might call them that.

Yes, he might just be trolling. No, that does not make any of this less confusing.

Here is a list of false claims from last week that we had not previously fact checked in a weekly update:

Google and the 2016 election

""Did you see Google? He said I may have lost 2 million to 10 million votes according to this character that worked at Google, right? And we still won. How the hell did we win? Everybody was against us. How did we win? How did we win? This is a Google executive. From two million to 10.5 million votes, and we won."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: That flawed study was conducted by a psychologist, not a Google employee or executive. You can read a full fact check on the study : That flawed study was conducted by a psychologist, not a Google employee or executive. You can read a full fact check on the study here

Joe Biden

Hunter Biden and the investigation

""The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, want to stay as far away as possible from the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son, or they won't get a very large amount of U.S. money..."" -- September 21 tweet

""And, you know, he really made it a -- it was an offer. It was beyond an offer. It was something where he said, 'I'm not going to give billions of dollars to Ukraine unless they remove this prosecutor.' And they removed the prosecutor supposedly in one hour. And the prosecutor was prosecuting the company of the son and the son."" -- September 22 exchange with reporters after Coast Guard briefing in Houston

Facts First: There is no public evidence that Hunter Biden was ever himself under investigation.

The investigation, as far as we know, was into the business activities of Mykola Zlochevsky, who owned a natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, for which Hunter Biden had sat on the board of directors since 2014. The United Kingdom had begun investigating Zlochevsky before Hunter Biden joined the board.

""Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws -- at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,"" Shokin's successor as prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Bloomberg.

Joe Biden and ""the case""

""Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case. So, somebody ought to look into that."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters at meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: There is no evidence that Biden ever called on Ukraine to remove its chief prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, from a case involving Mykola Zlochevsky, the owner of a natural gas company on whose board of directors Biden's son Hunter Biden sat. Rather, Biden, like the US government more broadly and several US allies, tried to get Shokin fired.

Trump's allies might argue that calling for a prosecutor's firing was even worse than calling for him to be taken off a particular case. But there is a key difference given the context.

Had Biden called for Shokin to be taken off a particular matter in which his son had a stake, this would seem to suggest that his motivation was helping his son. But Biden calling for Shokin's firing, without mentioning that particular case, was consistent with the international concern about Shokin's performance.

Joe Biden's previous comments

""This is a very dishonest thing that Joe Biden did. And then he said he never spoke to this son. Does anybody believe that one? But then he also said, long before, that that he did speak to his son. So he lied, again."" And: ""I mean, give me a break, he's already said he spoke to his son. And now he said, yesterday, very firmly. Who wouldn't speak to your son? Of course, you spoke to your son. So, he made the mistake of saying he never spoke to his son. He spoke to his son."" -- September 22 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure

Facts First: Biden has not previously said that he did speak to his son about his overseas business dealings. Rather, it was Hunter Biden who said that there was a conversation on the subject, according to a New Yorker : Biden has not previously said that he did speak to his son about his overseas business dealings. Rather, it was Hunter Biden who said that there was a conversation on the subject, according to a New Yorker article in July.

That article said this: ""As Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: 'Dad said, ""I hope you know what you are doing,"" and I said, ""I do.'""

Once is more than never, so Trump can fairly point out the contradiction -- though the New Yorker article did not offer evidence that the father-son exchange was detailed. Regardless, the elder Biden was not contradicting himself; he was contradicting his son.

Cokie Roberts

""I never met her. She never treated me nicely. But I would like to wish her family well. She was a professional, and I respect professionals. I respect you guys a lot, you people a lot. She was a real professional. Never treated me well, but I certainly respect her as a professional."" -- September 17 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

Facts First: Trump had met Roberts, who : Trump had met Roberts, who died on September 17. As CNN's Brian Stelter noted , she interviewed him at Trump Tower for a story that aired on ABC in December 1999. (Roberts also questioned him by phone during the 2016 campaign; she asked him asked about children using his campaign rhetoric to bully other children. He called the question ""very nasty."")

Trump, who has been interviewed many hundreds of times, could well have just forgotten the 1999 meeting, but his statement was false regardless of his intent.

San Francisco, the ocean and needles

""We'll start with those two cities and we're looking at San Francisco, we're looking at Los Angeles. And we're looking at all of the things that are happening. You know, there's tremendous pollution being put into the ocean, because they're going through what's called a storm sewer. That's for rainwater. And we have tremendous things that we don't have to discuss pouring into the ocean. There are needles, there are other things. Lot of bad -- lot of -- it's a terrible situation. That's in Los Angeles and in San Francisco. And we're going to be giving San Francisco -- they're in total violation -- we're going to be giving them the notice very soon."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

Facts First: There is no evidence for Trump's claim that San Francisco has significant pollution, including needles, being sent into the ocean through storm sewers.

San Francisco Mayor London Breed called Trump's claims ""ridiculous,"" saying in a statement that the city's sewer system ""ensures that all debris that flow into storm drains are filtered out at the city's wastewater treatment plants."" David Lewis, executive director of nonprofit Save the Bay, told the Mercury News: ""In San Francisco, all solids in that stormwater and sewage water are removed. And what comes out of the plant is sometimes cleaner than the water that many people in this state are drinking.""

The San Francisco Chronicle reported : ""Storm drain runoff is piped to one of two city treatment facilities, the Southeast Treatment Plant in the Bayview neighborhood or the Oceanside Treatment Plant near the zoo. Any pollutants would be treated at those points if they haven't already been filtered out at catch basins beneath city streets, according to the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. 'We haven't had any (recent) problems with syringes,' said SFPUC spokesman Tyler Gamble.""

Mountain climbers and the wall

""We actually built prototypes and we have, I guess you could say, world-class mountain climbers. We got climbers. We had 20 mountain climbers. That's all they do; they love to climb mountains. They can have it. Me, I don't want to climb mountains. But they're very good. And some of them were champions. And we gave them different prototypes of walls, and this was the one that was hardest to climb."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: There is no evidence that 20 mountain climbers, or any number of champion mountain climbers, were recruited to test Trump's border barriers. When The Daily Beast : There is no evidence that 20 mountain climbers, or any number of champion mountain climbers, were recruited to test Trump's border barriers. When The Daily Beast contacted several top mountain climbers and governing body USA Climbing, nobody had any idea what Trump was talking about. Customs and Border Protection refused to comment to CNN, referring questions to the White House.

The wall and San Diego

""You know in San Diego, California, is very difficult, always complaining, not doing great, but they wanted a wall in San Diego -- good mayor in San Diego, by the way. They wanted a wall, and I said, 'You know what, let's build it someplace else, because California, you know, once we build it, they'll complain.'"" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: It is possible that someone or some group from San Diego told him they wanted a wall, but as we : It is possible that someone or some group from San Diego told him they wanted a wall, but as we reported at the Toronto Star, there is no basis for Trump's repeated suggestion that the city itself wanted a wall. San Diego's city council voted 5-3 in 2017 to express opposition to the proposal, and even the Republican mayor Trump was praising here, Kevin Faulconer, has made clear that he is opposed

The name of the Democratic Party

Trump said he calls the Democratic Party the ""Democrat Party"" not only because ""Democrat"" sounds worse than ""Democratic"" but because ""that's their name, the Democrat Party""; he said, ""Frankly, they should probably change it -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The party is already named the Democratic Party. We realize this is a strange-sounding fact check, but Trump has repeatedly : The party is already named the Democratic Party. We realize this is a strange-sounding fact check, but Trump has repeatedly insisted that the actual name is the Democrat Party, so we are not going to let it slide.

A tweet on Ilhan Omar

Trump shared a tweet from comedian and conservative commentator Terrence K. Williams, who alleged that Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar was dancing on the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In his own comment above Williams' tweet, which Williams later deleted, Trump wrote , ""IIhan Omar, a member of AOC Plus 3, will win us the Great State of Minnesota. The new face of the Democrat Party!"" -- September 18 tweet

Facts First: The footage of Omar dancing was from September 13, 2019, not the anniversary of September 11. She was attending an event, called Breaking Concrete Ceilings, connected to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's Annual Legislative Conference.

You can read a full fact check on the tweets here

Nuclear weapons

""Our nuclear was getting very tired. They hadn't spent the money on it. And now we have it have it in, as we would say, 'tippy-top shape.' Tippy-top. It's — we have new and we have renovated and it's — it's incredible."" --September 20 press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

""As you know, we've spent tremendous and hopefully -- and we pray to God we never have to use it, but we've totally renovated and bought new nuclear. And the rest of our military is all brand new. The nuclear now is at a level that's it's never been before."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: ""Tired"" is vague and subjective, but experts reject that characterization of the US nuclear arsenal prior to the Trump administration. Obama did spend money on the arsenal, launching a modernization program that is expected to : ""Tired"" is vague and subjective, but experts reject that characterization of the US nuclear arsenal prior to the Trump administration. Obama did spend money on the arsenal, launching a modernization program that is expected to cost more than $1 trillion . And experts say that Trump has not yet implemented significant changes to the arsenal.

""I feel comfortable saying that the scientific studies to date have yet to provide any evidence that the nuclear arsenal was 'tired' or in any way at risk of being ineffective if called upon,"" said Scott Kemp, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Nuclear Security and Policy.

""I am not aware that Trump can claim to have done anything for the state of the nuclear arsenal — but nothing urgent needed to be done anyway,"" said Kemp, who served as a State Department adviser on arms control early in the Obama administration.

Alexandra Bell, senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control & Non-Proliferation, said that, with the exception of a hypothetical top-secret development she doesn't know about, ""everything is the same"" in the deployed arsenal ""as it was in January 2017"" -- aside from reductions the US made to fulfill its obligations under the New START treaty with Russia.

While ""the Trump administration has certainly requested and received increased funding for nuclear modernization,"" Bell said, ""this is a trajectory we have been on since 2010 "" -- and ""he hasn't really changed anything yet.""

""Budgets clearly demonstrate that we have spent enormous of money on nuclear modernization over the past decade,"" said Bell, who served in the State Department under Obama from 2010 to 2017.

A wall at the Democratic convention?

Talking about the large barriers he had visited at a California border site and is planning to erect elsewhere, Trump was asked if that's what he wants around the White House grounds. He said, ""No, but that's what the Democrats are putting up around their convention...They're building a big wall around their convention. Which they should do."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

""You know what I saw the other day? Where the Democrats are having their convention, their national convention. They just gave out a tremendous contract. You know what it's for? They're building a big wall around the building, they're building a big wall, a massive wall."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: There is no evidence that the Democrats are planning to erect a big wall around the convention site. ""It's not true,"" Democratic National Committee spokesman Brandon Gassaway told CNN.

There will likely be some sort of security fencing in the vicinity of the convention, as is standard, but there are no known plans for a wall even slightly resembling the steel-and-concrete structure Trump visited in California.

The Green New Deal and cars

Trump said that, under the Democrats' Green New Deal proposal, people would be limited to one car: ""Now, under the Green New Deal that (energy revenue) all goes away, that all goes away. It all goes away. You can forget it. No more cows, no more airplanes, no more trips. A single car. Make it electric -- single car, you're not allowed to travel more than 162 miles."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The congressional : The congressional resolution on the Green New Deal does not include any restrictions on the number of cars people could own or the number of miles they could drive.

The proposal calls for ""overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible, including through investment in zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing; clean, affordable, and accessible public transit; and high-speed rail.""

Bay of Pigs veterans

""You know just before the last election, the Cubans from Miami, where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote close to 90%. They gave me the Bay of Pigs award. Can you imagine, right? The Bay of Pigs award."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump got an endorsement, not an award, from the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association. The : Trump got an endorsement, not an award, from the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association. The endorsement was the first the association had ever made in a presidential election, so Trump could fairly boast about it. But still, an award and an endorsement are different things. (Trump claimed in August to have received an award from the Log Cabin Republicans, which told CNN it gave him an endorsement but not an award.)

Trump's Cuban American support in 2016

""You know just before the last election, the Cubans from Miami, where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote close to 90%..."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump did not get anywhere near 90% of the Cuban-American vote, in Miami or elsewhere, according to multiple analyses : Trump did not get anywhere near 90% of the Cuban-American vote, in Miami or elsewhere, according to multiple analyses reported on by the Miami Herald when Trump claimed in 2017 that he had received ""84%"" of the Cuban-American vote. The Herald noted that estimates range from 50% to 58%.

The Herald reported: ""Mauricio Claver-Carone, former executive director of the US-Cuba Democracy PAC who was appointed by Trump to the Treasury Department, estimated that Trump won 58% of the Cuban-American vote based on his review of results from about 30 Miami-Dade precincts with large Cuban-American populations."" As the Herald reported, University of Florida professor Daniel A. Smith found that Trump's best performance with Cuban-American voters in any Miami-Dade precinct was 68%.

Military aid to Ukraine

Question: ""How do you explain the military aid, sir? How do you explain delaying military aid (inaudible)?"" Trump: ""Because I want Germany and I want France and I want the European Union to put up money. And I didn't delay anything. We paid the military aid, to the best of my knowledge."" -- September 22 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure

Facts First: Trump's administration did delay military aid to Ukraine. : Trump's administration did delay military aid to Ukraine. CNN , the Washington Post and the New York Times reported that Trump himself ordered the hold on the aid.

Trump was correct that the aid was eventually paid, but he was incorrect when he denied the very existence of a delay; the delay has been publicly discussed by members of Congress and by people who were serving in the Ukrainian government this summer. The Post reported that although the Trump administration notified congressional officials in February and in May that portions of the aid was going to be released, but the release didn't actually happen until September.

The estate tax

""And to keep New Mexico's farms, ranches and small businesses in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax or death tax so that you can now give your farm or your ranch to your children."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. His 2017 tax law raised the threshold at which the tax must be paid, from $5.5 million to $11.2 million for an individual, but : Trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. His 2017 tax law raised the threshold at which the tax must be paid, from $5.5 million to $11.2 million for an individual, but did not get rid of the tax entirely

It's also misleading to suggest that the estate tax had been a particular burden on farms and small businesses; very few of them were paying the tax even before Trump's changes came into effect. According to the Tax Policy Center, a mere 50 farms and closely held businesses were among the 5,190 estates to pay the estate tax in 2017, before Trump's tax law. The Center wrote on its website: ""The Tax Policy Center estimates that small farms and businesses will pay $20 million in estate tax in 2017, one-tenth of 1 percentage of the total estate tax revenue.""

Oil prices

""Our country is doing well. You look at so many different things. Look at all of the regulation cutting that allows us to do what we did. Look at what happened three days ago — where you have an attack like that and it takes out a big chunk of oil, and the prices go up $4, $5, and now it's heading down rapidly. That tells you — that would have happened years ago, it would have gone up $50. It would've doubled. And this was a blip."" -- September 20 press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: Though oil prices did head back downward after an initial spike after the attack on Saudi oil facilities, that initial spike was larger than $4 or $5: : Though oil prices did head back downward after an initial spike after the attack on Saudi oil facilities, that initial spike was larger than $4 or $5: Brent crude futures , the international benchmark, and West Texas Intermediate futures both rose more than $8, about 15% each, between the close of trading on Friday, before the attack, and the close of trading on Monday; it was the largest single-day percentage gain for Brent since at least 1988, Reuters reported

We can't fact check Trump's hypothetical about what might have happened to oil prices if the attack had occurred some unspecified number of years ago.

The cost of the Mueller investigation

""House Judiciary has given up on the Mueller Report, sadly for them after two years and $40,000,000 spent..."" -- September 16 tweet

""...they spent $40 million -- there's not a person in the room that I couldn't find something on with that."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The Mueller investigation cost $32 million, not $40 million, according to : The Mueller investigation cost $32 million, not $40 million, according to figures released by the Justice Department -- and the government is expected recoup about $17 million as a result of the investigation, according to a CNN analysis of the sentences handed out to people charged by Mueller.

The vast majority of this $17 million is expected to come from former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was ordered to forfeit assets and pay millions to the Internal Revenue Service.

Here's a list of claims we've fact checked before in one of our weekly updates:

Immigration

Mexican troops on the border

""And I want to thank the President of Mexico, who right now has 27,000 soldiers on our southern border. It's been incredible what's taken place in a short period of time."" -- September 22 speech at Howdy, Modi event in Houston

Facts First: The approximately 26,000 troops are split between the US border and Mexico's southern border. Trump himself said in late July that 6,000 of the troops were near Guatemala; speaking to the press in September, acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner Mark Morgan said , ""Since June, Mexico has deployed thousands of troops. They've created a new national guard within their country: 10,000 troops to the southern border; 15,000 troops to the norther border with the United States.""

Mexico's immigration assistance

""You know, Mexico has never done anything to impede people from pouring into our country, and now they're doing just the opposite. They've really been incredible."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: Mexico also took action to impede migrants from entering the United States during the Obama administration.

Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, noted that the Mexican government beefed up its border enforcement measures as part of a cooperation program with the US that aimed to address the 2014 surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America. ""The numbers of unaccompanied minors dropped as a result of this cooperation (and the two countries dealt with a second, smaller spike in 2016 the same way),"" Selee said. He added: ""The Mexican government has actually deported more Central Americans to their home countries since 2015 than the US government has, sharply limiting the number of migrants from that region that have made it to the US border.""

Building the wall

""Well, this section is 14 (miles), but we're building many that are 50 and 40 and 17 and different areas. We're building on many different sites all up and down along the border."" -- September 18 interview with Fox News' Ed Henry

""Well, you know we're building the wall and it's going up and it's going up fast."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

""Now, the wall still, obviously, has a ways to go, but we're building it at a breakneck speed."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: Trump was exaggerating the pace of border-barrier construction. No new miles of border wall had been built during Trump's presidency as of August, Customs and Border Protection told CNN's Geneva Sands. Sixty miles of existing barriers had been replaced over Trump's tenure in office, but Trump was incorrect that there are ""many"" sections of 50, 40 and 17 miles under construction.

Democrats and the border

Trump said the Democrats have an agenda of ""open borders."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Even Democratic presidential candidates who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests.

Human trafficking

""If you want to stop the drug smugglers and the human traffickers, how about the human traffic? And they traffic really for the most part in women, that's what they traffic in, it's women. They're not trafficking in men, they capture women and they bring them across the open borders and they don't go through ports of entry where you have guards standing there with guns and rifles and everything else. They go out into the desert areas and they hang a left or they hang a right and they come in."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Many human trafficking victims do indeed come through ports of entry, according to US experts on trafficking and according to international data.

Experts say that victims are more likely to be deceived into crossing the border willingly than kidnapped and put in the back of a vehicle. ""I have worked on human trafficking on multiple continents in multiple countries for more than two decades, and in all the work that I've done with trafficking victims, I have met one who was actually kidnapped and thrown into a car,"" Martina Vandenberg of the Human Trafficking Legal Center told CNN in January, when Trump was telling frequent stories about women being bound and gagged in cars.

Many victims, experts say, are tricked into coming to the US with promises of a good job. Others are coerced through threats to their families or themselves. While experts say there may be some cases like the ones Trump has described, they emphasize that such cases are in a small minority. In 2018, the UN International Organization for Migration found that ""in the last 10 years, almost 80% of journeys undertaken by victims trafficked internationally cross through official border points, such as airports and land border control points.""

Democrats

The Green New Deal, cows and planes

""Now, under the Green New Deal that (energy revenue) all goes away, that all goes away. It all goes away. You can forget it. No more cows, no more airplanes, no more trips."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The Democrats' Green New Deal environmental resolution does not call for the elimination of cows or planes.

Trump did not make up this claim out of thin air. A ""FAQ"" page that once appeared on the website of a leading Green New Deal proponent, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, calls for the government to ""build out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary."" In explaining why Green New Deal proponents were aiming to get to ""net-zero"" carbon emissions in 10 years rather than the more ambitious goal of zero carbon emissions at all, the FAQ said, ""We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren't sure that we'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.""

The FAQ was not an official party document and has not been broadly adopted by Green New Deal supporters. Its language about cows and planes does not appear in the text of the Green New Deal resolution many congressional Democrats have endorsed. The resolution calls for ""overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector"" and ""working collaboratively with farmers and ranchers in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector as much as is technologically feasible.

Popularity and accomplishments

Special election in North Carolina's 9th District

Trump said North Carolina congressional candidate Dan Bishop, who won a September special election, was down ""17 points three weeks ago,"" before Trump got involved. -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Bishop was not down 17 points in any : Bishop was not down 17 points in any public poll , though some did have him trailing by single-digit margins.

When we tweeted about this, Matt Wolking, deputy director of communications for the Trump campaign, responded ""Try harder"" -- pointing to a tweet by Jim Blaine, a Republican strategist, that included an apparent poll excerpt that showed Bishop down 14.

But 14 is not 17. And neither Wolking nor Blaine responded to our questions about who conducted the poll, who it was conducted for, when it was conducted, what its methodology was, or what its sample size was; Blaine's tweet did not include any of that information.

Special election in North Carolina's 3rd District

Trump said Greg Murphy, who won the special election in North Carolina's 3rd District, ""was up a couple of points"" before his victory. -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Murphy was leading by significantly more than ""a couple of points,"" according to public polling. One : Murphy was leading by significantly more than ""a couple of points,"" according to public polling. One late poll had him up by 11 points.

The poll was in line with pundits' expectations for the race, which was widely seen to be an easy Republican victory. Murphy was running in a district formerly held by the late Republican Rep. Walter Jones, who ran unopposed by the Democrats in the 2018 election; and Trump won the district by about 24 points in 2016.

Trump could have fairly said Murphy outperformed the polls, since he won by 24 points, but ""a couple of points"" is incorrect.

Suppression polls

""Now, if it's close, like it's in play, you know you wait two three four or five hours to see what it is, but they don't even take a breath because they're called suppression polls, and they're no different than all of the dishonest reporting that you people say. They're no different. They're suppression polls."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: There is simply no evidence that pollsters have manipulated their numbers to suppress the enthusiasm of Trump voters, as Trump has repeatedly alleged.

Veterans Choice

Trump boasted that he was the one who got the Veterans Choice health care Trump passed, saying, ""They've tried to get that for 45 years. They haven't been able to get it. But I'm good at getting things."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was : The Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was signed into law by Barack Obama in 2014. In 2018, Trump signed the VA Mission Act, which expanded and changed the program.

Foreign and military affairs

Venezuela's wealth

""Look at Venezuela: Venezuela, 15 years ago, was one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and today very sad, no food, no water, no nothing."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Venezuela was not one of the world's wealthiest countries 15 years ago.

The International Monetary Fund ranked Venezuela 67th in the world in 2004 by GDP per capita, at $4,019 (US) -- better than more than half of the world's countries, but nowhere near the top.

""Venezuela was one of the richest countries in the world 60 years ago. The richest in Latin America 40 years ago. But not 20 years ago,"" Ricardo Hausmann, a former Venezuelan planning minister and central bank board member, said in response to a previous version of this Trump claim. Hausmann, now a Harvard University professor of economic development, was chief economist of the Inter-American Development Bank from 1994 to 2000.

The war in Afghanistan

""We have hit — in Afghanistan, we have hit the Taliban harder than they've ever been hit in the entire 19 years of war."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters at a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: We'll ignore Trump's subjective claim about how ""hard"" the US is attacking the Taliban. ""Nineteen years of war,"" though, was a small exaggeration. The US invaded Afghanistan in October 2001, nearly 18 years ago. This was not a one-time slip though; Trump habitually says ""19 years.""

The Iran nuclear deal

""The problem was, the deal that was signed by the previous administration was a disaster — which, by the way, would be expiring in a very short period of time also. So you really don't have a deal. You know, that deal was a very short-term deal. So they made a deal, but it was for a very short period of time. So that deal would be expiring very soon."" -- September 16 exchange with reporters with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

Facts First: Some central provisions of the nuclear agreement with Iran were written to expire in the next 10 to 15 years. But the deal as a whole -- including a blanket prohibition on Iran developing nuclear weapons -- was written to continue in perpetuity. You can read a fuller fact check : Some central provisions of the nuclear agreement with Iran were written to expire in the next 10 to 15 years. But the deal as a whole -- including a blanket prohibition on Iran developing nuclear weapons -- was written to continue in perpetuity. You can read a fuller fact check here

ISIS fighters and Europe

""We have thousands of ISIS fighters and we want those fighters to be taken -- you're talking about, I think it's a big -- we have thousands of ISIS fighters that we've taken into -- we've defeated 100% of the caliphate. We are holding in various forms of prison. We're holding thousands of people. Many come from Germany, many come from France, many come from Holland -- really most of them come from various European countries. And we want them to take them back."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

""They mostly come out of Europe."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters at a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: According to Trump's own government estimates, a minority of ISIS fighters being held in Syria came from Europe.

James Jeffrey, Trump's special envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition, said August 1 that about 8,000 of 10,000 terrorist fighters who were then prisoners in northeastern Syria were Iraqi or Syrian nationals; there were ""about 2,000 ISIS foreign fighters"" from all other countries.

Trump himself tweeted in February to ask that European countries take back ""over 800"" ISIS fighters captured in Syria.

Remains from North Korea

""We've gotten our hostages back. We've gotten our great soldiers back who were killed — many of them. And many more are coming back. We have many more coming back. And the families of those — we call them 'our heroes.' And they were our heroes. And they're coming back."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: While North Korea returned some remains last year, it is no longer doing so. The US military announced in May that the remains program had been suspended for the rest of the 2019 fiscal year because North Korea had stopped communicating with the US agency responsible for the effort.

Trump could accurately tout the return of remains in the past tense: North Korea returned 55 cases of possible remains in the summer of 2018. But the remains are no longer being returned. You can read a longer fact check of this claim here

Trade

Unions and the USMCA

Trump said of his USMCA trade agreement, ""Unions love it."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The agreement is generally opposed in its current form by major US unions, who have demanded changes to the text; the president of the AFL-CIO federation : The agreement is generally opposed in its current form by major US unions, who have demanded changes to the text; the president of the AFL-CIO federation says it will be a ""disaster for workers"" if it is not amended. As The New York Times has reported, the United Automobile Workers and United Steelworkers, among other unions, have also demanded changes.

Trade deficit with China

Trump said the trade deficit with China was $500 billion, alleging that previous presidents allowed China to ""to take out $500 billion a year"" or even ""more than that"" including theft of intellectual property. -- September 20 exchange with reporters at meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: Trump refers to trade deficits as losses and surpluses as gains or takings, though this characterization is rejected by many economists. The US trade deficit with China has never been $500 billion; it was : Trump refers to trade deficits as losses and surpluses as gains or takings, though this characterization is rejected by many economists. The US trade deficit with China has never been $500 billion; it was $381 billion last year when counting goods and services, $420 billion when counting goods alone.

Aid to farmers

Talking about his tariffs on China, Trump said, ""And I'm taking care of our farmers out of that. We're helping our farmers. Our farmers were targeted, and they were targeted for $16 billion. And I made that up to them. We paid them the $16 billion and had tens of billions of dollars left over."" -- September 20 press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: It's incorrect that there are tens of billions of dollars left over in tariff receipts after accounting for the $28 billion Trump has pledged to farmers affected by his trade war with China. (The $16 billion Trump mentioned here was a : It's incorrect that there are tens of billions of dollars left over in tariff receipts after accounting for the $28 billion Trump has pledged to farmers affected by his trade war with China. (The $16 billion Trump mentioned here was a second announcement that followed an earlier $12 billion announcement. The China-specific tariffs have generated a total of about $30 billion, according to the US government's tracking data as of September 24.

Who is paying for Trump's tariffs on China

Trump said twice that China is ""eating the tariffs"" he has imposed on imports of Chinese products, and he said on a third occasion that the government was taking in the tariff revenue ""from China.""

Facts First: A bevy of : A bevy of economic studies has found that Americans are bearing the overwhelming majority of the tariff costs, and Americans make the actual tariff payments.

China's economic performance

Trump said four times that China is having its worst economic year in ""57 years.""

Facts First: China's second-quarter growth rate was the : China's second-quarter growth rate was the worst in 27 years . Trump has repeatedly made clear that he knows that this is the reported figure, but he has added additional years for no apparent reason.

History of the tariffs

On three occasions on which eh talked about tariff revenue, Trump said the US has never previously received ""10 cents,"" ""100 cents"" or ""billions"" from China.

Facts First: The US government has been charging tariffs on imported Chinese goods for more than two centuries, and it took in billions from such tariffs long before Trump imposed his own tariffs. (As always, we'll note it is US importers and consumers, not China, who have paid these tariffs.)

The Treasury received $14 billion from tariffs on China in 2014 , to look at one pre-Trump year.

Economy and energy

Automotive investments

""My relationship has been very powerful with the autoworkers — not necessarily the top person or two, but the people that work doing automobiles. Nobody has ever brought more companies into the United States. You know, I have Japan and Germany, and many countries have been bringing car companies in and opening plants and expanding plants. "" -- September 16 exchange with reporters with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

Facts First: Contrary to Trump's claims, there has been no boom in investment from Japanese, German, or other foreign automakers during his tenure. From Trump's inauguration through July, the Center for Automotive Research, a nonprofit that studies the industry, found 66 automaker announcements of new US manufacturing facilities, or expansions or updates to existing facilities. The center found 170 such announcements in Obama's (four-year) first term, 154 in Obama's second term, according to the center's Bernard Swiecki.

Just two Japanese car companies, Toyota and Mazda, have announced plans to build a US plant (together) during Trump's presidency; their joint venture is under construction in Alabama. There is no evidence Trump was personally responsible for this investment decision.

Trump has said since 2018 that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has told him that more Japanese carmakers will soon announce major US investments. But none of these companies has announced a new US plant since Toyota and Mazda introduced the joint venture in early 2018, though Japanese automakers have made additional investments in existing facilities and Japanese truck company Hino Motors has built a truck-cab assembly plant in West Virginia.

""We know of no German or Japanese automakers currently looking to place additional car or truck assembly capacity in the United States,"" said Kristin Dziczek, the center's vice president of industry, labor and economics.

Energy independence

""Well, we have the Strategic — if you look at what we have, we have tremendous amounts of oil in our country. We're independent of everybody now."" -- September 16 exchange with reporters

""So nice that our Country is now Energy Independent. The USA is in better shape than ever before."" -- September 18 tweet

""We're independent, as independent as we want, and we are now a net exporter of energy"" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: While definitions of ""energy independence"" vary, the US is not ""energy independent"" by any definition; it is : While definitions of ""energy independence"" vary, the US is not ""energy independent"" by any definition; it is expected to export more energy than it imports by 2020, according to the government's Energy Information Administration, but that has not happened yet. In the first five months of 2019, PolitiFact noted , the US also consumed more energy than it produced.

There have been occasional, brief periods where US exports have exceed imports or where its production has exceeded consumption, but this hasn't happened for a full recent year.

""The US is still a net importer of crude and refined products, although the trend of declining dependence on imports should continue due to increased domestic production of unconventional oil and biofuels and growing investment in export infrastructure following the 2015 repeal of the crude export ban,"" said Josh Price, a senior analyst for energy and utilities at Height Capital Markets. ""Most of these factors preceded President Trump and have not been significantly altered by administration policies.""

The decrease in US imports and increase in exports began before the Trump administration. Obama presided over a boom in liquefied natural gas exports and signed a bill lifting a 40-year-old ban on crude oil exports.

""The truth is that both of the presidents of this decade (President Obama and President Trump) have presided over an incredibly brisk expansion of our capacity to produce oil and refined products. Executive policy has had little to do with the explosive gains, which are attributable to technology and price,"" said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service.

It's worth noting that the US will still be using large quantities of foreign energy even if it does become a net exporter next year. In other words, it will not be completely independent from foreign suppliers.

Energy production

Trump claimed four times that the US had only recently become the world's largest producer of oil and gas; in one of the claims, he added a message of self-congratulation in the third person: ""Thank you, Mr. President!""

Facts First: The US has not just ""now"" or ""very recently"" become the world's top energy producer, and it did not achieve this status because of Trump's policies: it took the top spot : The US has not just ""now"" or ""very recently"" become the world's top energy producer, and it did not achieve this status because of Trump's policies: it took the top spot in 2012 , under Obama, according to the US government's Energy Information Administration. The US became the top producer of crude oil in particular during Trump's tenure.

""The United States has been the world's top producer of natural gas since 2009, when US natural gas production surpassed that of Russia, and it has been the world's top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded Saudi Arabia's,"" the Energy Information Administration says

Asian American unemployment

Facts First: Trump falsely claimed four times that Asian Americans are at their lowest-ever unemployment rate. The unemployment rate for Asian Americans was : Trump falsely claimed four times that Asian Americans are at their lowest-ever unemployment rate. The unemployment rate for Asian Americans was 2.8% in August -- higher than the 2.6% rate in December 2016, Obama's last full month in office.

Overall unemployment

""Our job numbers for African Americans are the best in history. You saw the new ones came out; they're even better than they were two months ago. Hispanic, the best in history. Asian, the best in history. Overall, they're phenomenal. The best in 51 years. And I think we'll soon be historic on that one too."" -- September 16 exchange with reporters with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

""We're doing -- we have this great economy. We're doing better than we've ever done. Our employment numbers are the best they've ever been and unemployment numbers also. We are doing great. But we should be cutting. There's no inflation."" -- September 18 interview with Fox News' Ed Henry

""And unemployment in the United States has just reached the lowest level in over 51 years, and very soon, we think that will be broken to be a historic number."" -- September 22 speech at Howdy, Modi event in Houston

Facts First: Trump was exaggerating in all three cases -- very slightly with ""51 years,"" more significantly when he said ""the best they've ever been."" The Trump was exaggerating in all three cases -- very slightly with ""51 years,"" more significantly when he said ""the best they've ever been."" The unemployment rate over this spring and summer -- 3.7% in each of June, July and August, 3.6% in each of April and May -- has been the lowest since December 1969, slightly less than 50 years ago; all of these rates were well off the record 2.5%, set in 1953.

The dollar

""Will Fed ever get into the game? Dollar strongest EVER!"" -- September 16 tweet

Facts First: The dollar is not the strongest it has ever been against other currencies, according to various indices; it was significantly stronger in the 1980s and earlier this decade. You can read a longer version of this fact check : The dollar is not the strongest it has ever been against other currencies, according to various indices; it was significantly stronger in the 1980s and earlier this decade. You can read a longer version of this fact check here

Women's unemployment

Trump said at his New Mexico rally that unemployment numbers for women were the best in ""71 years.""

Facts First: This was his usual slight exaggeration. The rate this summer has been the lowest since 1953, 66 years ago.

Inflation

Trump claimed three times that there is ""no inflation."" Facts First: There is inflation: 1.7% for the last 12 months ending in August. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, was up 2.4% for the 12 months ending in August. Trump could fairly say that inflation is low, but ""no inflation"" is incorrect.

Trump could fairly say that inflation is low, but ""no inflation"" is incorrect.

Prescription drug prices

Trump claimed that last year was ""the first year in 51 years where prices went down"" for prescription drugs. -- September 16 exchange w with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

Facts First: This was a slight exaggeration. Prescription drug prices declined last year for the first time in 46 years, according to one of several measures. You can read a longer version of this fact check : This was a slight exaggeration. Prescription drug prices declined last year for the first time in 46 years, according to one of several measures. You can read a longer version of this fact check here

Pre-existing conditions

""And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. The Republicans will always do that."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: This promise has already proven false. Trump and Republicans, who have tried to pass : This promise has already proven false. Trump and Republicans, who have tried to pass bills that would have weakened protections for people with pre-existing conditions, are now trying to get the courts to declare Obamacare void, without a plan to replace those pre-existing protections if their lawsuit succeeds.

Air quality

""And I'm an environmentalist, I believe in the environment. I want the cleanest water on the planet. I want the cleanest air. I want a lot of things. You know right now we have the cleanest air that we've ever had in this country?"" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: By several measures, US air was cleaner under Obama than it's been under Trump. Three of the six types of pollutants identified by the Clean Air Act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before Trump took office, according to Environmental Protection Agency : By several measures, US air was cleaner under Obama than it's been under Trump. Three of the six types of pollutants identified by the Clean Air Act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before Trump took office, according to Environmental Protection Agency data

Additionally, there were more ""unhealthy air days"" for sensitive groups in 2018 than in 2016 -- 799 days across the 35 American cities surveyed by the EPA, up from 702. Though there were significantly more ""unhealthy air days"" in Obama's first term than there have been in Trump's, the lowest amount of unhealthy air days -- 598 -- occurred in 2014 under Obama.

Judicial vacancies

""President Obama said they (prisoners at Guantanamo Bay) were going to be totally completed and emptied out by the time he left office. And very much like judges, where, as you know, I ended up with 138 slots, you had a situation where that wasn't cleaned out."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

""In a few short weeks, we'll be up to 180, sounds impossible, federal judges, including court of appeals judges, because President Obama did us a great favor. when I came in, I said, 'I assume I have no judges to appoint.' 'No sir, you have 138 judges.' 138, didn't put them up, couldn't get them approved. I don't know what happened, but we started off with 138."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump did not enter office with 138 judicial vacancies. According to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments, there were 103 vacancies on district and appeals courts on Jan. 1, 2017, just before Trump took office, plus a vacancy on the Supreme Court.

Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the confirmation of many of Obama's judicial nominees late in his term; Obama obviously didn't intend to ""hand"" vacancies to Trump."

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) fears the Democrat-led House impeachment effort could lead President Trump to ultimately claim vindication, he told reporters in Iowa on Tuesday.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced on Tuesday the launch of an official impeachment inquiry, using the whistleblower complaint as a launching point. This follows months of far-left “Squad” members pushing impeachment and Pelosi’s continuous stiff-arming of such efforts.

“I’m announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry,” Pelosi announced at a Capitol Hill press conference.

“I am directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry,” she said.

“The President must be held accountable. No one is above the law,” she continued, citing the Founding Fathers.

“Getting back to our founders, in the darkest days of the American Revolution, Thomas Paine wrote that times have found us, that times found them to fight for and establish our democracy,” she added. “The times have found us today”:

Nancy Pelosi: ""Therefore today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry."" pic.twitter.com/HyHKD39N7M — Axios (@axios) September 24, 2019

Several 2020 Democrat candidates called for the inquiry prior to Pelosi’s announcement.

“This isn’t a partisan issue—or shouldn’t be,” Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) tweeted. “When the president of the United States is working with other countries to interfere with our elections, we should begin impeachment proceedings.”

“It was true when I said it in 2017 running for Senate in Texas and it’s still true today: President Trump should be impeached,” former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D) added.

“The House must impeach. It must start today,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wrote.

Noticeably absent though, was Sanders. While he believes that “impeachable offenses” exist, he signaled that Democrats may be acting too hastily and would not say if he would support the impeachment effort if it made it to the Senate.

“Here’s the dilemma that you have,” Sanders told reporters in Iowa on Tuesday, according to BuzzFeed News. “Now I don’t know — I’ll tell you that my gut is that the average Republican in the Senate and the House is totally intimidated by President Trump.”

“And at this particular point, I have my doubts, like you all. I have my doubts that any Republican, or very few, would vote against him,” he continued, detailing his fear. Sanders worries that – in the event that the impeachment effort gets passed on to the Senate – which would require a two-thirds majority (or 67 votes) – it would fail and Trump would claim vindication as a result.

“I know and you know what [Trump] will do: ‘I am vindicated! … I am vindicated!’ And I think that is a fact that has to be taken into consideration,” Sanders said, according to BuzzFeed.

“But what do you do when you have a president who has acted in an unconstitutional way? If that is the findings,” Sanders continued. “Again, I don’t want to judge it. I think that is the face. But there is a process that has to take place.”

Sanders reiterated that he believes there are impeachable offenses, and he has signaled such before, floating an inquiry in May:

It is obvious that the President is a pathological liar who does not understand the Constitution. The fact is that if Mr. Trump continues to disregard the right of Congress to subpoena, he will leave House Members with no choice but to begin an impeachment inquiry. — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) May 23, 2019

“I believe that there are impeachable offenses. That’s my view. But my view is not good enough,” Sanders said, according to BuzzFeed News.

“I happen to believe that there are grounds to do it. But you have to lay it out,” Sanders explained, refusing to reveal his thoughts on the controversy surrounding Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine.

“I know I’m a little bit old-fashioned. I like to see the evidence before I talk about things. I read the papers and I read what I read,” Sanders said. “But I don’t know that I know enough at this point to make any definitive statement.”

Fellow presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has taken her position on impeachment farther than Sanders, telling CNN’s Newsroom on Tuesday that impeachment would “further tear apart an already divided country.”

“Impeachment is something — that is a step that will divide the country and will be worse off for our country,” she said."

Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) proposed wealth tax, it goes even further, taxing more individuals at even higher rates.

For example, Sanders proposes to implement a one percent tax on couples with a net worth over $32 million. The percentage increases alongside the value of assets:

The tax rate would increase to 2 percent on net worth from $50 to $250 million, 3 percent from $250 to $500 million, 4 percent from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent from $1 to $2.5 billion, 6 percent from $2.5 to $5 billion, 7 percent from $5 to $10 billion, and 8 percent on wealth over $10 billion.

“These brackets are halved for singles,” Sanders explains.

The socialist senator admits the goal of his ultra-progressive redistribution proposal, boasting that — under his plan — the wealth of billionaires “would be cut in half over 15 years” and declaring that “billionaires should not exist”:

Billionaires should not exist. https://t.co/hgR6CeFvLa — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 24, 2019

There is no justice when three billionaires are able to own more wealth than the bottom half of the entire country. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 24, 2019

There should be no billionaires. We are going to tax their extreme wealth and invest in working people. Read the plan: https://t.co/RJDLvX5H4c — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 24, 2019

Sanders’ proposal would also spur the creation of a “national wealth registry” and provide an “increase in IRS funding” in order to manage a swell of new audits.

It states:

In order to ensure that the wealthy are not able to evade the tax, the proposal includes a number of key enforcement policies. First, it would create a national wealth registry and significant additional third party reporting requirements. Second, it includes an increase in IRS funding for enforcement and requires the IRS to perform an audit of 30 percent of wealth tax returns for those in the 1 percent bracket and a 100 percent audit rate for all billionaires. Third, the wealth tax includes a 40 percent exit tax on the net value of all assets under $1 billion and 60 percent over $1 billion for all wealthy individual seeking to expatriate to avoid the tax. Finally, the wealth tax proposal will include enhancements to the international tax enforcement and anti-money laundering regime including the strengthening of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.

The presidential candidate argues the U.S. already taxes inherited wealth via the estate tax and says his proposal is constitutional, citing two Yale law professors, Bruce Ackerman and Anne Alstott, who have expressed support for the radical concept. Sanders adds that it is “not radical” to ask the wealthy to “pay their fair share.”

His proposal is expected to result in $4.5 trillion over the next decade, according to University of California, Berkeley, economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. Nonetheless, that number does not come close to paying for his expansive, expensive proposals, such as his $16 trillion Green New Deal proposal or Medicare for All, which could — by some estimates — cost the U.S. over $60 trillion over the next decade alone.

Sanders’ ideological ally, Warren, has also introduced a wealth tax, although it does not go as far. She proposes implementing a two percent wealth tax on those with $50 million in assets, as opposed to Sanders’ $32 million. Warren’s plan increases the tax to three percent for those with assets of $1 billion or greater, with no distinction between couples or single filers. She, like Sanders, plans to fund her costly proposals via the wealth tax, although Saez and Zucman estimate that her proposal would result in $2.6 trillion over the next decade, $1.9 trillion less than Sanders’ proposal.

“If we make the top 0.1% pay their fair share in taxes, their quality of life would not change at all,” Sanders tweeted following the announcement of his redistribution scheme.

“But we would be able to invest in housing, child care and health care and improve the lives of millions of working people,” he added:"

Some speculate that Pelosi will use accusations from the alleged “whistleblower” – who claimed Trump urged Urkanian officials to “re-open inquiries into the business dealings of former president Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden” – as a basis to present an impeachment resolution, although the Washington Post reports that Pelosi is “discussing the creation of a select committee to conduct the possible impeachment of President Trump”:

With zero legislative accomplishments since retaking the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections, after nearly a year filled with contentious investigations, hearings, and the coming opening of a formal impeachment inquiry, Democrats are betting it all on a quixotic mission to try to take out Trump with impeachment.

A problem they face is that they need 218 votes to pass articles of impeachment out of the House, and an even-steeper 67-vote threshold in the U.S. Senate to convict and remove the president from office. At this stage, Democrats do not even have 218 votes despite their 235-seat majority–they are somewhere, at best for the pro-impeachment crowd, somewhere around 175 pro-impeachment votes but with growing momentum. In the Senate, there is next to zero chance that 20 Republicans would join all 47 Democrats to vote to convict Trump on impeachment charges.

But Democrats, after failing to take on major legislative issues like infrastructure, healthcare, paid family leave, or anything else for that matter, are now pushing forward with opening official impeachment proceedings against Trump.

Via @mikedebonis and @rachaelmbade, Pelosi is now ""discussing the creation of a select committee to conduct the possible impeachment of President Trump.” https://t.co/PIxMZZeDzt — Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) September 24, 2019

A House Democrat tells me it's ""very likely"" that Pelosi will announce a formal impeachment inquiry this afternoon and signal her own support for impeachment. — Jennifer Bendery (@jbendery) September 24, 2019

The Democrats spent all year conducting hearings and investigations related to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, only to fail–as the Special Counsel Robert Mueller probe also failed–to find any evidence of collusion or conspiracy between Trump and his campaign and the Russians. Mueller’s investigation and the Democrat-led investigations also failed to uncover evidence of obstruction of justice by Trump, leaving Democrats empty-handed heading into the August recess back in July.

But now, after the emergence of complaints by a supposed “whistleblower” against Trump with regard to a conversation he had with Ukraine’s newly-elected leader about former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden’s business dealings in the Eastern European NATO ally nation, Democrats have reinvigorated their push for impeachment. They are buoyed by a swelling of support from members in key battleground House districts and renewed energy from top Democrats in leadership, including in particular House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has reportedly told her friends that she views impeachment as inevitable now.

It remains unclear exactly what the Democrats would be impeaching Trump for. The content of the supposed “whistleblower” complaint about Trump’s call with Ukraine’s new president Volodymyr Zelensky remains private, as does the transcript of the call. The president has said he is considering releasing the call transcript, but has not done so yet–and he expressed concerns that releasing a call transcript could produce a chilling effect among world leaders who wish to have honest and frank conversations with the president of the United States.

But on Tuesday afternoon, after news broke that Pelosi was moving forward with impeachment, Trump announced via Twitter he has ordered the release of the call transcript in full:

I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019

….You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019

What’s more, the supposed “whistleblower” technically does not qualify as a whistleblower under the federal law that provides protection to such individuals, despite the media and leftists referring to the person as such, and the person apparently did not even bear witness to the call itself. Even if Trump did what was alleged, it is unclear how that would amount to an illegal act worthy of impeachment and conviction of a U.S. president, as several Republicans like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) have said.

Nonetheless, impeachment is less of a legal question and more of a political matter. Polling shows impeaching Trump remains very unpopular nationwide, and with 31 Democrats sitting in districts in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016–13 of which he won by more than six percent–with even more than that filling out a broader ring of vulnerable members nearing 50, Democrats could imperil their chances of holding their majority if they go through with this process.

To hit the threshold necessary to impeach Trump–218 votes–Pelosi would need to force several self-portrayed “moderate” Democrats in these approximately 50 battleground districts to support impeachment by voting for it. That prospect, getting these Democrats who go home to the district and campaign on doing things to help their constituents–to actually vote for anti-Trump craze mania has Republicans nationally salivating.

Pelosi has held off the left side of her conference all year on impeachment, arguing it would be a perilous political mission that would endanger Democrats and embolden Trump. But with the rise of the so-called “Squad” led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), a New York socialist, Pelosi has allowed the growth of these rising leftist forces in her conference all year, to the point where Ocasi0-Cortez has taken the driver’s seat in pushing the party’s agenda, the other side of the Democrat conference be damned.

Over the weekend, Ocasio-Cortez ripped Democrats for holding back on impeachment–ginning up the left side of the conference, firing up the Democrat base, and forcing Pelosi into action:

At this point, the bigger national scandal isn’t the president’s lawbreaking behavior – it is the Democratic Party’s refusal to impeach him for it. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 22, 2019

It is one thing for a sitting president to break the law. It’s another to let him. The integrity of our democracy isn’t threatened when a president breaks the law. It‘s threatened when we do nothing about it. The GOP’s silence & refusal to act shouldn’t be a surprise. Ours is. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 22, 2019

Now that Pelosi has jumped at the behest of the 29-year-old socialist freshman from New York and her fellow “Squad” members Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), Ocasio-Cortez is ripping Pelosi for only doing a committee–saying she wants instead a straight-up impeachment vote.

Yes, this is an emergency. We don’t have the luxury of time w/ another committee. Judiciary has been investigating& putting the pieces together for months. Impeachment belongs there. We must honor jurisdiction, historical precedent,& work done + allow Judiciary to move forward. https://t.co/CM0gXN7T1i — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 24, 2019

The complexity of how to structure impeachment proceedings is meaningless in the broader scheme of things politically, Republicans argue, because now in the GOP’s view the Democrat Party–and all of its members–have officially jumped the shark by going for broke on Trump impeachment, facts be damned.

Two supposedly “moderate” New York Democrats who joined the impeachment brigade this week, Reps. Antonio Delgado (D-NY) and Sean Patrick Maloney (D-NY), are already under fire back home in their district as Empire State Republicans hammer away at them for siding with the lunacy of Ocasio-Cortez.

New York GOP chairman Nick Langworthy said in a statement:

By joining the impeachment mob, Antonio Delgado and Sean Patrick Maloney just abandoned their constituents in favor of AOC and the Squad. The radical left’s endless obsession with trying to take out President Trump and derail his agenda will be rejected by the voters who want their representatives to focus on making their lives better, not their own power. This reckless decision will rightfully go down as the one that cost them their seats.

They are hardly alone. Two Virginia Democrat freshman women, Reps. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) and Elaine Luria (D-VA)–both freshman Democrats representing battleground House districts who co-signed an op-ed with five others nationwide in the Washington Post on Monday evening signaling their openness to impeaching Trump–are under fire in Virginia now for abandoning their constituents in favor of impeachment.

“Both Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger were already critically endangered heading into 2020, by publicly joining the left-wing impeachment jihad they are clearly angling for post-Elected office job opportunities,” John Findlay, the executive director of the Virginia Republican Party, told Breitbart News on Tuesday. “The Republican Party of Virginia already has field staff on the ground this year in preparation for 2020 and will only be expanding our presence as next November approaches.”

Another co-signer of their op-ed, Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA)–a freshman Democrat who represents Pennsylvania’s sixth congressional district, another battleground–is facing criticism already for siding with the radical efforts to impeach Trump while not delivering on substantive policy matters.

“Representative Chrissy Houlahan has gone Washington as she continues to prove that she cares more about partisan politics than finding solutions to the challenges we face here in Pennsylvania,” John Emmons, a conservative businessman running for the GOP nomination in Pennsylvania’s sixth district for the shot to take on Houlahan next November, told Breitbart News on Tuesday. “She’d rather go after the President and try to get onto CNN than get to work for the people of her district. The voters of PA-06 deserve so much better out of their Member of Congress.”

Rep. Jason Crow (D-CO), a freshman who co-signed the op-ed and represents a battleground district in Colorado after defeating a GOP incumbent in 2018, took a hit in Colorado for signing onto impeachment.

“From his call for impeachment to his extreme voting record, Jason Crow has put his constituents on the backburner and placed his personal ambitions ahead of the interests of working people,” Colorado GOP spokesman Kyle Kohli told Breitbart News. “Colorado’s 6th district won’t forget how Crow sided with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Nancy Pelosi over them.”

In Michigan, one of the op-ed’s cosigners, Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), and another fellow freshman Democrat, Rep. Haley Stevens (D-MI), joined the impeachment charade this week as well–and also are paying for it.

Michigan GOP chairwoman Laura Cox said in a statement:

Today, Elissa Slotkin and Haley Stevens decided to join with Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the most radical members of their party by jumping on the impeachment bandwagon. For nearly three years, Democrats and their allies in the media have conducted a witch-hunt against President Trump in an attempt to undo the results of the 2016 election. Time and time again their accusations have been proven false, and I find it shameful that Slotkin and Stevens have chosen to put their political ambitions ahead of the real issues facing their constituents.

These are just a taste of the lines of attack Republicans have ready for the Democrats if they continue wallowing deeper into this mess. The extent to which the impeachment fight, along with other national trends heading into next year’s presidential and congressional elections, could affect the outcome of the 2020 elections could be monstrous.

“By pushing for impeachment, Democrats and their allies in the media are making a major strategic mistake,” Andy Surabian, a GOP strategist and former White House official who advises the president’s son Donald Trump, Jr., told Breitbart News. “They’re literally walking directly into a buzz saw and don’t even seem to realize it.”

What’s more, while they draw attention to the Biden-Ukraine corruption questions, Biden continues slipping in the polls in the Democrat primary. Biden’s team has attempted to frame this battle as a sign that Trump is worried about facing the former Vice President head-to-head, while avoiding answering questions about what he did as Vice President in Ukraine in connection with getting a prosecutor investigating a company on whose board his son served fired in exchange for releasing U.S. taxpayer-funded aid and then bragging about it at a public event.

But in reality, the intense scrutiny is waking the country–including many Democrat voters who may not have known much about Hunter Biden’s business dealing in Ukraine or in China or elsewhere and how much of a liability they could be to his father politically.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)–a leftist socialist rising star on the hard edge of her party far outside the mainstream–has surged past Biden in polling in several states including Iowa, New Hampshire, and California. She is virtually or statistically tied with Biden in a number of national polls as well and has seen her numbers increase even in Biden strongholds like Nevada–leaving South Carolina as basically the only early state refuge for the one-time Democrat frontrunner.

If Warren is able to sustain this surge into winning the nomination, while Biden keeps slipping and falling away–all while Trump powers his way through this mess as he has done several times before with other Democrat-driven scandals–the 2020 election could end up becoming a Warren-versus-Trump referendum of socialism-versus-capitalism where the Democrat Party’s new extremist wing takes center stage with no accomplishments to point to since they won the House majority back–all part of why they are going for impeachment in the first place, because they have no other path to beat Trump, some Republicans argue, so they are going for broke with this strategy.

“Despite an all-out assault on President Trump, he still has a higher approval rating than Obama did at this point in time,” Steve Guest of the Republican National Committee said. “This round of baseless calls for impeachment is the Democrats’ acknowledgment of their inability to beat President Trump at the ballot box so they’ll try impeachment instead.”"

Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden are virtually deadlocked in a close race for the Democratic presidential nomination, according to a new national poll out Wednesday from Quinnipiac University.

The poll shows Warren at 27% and Biden at 25% among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, and is the first major national poll to show Warren in this strong a position since polling in Iowa and New Hampshire also found the two knotted at the top of the field. Although the difference between the candidates' numbers is within the poll's margin of error, the Massachusetts Democrat's new ranking is the first time a candidate other than the former vice president has topped the pack since Quinnipiac started posing the question in March.

The two candidates also saw change in support from the poll's August results, when Biden was at 32% and Warren was at 19%.

The poll reflects a tightening Democratic race as well as Warren's increasing consolidation of the progressive vote and making inroads among black voters. Her support among that crucial demographic bloc has climbed dramatically in recent months, from 4% in July to 8% in August to 19% now. Biden's support among black voters, meanwhile, has dipped from 53% to 40% over the same time. The numbers signal a potential softening in a key base for Biden's campaign, as well as an ability for Warren to grow support beyond white college-educated liberals.

In the new poll, Warren and Biden are followed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (16%), South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (7%) and California Sen. Kamala Harris (3%). All other candidates got 2% or lower in the poll.

Coulter, the author of “Resistance Is Futile!: How the Trump-Hating Left Lost Its Collective Mind,” told Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN during an appearance in Washington, D.C. at the Federation for American Immigration Reform’s (FAIR) Hold Their Feet to the Fire annual radio event that it was “very suspicious” how specifics about new U.S.-Mexico border wall construction was not readily made available to the public.

“It’s very suspicious that we can’t get a straight answer from them on is any new wall being built where there was nothing before?” Coulter said. “Now admittedly I’ve seen about 50 miles on a 3,000-mile border, so who cares? Fifty miles does nothing when you have a 3,000-mile border. They were crappy little fences. Any little car or a person can get past it. But there was a fence and should we create a real fence there? Yes, definitely – an improvement. But it does make a difference is if they created real wall where there was nothing before. It shows that they have the building permits, that there is no EPA problem with disturbing a snail darter – you’re actually doing something new here, and you’ve gotten the go-ahead. And I believe the answer to that is ‘no’ because every time we get a straight answer, the answer is ‘no.’”

She recounted an effort relayed to her by someone having a difficult time getting answers about progress on wall construction.

“Last I heard, one of our friends was pressing the White House – he showed it to me – he sent it to me secretly the email thread, and it’s just hilarious,” she continued. “He keeps asking – ‘Yes, yes, yes but just so I can go back to Coulter and say ‘new wall is being built.’ Can you tell me if new wall is being built where it is being built? And they will not answer that question.”

As for the 2020 presidential election and what Trump’s potentially unfulfilled pledges pertaining to immigration issues might mean for its outcome, Coulter said a lot of next year’s election had to do with the Democratic Party opposition.

“The Democrats are doing everything they can to lose this election – not only by the candidates they’re running, not only by their positions,” she said. “They seem to that if Trump wants to protect America’s working class, then we hate America’s working class. If Trump doesn’t want illegal aliens, then we love illegal aliens. They’re taking the most absurd positions. We could get the Democratic Party to officially come out for pederasty if we told them, ‘You know, Trump is against pederasty. He really wants to go after the pederasts.’ That would be a plank in the Democratic platform. So we have that, and we have this nonsense with the call with the Ukrainian guy today.”

She said Trump’s 2016 election victory was a result of a combination GOP voters being energized and Democrat complacency.

“Leaving aside how crazy they are, this is the argument for why we should be nervous,” she continued. “It was kind of a miracle victory in 2016. Trump won by 80,000 voters basically spread out over four states in the industrial Midwest, i.e., white working-class voters, who have not voted in elections in 30 years. The Democrats were caught sleeping. They were so sure it was going to be a 46-state landslide for Hillary [Clinton]. You know there were a lot of Democrats who thought, ‘Ah, I don’t want to get up early. I’m just going to say I vote. She’s going to win anyway.’”

However, Coulter warned without action on the border wall and the so-called DREAMers, some of those Trump voters may not be there in 2020.

“[I] think there are a lot of Trump voters – I know there are besides me – they voted for him for the wall, for him to end the DREAMers,” she said. “So why hasn’t he done that? No, you can’t blame Mitch McConnell for that. You can’t blame Paul Ryan for that. You certainly can’t blame the Democrats. That was an unconstitutional executive order. Obama admitted it was unconstitutional for six years until he signed it. He kept telling all these left-wing activist groups, ‘I can’t grant amnesty on my own, that would be unconstitutional.’ Then he signed. Mitch McConnell won.”

“I think a fair number, and it doesn’t take that many, of Trump’s voters to be discouraged,” she added. “The one thing that is going to get them to the polls and is going to get Ann to the polls is the terror of having some lunatic like Elizabeth Warren elected.”

Bernie Sanders is preparing to renew his focus on early-voting states Iowa and New Hampshire, as frustrations grow inside his presidential campaign over slumping poll numbers and a series of taxing clashes between lower level staff and national leadership.

The campaign's in-house production team recently began shooting its first television ads of the 2020 cycle in Iowa, likely quieting at least one source of dissent among some senior aides, who have been pushing for Sanders to get on the air.

But concerns over the trajectory of Vermont independent's second presidential bid as new evidence emerges that Sen. Elizabeth Warren is beginning to peel away at his base are becoming more pronounced, along with a realization that a failure to launch in Iowa and New Hampshire could spell the campaign's early doom.

Sanders began his 2020 run dedicated to hammering away at the argument that he, more than any other Democrat, was best positioned to deny President Donald Trump a second term. But Sanders is no longer running as the party's lone progressive populist, as he did in 2016. Warren's emergence in that space, and the sense among some Democrats that she is a better bet to successfully unite the party than Sanders or Biden has altered the shape of the race.

The new dynamic came into sharp relief last weekend, when a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom survey showed Warren surging into the top tier in Iowa with former Vice President Joe Biden. Sanders, who was well off the pace in third, trailed her in the state by more than 10 points, 22% to 11%.

Perhaps more worrying to some Sanders supporters, the Massachusetts progressive also overtook her colleague from Vermont with what has traditionally been his most reliable bloc of support: voters under 35, among whom Warren now leads in Iowa, 27% to Sanders' 22%.

Asked by a reporter on Sunday about the poll, Sanders said the campaign's internal numbers painted a different picture. But even if the senator and his staff have reason to believe the Iowa race is closer than the most recent polling indicates, interviews with two senior aides to Sanders revealed growing concerns that the Hawkeye State and New Hampshire could be at risk of slipping away.

The twin sources of frustration and internal debate, both aides told CNN, was a schedule that too often takes Sanders away from the early voting states and a perception among staff, especially in Iowa, that the campaign has been wrong-headed in its decision to put off investing there in television ads.

""It can't be this national campaign anymore. He's got to go on TV in Iowa. He's got to park himself in Iowa. He's got to show that he's the underdog fighting back,"" one of the aides told CNN.

The aide, who said that staff in Iowa has been ""screaming for Bernie to get on TV"" there, suggested that Sanders had overestimated his strength in Iowa and New Hampshire.

""I think there was initially this sense of, which candidates always want to do, they want to expand,"" the aide said. ""And so I think there was a sense in the campaign, probably a little bit wrongly, that he had an Iowa and New Hampshire base and was going to focus on South Carolina and Nevada and California and expanding. And I think what this is showing is he's got to just go back to basics.""

In an interview, campaign manager Faiz Shakir brushed off criticism that Sanders has spent too much time building a national brand, along with the suggestion that it had cost him in those early states. He pointed to Sanders' recent travels in Oklahoma, North Carolina and Colorado as evidence that the campaign is prepared for the long haul.

""We have four fingers in the air,"" Shakir said, referencing the start of the fourth quarter of 2019. ""We are ready to finish strong and, with that, comes an adjustment in the time and attention we pay to certain parts of the map and that includes Iowa and New Hampshire.""

But Shakir conceded that the shrinking calendar meant the campaign's margin for error was diminishing too.

""The arguments that we have framed up for the public, they need to come through clearly in this next period of time,"" he said of Sanders' efforts in Iowa. ""I think delivering that message is absolutely critical here in the fourth quarter. We have put ourselves in a position to do very well.""

A second senior aide also indicated that a move to focus more on Iowa and New Hampshire was imminent. That doesn't mean Sanders plans to eschew future trips to join striking union workers outside those states, as he did this week, but that Iowa, where he kicked off his ""Bernie Beats Trump"" tour on Monday, is soon likely to serve as a de facto base of operations.

Shakir also told CNN that Sanders, after parting ways earlier this year with the firm that made his ads in 2016, has personally decided to use the campaign's in-house team to produce his first round of television spots. The group, a fixture on the trail with the Sanders, began shooting elements for its first TV ad this week. Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have already begun to run ads in the state. Warren on Tuesday announced a planned eight-figure TV and digital ad buy in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.

""We have a major advantage over other campaigns in that we have a lot more cash on hand,"" Shakir said of the campaign's approach to ad expenditures. ""You can use it correctly, or you can squander it. We are trying to stick to our strategy and make sure we are using our resources wisely.""

The back-and-forth over the campaign's media strategy has been pointed, but both of the senior aides who spoke to CNN touched on a more fundamental source of internal tension: the increasingly public disconnect between state level operations, most notably seen in New Hampshire, and the campaign's national leadership.

Those conflicts have been stoked, the aides said, by mostly lower level staffers, many of them Sanders loyalists from 2016 who have bristled at the 2020 leadership's tone and more exacting standards.

A progressive consultant familiar with the campaign's operation in New England told CNN that unsettled Sanders diehards pushed, successfully, for the ouster of former New Hampshire state director Joe Caiazzo, who was reassigned to Massachusetts. Caiazzo, who declined to comment, has been replaced by Shannon Jackson, a more familiar face who managed Sanders' 2018 Senate race.

According to a new poll from Monmouth released Tuesday, the campaign is facing increased headwinds in New Hampshire, where Warren -- as she did in Iowa -- has surged into the top-tier with Biden. Sanders, again, sits third with 12% to Warren's 27%.

The progressive consultant also said the campaign's internal politics were complicating efforts to broaden its appeal and forge alliances with outside grassroots groups.

""It's very confusing,"" the progressive consultant said of communications with the campaign. ""I have talked to people that hear from all of them -- that hear from (senior adviser) Chuck Rocha, that hear from (senior adviser) Jeff Weaver and that hear from Faiz. But my understanding is that if you want to get to Bernie, it's not Faiz that you go through. It's Weaver or (deputy campaign manager) Ari Rabin-Havt.""

For new groups only beginning to make sense of the progressive firmament, the process of sorting out the campaign hierarchy can be a turn-off -- especially when Warren's team has developed a reputation for proactively seeking out those less seasoned activists.

One of the senior Sanders aides conceded that the growing pains have been, at times, sharper than many expected. In 2016, the aide said, the absence at times of a coherent national operation meant that field staff had much more autonomy. The shakeup in New Hampshire, and lower level changes in Iowa, were largely instigated by internal arguments rooted in differing ideas about how to run a successful campaign without betraying the spirit of Sanders' first run.

Shakir conceded that there is a level of angst between staff at the local level and the national office. But he insisted that the decisions being made are part of a desire to see the vision of the candidate executed.

In the end, he argued, the campaign team -- from top to bottom -- needs to trust in Sanders' judgment.

""We all take our leadership and follow the direction of Bernie Sanders and he drives the strategy, and the argument of how we are going to win people over,"" Shakir said. ""I think to the extent that there's other people on campaign who have different views, I respect and appreciate that.

""But ultimately I believe strongly that we all take our guidance from the top -- and he is the one driving this train."""

When asked by CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room"" if he believed Giuliani was potentially criminally liable, Schiff said that ""If Mr. Giuliani was involved in a scheme to coerce a foreign government into giving dirt, manufacturing dirt, on President Trump's political opponent, then yes, that certainly can violate the law -- violate the criminal laws.""

""Do I have any confidence, hope or what not, that the Justice Department would be willing to investigate?"" he added. ""No.""

The Justice Department, Schiff said, ""made it clear they're not going to investigate this and they don't want anyone else to. The fact that they would so cavalierly dismiss this credible evidence and say it is not even worthy of us looking into is yet another affirmation that Attorney General Bill Barr believes that he exists to serve the will and interest of the President, not the presidency, and that's exactly what he's doing.""

Schiff's comments come the same day acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the Intelligence Committee about his handling of a whistleblower complaint that has set off a politically explosive week in Washington.

Importantly, some issues involving individual GM plants have been resolved or are close to resolution, the sources said.

That mostly leaves the so-called national issues, including those involving pay and benefits for GM's nearly 50,000 hourly workers. Those are typically the last to be settled before a tentative labor deal can be reached. The two sides have been talking about those national issues since formal negotiations started in July

A final agreement can come together quickly in a strike. Any tentative deal needs the approval of union members, though the strike could end before a vote.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) announced Tuesday that she is beefing up her presidential campaign as she surges in several primary polls across the country.

In a memo to supporters, campaign manager Roger Lau wrote the campaign will grow its presence in Flordia, Texas, California, Illinois, Maine, and Georgia, as well as hire additional staff to help support Democrats running in competitive state legislature races in Michigan and Minnesota.

“Remember: this election is about more than just beating Donald Trump — he’s just the worst symptom of a corrupt system,” Lau wrote. “If we want to make big, structural change, we need to make sure Democrats control the U.S. House and Senate and win important gubernatorial and state legislative races across the country,” explained Lau.

Further, the campaign said it hopes to increase resources for volunteers with a canvassing app to enable them to converse with voters.

“This is how we dream big, fight hard, and win. We’ve got a plan to make sure Elizabeth is the next president of the United States. And when she’s in the Oval Office — when our plans go from big ideas to reality with the help of this grassroots movement — I want you to know that you helped make it happen,” Lau continued.

The announcement comes as the Warren campaign readies an eight-figure ad buy in New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina, and Nevada.

“At the start of this campaign, we laid out how Elizabeth is going to win the primary and the general election — by identifying the deep problems the country faces, creating plans to solve them, and building a grassroots movement to win in 2020 and make big, structural change in 2021 and beyond,” Lau said of the television blitz.

Meanwhile, Warren has solidified her status as the frontrunner in the Democrat presidential primary contest this week, two newly-released polls show.

Politico reports:

Twenty-seven percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents polled by Quinnipiac University said they favor Warren, according to a new poll released Wednesday morning. Twenty-five percent said they prefer former Vice President Joe Biden. Although Warren’s edge falls within the survey’s margin of error, Biden’s formidable lead over the rest of the field has crumbled since the last Quinnipiac national poll in August, which showed him with 32 percent support and Warren with 19 percent support.

Though some polls show Warren pulling ahead of Biden in some early primary and caucus states, a Real Clear Politics polling average shows the Massachusetts Democrat still trails the former vice president by roughly ten percent."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has overtaken Joe Biden and zoomed into first place nationally, according to polling from the far-left Quinnipiac.

Since polling of the 2020 Democrat primary began, and since he announced his candidacy, former Vice President Joe Biden had held a stubbornly wide lead against all comers.

That lead is now gone.

Thanks to a 15 point swing, Quinnipiac now has Warren leading Biden 27 to 25 percent. That is an eight point jump since August for Warren and a seven point collapse for Biden.

The only other contender who’s close is Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VA), with 16 points.

Still chugging along in single digits, despite more positive news coverage than anyone not named Barry Obama, is South Bend, IN, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, with just seven percent support.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) is DOA with just three percent support. She has lost four points, more than half of her support, since August.

The Quinnipiac poll, which surveyed 1,337 registered voters between September 19-23, does not appear to be an outlier. An Emerson poll conducted between September 19-23 of 462 Democrat primary voters, showed Biden with 25 percent national support, while Warren nips at his heels at 23 percent. Sanders is right there with 22 percent, which basically makes the national race a three-way tie.

In those two most recent national polls, Robert Francis “Paddy” O’Rourke, has hit bottom with 1 and 2 percent support, which puts him behind some guy named Andrew Yang.

In the Real Clear Politics poll of national Democrat primary polls, Biden enjoys an eight point lead over his rivals. But that lead was once closer to 20 points. Over the summer, the erosion has been slow and steady.

The same is true in the early primary states.

In the latest two polls out of Iowa, where the first voting begins in that state’s caucus on February 3, Warren leads by eight and two points.

In New Hampshire, which votes on February 11, Warren is ahead by two points in the latest poll.

In Nevada, the third primary state, Biden’s lead has slipped to just four points.

What’s happening in the fourth primary state, South Carolina, which is supposed to be Biden’s firewall, we just don’t know. There hasn’t been any polling there since early August. The older polls show Biden with a 20-plus point lead.

Does all of this mean Warren is the new frontrunner?

No.

What it means is what I’ve been saying all along: summer is over and the race has officially begun.

Over the summer, as rank-and-file Democrats did what all Americans do — fish, swim, camp, run the kids around, vacation, go to the movies, barbecue, picnic — they parked their votes on Biden. But now that the kids are back in school, they are taking a closer look at who’s out there and, finally, they are seeing that Joe Biden is no longer Joe Biden.

While Biden was never anything close to a good campaigner, now that he’s 188 years-old, he is even worse. Already, his eyes has exploded, his teeth have come loose, and he’s lost his train of thought too many times to count. Joe Biden is an old, old man. He’s frail when a president must be virile.

On top of that, unlike Trump, no one has to lie to prove Biden is a racist.

So now that the race has finally begun, people are giving Warren a serious look. In the past, though, whenever she has been under the spotlight, Warren has dissolved into a puddle of neuroses, so we will have to see how she does now. What’s more, she has a huge problem with attracting black voters, which might have something to do with this whiter-than-white woman having spent decades impersonating an American Indian in order to advance her academic and political careers.

During her own five days in the sun over the summer, Kamala Harris completely melted down, but there is still a chance voters might give her a second shot.

Whatever happens, an objective look at the Democrat field tells you why House Democrats are pursuing impeachment of President Trump. This is a very weak and extreme group, and Democrats know that without a recession, Trump will probably win a second term against any one of these extremists.

“If the election for president of the United States were held today, and the choices were Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren, who would you vote for?” the survey asked.

In that scenario, 48 percent of voters chose Warren, and 44 percent chose Donald Trump, taking her lead outside of the 2.8 percent margin of error.

The survey asked the same question, replacing Warren with Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA). While Biden also experienced a four-point advantage over the president – 47 percent to 43 percent – he did not earn as much national support as Warren, who edged him out by one point. It further signals an increase in the Massachusetts senator’s electability.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) says she does not know if she would ban the children of her vice president from serving on the boards of foreign companies, as the son of former Vice President Joe Biden did.

Following a rally in Iowa, Warren was asked if she would ban the children of her vice president from serving on the boards of foreign companies — a reference to the scrutinized business dealings of Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, who was paid $83,000 a month while sitting on the board of a Ukrainian oil corporation at the time that his father was in the White House.

Despite her anti-corruption agenda, Warren initially said “No” she would not allow her vice president’s children to serve on the boards of foreign companies, but she quickly backtracked the answer, saying, “I don’t know.”

The full exchange, caught on video, can be read and watched below:

REPORTER: To the ethics plans, could say whether or not under a Warren administration, would your vice president’s child be allowed to serve on the board of a foreign company? WARREN: No. REPORTER: Why not? WARREN: I don’t, I don’t, I don’t know. I mean, I’d have to go back and look at the details on the plan. REPORTER: Do you think that could be a problem?

As Breitbart News’s Haris Alic has reported, questions about why Hunter Biden was appointed to serve on the board of Ukrainian oil company Burisma in April 2014 have plagued the former vice president’s 2020 Democrat presidential primary bid.

Alic’s reporting notes:

Adding to concerns is the fact that at the time Hunter Biden joined Burisma, the company was seen as actively courting western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month Hunter Biden was tapped for the group’s board, the government of Great Britain froze accounts belonging to Burisma founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukrainian minister of natural resources, would later be accused of corruption for using his office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control. [Emphasis added] Joe Biden’s role in the entire matter has only increased suspicions of conflicting interests. As the sitting vice president, Joe Biden led the Obama administration’s response to the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014. In that role, he pushed billions of dollars in aid to the Ukrainian government, some of which allegedly was filtered to Burisma. [Emphasis added]

Breitbart News’s Senior Contributor Peter Schweizer has detailed in his book, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, how Hunter Biden had no experience with the oil and gas industry or the nation of Ukraine before joining Burisma while his father was vice president.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) engaged in the most dishonest and shameless act of cultural appropriation imaginable, and the so-called Woke Movement is giving her a total pass.

These Woke Puritans on the left claim to be all about racial sensitivity, about opposing white privilege, about not offending people of color. They’re so rabid they swarm to attack nobody high schoolers who wear “problematic” prom dresses, white college kids who wear dreadlocks, even children who trick-or-treat as an Indian chief or an Eskimo or a Mexican bandit or an Arab.

This is supposed to be the New Sensitivity, right?

We’re supposed to be “perfecting” our society into something more pure and decent, right?

Well, then, explain to me just how in the hell a kid in a sombrero is “problematic” and not a 70-year-old white woman who spent decades wearing the equivalent of “redface” to advance herself?

For decades, Elizabeth Warren committed the most audacious act of cultural appropriation I have ever seen in a national politician. For decades, Warren pretended to be a Cherokee Indian, and to this day, even though her DNA test proves she’s has no more native blood (and probably less) than the average white American, she still hasn’t admitted she is not part Cherokee.

To everyday Americans, it’s her cheating that galls us; it’s someone pretending to be someone she’s not as a means to gain an advantage that galls us.

The Puritan Wokesters, though, if they actually were who they say they are, if they actually stood for what they say they stand for, should be apoplectic over Cherokee Warren, because what she did is not only outrageous, is not only a privileged white woman stealing a cultural identity purely for mercenary purposes, but you also have to ask yourself how many real-life people of color were not hired or promoted or given an opportunity because Cherokee Warren had already filled that slot?

What more proof is there that the Woke Movement is a total fraud filled with partisan liars. Here Warren is surging in the Democrat primary to a point where the Democrat presidential nomination is probably hers to lose. The latest polls show her up in both Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two primary states, and so far she has paid zero price from the Woke Police for decades and decades and decades of cultural appropriation.

Look at it this way…

If your child dresses as a Cherokee Indian this Halloween, the Woke-tards will be coming after you and him.

But Elizabeth Warren can spend decades pretending to be a Cherokee Indian as a means to get rich and famous and powerful, and these same people refuse to utter a peep.

The transcript does not provide a “smoking gun,” as Democrat candidates proclaim. Rather, it shows Trump asking the Ukranian leader to further look into the 2016 election meddling roots — something Democrats, given their self-described goals of ensuring election security, would be in favor of.

Trump said:

I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike… I guess you have one of your wealthy people… The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you’re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.

Biden’s son was not mentioned until after the fact:

… I just want to let you know that’s the other thing, There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you ·can look into it … It sounds horrible to me.

As the Wall Street Journal’s Kimberley Strassel explained:

2)As to call transcript itself: Trump’s actual “favor” is that Ukraine look backward, to what happened in the 2016 election. This is a legitimate ask, since election meddling looks to have come from both Russia and Ukraine. — Kimberley Strassel (@KimStrassel) September 25, 2019

The House Intelligence Committee released the complaint on Thursday, which detailed accusations from an anonymous “whistleblower” who did not have firsthand knowledge of the conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The alleged “whistleblower” contends that Trump was “using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.”

However, as the transcripts of the conversation, which were released Wednesday, showed, Trump’s explicit use of the word “favor” was used in reference to Crowdstrike and the questions surrounding election meddling and hacking efforts. Biden and his son were not mentioned until later in the conversation. The transcripts show no quid pro quo or “pressure,” and the Ukrainian president confirmed such.

Nonetheless, Democrats – particularly 2020 Democrat candidates – are claiming that the “whistleblower” complaint is “explosive” in nature and contend that it proves Trump committed “crimes” in the White House.

Joe Biden (D), whose alleged corrupt practices remain at the center of the controversy, proclaimed that Trump “believes he is above the law” and attempted to convince Americans across the board that the Democrats’ latest investigation and impeachment effort is not a partisan issue:

We have a President who believes there is no limit to his power, who believes he can do anything and get away with it, and who believes he is above the law. This isn’t a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. This is a national issue. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 26, 2019

“The whistleblower complaint is explosive,” Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) wrote. “It paints a sobering picture of a president abusing his power for his own political gain against US national security interests.”

“Americans deserve to know the truth—that’s why an impeachment inquiry is so critical & our moral obligation,” he added:

Cory Booker (D-NJ) are losing to some guy named Andrew Yang.

The four most recent national polls show Yang beating Booker in every single one. These same polls show Yang tied with O’Rourke in three, but shellacking him in a fourth.

The Economist has Yang at two points, Paddy with two points, and Booker with — LOL — zero.

Emerson has Yang at eight(!) points, Paddy with one point, and Booker with two.

Quinnipiac has Yang at two points, Paddy with two points, and Booker with — LOL — zero.

Morning Consult has all three sitting at three points.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Julian Castro, a former HUD secretary under President Obama, are polling even worse than Paddy and Booker.

The most interesting bit of polling news, though, is the total collapse of Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who is only polling a little better than Yang. But in the Emerson poll, which is only a few days old, he beats her eight points to four points.

In just ten weeks, Harris has dived from having 15 points of average national support from Democrat primary voters to just 4.9 percent, which is where she sits today, according to the Real Clear Politics poll of polls.

The Real Clear Politics poll of polls has Yang at 3.3 percent, which puts him ahead of O’Rourke at 2.4 percent, Booker at 1.7 percent, Klobuchar at 1.6 percent, and Castro at 1.3 percent.

Right now, the race for a 2020 Democrat presidential nomination is a three-way race… period. And it’s not even close.

In that poll of polls, former Vice President Joe Biden leads with 28 percent, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VA) with 22 and 17 percent, respectively.

The only positive thing you can say about Mean Little Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s poll position is that he’s at the top of the bottom tier with 5.9 percent support, which only puts him a little ahead of Yang’s 3.3 percent. But…

In that Emerson poll, Buttigieg is behind Yang — eight to six.

The 44-year-old Yang has no political experience. He’s a private sector success, an entrepreneur, lawyer, and CEO. His big idea is to take away everyone’s private health insurance by forcing us into a government-run Medicare For All. He wants to confiscate guns and give everyone $1,000 every month as a guaranteed income, for some crazy reason.

In other words, he’s a crank.

But so are all the others.

The difference is that Yang has some charisma and a sense of humor. Unlike Booker and Paddy and Klobuchar and Castro and the Mean Little Mayor, Yang is likable and self-deprecating. And that is all it takes to beat a bunch of left-wing stiffs these days.

He smeared Ilhan Omar. He smeared San Francisco. He denied the existence of an obvious delay in military aid to Ukraine. He denied that the name of the Democratic Party is the Democratic Party. He confused champion mountain climbers by claiming that champion mountain climbers had tried and failed to climb his border wall.

President Donald Trump made 79 false claims last week, mixing some fresh false accusations and pointlessly false anecdotes into his usual stew of repeat favorites.

Seventy-nine false claims is down from 90 the week prior to last , Trump's highest total since we started counting at CNN on July 8, but it was still his fourth-most-dishonest of these 11 weeks. His weekly average since July 8 is now 59 false claims.

Trump made 29 of last week's 79 false claims at his campaign rally in New Mexico. He made 13 more in his White House meeting and press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, seven on Twitter. The rest came in a smattering of events, interviews and exchanges with reporters.

Twenty-seven of the false claims were about the economy, 15 about Democrats.

The most egregious false claim: The Ukraine delay

Facing difficult questions about why he delayed military aid to Ukraine, Trump and his allies have tested out a variety of possible explanations. At one point last week, though, Trump decided to just deny the very existence of the delay.

""I didn't delay anything,"" he told reporters . ""We paid the military aid, to the best of my knowledge.""

The money was paid, but that payment very clearly came after a delay. By this week, Trump was openly defending the delay he had said did not happen.

""I'd withhold again and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine, because they're not doing it,"" he said -- which is also not true.

The most revealing false claim: Maligning Omar, again

This time, Trump amplified a tweet from a conservative commentator, Terrence K. Williams. Posting a video of Omar dancing, Williams accused her of partying on the anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

The most absurd false claim: The name of the Democratic Party

For sheer weirdness, it is hard to top Trump's story about the mountain climbers and the border wall. But we say his claim about the Democratic Party did it.

Some of Trump's false claims are so bizarre that it's almost embarrassing to check them. When you do, some of his supporters will inevitably accuse you of humorlessness or pettiness.

Whatever: this is a comprehensive tally, and we must do our solemn duty. Thus, we must point out that ... the name of the Democratic Party is the Democratic Party.

We must do so because Trump has repeatedly and solemnly insisted that the actual name is the ""Democrat Party.""

He said last week, again, that he is not only using ""Democrat Party"" because it sounds worse but because that is the party's official name. He urged the Democrats to make a change to the nicer ""Democratic Party,"" in which case he might call them that.

Yes, he might just be trolling. No, that does not make any of this less confusing.

Here is a list of false claims from last week that we had not previously fact checked in a weekly update:

Google and the 2016 election

""Did you see Google? He said I may have lost 2 million to 10 million votes according to this character that worked at Google, right? And we still won. How the hell did we win? Everybody was against us. How did we win? How did we win? This is a Google executive. From two million to 10.5 million votes, and we won."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: That flawed study was conducted by a psychologist, not a Google employee or executive. You can read a full fact check on the study : That flawed study was conducted by a psychologist, not a Google employee or executive. You can read a full fact check on the study here

Joe Biden

Hunter Biden and the investigation

""The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, want to stay as far away as possible from the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son, or they won't get a very large amount of U.S. money..."" -- September 21 tweet

""And, you know, he really made it a -- it was an offer. It was beyond an offer. It was something where he said, 'I'm not going to give billions of dollars to Ukraine unless they remove this prosecutor.' And they removed the prosecutor supposedly in one hour. And the prosecutor was prosecuting the company of the son and the son."" -- September 22 exchange with reporters after Coast Guard briefing in Houston

Facts First: There is no public evidence that Hunter Biden was ever himself under investigation.

The investigation, as far as we know, was into the business activities of Mykola Zlochevsky, who owned a natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, for which Hunter Biden had sat on the board of directors since 2014. The United Kingdom had begun investigating Zlochevsky before Hunter Biden joined the board.

""Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws -- at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,"" Shokin's successor as prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Bloomberg.

Joe Biden and ""the case""

""Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case. So, somebody ought to look into that."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters at meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: There is no evidence that Biden ever called on Ukraine to remove its chief prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, from a case involving Mykola Zlochevsky, the owner of a natural gas company on whose board of directors Biden's son Hunter Biden sat. Rather, Biden, like the US government more broadly and several US allies, tried to get Shokin fired.

Trump's allies might argue that calling for a prosecutor's firing was even worse than calling for him to be taken off a particular case. But there is a key difference given the context.

Had Biden called for Shokin to be taken off a particular matter in which his son had a stake, this would seem to suggest that his motivation was helping his son. But Biden calling for Shokin's firing, without mentioning that particular case, was consistent with the international concern about Shokin's performance.

Joe Biden's previous comments

""This is a very dishonest thing that Joe Biden did. And then he said he never spoke to this son. Does anybody believe that one? But then he also said, long before, that that he did speak to his son. So he lied, again."" And: ""I mean, give me a break, he's already said he spoke to his son. And now he said, yesterday, very firmly. Who wouldn't speak to your son? Of course, you spoke to your son. So, he made the mistake of saying he never spoke to his son. He spoke to his son."" -- September 22 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure

Facts First: Biden has not previously said that he did speak to his son about his overseas business dealings. Rather, it was Hunter Biden who said that there was a conversation on the subject, according to a New Yorker : Biden has not previously said that he did speak to his son about his overseas business dealings. Rather, it was Hunter Biden who said that there was a conversation on the subject, according to a New Yorker article in July.

That article said this: ""As Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: 'Dad said, ""I hope you know what you are doing,"" and I said, ""I do.'""

Once is more than never, so Trump can fairly point out the contradiction -- though the New Yorker article did not offer evidence that the father-son exchange was detailed. Regardless, the elder Biden was not contradicting himself; he was contradicting his son.

Cokie Roberts

""I never met her. She never treated me nicely. But I would like to wish her family well. She was a professional, and I respect professionals. I respect you guys a lot, you people a lot. She was a real professional. Never treated me well, but I certainly respect her as a professional."" -- September 17 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

Facts First: Trump had met Roberts, who : Trump had met Roberts, who died on September 17. As CNN's Brian Stelter noted , she interviewed him at Trump Tower for a story that aired on ABC in December 1999. (Roberts also questioned him by phone during the 2016 campaign; she asked him asked about children using his campaign rhetoric to bully other children. He called the question ""very nasty."")

Trump, who has been interviewed many hundreds of times, could well have just forgotten the 1999 meeting, but his statement was false regardless of his intent.

San Francisco, the ocean and needles

""We'll start with those two cities and we're looking at San Francisco, we're looking at Los Angeles. And we're looking at all of the things that are happening. You know, there's tremendous pollution being put into the ocean, because they're going through what's called a storm sewer. That's for rainwater. And we have tremendous things that we don't have to discuss pouring into the ocean. There are needles, there are other things. Lot of bad -- lot of -- it's a terrible situation. That's in Los Angeles and in San Francisco. And we're going to be giving San Francisco -- they're in total violation -- we're going to be giving them the notice very soon."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

Facts First: There is no evidence for Trump's claim that San Francisco has significant pollution, including needles, being sent into the ocean through storm sewers.

San Francisco Mayor London Breed called Trump's claims ""ridiculous,"" saying in a statement that the city's sewer system ""ensures that all debris that flow into storm drains are filtered out at the city's wastewater treatment plants."" David Lewis, executive director of nonprofit Save the Bay, told the Mercury News: ""In San Francisco, all solids in that stormwater and sewage water are removed. And what comes out of the plant is sometimes cleaner than the water that many people in this state are drinking.""

The San Francisco Chronicle reported : ""Storm drain runoff is piped to one of two city treatment facilities, the Southeast Treatment Plant in the Bayview neighborhood or the Oceanside Treatment Plant near the zoo. Any pollutants would be treated at those points if they haven't already been filtered out at catch basins beneath city streets, according to the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. 'We haven't had any (recent) problems with syringes,' said SFPUC spokesman Tyler Gamble.""

Mountain climbers and the wall

""We actually built prototypes and we have, I guess you could say, world-class mountain climbers. We got climbers. We had 20 mountain climbers. That's all they do; they love to climb mountains. They can have it. Me, I don't want to climb mountains. But they're very good. And some of them were champions. And we gave them different prototypes of walls, and this was the one that was hardest to climb."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: There is no evidence that 20 mountain climbers, or any number of champion mountain climbers, were recruited to test Trump's border barriers. When The Daily Beast : There is no evidence that 20 mountain climbers, or any number of champion mountain climbers, were recruited to test Trump's border barriers. When The Daily Beast contacted several top mountain climbers and governing body USA Climbing, nobody had any idea what Trump was talking about. Customs and Border Protection refused to comment to CNN, referring questions to the White House.

The wall and San Diego

""You know in San Diego, California, is very difficult, always complaining, not doing great, but they wanted a wall in San Diego -- good mayor in San Diego, by the way. They wanted a wall, and I said, 'You know what, let's build it someplace else, because California, you know, once we build it, they'll complain.'"" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: It is possible that someone or some group from San Diego told him they wanted a wall, but as we : It is possible that someone or some group from San Diego told him they wanted a wall, but as we reported at the Toronto Star, there is no basis for Trump's repeated suggestion that the city itself wanted a wall. San Diego's city council voted 5-3 in 2017 to express opposition to the proposal, and even the Republican mayor Trump was praising here, Kevin Faulconer, has made clear that he is opposed

The name of the Democratic Party

Trump said he calls the Democratic Party the ""Democrat Party"" not only because ""Democrat"" sounds worse than ""Democratic"" but because ""that's their name, the Democrat Party""; he said, ""Frankly, they should probably change it -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The party is already named the Democratic Party. We realize this is a strange-sounding fact check, but Trump has repeatedly : The party is already named the Democratic Party. We realize this is a strange-sounding fact check, but Trump has repeatedly insisted that the actual name is the Democrat Party, so we are not going to let it slide.

A tweet on Ilhan Omar

Trump shared a tweet from comedian and conservative commentator Terrence K. Williams, who alleged that Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar was dancing on the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In his own comment above Williams' tweet, which Williams later deleted, Trump wrote , ""IIhan Omar, a member of AOC Plus 3, will win us the Great State of Minnesota. The new face of the Democrat Party!"" -- September 18 tweet

Facts First: The footage of Omar dancing was from September 13, 2019, not the anniversary of September 11. She was attending an event, called Breaking Concrete Ceilings, connected to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's Annual Legislative Conference.

Nuclear weapons

""Our nuclear was getting very tired. They hadn't spent the money on it. And now we have it have it in, as we would say, 'tippy-top shape.' Tippy-top. It's — we have new and we have renovated and it's — it's incredible."" --September 20 press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

""As you know, we've spent tremendous and hopefully -- and we pray to God we never have to use it, but we've totally renovated and bought new nuclear. And the rest of our military is all brand new. The nuclear now is at a level that's it's never been before."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: ""Tired"" is vague and subjective, but experts reject that characterization of the US nuclear arsenal prior to the Trump administration. Obama did spend money on the arsenal, launching a modernization program that is expected to : ""Tired"" is vague and subjective, but experts reject that characterization of the US nuclear arsenal prior to the Trump administration. Obama did spend money on the arsenal, launching a modernization program that is expected to cost more than $1 trillion . And experts say that Trump has not yet implemented significant changes to the arsenal.

""I feel comfortable saying that the scientific studies to date have yet to provide any evidence that the nuclear arsenal was 'tired' or in any way at risk of being ineffective if called upon,"" said Scott Kemp, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Nuclear Security and Policy.

""I am not aware that Trump can claim to have done anything for the state of the nuclear arsenal — but nothing urgent needed to be done anyway,"" said Kemp, who served as a State Department adviser on arms control early in the Obama administration.

Alexandra Bell, senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control & Non-Proliferation, said that, with the exception of a hypothetical top-secret development she doesn't know about, ""everything is the same"" in the deployed arsenal ""as it was in January 2017"" -- aside from reductions the US made to fulfill its obligations under the New START treaty with Russia.

While ""the Trump administration has certainly requested and received increased funding for nuclear modernization,"" Bell said, ""this is a trajectory we have been on since 2010 "" -- and ""he hasn't really changed anything yet.""

""Budgets clearly demonstrate that we have spent enormous of money on nuclear modernization over the past decade,"" said Bell, who served in the State Department under Obama from 2010 to 2017.

A wall at the Democratic convention?

Talking about the large barriers he had visited at a California border site and is planning to erect elsewhere, Trump was asked if that's what he wants around the White House grounds. He said, ""No, but that's what the Democrats are putting up around their convention...They're building a big wall around their convention. Which they should do."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

""You know what I saw the other day? Where the Democrats are having their convention, their national convention. They just gave out a tremendous contract. You know what it's for? They're building a big wall around the building, they're building a big wall, a massive wall."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: There is no evidence that the Democrats are planning to erect a big wall around the convention site. ""It's not true,"" Democratic National Committee spokesman Brandon Gassaway told CNN.

There will likely be some sort of security fencing in the vicinity of the convention, as is standard, but there are no known plans for a wall even slightly resembling the steel-and-concrete structure Trump visited in California.

The Green New Deal and cars

Trump said that, under the Democrats' Green New Deal proposal, people would be limited to one car: ""Now, under the Green New Deal that (energy revenue) all goes away, that all goes away. It all goes away. You can forget it. No more cows, no more airplanes, no more trips. A single car. Make it electric -- single car, you're not allowed to travel more than 162 miles."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The congressional : The congressional resolution on the Green New Deal does not include any restrictions on the number of cars people could own or the number of miles they could drive.

The proposal calls for ""overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible, including through investment in zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing; clean, affordable, and accessible public transit; and high-speed rail.""

Bay of Pigs veterans

""You know just before the last election, the Cubans from Miami, where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote close to 90%. They gave me the Bay of Pigs award. Can you imagine, right? The Bay of Pigs award."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump got an endorsement, not an award, from the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association. The : Trump got an endorsement, not an award, from the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association. The endorsement was the first the association had ever made in a presidential election, so Trump could fairly boast about it. But still, an award and an endorsement are different things. (Trump claimed in August to have received an award from the Log Cabin Republicans, which told CNN it gave him an endorsement but not an award.)

Trump's Cuban American support in 2016

""You know just before the last election, the Cubans from Miami, where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote close to 90%..."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump did not get anywhere near 90% of the Cuban-American vote, in Miami or elsewhere, according to multiple analyses : Trump did not get anywhere near 90% of the Cuban-American vote, in Miami or elsewhere, according to multiple analyses reported on by the Miami Herald when Trump claimed in 2017 that he had received ""84%"" of the Cuban-American vote. The Herald noted that estimates range from 50% to 58%.

The Herald reported: ""Mauricio Claver-Carone, former executive director of the US-Cuba Democracy PAC who was appointed by Trump to the Treasury Department, estimated that Trump won 58% of the Cuban-American vote based on his review of results from about 30 Miami-Dade precincts with large Cuban-American populations."" As the Herald reported, University of Florida professor Daniel A. Smith found that Trump's best performance with Cuban-American voters in any Miami-Dade precinct was 68%.

Military aid to Ukraine

Question: ""How do you explain the military aid, sir? How do you explain delaying military aid (inaudible)?"" Trump: ""Because I want Germany and I want France and I want the European Union to put up money. And I didn't delay anything. We paid the military aid, to the best of my knowledge."" -- September 22 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure

Facts First: Trump's administration did delay military aid to Ukraine. : Trump's administration did delay military aid to Ukraine. CNN , the Washington Post and the New York Times reported that Trump himself ordered the hold on the aid.

Trump was correct that the aid was eventually paid, but he was incorrect when he denied the very existence of a delay; the delay has been publicly discussed by members of Congress and by people who were serving in the Ukrainian government this summer. The Post reported that although the Trump administration notified congressional officials in February and in May that portions of the aid was going to be released, but the release didn't actually happen until September.

The estate tax

""And to keep New Mexico's farms, ranches and small businesses in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax or death tax so that you can now give your farm or your ranch to your children."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. His 2017 tax law raised the threshold at which the tax must be paid, from $5.5 million to $11.2 million for an individual, but : Trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. His 2017 tax law raised the threshold at which the tax must be paid, from $5.5 million to $11.2 million for an individual, but did not get rid of the tax entirely

It's also misleading to suggest that the estate tax had been a particular burden on farms and small businesses; very few of them were paying the tax even before Trump's changes came into effect. According to the Tax Policy Center, a mere 50 farms and closely held businesses were among the 5,190 estates to pay the estate tax in 2017, before Trump's tax law. The Center wrote on its website: ""The Tax Policy Center estimates that small farms and businesses will pay $20 million in estate tax in 2017, one-tenth of 1 percentage of the total estate tax revenue.""

Oil prices

""Our country is doing well. You look at so many different things. Look at all of the regulation cutting that allows us to do what we did. Look at what happened three days ago — where you have an attack like that and it takes out a big chunk of oil, and the prices go up $4, $5, and now it's heading down rapidly. That tells you — that would have happened years ago, it would have gone up $50. It would've doubled. And this was a blip."" -- September 20 press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: Though oil prices did head back downward after an initial spike after the attack on Saudi oil facilities, that initial spike was larger than $4 or $5: : Though oil prices did head back downward after an initial spike after the attack on Saudi oil facilities, that initial spike was larger than $4 or $5: Brent crude futures , the international benchmark, and West Texas Intermediate futures both rose more than $8, about 15% each, between the close of trading on Friday, before the attack, and the close of trading on Monday; it was the largest single-day percentage gain for Brent since at least 1988, Reuters reported

We can't fact check Trump's hypothetical about what might have happened to oil prices if the attack had occurred some unspecified number of years ago.

The cost of the Mueller investigation

""House Judiciary has given up on the Mueller Report, sadly for them after two years and $40,000,000 spent..."" -- September 16 tweet

""...they spent $40 million -- there's not a person in the room that I couldn't find something on with that."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The Mueller investigation cost $32 million, not $40 million, according to : The Mueller investigation cost $32 million, not $40 million, according to figures released by the Justice Department -- and the government is expected recoup about $17 million as a result of the investigation, according to a CNN analysis of the sentences handed out to people charged by Mueller.

The vast majority of this $17 million is expected to come from former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was ordered to forfeit assets and pay millions to the Internal Revenue Service.

Here's a list of claims we've fact checked before in one of our weekly updates:

Immigration

Mexican troops on the border

""And I want to thank the President of Mexico, who right now has 27,000 soldiers on our southern border. It's been incredible what's taken place in a short period of time."" -- September 22 speech at Howdy, Modi event in Houston

Facts First: The approximately 26,000 troops are split between the US border and Mexico's southern border. Trump himself said in late July that 6,000 of the troops were near Guatemala; speaking to the press in September, acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner Mark Morgan said , ""Since June, Mexico has deployed thousands of troops. They've created a new national guard within their country: 10,000 troops to the southern border; 15,000 troops to the norther border with the United States.""

Mexico's immigration assistance

""You know, Mexico has never done anything to impede people from pouring into our country, and now they're doing just the opposite. They've really been incredible."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: Mexico also took action to impede migrants from entering the United States during the Obama administration.

Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, noted that the Mexican government beefed up its border enforcement measures as part of a cooperation program with the US that aimed to address the 2014 surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America. ""The numbers of unaccompanied minors dropped as a result of this cooperation (and the two countries dealt with a second, smaller spike in 2016 the same way),"" Selee said. He added: ""The Mexican government has actually deported more Central Americans to their home countries since 2015 than the US government has, sharply limiting the number of migrants from that region that have made it to the US border.""

Building the wall

""Well, this section is 14 (miles), but we're building many that are 50 and 40 and 17 and different areas. We're building on many different sites all up and down along the border."" -- September 18 interview with Fox News' Ed Henry

""Well, you know we're building the wall and it's going up and it's going up fast."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

""Now, the wall still, obviously, has a ways to go, but we're building it at a breakneck speed."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: Trump was exaggerating the pace of border-barrier construction. No new miles of border wall had been built during Trump's presidency as of August, Customs and Border Protection told CNN's Geneva Sands. Sixty miles of existing barriers had been replaced over Trump's tenure in office, but Trump was incorrect that there are ""many"" sections of 50, 40 and 17 miles under construction.

Democrats and the border

Trump said the Democrats have an agenda of ""open borders."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Even Democratic presidential candidates who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests.

Human trafficking

""If you want to stop the drug smugglers and the human traffickers, how about the human traffic? And they traffic really for the most part in women, that's what they traffic in, it's women. They're not trafficking in men, they capture women and they bring them across the open borders and they don't go through ports of entry where you have guards standing there with guns and rifles and everything else. They go out into the desert areas and they hang a left or they hang a right and they come in."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Many human trafficking victims do indeed come through ports of entry, according to US experts on trafficking and according to international data.

Experts say that victims are more likely to be deceived into crossing the border willingly than kidnapped and put in the back of a vehicle. ""I have worked on human trafficking on multiple continents in multiple countries for more than two decades, and in all the work that I've done with trafficking victims, I have met one who was actually kidnapped and thrown into a car,"" Martina Vandenberg of the Human Trafficking Legal Center told CNN in January, when Trump was telling frequent stories about women being bound and gagged in cars.

Many victims, experts say, are tricked into coming to the US with promises of a good job. Others are coerced through threats to their families or themselves. While experts say there may be some cases like the ones Trump has described, they emphasize that such cases are in a small minority. In 2018, the UN International Organization for Migration found that ""in the last 10 years, almost 80% of journeys undertaken by victims trafficked internationally cross through official border points, such as airports and land border control points.""

Democrats

The Green New Deal, cows and planes

""Now, under the Green New Deal that (energy revenue) all goes away, that all goes away. It all goes away. You can forget it. No more cows, no more airplanes, no more trips."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The Democrats' Green New Deal environmental resolution does not call for the elimination of cows or planes.

Trump did not make up this claim out of thin air. A ""FAQ"" page that once appeared on the website of a leading Green New Deal proponent, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, calls for the government to ""build out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary."" In explaining why Green New Deal proponents were aiming to get to ""net-zero"" carbon emissions in 10 years rather than the more ambitious goal of zero carbon emissions at all, the FAQ said, ""We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren't sure that we'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.""

The FAQ was not an official party document and has not been broadly adopted by Green New Deal supporters. Its language about cows and planes does not appear in the text of the Green New Deal resolution many congressional Democrats have endorsed. The resolution calls for ""overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector"" and ""working collaboratively with farmers and ranchers in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector as much as is technologically feasible.

Popularity and accomplishments

Special election in North Carolina's 9th District

Trump said North Carolina congressional candidate Dan Bishop, who won a September special election, was down ""17 points three weeks ago,"" before Trump got involved. -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Bishop was not down 17 points in any : Bishop was not down 17 points in any public poll , though some did have him trailing by single-digit margins.

When we tweeted about this, Matt Wolking, deputy director of communications for the Trump campaign, responded ""Try harder"" -- pointing to a tweet by Jim Blaine, a Republican strategist, that included an apparent poll excerpt that showed Bishop down 14.

But 14 is not 17. And neither Wolking nor Blaine responded to our questions about who conducted the poll, who it was conducted for, when it was conducted, what its methodology was, or what its sample size was; Blaine's tweet did not include any of that information.

Special election in North Carolina's 3rd District

Trump said Greg Murphy, who won the special election in North Carolina's 3rd District, ""was up a couple of points"" before his victory. -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Murphy was leading by significantly more than ""a couple of points,"" according to public polling. One : Murphy was leading by significantly more than ""a couple of points,"" according to public polling. One late poll had him up by 11 points.

The poll was in line with pundits' expectations for the race, which was widely seen to be an easy Republican victory. Murphy was running in a district formerly held by the late Republican Rep. Walter Jones, who ran unopposed by the Democrats in the 2018 election; and Trump won the district by about 24 points in 2016.

Trump could have fairly said Murphy outperformed the polls, since he won by 24 points, but ""a couple of points"" is incorrect.

Suppression polls

""Now, if it's close, like it's in play, you know you wait two three four or five hours to see what it is, but they don't even take a breath because they're called suppression polls, and they're no different than all of the dishonest reporting that you people say. They're no different. They're suppression polls."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: There is simply no evidence that pollsters have manipulated their numbers to suppress the enthusiasm of Trump voters, as Trump has repeatedly alleged.

Veterans Choice

Trump boasted that he was the one who got the Veterans Choice health care Trump passed, saying, ""They've tried to get that for 45 years. They haven't been able to get it. But I'm good at getting things."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was : The Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was signed into law by Barack Obama in 2014. In 2018, Trump signed the VA Mission Act, which expanded and changed the program.

Foreign and military affairs

Venezuela's wealth

""Look at Venezuela: Venezuela, 15 years ago, was one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and today very sad, no food, no water, no nothing."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Venezuela was not one of the world's wealthiest countries 15 years ago.

The International Monetary Fund ranked Venezuela 67th in the world in 2004 by GDP per capita, at $4,019 (US) -- better than more than half of the world's countries, but nowhere near the top.

""Venezuela was one of the richest countries in the world 60 years ago. The richest in Latin America 40 years ago. But not 20 years ago,"" Ricardo Hausmann, a former Venezuelan planning minister and central bank board member, said in response to a previous version of this Trump claim. Hausmann, now a Harvard University professor of economic development, was chief economist of the Inter-American Development Bank from 1994 to 2000.

The war in Afghanistan

""We have hit — in Afghanistan, we have hit the Taliban harder than they've ever been hit in the entire 19 years of war."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters at a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: We'll ignore Trump's subjective claim about how ""hard"" the US is attacking the Taliban. ""Nineteen years of war,"" though, was a small exaggeration. The US invaded Afghanistan in October 2001, nearly 18 years ago. This was not a one-time slip though; Trump habitually says ""19 years.""

The Iran nuclear deal

""The problem was, the deal that was signed by the previous administration was a disaster — which, by the way, would be expiring in a very short period of time also. So you really don't have a deal. You know, that deal was a very short-term deal. So they made a deal, but it was for a very short period of time. So that deal would be expiring very soon."" -- September 16 exchange with reporters with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

Facts First: Some central provisions of the nuclear agreement with Iran were written to expire in the next 10 to 15 years. But the deal as a whole -- including a blanket prohibition on Iran developing nuclear weapons -- was written to continue in perpetuity. You can read a fuller fact check : Some central provisions of the nuclear agreement with Iran were written to expire in the next 10 to 15 years. But the deal as a whole -- including a blanket prohibition on Iran developing nuclear weapons -- was written to continue in perpetuity. You can read a fuller fact check here

ISIS fighters and Europe

""We have thousands of ISIS fighters and we want those fighters to be taken -- you're talking about, I think it's a big -- we have thousands of ISIS fighters that we've taken into -- we've defeated 100% of the caliphate. We are holding in various forms of prison. We're holding thousands of people. Many come from Germany, many come from France, many come from Holland -- really most of them come from various European countries. And we want them to take them back."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

""They mostly come out of Europe."" -- September 20 exchange with reporters at a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: According to Trump's own government estimates, a minority of ISIS fighters being held in Syria came from Europe.

James Jeffrey, Trump's special envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition, said August 1 that about 8,000 of 10,000 terrorist fighters who were then prisoners in northeastern Syria were Iraqi or Syrian nationals; there were ""about 2,000 ISIS foreign fighters"" from all other countries.

Trump himself tweeted in February to ask that European countries take back ""over 800"" ISIS fighters captured in Syria.

Remains from North Korea

""We've gotten our hostages back. We've gotten our great soldiers back who were killed — many of them. And many more are coming back. We have many more coming back. And the families of those — we call them 'our heroes.' And they were our heroes. And they're coming back."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters during border visit

Facts First: While North Korea returned some remains last year, it is no longer doing so. The US military announced in May that the remains program had been suspended for the rest of the 2019 fiscal year because North Korea had stopped communicating with the US agency responsible for the effort.

Trump could accurately tout the return of remains in the past tense: North Korea returned 55 cases of possible remains in the summer of 2018. But the remains are no longer being returned. You can read a longer fact check of this claim here

Trade

Unions and the USMCA

Trump said of his USMCA trade agreement, ""Unions love it."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: The agreement is generally opposed in its current form by major US unions, who have demanded changes to the text; the president of the AFL-CIO federation : The agreement is generally opposed in its current form by major US unions, who have demanded changes to the text; the president of the AFL-CIO federation says it will be a ""disaster for workers"" if it is not amended. As The New York Times has reported, the United Automobile Workers and United Steelworkers, among other unions, have also demanded changes.

Trade deficit with China

Trump said the trade deficit with China was $500 billion, alleging that previous presidents allowed China to ""to take out $500 billion a year"" or even ""more than that"" including theft of intellectual property. -- September 20 exchange with reporters at meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: Trump refers to trade deficits as losses and surpluses as gains or takings, though this characterization is rejected by many economists. The US trade deficit with China has never been $500 billion; it was : Trump refers to trade deficits as losses and surpluses as gains or takings, though this characterization is rejected by many economists. The US trade deficit with China has never been $500 billion; it was $381 billion last year when counting goods and services, $420 billion when counting goods alone.

Aid to farmers

Talking about his tariffs on China, Trump said, ""And I'm taking care of our farmers out of that. We're helping our farmers. Our farmers were targeted, and they were targeted for $16 billion. And I made that up to them. We paid them the $16 billion and had tens of billions of dollars left over."" -- September 20 press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison

Facts First: It's incorrect that there are tens of billions of dollars left over in tariff receipts after accounting for the $28 billion Trump has pledged to farmers affected by his trade war with China. (The $16 billion Trump mentioned here was a : It's incorrect that there are tens of billions of dollars left over in tariff receipts after accounting for the $28 billion Trump has pledged to farmers affected by his trade war with China. (The $16 billion Trump mentioned here was a second announcement that followed an earlier $12 billion announcement. The China-specific tariffs have generated a total of about $30 billion, according to the US government's tracking data as of September 24.

Who is paying for Trump's tariffs on China

Trump said twice that China is ""eating the tariffs"" he has imposed on imports of Chinese products, and he said on a third occasion that the government was taking in the tariff revenue ""from China.""

Facts First: A bevy of : A bevy of economic studies has found that Americans are bearing the overwhelming majority of the tariff costs, and Americans make the actual tariff payments.

China's economic performance

Trump said four times that China is having its worst economic year in ""57 years.""

Facts First: China's second-quarter growth rate was the : China's second-quarter growth rate was the worst in 27 years . Trump has repeatedly made clear that he knows that this is the reported figure, but he has added additional years for no apparent reason.

History of the tariffs

On three occasions on which eh talked about tariff revenue, Trump said the US has never previously received ""10 cents,"" ""100 cents"" or ""billions"" from China.

Facts First: The US government has been charging tariffs on imported Chinese goods for more than two centuries, and it took in billions from such tariffs long before Trump imposed his own tariffs. (As always, we'll note it is US importers and consumers, not China, who have paid these tariffs.)

The Treasury received $14 billion from tariffs on China in 2014 , to look at one pre-Trump year.

Economy and energy

Automotive investments

""My relationship has been very powerful with the autoworkers — not necessarily the top person or two, but the people that work doing automobiles. Nobody has ever brought more companies into the United States. You know, I have Japan and Germany, and many countries have been bringing car companies in and opening plants and expanding plants. "" -- September 16 exchange with reporters with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

Facts First: Contrary to Trump's claims, there has been no boom in investment from Japanese, German, or other foreign automakers during his tenure. From Trump's inauguration through July, the Center for Automotive Research, a nonprofit that studies the industry, found 66 automaker announcements of new US manufacturing facilities, or expansions or updates to existing facilities. The center found 170 such announcements in Obama's (four-year) first term, 154 in Obama's second term, according to the center's Bernard Swiecki.

Just two Japanese car companies, Toyota and Mazda, have announced plans to build a US plant (together) during Trump's presidency; their joint venture is under construction in Alabama. There is no evidence Trump was personally responsible for this investment decision.

Trump has said since 2018 that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has told him that more Japanese carmakers will soon announce major US investments. But none of these companies has announced a new US plant since Toyota and Mazda introduced the joint venture in early 2018, though Japanese automakers have made additional investments in existing facilities and Japanese truck company Hino Motors has built a truck-cab assembly plant in West Virginia.

""We know of no German or Japanese automakers currently looking to place additional car or truck assembly capacity in the United States,"" said Kristin Dziczek, the center's vice president of industry, labor and economics.

Energy independence

""Well, we have the Strategic — if you look at what we have, we have tremendous amounts of oil in our country. We're independent of everybody now."" -- September 16 exchange with reporters

""So nice that our Country is now Energy Independent. The USA is in better shape than ever before."" -- September 18 tweet

""We're independent, as independent as we want, and we are now a net exporter of energy"" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: While definitions of ""energy independence"" vary, the US is not ""energy independent"" by any definition; it is : While definitions of ""energy independence"" vary, the US is not ""energy independent"" by any definition; it is expected to export more energy than it imports by 2020, according to the government's Energy Information Administration, but that has not happened yet. In the first five months of 2019, PolitiFact noted , the US also consumed more energy than it produced.

There have been occasional, brief periods where US exports have exceed imports or where its production has exceeded consumption, but this hasn't happened for a full recent year.

""The US is still a net importer of crude and refined products, although the trend of declining dependence on imports should continue due to increased domestic production of unconventional oil and biofuels and growing investment in export infrastructure following the 2015 repeal of the crude export ban,"" said Josh Price, a senior analyst for energy and utilities at Height Capital Markets. ""Most of these factors preceded President Trump and have not been significantly altered by administration policies.""

The decrease in US imports and increase in exports began before the Trump administration. Obama presided over a boom in liquefied natural gas exports and signed a bill lifting a 40-year-old ban on crude oil exports.

""The truth is that both of the presidents of this decade (President Obama and President Trump) have presided over an incredibly brisk expansion of our capacity to produce oil and refined products. Executive policy has had little to do with the explosive gains, which are attributable to technology and price,"" said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service.

It's worth noting that the US will still be using large quantities of foreign energy even if it does become a net exporter next year. In other words, it will not be completely independent from foreign suppliers.

Energy production

Trump claimed four times that the US had only recently become the world's largest producer of oil and gas; in one of the claims, he added a message of self-congratulation in the third person: ""Thank you, Mr. President!""

Facts First: The US has not just ""now"" or ""very recently"" become the world's top energy producer, and it did not achieve this status because of Trump's policies: it took the top spot : The US has not just ""now"" or ""very recently"" become the world's top energy producer, and it did not achieve this status because of Trump's policies: it took the top spot in 2012 , under Obama, according to the US government's Energy Information Administration. The US became the top producer of crude oil in particular during Trump's tenure.

""The United States has been the world's top producer of natural gas since 2009, when US natural gas production surpassed that of Russia, and it has been the world's top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded Saudi Arabia's,"" the Energy Information Administration says

Asian American unemployment

Facts First: Trump falsely claimed four times that Asian Americans are at their lowest-ever unemployment rate. The unemployment rate for Asian Americans was : Trump falsely claimed four times that Asian Americans are at their lowest-ever unemployment rate. The unemployment rate for Asian Americans was 2.8% in August -- higher than the 2.6% rate in December 2016, Obama's last full month in office.

Overall unemployment

""Our job numbers for African Americans are the best in history. You saw the new ones came out; they're even better than they were two months ago. Hispanic, the best in history. Asian, the best in history. Overall, they're phenomenal. The best in 51 years. And I think we'll soon be historic on that one too."" -- September 16 exchange with reporters with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

""We're doing -- we have this great economy. We're doing better than we've ever done. Our employment numbers are the best they've ever been and unemployment numbers also. We are doing great. But we should be cutting. There's no inflation."" -- September 18 interview with Fox News' Ed Henry

""And unemployment in the United States has just reached the lowest level in over 51 years, and very soon, we think that will be broken to be a historic number."" -- September 22 speech at Howdy, Modi event in Houston

Facts First: Trump was exaggerating in all three cases -- very slightly with ""51 years,"" more significantly when he said ""the best they've ever been."" The Trump was exaggerating in all three cases -- very slightly with ""51 years,"" more significantly when he said ""the best they've ever been."" The unemployment rate over this spring and summer -- 3.7% in each of June, July and August, 3.6% in each of April and May -- has been the lowest since December 1969, slightly less than 50 years ago; all of these rates were well off the record 2.5%, set in 1953.

The dollar

""Will Fed ever get into the game? Dollar strongest EVER!"" -- September 16 tweet

Facts First: The dollar is not the strongest it has ever been against other currencies, according to various indices; it was significantly stronger in the 1980s and earlier this decade. You can read a longer version of this fact check : The dollar is not the strongest it has ever been against other currencies, according to various indices; it was significantly stronger in the 1980s and earlier this decade. You can read a longer version of this fact check here

Women's unemployment

Trump said at his New Mexico rally that unemployment numbers for women were the best in ""71 years.""

Facts First: This was his usual slight exaggeration. The rate this summer has been the lowest since 1953, 66 years ago.

Inflation

Trump claimed three times that there is ""no inflation."" Facts First: There is inflation: 1.7% for the last 12 months ending in August. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, was up 2.4% for the 12 months ending in August. Trump could fairly say that inflation is low, but ""no inflation"" is incorrect.

Trump could fairly say that inflation is low, but ""no inflation"" is incorrect.

Prescription drug prices

Trump claimed that last year was ""the first year in 51 years where prices went down"" for prescription drugs. -- September 16 exchange w with Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain

Facts First: This was a slight exaggeration. Prescription drug prices declined last year for the first time in 46 years, according to one of several measures. You can read a longer version of this fact check : This was a slight exaggeration. Prescription drug prices declined last year for the first time in 46 years, according to one of several measures. You can read a longer version of this fact check here

Pre-existing conditions

""And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. The Republicans will always do that."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: This promise has already proven false. Trump and Republicans, who have tried to pass : This promise has already proven false. Trump and Republicans, who have tried to pass bills that would have weakened protections for people with pre-existing conditions, are now trying to get the courts to declare Obamacare void, without a plan to replace those pre-existing protections if their lawsuit succeeds.

Air quality

""And I'm an environmentalist, I believe in the environment. I want the cleanest water on the planet. I want the cleanest air. I want a lot of things. You know right now we have the cleanest air that we've ever had in this country?"" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: By several measures, US air was cleaner under Obama than it's been under Trump. Three of the six types of pollutants identified by the Clean Air Act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before Trump took office, according to Environmental Protection Agency : By several measures, US air was cleaner under Obama than it's been under Trump. Three of the six types of pollutants identified by the Clean Air Act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before Trump took office, according to Environmental Protection Agency data

Additionally, there were more ""unhealthy air days"" for sensitive groups in 2018 than in 2016 -- 799 days across the 35 American cities surveyed by the EPA, up from 702. Though there were significantly more ""unhealthy air days"" in Obama's first term than there have been in Trump's, the lowest amount of unhealthy air days -- 598 -- occurred in 2014 under Obama.

Judicial vacancies

""President Obama said they (prisoners at Guantanamo Bay) were going to be totally completed and emptied out by the time he left office. And very much like judges, where, as you know, I ended up with 138 slots, you had a situation where that wasn't cleaned out."" -- September 18 exchange with reporters on Air Force One

""In a few short weeks, we'll be up to 180, sounds impossible, federal judges, including court of appeals judges, because President Obama did us a great favor. when I came in, I said, 'I assume I have no judges to appoint.' 'No sir, you have 138 judges.' 138, didn't put them up, couldn't get them approved. I don't know what happened, but we started off with 138."" -- September 16 campaign rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico

Facts First: Trump did not enter office with 138 judicial vacancies. According to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments, there were 103 vacancies on district and appeals courts on Jan. 1, 2017, just before Trump took office, plus a vacancy on the Supreme Court.

Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the confirmation of many of Obama's judicial nominees late in his term; Obama obviously didn't intend to ""hand"" vacancies to Trump."

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) fears the Democrat-led House impeachment effort could lead President Trump to ultimately claim vindication, he told reporters in Iowa on Tuesday.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced on Tuesday the launch of an official impeachment inquiry, using the whistleblower complaint as a launching point. This follows months of far-left “Squad” members pushing impeachment and Pelosi’s continuous stiff-arming of such efforts.

“I’m announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry,” Pelosi announced at a Capitol Hill press conference.

“I am directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry,” she said.

“The President must be held accountable. No one is above the law,” she continued, citing the Founding Fathers.

“Getting back to our founders, in the darkest days of the American Revolution, Thomas Paine wrote that times have found us, that times found them to fight for and establish our democracy,” she added. “The times have found us today”:

Nancy Pelosi: ""Therefore today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry."" pic.twitter.com/HyHKD39N7M — Axios (@axios) September 24, 2019

Several 2020 Democrat candidates called for the inquiry prior to Pelosi’s announcement.

“This isn’t a partisan issue—or shouldn’t be,” Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) tweeted. “When the president of the United States is working with other countries to interfere with our elections, we should begin impeachment proceedings.”

“It was true when I said it in 2017 running for Senate in Texas and it’s still true today: President Trump should be impeached,” former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D) added.

“The House must impeach. It must start today,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wrote.

Noticeably absent though, was Sanders. While he believes that “impeachable offenses” exist, he signaled that Democrats may be acting too hastily and would not say if he would support the impeachment effort if it made it to the Senate.

“Here’s the dilemma that you have,” Sanders told reporters in Iowa on Tuesday, according to BuzzFeed News. “Now I don’t know — I’ll tell you that my gut is that the average Republican in the Senate and the House is totally intimidated by President Trump.”

“And at this particular point, I have my doubts, like you all. I have my doubts that any Republican, or very few, would vote against him,” he continued, detailing his fear. Sanders worries that – in the event that the impeachment effort gets passed on to the Senate – which would require a two-thirds majority (or 67 votes) – it would fail and Trump would claim vindication as a result.

“I know and you know what [Trump] will do: ‘I am vindicated! … I am vindicated!’ And I think that is a fact that has to be taken into consideration,” Sanders said, according to BuzzFeed.

“But what do you do when you have a president who has acted in an unconstitutional way? If that is the findings,” Sanders continued. “Again, I don’t want to judge it. I think that is the face. But there is a process that has to take place.”

Sanders reiterated that he believes there are impeachable offenses, and he has signaled such before, floating an inquiry in May:

It is obvious that the President is a pathological liar who does not understand the Constitution. The fact is that if Mr. Trump continues to disregard the right of Congress to subpoena, he will leave House Members with no choice but to begin an impeachment inquiry. — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) May 23, 2019

“I believe that there are impeachable offenses. That’s my view. But my view is not good enough,” Sanders said, according to BuzzFeed News.

“I happen to believe that there are grounds to do it. But you have to lay it out,” Sanders explained, refusing to reveal his thoughts on the controversy surrounding Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine.

“I know I’m a little bit old-fashioned. I like to see the evidence before I talk about things. I read the papers and I read what I read,” Sanders said. “But I don’t know that I know enough at this point to make any definitive statement.”

Fellow presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has taken her position on impeachment farther than Sanders, telling CNN’s Newsroom on Tuesday that impeachment would “further tear apart an already divided country.”

“Impeachment is something — that is a step that will divide the country and will be worse off for our country,” she said."

Warren, the Massachusetts senator and a frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic nomination, has been a frequent critic of corporate malfeasance.

In a letter sent to Securities and Exchange Commission chair Jay Clayton on Thursday, Warren said that even though reforms were put into place after the 2008 financial crisis to increase oversight of the ratings agencies, ""the SEC and other federal agencies have neglected or delayed implementation of many of the changes.""

She said a big problem is that companies pay Moody's and S&P to rate their bonds.

""Under the issuer-pays model, bond issuers - like large financial institutions - pay the agencies for their assessments of the products they hope to sell, ultimately giving the rating firms an incentive to give better ratings, regardless of the risk, since bond issuers might otherwise go to their competitors,"" Warren wrote.

""Right now, I'd like to just see us do the Ukraine issue because it is so clear and it is such a clear violation of law,"" the Massachusetts Democrat said in an interview in her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the day after the release of a stunning whistleblower complaint about Trump and his conduct.

""The President is asking for help against one of his political rivals and asking a foreign government for a thing of value for himself personally. That's against the law,"" she continued.

Warren's comments come as Democrats debate how broadly to draft articles of impeachment against the President. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Democrats in a private meeting on Wednesday that she wants to focus on Trump's conversations with Ukraine, according to several sources involved in the discussions. A resolution that is more broad could make it more complicated to get the necessary votes on the House floor, according to multiple Democratic sources.

But some Democrats who backed impeachment earlier on said they want the focus of the inquiry to include findings of potential obstruction of justice, saying Trump shouldn't be let off the hook for allegedly trying to thwart former special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe . Others say the inquiry should address Trump's involvement in alleged hush-money payments to prevent stories of his alleged affairs from coming out before the 2016 election.

The whistleblower complaint detailed various ways in which the whistleblower believed Trump sought to ""solicit interference"" from Ukraine ahead of the 2020 election, including by encouraging Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig into Hunter Biden's past. It also laid out an alleged pattern of efforts by the White House to cover up those attempts.

The White House released a transcript of a call between Trump and Zelensky, showing Trump repeatedly pushing his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Biden and his son. The transcript has drawn further scrutiny because it had been moved to a highly secure server. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.

""They didn't leave that transcript in the regular course of transcripts of phone calls with foreign leaders. Why? Because it wasn't a regular call,"" Warren said. ""It was a call that violated the law. And so their immediate instinct is: Let's block it out. Let's make sure nobody can see it. Let's cover it up.""

On whether she believes any Senate Republicans would vote to convict Trump, Warren answered: ""I don't know.""

""I think everyone in Congress should be called on to vote,"" she added. ""Everyone who took an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States and then they should have to live with that vote forever.""

Warren, who has risen in recent polls and is running neck-and-neck with Joe Biden, said she hoped the impeachment process could be wrapped up before voting in the Democratic primary begins in February. She has called on the House to begin impeachment proceedings since April after the release of Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Asked whether Hunter Biden's business dealings should be off limits in the 2020 campaign, Warren pivoted back to Trump.

""I believe that this issue is about Donald Trump and that's where we need to keep our focus,"" she said. ""He is the President of the United States and he has solicited a foreign government interfering in our 2020 election. That is a threat to democracy and it is a threat to our Constitution. That's where we need to focus.""

Warren also told CNN on Friday that she worries for the safety of the whistleblower, whose identity remains unknown to the public. She said Trump and his administration are ""doing their best to try to cover this up and discredit anyone who's trying to get to the truth.""

Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire on Thursday testified before the House Intelligence Committee about the complaint and defended the whistleblower, saying the whistleblower ""did the right thing.""

More than half of the House of Representatives now supports an inquiry, after Pelosi announced Tuesday a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump."

Coulter, the author of “Resistance Is Futile!: How the Trump-Hating Left Lost Its Collective Mind,” told Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN during an appearance in Washington, D.C. at the Federation for American Immigration Reform’s (FAIR) Hold Their Feet to the Fire annual radio event that it was “very suspicious” how specifics about new U.S.-Mexico border wall construction was not readily made available to the public.

“It’s very suspicious that we can’t get a straight answer from them on is any new wall being built where there was nothing before?” Coulter said. “Now admittedly I’ve seen about 50 miles on a 3,000-mile border, so who cares? Fifty miles does nothing when you have a 3,000-mile border. They were crappy little fences. Any little car or a person can get past it. But there was a fence and should we create a real fence there? Yes, definitely – an improvement. But it does make a difference is if they created real wall where there was nothing before. It shows that they have the building permits, that there is no EPA problem with disturbing a snail darter – you’re actually doing something new here, and you’ve gotten the go-ahead. And I believe the answer to that is ‘no’ because every time we get a straight answer, the answer is ‘no.’”

She recounted an effort relayed to her by someone having a difficult time getting answers about progress on wall construction.

“Last I heard, one of our friends was pressing the White House – he showed it to me – he sent it to me secretly the email thread, and it’s just hilarious,” she continued. “He keeps asking – ‘Yes, yes, yes but just so I can go back to Coulter and say ‘new wall is being built.’ Can you tell me if new wall is being built where it is being built? And they will not answer that question.”

As for the 2020 presidential election and what Trump’s potentially unfulfilled pledges pertaining to immigration issues might mean for its outcome, Coulter said a lot of next year’s election had to do with the Democratic Party opposition.

“The Democrats are doing everything they can to lose this election – not only by the candidates they’re running, not only by their positions,” she said. “They seem to that if Trump wants to protect America’s working class, then we hate America’s working class. If Trump doesn’t want illegal aliens, then we love illegal aliens. They’re taking the most absurd positions. We could get the Democratic Party to officially come out for pederasty if we told them, ‘You know, Trump is against pederasty. He really wants to go after the pederasts.’ That would be a plank in the Democratic platform. So we have that, and we have this nonsense with the call with the Ukrainian guy today.”

She said Trump’s 2016 election victory was a result of a combination GOP voters being energized and Democrat complacency.

“Leaving aside how crazy they are, this is the argument for why we should be nervous,” she continued. “It was kind of a miracle victory in 2016. Trump won by 80,000 voters basically spread out over four states in the industrial Midwest, i.e., white working-class voters, who have not voted in elections in 30 years. The Democrats were caught sleeping. They were so sure it was going to be a 46-state landslide for Hillary [Clinton]. You know there were a lot of Democrats who thought, ‘Ah, I don’t want to get up early. I’m just going to say I vote. She’s going to win anyway.’”

However, Coulter warned without action on the border wall and the so-called DREAMers, some of those Trump voters may not be there in 2020.

“[I] think there are a lot of Trump voters – I know there are besides me – they voted for him for the wall, for him to end the DREAMers,” she said. “So why hasn’t he done that? No, you can’t blame Mitch McConnell for that. You can’t blame Paul Ryan for that. You certainly can’t blame the Democrats. That was an unconstitutional executive order. Obama admitted it was unconstitutional for six years until he signed it. He kept telling all these left-wing activist groups, ‘I can’t grant amnesty on my own, that would be unconstitutional.’ Then he signed. Mitch McConnell won.”

“I think a fair number, and it doesn’t take that many, of Trump’s voters to be discouraged,” she added. “The one thing that is going to get them to the polls and is going to get Ann to the polls is the terror of having some lunatic like Elizabeth Warren elected.”

""To address several inquiries we have received we are writing to let you know that, pending a final decision after the certification deadline, it is the intention of the DNC and our media partners to hold the October debate over one night on Tuesday October 15th,"" the DNC wrote in an email Friday morning.

The party's fourth sanctioned primary debate will air live at 8 p.m. ET from the campus of Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, with CNN anchors Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper and New York Times national editor Marc Lacey serving as moderators.

Twelve candidates have said they surpassed the polling and contribution thresholds outlined by the DNC to receive an invitation to participate in the debate: former Vice President Joe Biden, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, businessman Tom Steyer, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and businessman Andrew Yang.

At this time, no other candidate appears close to reaching the polling and fundraising thresholds by the October 1 deadline. To receive an invitation to the debate, candidates need a to meet a 2% polling threshold in four DNC-approved polls and at least 130,000 unique donors, including 400 donors per state from at least 20 states, to qualify.

""We ask that you to immediately reverse course and heed the recommendation of top US military officials and faith leaders to open our doors to eligible refugees from all corners of the world,"" the letter reads. ""A generous US refugee policy spares tens of thousands from terrible fates.""

The letter, led by Sens. Jeff Merkley and Ed Markey, comes on the heels of the State Department's report to Congress that proposed a refugee cap -- which dictates how many refugees may be admitted to the US -- to 18,000 for fiscal year 2020, which begins next week.

Under Trump, the administration has slowly chipped away at the refugee cap. The ceiling for fiscal year 2019 stands at 30,000, which, at the time, was the lowest level since 1980.

The State Department announced the proposed refugee ceiling Thursday as part of a larger number of combined refugee and asylum claims expected for the next fiscal year.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

The possible super PAC is far from operational, but Larry Rasky, a former Biden aide, has led the effort to stand up an outside group that he believes would help the former vice president rebut attacks that could impact Biden's standing in the crowded and contentious Democratic primary. While Biden is still seen as a front-runner in the race, recent polling has shown his once-large lead slipping as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren rises in the field

""For me, this week puts everything into stark relief,"" Rasky said. He added that he has begun to think ""the campaign was being a little naïve about the resources we'd need to fight this.""

""The campaign is fighting a war on two fronts -- the primary and the general election -- at the same time. They certainly need all the support they can get.""

News of the super PAC, which was first reported by The New York Times , was not welcome inside Biden's campaign. Biden's team, from the outset of his presidential bid, has said they would disavow any outside spending on the former vice president's behalf. This case is no different. TJ Ducklo, a spokesman for Biden, reiterated Friday that the campaign would reject any help from outside super PACs.

""The attacks aimed at this campaign from dark money groups helping Donald Trump spread his outlandish lies and slander have only served as a reminder of the urgent need for campaign finance reform,"" Ducklo said. ""Which is exactly why since the beginning of this campaign, Biden for President has not and will not welcome the help of super PACs. That goes for those that purport to help him, despite his explicit condemnation of their existence.""

A source familiar with the internal Biden campaign strategy, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the outside effort, put a finer point on it.

""The campaign had its best week of fundraising since the second week after launching, and it would be impossible to miss from anywhere on earth that Donald Trump is panicked about Joe Biden,"" the source said. ""The campaign doesn't need or want this effort, and anyone engaging in it doesn't have its best interests at heart.""

Rasky said he expected that his prospective effort would be disavowed by the campaign, but he and others still believe the outside group is needed to rebut attacks leveled by Trump and other Republicans.

""We are dead serious about the need to do it,"" Rasky said. ""But we are also mindful of the campaign's position and the Vice President's expressed desire not to have one. That is a lot for us to ponder.""

Biden's campaign is not the first to have a super PAC considering spending on its behalf. A super PAC ran ads in support of Washington Gov. Jay Inslee during his now-ended presidential bid. And top Democratic donors considered launching a super PAC to help New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker earlier this year. Booker did not back the effort.

A source close to the possible super PAC said that while its focus would be to respond to attacks from Trump and other Republicans, they would not rule out responding to Democratic attacks on Biden.

""That's not what it is for,"" the source said, ""but if Biden is attacked, we need to defend him."""

""Do I have any confidence, hope or what not, that the Justice Department would be willing to investigate?"" he added. ""No.""

The Justice Department, Schiff said, ""made it clear they're not going to investigate this and they don't want anyone else to. The fact that they would so cavalierly dismiss this credible evidence and say it is not even worthy of us looking into is yet another affirmation that Attorney General Bill Barr believes that he exists to serve the will and interest of the President, not the presidency, and that's exactly what he's doing.""

Schiff's comments come the same day acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the Intelligence Committee about his handling of a whistleblower complaint that has set off a politically explosive week in Washington.

Civiqs surveyed 1,548 registered voters September 21-24, 2019, and asked respondents whom they would support in hypothetical general election matchups featuring the president and top Democrat presidential candidates.

“If the election for president of the United States were held today, and the choices were Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren, who would you vote for?” the survey asked.

In that scenario, 48 percent of voters chose Warren, and 44 percent chose Donald Trump, taking her lead outside of the 2.8 percent margin of error.

The survey asked the same question, replacing Warren with Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA). While Biden also experienced a four-point advantage over the president – 47 percent to 43 percent – he did not earn as much national support as Warren, who edged him out by one point. It further signals an increase in the Massachusetts senator’s electability.

The poll found Sanders with a two-point advantage over Trump – 46 percent to 44 percent – and Harris tied with the president with 44 percent each:

“I wanted to give you call just to say thank you. I’m glad we’re going to be in this fight together side by side. I love the endorsement and for all the right reasons,” Warren said.

“Thank you so much. Well you know I have to tell you,” he began, telling Warren when he began to realize that she was the candidate for him.

“It was at the last debates and I was like ‘this health insurance industry is a f*cking racket,” he said.

“It felt right,” Warren said as she pounded her chest.

“That’s why we’ve got to do it. Because it is right. Health care is a basic human right, and we fight for basic human rights. Not just for some of us. For all of us,” Warren said.

“I’m so excited to be shoulder to shoulder with you too. I can’t believe you called,” Van Ness gushed. “Let me know how I can be of service. I really want to help.”

“Yep. Were going to do it together,” Warren said to an awkward pause and filling in the silence by telling him to “be strong.”

“Go save America,” Van Ness said, before pivoting the conversation and telling Warren that they must get rid of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) because “he’s the worst.”

“Like we also really got to get that Mitch out of there because regardless of what – I mean Mitch McConnell, he’s the worst,” he said.

“We got to take the Senate. We’re going to take Congress back,” he continued, quickly correcting himself, as Democrats already possess a House majority.

“Well we already have Congress,” he said, adding, “and then we got to get you in the White House, and we’re just going to sort everything out.”

“So you go Save America, I’m going to keep doing these interviews, and I can’t believe you took the time to talk to me and I’ll talk to you soon,” he added.

“Ok, talk to you soon. Be strong out there,” Warren said.

“Thank you, I will. You too,” he added with an enthusiastic “Ah!”

Van Ness is hardly the first supporter Warren has called to thank. The presidential candidate tweeted videos of personal calls she made to grassroots donors, thanking them for contributing to her campaign, on Friday:

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Thursday refused to say if Medicare for All will result in higher taxes for middle class families, dodging the question and instead claiming people care more about overall “costs.”

Warren spoke to NBC News’ Ali Vitali, who asked the Massachusetts senator if Medicare for All will result in higher taxes for middle class families– a question Warren has faced several times before on both the debate stage and campaign trail. Once again, Warren did not answer the question, instead claiming that families care more about overall “costs”:

“So one of the things that a few of your opponents were talking about late last week really was this idea of middle class taxes in healthcare. So yes or no– should middle class Americans expect their taxes to go up under a Medicare for All system?” Vitali asked.

“You may remember that I’ve spent a big chunk of my life studying why middle class families go broke, and one of the number one reasons is health care,” Warren said, repeating one of her routine talking points.

“The problem is its total cost for these families, so it’s what you pay in premiums. It’s also what you paying co-pays to see a doctor, or sorry that doctor is out of network so you’ve got to pay for the whole thing,” she explained.

Because of that, Warren suggested that Americans need to change the way they view the system:

People keep reaching into their pockets and reaching into their pockets even when they have health insurance, so how we have to think about this system is yes we should expect that for giant corporations and very wealthy individuals, costs will go up, but for middle class families – for hardworking people – the costs are going to go down.

“But that’s not the same as taxes not going up,” Vitali pointed out.

Warren did not dismiss Vitali’s assertion but argued that families care more about overall “costs,” regardless of increased taxes.

“What matters to families is costs,” Warren said.

Warren faced the same question during the Democrat debate in Houston, Texas, and repeated the same lines about total “cost.”

“What we’re talking about here is what’s going to happen in families’ pockets, what’s going to happen in their budgets, and the answer is, on Medicare for All, costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals and costs are going to go up for giant corporations,” she said.

“But for hardworking families across this country costs are going to go down, and that’s how it should work under Medicare for All,” she added, refusing to ultimately say if middle class taxes would go up, regardless of overall “costs.”

Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) went after Warren for repeatedly refusing to answer the question.

“Senator Warren is known for being straightforward, and was extremely evasive when asked that question, and we’ve seen that repeatedly,” he told CNN’s The Lead last week.

“I think that if you are proud of your plan and it’s the right plan, you should defend it in straightforward terms,” he continued.

“And I think it’s puzzling that when everybody knows the answer to that question, of whether her plan and Senator Sanders’ plan will raise middle-class taxes is yes, why you wouldn’t just say so and then explain why you think that’s the better way forward,” he added."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) told supporters during a campaign stop in Keene, New Hampshire, on Wednesday that Americans should phase out new homes, buildings, and vehicles that produce carbon emissions over the next 16 years.

Warren said that Americans need to phase out structures that “have any carbon emissions” by 2028 and said the same of cars, calling to halt emission-producing vehicles by 2030.

“We need to say by 2028, we’re not going to do any more buildings and houses that have any carbon emissions,” she declared. “By 2030, no more cars with carbon emissions, and by 2035 no more production of electricity that has carbon emissions”:

Warren unveiled her $3 trillion climate change plan – inspired by Gov. Jay Inslee (D) – in September. The plan touts the same goals she outlined in her Keene stump speech, calling for “zero-carbon pollution for all new commercial and residential buildings” by 2028, “zero emissions for all new light-duty passenger vehicles, medium-duty trucks, and all buses” by 2030, and “100% renewable and zero-emission energy in electricity generation, with an interim target of 100% carbon-neutral power” by 2030.

As Breitbart News’s Jerome Hudson detailed in his book 50 Things They Don’t Want You to Know, carbon emissions from energy usage in U.S. are the lowest since 1992. Additionally, the U.S. reduced its greenhouse gas output by 2.7 percent in 2017 – President Trump’s first year in office – according to a report from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released last fall."

Following a rally in Iowa, Warren was asked if she would ban the children of her vice president from serving on the boards of foreign companies — a reference to the scrutinized business dealings of Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, who was paid $83,000 a month while sitting on the board of a Ukrainian oil corporation at the time that his father was in the White House.

Despite her anti-corruption agenda, Warren initially said “No” she would not allow her vice president’s children to serve on the boards of foreign companies, but she quickly backtracked the answer, saying, “I don’t know.”

The full exchange, caught on video, can be read and watched below:

As Breitbart News’s Haris Alic has reported, questions about why Hunter Biden was appointed to serve on the board of Ukrainian oil company Burisma in April 2014 have plagued the former vice president’s 2020 Democrat presidential primary bid.

Alic’s reporting notes:

Adding to concerns is the fact that at the time Hunter Biden joined Burisma, the company was seen as actively courting western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month Hunter Biden was tapped for the group’s board, the government of Great Britain froze accounts belonging to Burisma founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukrainian minister of natural resources, would later be accused of corruption for using his office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control. [Emphasis added] Joe Biden’s role in the entire matter has only increased suspicions of conflicting interests. As the sitting vice president, Joe Biden led the Obama administration’s response to the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014. In that role, he pushed billions of dollars in aid to the Ukrainian government, some of which allegedly was filtered to Burisma. [Emphasis added]

Breitbart News’s Senior Contributor Peter Schweizer has detailed in his book, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, how Hunter Biden had no experience with the oil and gas industry or the nation of Ukraine before joining Burisma while his father was vice president.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) benefited financially from the existence of private prisons despite vowing to ban them on the grounds that they are “profiteering off cruelty,” a report from the Washington Free Beacon revealed.

Warren pledged in June to ban private immigration centers and private prisons, detailing the vow in a Medium post.

“There should be no place in America for profiting off putting more people behind bars or in detention,” Warren wrote:

We didn’t get here by chance. Washington works hand-in-hand with private prison companies, who spend millions on lobbyists, campaign contributions, and revolving-door hires — all to turn our criminal and immigration policies into ones that prioritize making them rich instead of keeping us safe.

“That’s why I will shut down the use of federal private detention facilities by ending all contracts that the Bureau of Prisons, ICE, and the U.S. Marshals Service have with private detention providers,” Warren continued, accusing private prisons of engaging in “exploitation, plain and simple.”

She even implicated the Trump administration, accusing it of luring in private prison companies, which “saw their chance to run the same playbook for our immigration system.”

Despite those pleas, Warren has benefited financially from the existence of private prisons.

According to the Free Beacon, Warren invested tens of thousands of dollars — $50,000 — in a Vanguard Group fund which “owned hundreds of millions of dollars worth of shares in leading private prison companies. While she sold her stakes in that fund in 2013, the Free Beacon noted that it was “the largest shareholder of America’s largest private prison corporation” at the time.

The Free Beacon reported:

Warren invested in Vanguard Target Retirement 2025—a retirement account run by the Vanguard Group, an investment management company—which in turn invested more than 30 percent of its money in Vanguard’s domestic stock index fund. Vanguard was the top shareholder of Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), and one of the largest of GEO Group, both private prison companies, according to data from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Vanguard owned more than 12 million CCA shares and nearly 9 million GEO Group shares, which were worth roughly $456 million and $216 million, respectively, in March 2013. CCA, now called CoreCivic, was already the country’s largest owner of private prisons in 2013, according to an annual report. The company owned or controlled more than 50 correctional or detention facilities in the country, “with a total design capacity of approximately 86,000 beds in 20 states and the District of Columbia.” GEO Group is also one of the largest private prison providers in the country with 66 prison facilities across the world as of 2013. The two companies also operate many Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facilities for illegal immigrants.

Warren’s investment in the fund stands in stark contrast with the presidential candidate’s accusatory remarks over the summer, in which she accused private prisons and the financial beneficiaries of “profiteering off cruelty.”"

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) told late-night host Stephen Colbert on Thursday that his Medicare for All proposal is far from free and Americans making over $29,000 will see their taxes raised to pay for it.

Sanders has been a vocal proponent of Medicare for All, which — by some estimates — could cost over $60 trillion over a decade. Colbert asked Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) last week if Medicare for All would result in higher taxes for middle class Americans, and he posed the same question to Sanders on Thursday.

“Senator Warren was on here last week and I asked her about her plans for Medicare for All, and I’m going to ask you the question that I asked her … at the risk of being accused of trumpeting Republican talking points,” Colbert said.

“Is there an increase in taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for All, or rather, where would the tax burden go to pay for that?” the CBS host asked.

Sanders initially issued a similar answer to Warren, who repeatedly talked about overall “costs” rather than increased taxation itself.

“Under my legislation — 15 co-sponsors I believe in the Senate now — nobody in America will pay any more premiums,” Sanders said. “No more co-payments, gone. No more out-of-pocket expenses, gone. Nobody will go bankrupt… because of medical bills, that is gone.”

“Nobody in America under my bill will pay more than $200 a year in total for their prescription drugs,” he continued.

However, the socialist senator admitted that health care is not “free.”

“Now having said that, is health care free? No, it is not. So what we do is exempt the first $29,000 of a person’s income. You make less than $29,000, you pay nothing in taxes,” Sanders explained, essentially admitting that taxes will go up on middle class families from there.

“Above that, in a progressive way with the wealthiest people paying the largest percentage, people do pay more in taxes,” Sanders said. “But if I say to you, that right now you’re paying $20,000 a year in a tax called a premium for insurance companies. That’s gone.”

Sanders’ admission stands in stark contrast to Warren, who refused to explicitly state that Medicare for All will result in increased taxes for the middle class.

“Will their taxes go up?” Colbert asked after Warren refused to answer the question directly.

“I’ve listened to these answers a few times before, and I just want to make a parallel suggestion to you that you might defend the taxes perhaps that you’re not mentioning in your sentence,” he said.

“Isn’t Medicare for All like public school? There might be taxes for it, but you certainly save a lot of money sending your kids to school and do you want to live in a world where your kids aren’t educated? Do you want to live in a world where your fellow citizens are dying, even if it costs a little bit of money?” he asked.

“So, I accept your point and I believe in your point. Health care is a basic human right. We fight for basic human rights, and that’s Medicare for All. Everyone gets covered,” Warren responded, still refusing to say if she would raise taxes on the middle class to implement Medicare for All."

The House Intelligence Committee released the complaint on Thursday, which detailed accusations from an anonymous “whistleblower” who did not have firsthand knowledge of the conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The alleged “whistleblower” contends that Trump was “using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.”

However, as the transcripts of the conversation, which were released Wednesday, showed, Trump’s explicit use of the word “favor” was used in reference to Crowdstrike and the questions surrounding election meddling and hacking efforts. Biden and his son were not mentioned until later in the conversation. The transcripts show no quid pro quo or “pressure,” and the Ukrainian president confirmed such.

Nonetheless, Democrats – particularly 2020 Democrat candidates – are claiming that the “whistleblower” complaint is “explosive” in nature and contend that it proves Trump committed “crimes” in the White House.

Joe Biden (D), whose alleged corrupt practices remain at the center of the controversy, proclaimed that Trump “believes he is above the law” and attempted to convince Americans across the board that the Democrats’ latest investigation and impeachment effort is not a partisan issue:

We have a President who believes there is no limit to his power, who believes he can do anything and get away with it, and who believes he is above the law. This isn’t a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. This is a national issue. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 26, 2019

“The whistleblower complaint is explosive,” Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) wrote. “It paints a sobering picture of a president abusing his power for his own political gain against US national security interests.”

“Americans deserve to know the truth—that’s why an impeachment inquiry is so critical & our moral obligation,” he added:

Cory Booker (D-NJ) are losing to some guy named Andrew Yang.

The four most recent national polls show Yang beating Booker in every single one. These same polls show Yang tied with O’Rourke in three, but shellacking him in a fourth.

The Economist has Yang at two points, Paddy with two points, and Booker with — LOL — zero.

Emerson has Yang at eight(!) points, Paddy with one point, and Booker with two.

Quinnipiac has Yang at two points, Paddy with two points, and Booker with — LOL — zero.

Morning Consult has all three sitting at three points.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Julian Castro, a former HUD secretary under President Obama, are polling even worse than Paddy and Booker.

The most interesting bit of polling news, though, is the total collapse of Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who is only polling a little better than Yang. But in the Emerson poll, which is only a few days old, he beats her eight points to four points.

In just ten weeks, Harris has dived from having 15 points of average national support from Democrat primary voters to just 4.9 percent, which is where she sits today, according to the Real Clear Politics poll of polls.

The Real Clear Politics poll of polls has Yang at 3.3 percent, which puts him ahead of O’Rourke at 2.4 percent, Booker at 1.7 percent, Klobuchar at 1.6 percent, and Castro at 1.3 percent.

Right now, the race for a 2020 Democrat presidential nomination is a three-way race… period. And it’s not even close.

In that poll of polls, former Vice President Joe Biden leads with 28 percent, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VA) with 22 and 17 percent, respectively.

The only positive thing you can say about Mean Little Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s poll position is that he’s at the top of the bottom tier with 5.9 percent support, which only puts him a little ahead of Yang’s 3.3 percent. But…

In that Emerson poll, Buttigieg is behind Yang — eight to six.

The 44-year-old Yang has no political experience. He’s a private sector success, an entrepreneur, lawyer, and CEO. His big idea is to take away everyone’s private health insurance by forcing us into a government-run Medicare For All. He wants to confiscate guns and give everyone $1,000 every month as a guaranteed income, for some crazy reason.

In other words, he’s a crank.

But so are all the others.

The difference is that Yang has some charisma and a sense of humor. Unlike Booker and Paddy and Klobuchar and Castro and the Mean Little Mayor, Yang is likable and self-deprecating. And that is all it takes to beat a bunch of left-wing stiffs these days.

Follow her on Twitter: @FromaHarrop . The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers; view more opinion articles at CNN.

(CNN) Democrats might ask themselves why President Donald Trump is so intent on smearing former Vice President Joe Biden with phony scandals. Why isn't he doing the same to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who's been climbing in the polls and has a shot at becoming the Democratic nominee for president?

The clear answer is that Biden, in his own words, could ""beat him like a drum"" -- and while Warren could win against Trump, her victory does not look like a resounding one, according to recent polls . In Trump's view, Biden poses the greatest threat and must be destroyed. And what better way than to wound Biden to the point that Democrats might think he's more trouble than he's worth?

Warren fans will point to national polls showing their candidate defeating Trump in a general election. But it's important to note that Warren has been largely spared from Trump's attacks thus far, and those polls don't take into account the campaign of calumny that would surely follow a Warren nomination. It's Biden that Trump clearly most fears.

It would not surprise me if foreign propagandists decided to take to social media to advance Warren's candidacy and hurt Biden's. This happened in 2016, when Russian trolls tried to turn fans of Bernie Sanders against Hillary Clinton. Many supporters took the bait and either voted for third party candidates or sat out the election.

Though polls suggest that Warren could defeat Trump by a few points, Biden still holds a more comfortable margin over the President. Let's not forget that poll numbers don't necessarily translate to an Electoral College victory. In 2016, Clinton lost the election even though she bested Trump by nearly 2.9 million votes nationally.

Biden is still a stronger bet against Trump in crucial swing states like Wisconsin and Ohio, compared to Warren. The most recent Wisconsin poll pitting Democrats against Trump has Biden winning by 9 points, while Elizabeth Warren is tied with the President. In Ohio, Biden is the only Democrat who can beat Trump. According to the most recent Quinnipiac poll from July, Biden leads Trump by 8 points, while Sanders and Warren both trail the President by 1.

President Trump has claimed Biden called for Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor who was ""investigating his son."" But there is no evidence Hunter Biden was under investigation. The probe was into the business dealings of the owner of a Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden sat on the board of directors.

How should Democrats handle Trump's hatchet job on Biden's integrity? For starters, they should not get sucked into arguments over Biden's guilt or innocence. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden, and Ukraine's current prosecutor general also came out in defense of the two. And making the case that the Trump children are profiting from their proximity to their father establishes a false equivalence that turns a flat-out lie into a ""what about the other side?"" discussion.

Meanwhile, other polls underscore weaknesses in the Warren campaign. For one thing, Warren seems to have a likeability problem, even in politically friendly states. A CNN/UNH Survey Center poll from July asked likely New Hampshire voters which Democrat they found most likeable. Biden and Sanders topped the list at 20% each, while only 4% chose Warren.

Then there are the policies. Warren endorses a Medicare for All health plan that would do away with private coverage, even though a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows only 41% of registered voters supporting a system that eliminates private health coverage.

Biden's support for a government-run option in Obamacare is much closer to the public's preference. The poll found that 67% want an option to buy health coverage through a Medicare program, while keeping the possibility of private insurance.

Warren's call for decriminalizing illegal border crossings is also widely unpopular. She might be able to finesse that position in a general election campaign, but her views on immigration generally have ventured dangerously close to open borders.

Democrats might ultimately choose someone other than Biden as their presidential nominee. But it should be their decision and not a scared response to Trump's manipulation of the truth. There is a good reason he's so intent on crushing Biden."

173,"Analysis by Harry Enten, CNN",,A new Quinnipiac University poll out this week finds Sen. Elizabeth Warren with a 74% favorable rating and a 10% unfavorable rating among potential Democratic primary voters.,2019-09-28,CNN,Analysis: Warren's rising popularity has been limited to Democrats,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/28/politics/elizabeth-warren-democrats-popularity/index.html,"(CNN) First things first: The theme song of the week is Mork & Mindy closing credits .

A new Quinnipiac University poll out this week finds Sen. Elizabeth Warren with a 74% favorable rating and a 10% unfavorable rating among potential Democratic primary voters. Her favorable rating is up significantly from 61% in May , while her unfavorable rating is down from 16%.

This poll is one of many that suggests Warren's favorable rating has climbed since the beginning of the year.

Warren seems to have the hot hand in the Democratic presidential primary. She's challenging former Vice President Joe Biden for the lead in Iowa, New Hampshire and nationally. These numbers show that at least part of her rise is because she's become more popular.

However, her growing popularity does not seem to be extending to outside the Democratic base.

Quinnipiac was kind enough to provide me with a crosstab of how non-potential Democratic voters (i.e. those who are not Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents) feel about Warren.

This month, she comes in with an 11% favorable rating and a 70% unfavorable rating among this group. That shouldn't be too surprising, given that, while some of this group are independents who don't lean toward either party, much of it is made up of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. We simply should expect Warren (or any Democrat) to struggle with this group.

What's interesting is the trendline. Back in Quinnipiac's May poll, Warren's favorable rating with non-potential Democratic primary voters was 8%, compared to an unfavorable rating of 66%. A CNN poll a month later put Warren with an 11% favorable and 66% unfavorable rating with this group.

Put another way, Warren has not really seen any improvement with non-potential Democratic primary voters over the summer, even as she has dramatically improved with Democrats.

Now compare Warren's numbers with that of her chief Democratic rival, Biden. He's become considerably less popular with Democrats. His favorable rating with potential Democratic primary voters from May to now has gone from 79% to 72% and his unfavorable has gone from 14% to 19%.

Among non-potential Democratic voters, the fall off has not been as dramatic. Biden's favorable rating remains steady at 22%. His unfavorable rating is up from 63% in May to 70% now.

Biden maintains a clear edge in net favorability (favorable - unfavorable) rating of -48 points versus -59 points for Warren among non-potential Democratic primary voters.

Biden's advantage here may explain why he does better in polls against Republican President Doanld Trump than Warren. A recent Fox News poll , for instance, had both Biden and Warren beating Trump -- but Biden more than doubled Warren's margin over the President (14 points vs. 6 points). He did so, in large part, because he did significantly better than Warren among non-Democratic primary voters.

Of course, we'll have to see how this week's impeachment news may shift these numbers. Biden's numbers could slink southward as Republicans attack him.

But for now, Biden's maintaining his electability edge over Warren."

UKRAINE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT IS PUBLIC! It is ALL rumor, gossip, hearsay. NO PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OR EVIDENCE OF ANYTHING! I recommend reading it. In the alternative, a picture is worth a thousand words, so here is a picture that fully describes the whistleblower & his report. Mo pic.twitter.com/OYHmoRpUgv — Mo Brooks (@RepMoBrooks) September 26, 2019

During an appearance on Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN during an appearance in Washington, D.C. on Thursday at the Federation for American Immigration Reform’s (FAIR) Hold Their Feet to the Fire annual radio event, Brooks elaborated on his feelings about the allegations, which he said could be tied to 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) supporters.

“Elizabeth Warren in my judgment is just about guaranteed to be the Democrat nominee for president, OK?” Brooks said. “And there’s probably a number of people who support Elizabeth Warren that in part were either behind the disclosure of this information or are currently promoting it today in order to enhance Elizabeth Warren’s stature vis-à-vis, Joe Biden.”

According to the Alabama Republican, Warren meets the requirements of the modern Democratic Party in both identity and ideology.

“Let’s look at who Joe Biden is, OK?” he continued. “He is a white male who is a liberal. In today’s Democratic Party, that doesn’t cut it. On a sexist level, the Democratic Party basically says we want women, not men. And Joe Biden is a man. So that doesn’t fit that identity politics item that the Democrat Party fosters on the American people. Additionally, Joe Biden is a mere liberal. The Democrats of today insist on pure socialist.”

“And to Elizabeth Warren’s credit, the third principle argument that they use is based on race,” Brooks added. “They are opposed generally to the election or nomination of Caucasians. And to Elizabeth Warren’s credit, she’s claimed that she’s a Native American.”

Those criteria, according to Brooks are who Democrat voters want representing their party on the ballot.

“Those are their three themes, and those are the three themes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used to beat a 20-year white male liberal incumbent congressman in New York.”

Warren, the Massachusetts senator and a frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic nomination, has been a frequent critic of corporate malfeasance.

In a letter sent to Securities and Exchange Commission chair Jay Clayton on Thursday, Warren said that even though reforms were put into place after the 2008 financial crisis to increase oversight of the ratings agencies, ""the SEC and other federal agencies have neglected or delayed implementation of many of the changes.""

She said a big problem is that companies pay Moody's and S&P to rate their bonds.

""Under the issuer-pays model, bond issuers - like large financial institutions - pay the agencies for their assessments of the products they hope to sell, ultimately giving the rating firms an incentive to give better ratings, regardless of the risk, since bond issuers might otherwise go to their competitors,"" Warren wrote.

""Right now, I'd like to just see us do the Ukraine issue because it is so clear and it is such a clear violation of law,"" the Massachusetts Democrat said in an interview in her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the day after the release of a stunning whistleblower complaint about Trump and his conduct.

""The President is asking for help against one of his political rivals and asking a foreign government for a thing of value for himself personally. That's against the law,"" she continued.

Warren's comments come as Democrats debate how broadly to draft articles of impeachment against the President. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Democrats in a private meeting on Wednesday that she wants to focus on Trump's conversations with Ukraine, according to several sources involved in the discussions. A resolution that is more broad could make it more complicated to get the necessary votes on the House floor, according to multiple Democratic sources.

But some Democrats who backed impeachment earlier on said they want the focus of the inquiry to include findings of potential obstruction of justice, saying Trump shouldn't be let off the hook for allegedly trying to thwart former special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe . Others say the inquiry should address Trump's involvement in alleged hush-money payments to prevent stories of his alleged affairs from coming out before the 2016 election.

The whistleblower complaint detailed various ways in which the whistleblower believed Trump sought to ""solicit interference"" from Ukraine ahead of the 2020 election, including by encouraging Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig into Hunter Biden's past. It also laid out an alleged pattern of efforts by the White House to cover up those attempts.

The White House released a transcript of a call between Trump and Zelensky, showing Trump repeatedly pushing his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Biden and his son. The transcript has drawn further scrutiny because it had been moved to a highly secure server. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.

""They didn't leave that transcript in the regular course of transcripts of phone calls with foreign leaders. Why? Because it wasn't a regular call,"" Warren said. ""It was a call that violated the law. And so their immediate instinct is: Let's block it out. Let's make sure nobody can see it. Let's cover it up.""

On whether she believes any Senate Republicans would vote to convict Trump, Warren answered: ""I don't know.""

""I think everyone in Congress should be called on to vote,"" she added. ""Everyone who took an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States and then they should have to live with that vote forever.""

Warren, who has risen in recent polls and is running neck-and-neck with Joe Biden, said she hoped the impeachment process could be wrapped up before voting in the Democratic primary begins in February. She has called on the House to begin impeachment proceedings since April after the release of Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Asked whether Hunter Biden's business dealings should be off limits in the 2020 campaign, Warren pivoted back to Trump.

""I believe that this issue is about Donald Trump and that's where we need to keep our focus,"" she said. ""He is the President of the United States and he has solicited a foreign government interfering in our 2020 election. That is a threat to democracy and it is a threat to our Constitution. That's where we need to focus.""

Warren also told CNN on Friday that she worries for the safety of the whistleblower, whose identity remains unknown to the public. She said Trump and his administration are ""doing their best to try to cover this up and discredit anyone who's trying to get to the truth.""

Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire on Thursday testified before the House Intelligence Committee about the complaint and defended the whistleblower, saying the whistleblower ""did the right thing.""

The former CIA officer said that if the “whistleblower” is being used in an effort to try and remove President Trump, the individual should be forced to testify before Congress.

“You better stand up and do it publicly,” said Wright. He also criticized House Democrats for moving forward without gathering all of the facts.

“This isn’t about trying to get facts. We’ve already decided, as a partisan Democratic Party. I’m sorry to say, we’ve already decided we have to get rid of the president. We’re moving forward with it, irrespective of facts. That is clear.”

On Friday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) claimed, without evidence, that Russia was involved in the phone conversation in July between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

“I think Russia has a hand in this, by the way,” Pelosi said during an interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe.

She continued:

We saw what the Russian disruption of our election last time, their interference, 100% confidence of the intelligence community, high confidence in the intelligence community, that the Russians disrupted our election. That was wrong. The integrity of our elections is central to our democracy. So what the president did in inviting outside intervention into our election, it goes beyond the pale.

On Saturday, President Trump criticized Democrats on Twitter for focusing all of their efforts on impeachment:

On September 21, Breitbart News reported that Congressional Republicans defended President Trump against the Democrats and the accusations made by the “whistleblower.”

“It’s not like we haven’t seen this movie before,” said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH).

“Democrats come out, they’re all spun up, Adam Schiff makes all kinds of statements, and then when the facts come out — Whoa, different story! This seems to be the same kind of deal,” he concluded.

However, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said Friday that she hopes the impeachment inquiry will be completed before 2020 primary voting begins in February.

“Do you think it’s important that all of this be wrapped up before voting begins in February?” CNN’s political correspondent, MJ Lee, asked Warren on Friday’s broadcast of OutFront.

""We ask that you to immediately reverse course and heed the recommendation of top US military officials and faith leaders to open our doors to eligible refugees from all corners of the world,"" the letter reads. ""A generous US refugee policy spares tens of thousands from terrible fates.""

The letter, led by Sens. Jeff Merkley and Ed Markey, comes on the heels of the State Department's report to Congress that proposed a refugee cap -- which dictates how many refugees may be admitted to the US -- to 18,000 for fiscal year 2020, which begins next week.

Under Trump, the administration has slowly chipped away at the refugee cap. The ceiling for fiscal year 2019 stands at 30,000, which, at the time, was the lowest level since 1980.

The State Department announced the proposed refugee ceiling Thursday as part of a larger number of combined refugee and asylum claims expected for the next fiscal year.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

The possible super PAC is far from operational, but Larry Rasky, a former Biden aide, has led the effort to stand up an outside group that he believes would help the former vice president rebut attacks that could impact Biden's standing in the crowded and contentious Democratic primary. While Biden is still seen as a front-runner in the race, recent polling has shown his once-large lead slipping as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren rises in the field

""For me, this week puts everything into stark relief,"" Rasky said. He added that he has begun to think ""the campaign was being a little naïve about the resources we'd need to fight this.""

""The campaign is fighting a war on two fronts -- the primary and the general election -- at the same time. They certainly need all the support they can get.""

News of the super PAC, which was first reported by The New York Times , was not welcome inside Biden's campaign. Biden's team, from the outset of his presidential bid, has said they would disavow any outside spending on the former vice president's behalf. This case is no different. TJ Ducklo, a spokesman for Biden, reiterated Friday that the campaign would reject any help from outside super PACs.

""The attacks aimed at this campaign from dark money groups helping Donald Trump spread his outlandish lies and slander have only served as a reminder of the urgent need for campaign finance reform,"" Ducklo said. ""Which is exactly why since the beginning of this campaign, Biden for President has not and will not welcome the help of super PACs. That goes for those that purport to help him, despite his explicit condemnation of their existence.""

A source familiar with the internal Biden campaign strategy, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the outside effort, put a finer point on it.

""The campaign had its best week of fundraising since the second week after launching, and it would be impossible to miss from anywhere on earth that Donald Trump is panicked about Joe Biden,"" the source said. ""The campaign doesn't need or want this effort, and anyone engaging in it doesn't have its best interests at heart.""

Rasky said he expected that his prospective effort would be disavowed by the campaign, but he and others still believe the outside group is needed to rebut attacks leveled by Trump and other Republicans.

""We are dead serious about the need to do it,"" Rasky said. ""But we are also mindful of the campaign's position and the Vice President's expressed desire not to have one. That is a lot for us to ponder.""

Biden's campaign is not the first to have a super PAC considering spending on its behalf. A super PAC ran ads in support of Washington Gov. Jay Inslee during his now-ended presidential bid. And top Democratic donors considered launching a super PAC to help New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker earlier this year. Booker did not back the effort.

A source close to the possible super PAC said that while its focus would be to respond to attacks from Trump and other Republicans, they would not rule out responding to Democratic attacks on Biden.

""That's not what it is for,"" the source said, ""but if Biden is attacked, we need to defend him."""

Warren was far from the only Democrat to declare support for Kavanaugh’s accuser on Friday.

“A year ago, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford told her story. Senators didn’t listen, but the Americans people did,” former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D) wrote.

“Like Anita Hill before her, the impact of her testimony will inspire and encourage women to continue to have the courage to speak out,” he added, calling her a “hero”:

“One year ago today, we saw what true courage looked like as Dr. Christine Blasey Ford stepped forward and testified before the Senate,” Mayor Bill de Blasio (D), who recently dropped out of the Democrat presidential primary race, tweeted.

Ford’s accusatory testimony – in which she accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her at a college party more than 30 years ago – was fraught with contradictions. Ford claimed that her friend, Leland Keyser, was at the party where the alleged assault took place. However, Keyser has been quoted denying any recollection of the alleged event.

“I don’t have any confidence in the story. Those facts together I don’t recollect, and it just didn’t make any sense,” she said, according to the New York Times’ Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly’s book The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation.

“It would be impossible for me to be the only girl at a get-together with three guys, have her leave, and then not figure out how she’s getting home,” Keyser said. “I just really didn’t have confidence in the story.”

Even Ford’s father reportedly supported Kavanaugh’s confirmation, despite his daughter’s unfounded claims.

Despite the pending questions, Ford has remained a heroic political figure for many on the left. She made Time Magazine’s annual “100 Most Influential People” list, which featured a profile written by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who praised Ford’s “sacrifice.”

“Her story, spoken while holding back tears, shook Washington and the country. Her courage, in the face of those who wished to silence her, galvanized Americans,” Harris wrote.

“And her unfathomable sacrifice, out of a sense of civic duty, shined a spotlight on the way we treat survivors of sexual violence,” she continued.

Harris praised Ford again on Friday in an op-ed published by Elle, calling for an impeachment inquiry into Kavanaugh.

“After allegations of sexual assault surfaced during Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings, I saw up close that the hearings and FBI investigation were not a serious pursuit of truth or justice,” she continued.

“We need to get to the truth about Kavanaugh. And I believe the best path to truth and accountability is through a formal impeachment process,” she added."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Thursday refused to say if Medicare for All will result in higher taxes for middle class families, dodging the question and instead claiming people care more about overall “costs.”

Warren spoke to NBC News’ Ali Vitali, who asked the Massachusetts senator if Medicare for All will result in higher taxes for middle class families– a question Warren has faced several times before on both the debate stage and campaign trail. Once again, Warren did not answer the question, instead claiming that families care more about overall “costs”:

“So one of the things that a few of your opponents were talking about late last week really was this idea of middle class taxes in healthcare. So yes or no– should middle class Americans expect their taxes to go up under a Medicare for All system?” Vitali asked.

“You may remember that I’ve spent a big chunk of my life studying why middle class families go broke, and one of the number one reasons is health care,” Warren said, repeating one of her routine talking points.

“The problem is its total cost for these families, so it’s what you pay in premiums. It’s also what you paying co-pays to see a doctor, or sorry that doctor is out of network so you’ve got to pay for the whole thing,” she explained.

Because of that, Warren suggested that Americans need to change the way they view the system:

People keep reaching into their pockets and reaching into their pockets even when they have health insurance, so how we have to think about this system is yes we should expect that for giant corporations and very wealthy individuals, costs will go up, but for middle class families – for hardworking people – the costs are going to go down.

“But that’s not the same as taxes not going up,” Vitali pointed out.

Warren did not dismiss Vitali’s assertion but argued that families care more about overall “costs,” regardless of increased taxes.

“What matters to families is costs,” Warren said.

Warren faced the same question during the Democrat debate in Houston, Texas, and repeated the same lines about total “cost.”

“What we’re talking about here is what’s going to happen in families’ pockets, what’s going to happen in their budgets, and the answer is, on Medicare for All, costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals and costs are going to go up for giant corporations,” she said.

“But for hardworking families across this country costs are going to go down, and that’s how it should work under Medicare for All,” she added, refusing to ultimately say if middle class taxes would go up, regardless of overall “costs.”

Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) went after Warren for repeatedly refusing to answer the question.

“Senator Warren is known for being straightforward, and was extremely evasive when asked that question, and we’ve seen that repeatedly,” he told CNN’s The Lead last week.

“I think that if you are proud of your plan and it’s the right plan, you should defend it in straightforward terms,” he continued.

“And I think it’s puzzling that when everybody knows the answer to that question, of whether her plan and Senator Sanders’ plan will raise middle-class taxes is yes, why you wouldn’t just say so and then explain why you think that’s the better way forward,” he added."

“I wanted to give you call just to say thank you. I’m glad we’re going to be in this fight together side by side. I love the endorsement and for all the right reasons,” Warren said.

“Thank you so much. Well you know I have to tell you,” he began, telling Warren when he began to realize that she was the candidate for him.

“It was at the last debates and I was like ‘this health insurance industry is a f*cking racket,” he said.

“It felt right,” Warren said as she pounded her chest.

“That’s why we’ve got to do it. Because it is right. Health care is a basic human right, and we fight for basic human rights. Not just for some of us. For all of us,” Warren said.

“I’m so excited to be shoulder to shoulder with you too. I can’t believe you called,” Van Ness gushed. “Let me know how I can be of service. I really want to help.”

“Yep. Were going to do it together,” Warren said to an awkward pause and filling in the silence by telling him to “be strong.”

“Go save America,” Van Ness said, before pivoting the conversation and telling Warren that they must get rid of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) because “he’s the worst.”

“Like we also really got to get that Mitch out of there because regardless of what – I mean Mitch McConnell, he’s the worst,” he said.

“We got to take the Senate. We’re going to take Congress back,” he continued, quickly correcting himself, as Democrats already possess a House majority.

“Well we already have Congress,” he said, adding, “and then we got to get you in the White House, and we’re just going to sort everything out.”

“So you go Save America, I’m going to keep doing these interviews, and I can’t believe you took the time to talk to me and I’ll talk to you soon,” he added.

“Ok, talk to you soon. Be strong out there,” Warren said.

“Thank you, I will. You too,” he added with an enthusiastic “Ah!”

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) told supporters during a campaign stop in Keene, New Hampshire, on Wednesday that Americans should phase out new homes, buildings, and vehicles that produce carbon emissions over the next 16 years.

Warren said that Americans need to phase out structures that “have any carbon emissions” by 2028 and said the same of cars, calling to halt emission-producing vehicles by 2030.

“We need to say by 2028, we’re not going to do any more buildings and houses that have any carbon emissions,” she declared. “By 2030, no more cars with carbon emissions, and by 2035 no more production of electricity that has carbon emissions”:

Warren unveiled her $3 trillion climate change plan – inspired by Gov. Jay Inslee (D) – in September. The plan touts the same goals she outlined in her Keene stump speech, calling for “zero-carbon pollution for all new commercial and residential buildings” by 2028, “zero emissions for all new light-duty passenger vehicles, medium-duty trucks, and all buses” by 2030, and “100% renewable and zero-emission energy in electricity generation, with an interim target of 100% carbon-neutral power” by 2030.

As Breitbart News’s Jerome Hudson detailed in his book 50 Things They Don’t Want You to Know, carbon emissions from energy usage in U.S. are the lowest since 1992. Additionally, the U.S. reduced its greenhouse gas output by 2.7 percent in 2017 – President Trump’s first year in office – according to a report from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released last fall."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) benefited financially from the existence of private prisons despite vowing to ban them on the grounds that they are “profiteering off cruelty,” a report from the Washington Free Beacon revealed.

Warren pledged in June to ban private immigration centers and private prisons, detailing the vow in a Medium post.

“There should be no place in America for profiting off putting more people behind bars or in detention,” Warren wrote:

We didn’t get here by chance. Washington works hand-in-hand with private prison companies, who spend millions on lobbyists, campaign contributions, and revolving-door hires — all to turn our criminal and immigration policies into ones that prioritize making them rich instead of keeping us safe.

“That’s why I will shut down the use of federal private detention facilities by ending all contracts that the Bureau of Prisons, ICE, and the U.S. Marshals Service have with private detention providers,” Warren continued, accusing private prisons of engaging in “exploitation, plain and simple.”

She even implicated the Trump administration, accusing it of luring in private prison companies, which “saw their chance to run the same playbook for our immigration system.”

Despite those pleas, Warren has benefited financially from the existence of private prisons.

According to the Free Beacon, Warren invested tens of thousands of dollars — $50,000 — in a Vanguard Group fund which “owned hundreds of millions of dollars worth of shares in leading private prison companies. While she sold her stakes in that fund in 2013, the Free Beacon noted that it was “the largest shareholder of America’s largest private prison corporation” at the time.

The Free Beacon reported:

Warren invested in Vanguard Target Retirement 2025—a retirement account run by the Vanguard Group, an investment management company—which in turn invested more than 30 percent of its money in Vanguard’s domestic stock index fund. Vanguard was the top shareholder of Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), and one of the largest of GEO Group, both private prison companies, according to data from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Vanguard owned more than 12 million CCA shares and nearly 9 million GEO Group shares, which were worth roughly $456 million and $216 million, respectively, in March 2013. CCA, now called CoreCivic, was already the country’s largest owner of private prisons in 2013, according to an annual report. The company owned or controlled more than 50 correctional or detention facilities in the country, “with a total design capacity of approximately 86,000 beds in 20 states and the District of Columbia.” GEO Group is also one of the largest private prison providers in the country with 66 prison facilities across the world as of 2013. The two companies also operate many Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facilities for illegal immigrants.

Warren’s investment in the fund stands in stark contrast with the presidential candidate’s accusatory remarks over the summer, in which she accused private prisons and the financial beneficiaries of “profiteering off cruelty.”"

During an appearance on Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN during an appearance in Washington, D.C. at the Federation for American Immigration Reform’s (FAIR) Hold Their Feet to the Fire annual radio event, Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-AL) discussed the possible motivations of the renewed push against Trump as it pertained to Ukraine.

“I think they’re trying to make the president look bad,” Aderholt said. “That’s one aspect of it – but also trying to appease their Democrat base on the other side. Now what is going to be interesting, I think, is see what in the next few days and next couple of weeks what we see this does to Biden because Biden is all wrapped up in this whole thing and his son Hunter. So, I don’t know how that’s going to have an impact.”

The Alabama Republican lawmaker said given the Biden son’s involvement in the saga, Biden could be eliminated from contention for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

“I think quite honestly Biden is out of the picture,” he continued. “I’ve said for quite some time now that I don’t think he will be the nominee. And I think with this recent thing he has implicated with his son that I think this assures he will not be the nominee.”

Aderholt went on to add that among his House colleagues, there is a consensus Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) will be the nominee.

“Certainly, those on the left side of the party – they don’t like Trump obviously,” he added. “But they don’t really like Biden either. So, I think Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren – that’s who they would gravitate toward. I talk to a lot of my colleagues. I casually just ask the question about how they see this playing out. It seems like the consensus is that Elizabeth Warren is going to be the nominee.”

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) told late-night host Stephen Colbert on Thursday that his Medicare for All proposal is far from free and Americans making over $29,000 will see their taxes raised to pay for it.

Sanders has been a vocal proponent of Medicare for All, which — by some estimates — could cost over $60 trillion over a decade. Colbert asked Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) last week if Medicare for All would result in higher taxes for middle class Americans, and he posed the same question to Sanders on Thursday.

“Senator Warren was on here last week and I asked her about her plans for Medicare for All, and I’m going to ask you the question that I asked her … at the risk of being accused of trumpeting Republican talking points,” Colbert said.

“Is there an increase in taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for All, or rather, where would the tax burden go to pay for that?” the CBS host asked.

Sanders initially issued a similar answer to Warren, who repeatedly talked about overall “costs” rather than increased taxation itself.

“Under my legislation — 15 co-sponsors I believe in the Senate now — nobody in America will pay any more premiums,” Sanders said. “No more co-payments, gone. No more out-of-pocket expenses, gone. Nobody will go bankrupt… because of medical bills, that is gone.”

“Nobody in America under my bill will pay more than $200 a year in total for their prescription drugs,” he continued.

However, the socialist senator admitted that health care is not “free.”

“Now having said that, is health care free? No, it is not. So what we do is exempt the first $29,000 of a person’s income. You make less than $29,000, you pay nothing in taxes,” Sanders explained, essentially admitting that taxes will go up on middle class families from there.

“Above that, in a progressive way with the wealthiest people paying the largest percentage, people do pay more in taxes,” Sanders said. “But if I say to you, that right now you’re paying $20,000 a year in a tax called a premium for insurance companies. That’s gone.”

Sanders’ admission stands in stark contrast to Warren, who refused to explicitly state that Medicare for All will result in increased taxes for the middle class.

“Will their taxes go up?” Colbert asked after Warren refused to answer the question directly.

“I’ve listened to these answers a few times before, and I just want to make a parallel suggestion to you that you might defend the taxes perhaps that you’re not mentioning in your sentence,” he said.

“Isn’t Medicare for All like public school? There might be taxes for it, but you certainly save a lot of money sending your kids to school and do you want to live in a world where your kids aren’t educated? Do you want to live in a world where your fellow citizens are dying, even if it costs a little bit of money?” he asked.

“So, I accept your point and I believe in your point. Health care is a basic human right. We fight for basic human rights, and that’s Medicare for All. Everyone gets covered,” Warren responded, still refusing to say if she would raise taxes on the middle class to implement Medicare for All."

“We are here today because the Republicans in the House are paralyzed with hatred of President Clinton, and until the Republicans free themselves of hatred our country will suffer,” Pelosi said in the clip.

“They are driven by hatred,” Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) declared. “They hate Bill and Hillary Clinton so much, they will stop at nothing to bring him down.”

“Impeachment of a president is an undoing of a national election, and one of the reasons we all feel so angry about what they are doing is that they are ripping from us, they are ripping us under our votes,” Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) said. “They are telling us that our votes don’t count.”

The flashback even features Joe Biden (D), who warned Congress to be careful and make “darn sure” that they are impeaching based on “principle not politics.”

Their remarks stand in stark contrast to their recent remarks.

Pelosi announced the formal impeachment inquiry against President Trump on Wednesday.

“Shout out to all of the millennials for staying woke and supporting me all this time I’ve been warning Congress about Trump and why we needed to impeach him,” Waters wrote. “Remember what I’ve always said: If you fight, you can win!”:

(CNN) Democrats might ask themselves why President Donald Trump is so intent on smearing former Vice President Joe Biden with phony scandals. Why isn't he doing the same to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who's been climbing in the polls and has a shot at becoming the Democratic nominee for president?

The clear answer is that Biden, in his own words, could ""beat him like a drum"" -- and while Warren could win against Trump, her victory does not look like a resounding one, according to recent polls . In Trump's view, Biden poses the greatest threat and must be destroyed. And what better way than to wound Biden to the point that Democrats might think he's more trouble than he's worth?

Warren fans will point to national polls showing their candidate defeating Trump in a general election. But it's important to note that Warren has been largely spared from Trump's attacks thus far, and those polls don't take into account the campaign of calumny that would surely follow a Warren nomination. It's Biden that Trump clearly most fears.

It would not surprise me if foreign propagandists decided to take to social media to advance Warren's candidacy and hurt Biden's. This happened in 2016, when Russian trolls tried to turn fans of Bernie Sanders against Hillary Clinton. Many supporters took the bait and either voted for third party candidates or sat out the election.

Though polls suggest that Warren could defeat Trump by a few points, Biden still holds a more comfortable margin over the President. Let's not forget that poll numbers don't necessarily translate to an Electoral College victory. In 2016, Clinton lost the election even though she bested Trump by nearly 2.9 million votes nationally.

Biden is still a stronger bet against Trump in crucial swing states like Wisconsin and Ohio, compared to Warren. The most recent Wisconsin poll pitting Democrats against Trump has Biden winning by 9 points, while Elizabeth Warren is tied with the President. In Ohio, Biden is the only Democrat who can beat Trump. According to the most recent Quinnipiac poll from July, Biden leads Trump by 8 points, while Sanders and Warren both trail the President by 1.

President Trump has claimed Biden called for Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor who was ""investigating his son."" But there is no evidence Hunter Biden was under investigation. The probe was into the business dealings of the owner of a Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden sat on the board of directors.

How should Democrats handle Trump's hatchet job on Biden's integrity? For starters, they should not get sucked into arguments over Biden's guilt or innocence. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden, and Ukraine's current prosecutor general also came out in defense of the two. And making the case that the Trump children are profiting from their proximity to their father establishes a false equivalence that turns a flat-out lie into a ""what about the other side?"" discussion.

Meanwhile, other polls underscore weaknesses in the Warren campaign. For one thing, Warren seems to have a likeability problem, even in politically friendly states. A CNN/UNH Survey Center poll from July asked likely New Hampshire voters which Democrat they found most likeable. Biden and Sanders topped the list at 20% each, while only 4% chose Warren.

Then there are the policies. Warren endorses a Medicare for All health plan that would do away with private coverage, even though a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows only 41% of registered voters supporting a system that eliminates private health coverage.

Biden's support for a government-run option in Obamacare is much closer to the public's preference. The poll found that 67% want an option to buy health coverage through a Medicare program, while keeping the possibility of private insurance.

Warren's call for decriminalizing illegal border crossings is also widely unpopular. She might be able to finesse that position in a general election campaign, but her views on immigration generally have ventured dangerously close to open borders.

Democrats might ultimately choose someone other than Biden as their presidential nominee. But it should be their decision and not a scared response to Trump's manipulation of the truth. There is a good reason he's so intent on crushing Biden."
195,"Analysis by Harry Enten, CNN",,A new Quinnipiac University poll out this week finds Sen. Elizabeth Warren with a 74% favorable rating and a 10% unfavorable rating among potential Democratic primary voters.,2019-09-28,CNN,Analysis: Warren's rising popularity has been limited to Democrats,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/28/politics/elizabeth-warren-democrats-popularity/index.html,"(CNN) First things first: The theme song of the week is Mork & Mindy closing credits .

A new Quinnipiac University poll out this week finds Sen. Elizabeth Warren with a 74% favorable rating and a 10% unfavorable rating among potential Democratic primary voters. Her favorable rating is up significantly from 61% in May , while her unfavorable rating is down from 16%.

This poll is one of many that suggests Warren's favorable rating has climbed since the beginning of the year.

Warren seems to have the hot hand in the Democratic presidential primary. She's challenging former Vice President Joe Biden for the lead in Iowa, New Hampshire and nationally. These numbers show that at least part of her rise is because she's become more popular.

However, her growing popularity does not seem to be extending to outside the Democratic base.

Quinnipiac was kind enough to provide me with a crosstab of how non-potential Democratic voters (i.e. those who are not Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents) feel about Warren.

This month, she comes in with an 11% favorable rating and a 70% unfavorable rating among this group. That shouldn't be too surprising, given that, while some of this group are independents who don't lean toward either party, much of it is made up of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. We simply should expect Warren (or any Democrat) to struggle with this group.

What's interesting is the trendline. Back in Quinnipiac's May poll, Warren's favorable rating with non-potential Democratic primary voters was 8%, compared to an unfavorable rating of 66%. A CNN poll a month later put Warren with an 11% favorable and 66% unfavorable rating with this group.

Put another way, Warren has not really seen any improvement with non-potential Democratic primary voters over the summer, even as she has dramatically improved with Democrats.

Now compare Warren's numbers with that of her chief Democratic rival, Biden. He's become considerably less popular with Democrats. His favorable rating with potential Democratic primary voters from May to now has gone from 79% to 72% and his unfavorable has gone from 14% to 19%.

Among non-potential Democratic voters, the fall off has not been as dramatic. Biden's favorable rating remains steady at 22%. His unfavorable rating is up from 63% in May to 70% now.

Biden maintains a clear edge in net favorability (favorable - unfavorable) rating of -48 points versus -59 points for Warren among non-potential Democratic primary voters.

Biden's advantage here may explain why he does better in polls against Republican President Doanld Trump than Warren. A recent Fox News poll , for instance, had both Biden and Warren beating Trump -- but Biden more than doubled Warren's margin over the President (14 points vs. 6 points). He did so, in large part, because he did significantly better than Warren among non-Democratic primary voters.

Of course, we'll have to see how this week's impeachment news may shift these numbers. Biden's numbers could slink southward as Republicans attack him.

But for now, Biden's maintaining his electability edge over Warren."

At a CNN town hall in March in Jackson, Mississippi, she talked boldly about the enduring stain of chattel slavery and her plans to address lingering racial inequality.

A month later, she got a standing ovation at the ""She The People"" conference where she set the pace on black maternal health care policy. Jesse Jackson lavished her with praise, seeming to single her out after her speech at the Rainbow Push conference in June.

And at Congressional Black Caucus event in Washington, DC, in early September, she drew the largest applause of all the candidates, two of whom were CBC members. She has also grabbed endorsements from prominent black women, such as Roxane Gay.

Yet, Warren, whose campaign feels most like a movement, has struggled to translate that appeal to black voters on the ground. On the campus of a small historically black college here this weekend that was very much evident -- she only drew a handful of black voters in a crowd of about 1,000 people. Event attendance, particularly on a Saturday afternoon in 90 degree weather, is a very rough metric -- Biden's crowd at the same venue was mostly white as well. But it's clear that Warren, like Bernie Sanders before her, is struggling with black voters. She is all the rage on black twitter, not so much elsewhere. A new CNN poll has her lagging Biden in this state among black voters by 41 points -- she notches 4% among black voters. (Sanders gets 13%).

Asked Saturday about closing this gap and why she thinks it persists, she answered:

""The way I see this is that African American women have really been the backbone of the Democratic Party for generations now. They get out there and they fight for you. What I'm doing is showing up and trying to talk to people about why I'm in this fight. About what's broken and how to fix it and how we're building a grassroots movement to get it done. And it's not just one policy, it's everywhere. Education it is. It's about our historically black colleges and universities. It's about closing the black white wealth gap by canceling a lot of the student loan debt that's out there. It's there in health care to deal with the maternal health mortality rates that hit black women so much harder than any other group. It's about housing and attacking redlining straight on. I've got a lot of plans and what I want to do talk to people about all of them. Because ultimately we have a country that keeps working better and better for those at the top and isn't working for much of anyone else and I think we got a chance to change that.""

Her very specific plans are certainly breaking through with some voters. Casey McClure, who came with her mother and father to Warren's event here with very specific reasons why she backs the Massachusetts senator.

""I'm voting for Warren because I can't afford college anymore. I also like her plan for black women so we won't die so much in labor,"" McClure, 26, said. ""And she reminds me of Obama because she gives us hope.""

McClure said she is trying to convince her dad, Willie McClure, 65, to back Warren. He seems to lean-Biden because of the Obama connection, but is still making up his mind.

""I like Warren because of the fire she brings. What she's bringing to the table is the main issues and that's what we need,"" McClure said. ""And I like Biden ... he's got this calm attitude about himself. If one of them is not elected, I'd like to see them each at least serve in administration.""

Deitra Pichey, 32, came with her brother Marcus Bigger, 34, to hear Warren. While she backs Andrew Yang, she thinks Warren has a shot with black voters.

""I think her policies definitely align with the African American community, it's just that we need to hear her more,"" Pichey said. ""She needs to go to more HBCUs to speak to our community because there's a lot of issues that affect us as a whole that people running for the Democratic nomination need to hear about.""

Bigger has settled on Warren because of her plan to forgive student loan debt.

""I think she is hitting on the right points,"" he said. ""I don't know if a lot of black voters have tuned in to hear her message.""

After her event at Clinton College, Warren went to nearby soul food restaurant where she posed for pictures and signed the wall. She will return in the coming weeks for an event with Rep. Jim Clyburn, the venerable South Carolina congressman who the Democratic candidates are all courting for an endorsement.

As in 2016, there is likely to be a generational divide among black voters, with younger voters opting for the not-Biden candidates.

Sanders got 52% of black voters under 30 in 2016, yet those voters were only about 3% of voters in a CNN analysis of 27 states with exit or entrance polls. Among black voters over age 30, it was 82% Hillary Clinton to 17% Sanders. That block of older black voters were about one-fifth of Democratic voters, giving Clinton a big base of support in 2016 that has now largely shifted to Biden.

While Biden has drawn criticism for his praise of his work with segregationist senators and his rambling answer (record players?) to a question about slavery in the last debate, there remains a reservoir of good will toward him, particularly among older black voters.

Biden's retort when people question him on issues, particularly on race, is to say that people know him. And in this state, and all across the South among black voters that carries a lot weight. Southerners figure out who you are by figuring out who your people are. And Biden still has the clearest answer.

""When people see Biden, they see Obama's VP and they feel like he can relate,"" said Tracey Easter, 44. ""He is human. We saw him lose his son. He is a good and decent man."""

Mo pic.twitter.com/OYHmoRpUgv — Mo Brooks (@RepMoBrooks) September 26, 2019

During an appearance on Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN during an appearance in Washington, D.C. on Thursday at the Federation for American Immigration Reform’s (FAIR) Hold Their Feet to the Fire annual radio event, Brooks elaborated on his feelings about the allegations, which he said could be tied to 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) supporters.

“Elizabeth Warren in my judgment is just about guaranteed to be the Democrat nominee for president, OK?” Brooks said. “And there’s probably a number of people who support Elizabeth Warren that in part were either behind the disclosure of this information or are currently promoting it today in order to enhance Elizabeth Warren’s stature vis-à-vis, Joe Biden.”

According to the Alabama Republican, Warren meets the requirements of the modern Democratic Party in both identity and ideology.

“Let’s look at who Joe Biden is, OK?” he continued. “He is a white male who is a liberal. In today’s Democratic Party, that doesn’t cut it. On a sexist level, the Democratic Party basically says we want women, not men. And Joe Biden is a man. So that doesn’t fit that identity politics item that the Democrat Party fosters on the American people. Additionally, Joe Biden is a mere liberal. The Democrats of today insist on pure socialist.”

“And to Elizabeth Warren’s credit, the third principle argument that they use is based on race,” Brooks added. “They are opposed generally to the election or nomination of Caucasians. And to Elizabeth Warren’s credit, she’s claimed that she’s a Native American.”

Those criteria, according to Brooks are who Democrat voters want representing their party on the ballot.

“Those are their three themes, and those are the three themes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used to beat a 20-year white male liberal incumbent congressman in New York.”

Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren are knotted up in Nevada, according to new CNN polls conducted by SSRS in the third and fourth states to cast ballots for the 2020 Democratic nomination .

Biden tops Warren by 21 points in South Carolina -- 37% of likely voters back the former vice president, 16% Warren and 11% Sanders. In Nevada, there is no clear leader, with Biden and Sanders tied at 22% of likely caucusgoers with 18% for Warren, all within the poll's margin of sampling error. In neither state does any other candidate reach double-digits.

Biden's strong standing in South Carolina rests on support from black voters. Overall, 45% of black likely primary voters back Biden, more than 30 points ahead of his closest competitor. Among white likely primary voters, however, Biden and Warren are deadlocked: 29% favor Biden, 28% Warren.

Nevada's three-way race rests on the demographic and political divides that are driving the contest nationwide. Liberal likely caucusgoers break heavily for Sanders, while moderate and conservative caucusgoers give Biden a wide edge. Those under age 50 break toward Sanders: 35% for him vs. 13% for Warren and 12% for Biden. Among those over 50, 32% back Biden, 23% Warren and 11% Sanders. Voters with college degrees are more in Warren's corner, while those without degrees split between Sanders and Biden with Warren lagging behind.

There is room in both states for these numbers to move. So far, 44% of likely caucusgoers in Nevada and 45% of likely voters in South Carolina say they've chosen a candidate and made up their mind. Another 38% in each state say they have a preference but could change their mind and 18% in Nevada and 17% in South Carolina don't have a preference yet.

Biden stands alone in South Carolina when likely voters are asked to rate their level of enthusiasm. Nearly half, 48%, would be enthusiastic about a Biden nomination, outpacing Warren's 35%, Sanders' and California Sen. Kamala Harris's 23% and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg's 19%. In Nevada, more than 4 in 10 say they would be enthusiastic about each of the top three -- 47% for Sanders, 44% for Biden and 42% for Warren -- while 22% each would be enthusiastic about a Harris or Buttigieg nomination.

In both states, however, majorities would at least be satisfied with any of these five candidates. The share saying they would be dissatisfied or upset with any of these five peaks at 37% for Buttigieg in South Carolina and 28% for Harris or Buttigieg in Nevada.

On the issues and electability

About six in 10 likely Democratic voters or caucusgoers say it's more important to nominate a candidate with a strong chance of beating President Donald Trump than it is to nominate one who shares their views on the issues. And in both states, the group that is focused on beating Trump is more apt to favor Biden over Sanders. In Nevada, they are also more apt to favor Warren than are those focused on issues, her numbers are about the same across those groups in South Carolina.

Regardless of how they rate the importance of a candidate's positions on the issues, Nevada and South Carolina Democrats seem to differ over who can best handle the top issues facing the field. On health care, South Carolina's likely voters favor Biden -- 34% say he'd do the best job on it vs. 17% for Sanders and 16% for Warren -- while those in Nevada give Sanders an edge -- 32% say the Vermonter would do the best job on health care, 25% Biden, 17% Warren.

In Nevada, there's a massive divide within likely caucusgoers over health care along ideological lines, mirroring the debate the candidates have had publicly over the merits of ""Medicare for All."" Fully 50% of liberal likely caucusgoers say they trust Sanders most on health care with 20% naming Warren and 15% Biden, while Sanders trails Biden by 11 points among moderate and conservative likely caucusgoers (31% Biden, 20% Sanders and 14% Warren). The ideological gap is narrower in South Carolina.

Biden holds a wide edge overall on each of the five issues tested in South Carolina (health care, the climate crisis, gun policy, the economy and immigration. In Nevada, however, things get tighter outside of health care. On no other issue does a single candidate earn the trust of even 25% of likely caucusgoers, with Sanders, Biden and Warren clustered near the top across all five.

Looking beyond the primaries, the President's approval rating in Nevada -- likely to be a critical battleground state in 2020 -- is underwater, 51% disapprove while 41% approve. That's about the same as it was last October just before Democrats won a Senate seat there, one of two picked up from Republicans in the 2018 midterms. In South Carolina, Trump's ratings outpace his national marks, which currently hover around 40% approval, with 49% approving and 47% disapproving. In both states, there is a 90-point gap between where Republicans and Democrats stand on Trump's approval, with independents tilting negative.

The surveys were conducted from September 22 through 26, during which time House Democrats announced a formal impeachment inquiry into the President . Looking at interviews conducted before and after the announcement of the inquiry, there does not appear to be a shift in Trump's ratings.

The Republican Party in both states has canceled its Republican nominating contest for 2020. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents largely back their party's decision, though. In South Carolina, 62% approve of canceling the primary, while 52% approve of the Nevada GOP's cancellation of its caucus. But even among those Republicans and Republican-leaners who disapprove of the decision to cancel the primary or caucus, the President is still deeply popular (83% approve of his job performance in Nevada, 74% in South Carolina).

The CNN polls in Nevada and South Carolina were conducted by telephone among random samples of adults in each state. In Nevada, results among the 1,203 adults have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points, it is 7.1 points for results among the 324 likely Democratic caucusgoers. In South Carolina, results among 1,200 adults carry an error margin of 3.4 percentage points, while those among the 406 likely Democratic primary voters have an error margin of 5.9 points."

Nevada is right next door to California, her home state. South Carolina has a large black population.

Instead, she’s at 5% in Nevada and 3% in South Carolina.

When you dig a little deeper, there doesn’t seem to be any untapped well of support. Just 22% of likely caucus-goers in Nevada and 23% of likely primary voters in South Carolina say they would be enthusiastic about her winning the nomination. That’s more than 20 points behind the leader in each contest.

Harris tied with Pete Buttigieg in Nevada and only statistically insignificantly ahead of him in South Carolina when it comes to enthusiasm. Both states have been among the South Bend, Indiana, mayor’s weakest.

These numbers suggest that Harris is making the right call by planting herself in Iowa. Even if these states should be stronger for her in theory, she polls about as well in Iowa. These states are not anywhere close to a backstop for Harris. What she needs is to somehow use Iowa as a catapult to improve her standing in these later contests.

Perhaps the only encouraging sign for Harris is she’s at 6% among black voters in South Carolina compared to Elizabeth Warren’s 4%. That is, she is in no worse position than Warren among a pivotal bloc of voters, even as she struggles overall. It suggests Harris has more room to grow with black voters -- if her campaign can ever get going."

“Now the American people are being told we’re going to impeach the president … but guess what America, you can’t ask any questions of any of these people because they have certain protections,” Wright said during an interview on Fox & Friends Friday.

“That’s a sham; that doesn’t make any sense. That is an effort ultimately to kneecap … the president of the United States. This president or any other president, it is a horrific precedent,” he concluded.

The former CIA officer said that if the “whistleblower” is being used in an effort to try and remove President Trump, the individual should be forced to testify before Congress.

“You better stand up and do it publicly,” said Wright. He also criticized House Democrats for moving forward without gathering all of the facts.

“This isn’t about trying to get facts. We’ve already decided, as a partisan Democratic Party. I’m sorry to say, we’ve already decided we have to get rid of the president. We’re moving forward with it, irrespective of facts. That is clear.”

On Friday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) claimed, without evidence, that Russia was involved in the phone conversation in July between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

“I think Russia has a hand in this, by the way,” Pelosi said during an interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe.

She continued:

We saw what the Russian disruption of our election last time, their interference, 100% confidence of the intelligence community, high confidence in the intelligence community, that the Russians disrupted our election. That was wrong. The integrity of our elections is central to our democracy. So what the president did in inviting outside intervention into our election, it goes beyond the pale.

On Saturday, President Trump criticized Democrats on Twitter for focusing all of their efforts on impeachment:

On September 21, Breitbart News reported that Congressional Republicans defended President Trump against the Democrats and the accusations made by the “whistleblower.”

“It’s not like we haven’t seen this movie before,” said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH).

“Democrats come out, they’re all spun up, Adam Schiff makes all kinds of statements, and then when the facts come out — Whoa, different story! This seems to be the same kind of deal,” he concluded.

However, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said Friday that she hopes the impeachment inquiry will be completed before 2020 primary voting begins in February.

“Do you think it’s important that all of this be wrapped up before voting begins in February?” CNN’s political correspondent, MJ Lee, asked Warren on Friday’s broadcast of OutFront.

How is that possible?""

Her answer: ""Trump has apparently come to believe that he is so brilliant, so talented, so invincible , that he could get away with defying every norm, every practice, every institution of the democracy he is charged with leading.""

In a word from ancient Greece: hubris.

described it another way: ""Trump's decision to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate a political opponent one day after the country heard special counsel Robert Mueller testify before Congress suggests a man with a political death wish .""

One thing worked well for candidate Donald Trump in 2016. His ability to nickname and define his political rivals swiftly and mercilessly froze everyone else out of the Republican nomination and then helped secure him an Electoral College victory over Hillary Clinton. So, according to documents released this past week, he decided to do it again -- by tarring 2020 frontrunner Joe Biden as dishonest and mired in a Ukraine corruption investigation -- despite the lack of evidence that the former vice president had done anything wrong.

But is this election fundamentally different from 2016, with Trump as President seeking re-election rather than as an unlikely candidate?

Peter Bergen: "" Last week's disclosures explained why House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an inquiry that could lead to Trump's impeachment, wrote: "" A sitting president appears to have abused his office for political gain, and White House officials allegedly engaged in a cover-up of that effort.""

Elie Honig noted that the whistleblower complaint ratcheted up the odds of impeachment, partly by showing Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani's key role: ""Giuliani's involvement in Trump's efforts to have Ukraine gather dirt on political opponents is itself a major problem for Trump: noted that the whistleblower complaint ratcheted up the odds of impeachment, partly by showing Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani's key role: ""Giuliani's involvement in Trump's efforts to have Ukraine gather dirt on political opponents is itself a major problem for Trump: Why on earth was Giuliani -- a private citizen and not an employee of the US government -- involved in any of this at all? The answer, it seems, is that Trump's dealings with Ukraine were intended for his own personal and political benefit and not for (or perhaps at the expense of) the best interests of the United States.""

Josh Campbell said we can expect more of what we saw from the President during the Mueller investigation: "" Trump famously punches back at critics. And former FBI supervisory special agentsaid we can expect more of what we saw from the President during the Mueller investigation: "" President Trump has already started muddying the waters in the latest Ukrainian scandal , publicly blasting the whistleblower as a 'partisan,' even though Trump admitted in the same setting that he doesn't know who the person is. The President denied knowing which phone call media reports were even referring to, and then minutes later described the same call as having been 'beautiful.' And, of course, he has returned to a familiar lexicon, labeling the latest incident as 'the Ukraine witch hunt.'""

Now what?

As congressional committees investigate, people are looking ahead to the debate over whether Trump's actions are indeed impeachable.

Frank Bowman III is a University of Missouri law professor who has written a 478-page history of impeachment, and his verdict this week was unequivocal: is a University of Missouri law professor who has written a 478-page history of impeachment, and his verdict this week was unequivocal: ""If what Trump did here isn't impeachable, nothing is.""

Forty-five years ago, the House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal. Nixon resigned within two weeks. Bowman wrote, ""Nixon's conduct was penny-ante compared to Trump's. Trump didn't cover up a second-rate burglary by a group of inept 'plumbers' looking for dirt on Democrats. Rather, he appears to have wielded the entire economic, military and moral authority of a great nation to, effectively, extort another democratically elected head of state.""

Paul Callan: ""President Trump appears to be using his official position as President to coerce the Ukrainian President to investigate possibly false corruption claims in an attempt to smear his Democratic political rival. Trump's tendency to ""speak in a code,"" as Trump fixer Michael Cohen explained to a Congressional committee, is worth remembering when you read the rough transcript of the President's call with Zelensky, wrote: ""President Trump appears to be using his official position as President to coerce the Ukrainian President to investigate possibly false corruption claims in an attempt to smear his Democratic political rival. The 'stick' or threat that can be wielded is a cut-off of US aid unless Trump gains a personal benefit, the destruction of a political rival.""

Marc Thiessen of The Washington Post wrote that the Democrats favoring impeachment are getting ahead of the evidence relating to Trump's request for an investigation of Biden: ""Should Trump have done this? Absolutely not. of The Washington Post wrote that the Democrats favoring impeachment are getting ahead of the evidence relating to Trump's request for an investigation of Biden: ""Should Trump have done this? Absolutely not. But the reality of this call is a far cry from overheated charges that Trump used US aid to repeatedly pressure Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden. At a news conference with Trump at the United Nations, Zelensky said the call was 'normal' and 'nobody pushed me.' Career public integrity prosecutors at the Justice Department also reviewed the transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call and found there was no campaign finance crime to pursue.""

Julian Zelizer. ""There is a compelling argument that Many have written about the pressure a vote for impeachment would place on moderate Democrats elected in districts where Trump won in 2016. But the real test is of Republicans, who profess faith in limited government and the rule of law, wrote. ""There is a compelling argument that impeaching him could be the only way to demonstrate the GOP's genuine commitment to conservative principles . In some ways, the most damaging step the Republicans could take is to continue stifling the investigation and blindly defending the President even as most can see before their very eyes the way that he is running roughshod over everything they have claimed to stand for.""

Michael D'Antonio wrote. ""This will work for as long as they believe he is truly powerful. Now that the cracks are beginning to show, he cannot count on anyone's genuine affection or loyalty. So far, congressional Republicans have been more lukewarm than usual in their support of Trump, amid reports that a majority of GOP senators would oppose the President, if they could vote to remove him in secret (they can't).

(CNN) The whistleblower complaint is certainly worthy of investigation, but is an inappropriate phone call an impeachable offense? Is there evidence of a quid pro quo? Is there a case to be made that President Trump engaged in a ""betrayal of his oath of office""? Or is this a rush to judgment at a time we need to slow down and look at the facts?

It's not a heavy lift to find Republicans who have, at some point, looked at President Trump's actions and said, ""I would not have done that"" or ""I would not have said it that way."" I count myself among them. With that as a starting point, it's important to consider the credibility of the whistleblower complaint, the calculation of the Democrats and the collateral damage that will likely result from the impeachment proceedings.

Credibility of complaint:

Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified Thursday that the whistleblower did the right thing and the complaint was ""credible"" and ""important.""

That's true, from the standpoint that the complaint follows the appropriate protocol and reporting procedures. The official complaint is a clearly calculated document, more likely prepared by an attorney than the work of a rank-and-file member of the intelligence community.

Ford’s accusatory testimony – in which she accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her at a college party more than 30 years ago – was fraught with contradictions. Ford claimed that her friend, Leland Keyser, was at the party where the alleged assault took place. However, Keyser has been quoted denying any recollection of the alleged event.

“I don’t have any confidence in the story. Those facts together I don’t recollect, and it just didn’t make any sense,” she said, according to the New York Times’ Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly’s book The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation.

“Her story, spoken while holding back tears, shook Washington and the country. Her courage, in the face of those who wished to silence her, galvanized Americans,” Harris wrote.

Harris praised Ford again on Friday in an op-ed published by Elle, calling for an impeachment inquiry into Kavanaugh.

“After allegations of sexual assault surfaced during Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings, I saw up close that the hearings and FBI investigation were not a serious pursuit of truth or justice,” she continued.

“We need to get to the truth about Kavanaugh. And I believe the best path to truth and accountability is through a formal impeachment process,” she added."

During an appearance on Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN during an appearance in Washington, D.C. at the Federation for American Immigration Reform’s (FAIR) Hold Their Feet to the Fire annual radio event, Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-AL) discussed the possible motivations of the renewed push against Trump as it pertained to Ukraine.

“I think they’re trying to make the president look bad,” Aderholt said. “That’s one aspect of it – but also trying to appease their Democrat base on the other side. Now what is going to be interesting, I think, is see what in the next few days and next couple of weeks what we see this does to Biden because Biden is all wrapped up in this whole thing and his son Hunter. So, I don’t know how that’s going to have an impact.”

The Alabama Republican lawmaker said given the Biden son’s involvement in the saga, Biden could be eliminated from contention for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

“I think quite honestly Biden is out of the picture,” he continued. “I’ve said for quite some time now that I don’t think he will be the nominee. And I think with this recent thing he has implicated with his son that I think this assures he will not be the nominee.”

Aderholt went on to add that among his House colleagues, there is a consensus Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) will be the nominee.

“Certainly, those on the left side of the party – they don’t like Trump obviously,” he added. “But they don’t really like Biden either. So, I think Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren – that’s who they would gravitate toward. I talk to a lot of my colleagues. I casually just ask the question about how they see this playing out. It seems like the consensus is that Elizabeth Warren is going to be the nominee.”

The GoFundMe page states that all proceeds from the fundraiser would go “toward the whistleblower’s legal fees.” The “whistleblower” alleged that Trump pressed Ukraine’s leader to investigate 2020 Democrat candidate Joe Biden, and has caused House Democrats to start a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump.

Mark Zaid, who serves as the “whistleblower’s” lawyer, confirmed the fundraising effort in a Wednesday night tweet.

“We would appreciate any and all support US citizens can give,” Zaid tweeted.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) confirmed Wednesday that the identity of the unknown “whistleblower” has a political bias in favor of one of Trump’s 2020 rivals.

The “whistleblower”— who is reported to be a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer— said in the complaint the knowledge was obtained from “White House officials” but was not firsthand knowledge, according to a Justice Department official.

Members of Congress had opinions largely along partisan lines about whether the “whistleblower” was really a true “whistleblower.”

Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) said in a Thursday interview with Breitbart News Daily’s Alex Marlow that the purported government bureaucrat not only does not meet the standard as a “whistleblower,” but is also someone with a political bias.

2020 Democrat candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said in a Friday CNN interview she feared for the “whistleblower’s” safety, framing the person as someone “trying to get to the truth.”"

“We are here today because the Republicans in the House are paralyzed with hatred of President Clinton, and until the Republicans free themselves of hatred our country will suffer,” Pelosi said in the clip.

“They are driven by hatred,” Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) declared. “They hate Bill and Hillary Clinton so much, they will stop at nothing to bring him down.”

“Impeachment of a president is an undoing of a national election, and one of the reasons we all feel so angry about what they are doing is that they are ripping from us, they are ripping us under our votes,” Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) said. “They are telling us that our votes don’t count.”

The flashback even features Joe Biden (D), who warned Congress to be careful and make “darn sure” that they are impeaching based on “principle not politics.”

Their remarks stand in stark contrast to their recent remarks.

The younger Biden, who has a storied history of personal and professional issues, is at the center of controversy after President Donald Trump suggested the Ukrainian government look into his business dealings in the country. Although the Bidens are denying any wrongdoing, even going to the extent of accusing Trump of abusing his power, the situation only underscores the shadowy nature of Hunter Biden’s professional life.

Breitbart News is providing an indepth breakdown of instances in which Hunter Biden’s business interests directly intersected with his father’s position in elective office.

1. Joe Biden’s top campaign contributor hired Hunter fresh out of law school.

Shortly after Joe Biden was reelected to the U.S. Senate in 1996, his largest campaign contributor, the credit card issuer MBNA Corp., hired Hunter for an undisclosed role. The job raised eyebrows from ethics watchdogs since MBNA employees had just donated $63,000 to Joe Biden’s reelection campaign in what appeared to be a coordinated manner designed to sidestep federal campaign finance regulations.

Clouding the picture even further was the fact that then 26-year-old Hunter Biden was a recent graduate of Yale Law School with no banking or business experience. Both father and son defended the job offer, claiming nothing improper had or would result because of the arrangement.

“Unfortunately, no matter where I went to work, some people would make an issue of it,” the younger Biden told the Delaware News Journal in November 1996 when the job was announced.

Despite his role being unknown at the time of his hiring, when Hunter Biden left the company in 1998 to join the Clinton-era Commerce Department it was as a senior vice president.

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Joe Biden was championing bankruptcy reform legislation endorsed by financial interests and credit card companies such as MBNA.

2. Hunter Biden was on MBNA’s payroll while Joe Biden was writing bankruptcy reform legislation.

In the early-2000s, Hunter Biden remained on MBNA’s payroll as a consultant while his father was writing and pushing the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. The arrangement, which did not become public until after the law was passed, started in 2001 after Hunter Biden had left his position in the Commerce Department. Hunter Biden was paid monthly consulting fees, with some claiming they ranged upwards of $100,000, to advise the company on online banking issues.

The 2005 bankruptcy law tightened regulations to make it extremely difficult to declare bankruptcy. The law was heavily favored by MBNA and other giants in the banking and finance sectors. Many consumer protection advocates, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), have claimed the bill benefited special interests at the expense of consumers. Some have even suggested the law only served to hasten and aggravate the recession of the late 2000s.

As previously reported by the New York Times, Biden worked against many of his own fellow Democrats in Congress to ensure the final version of the bill was free of provisions opposed by companies such as MBNA.

Biden “was one of five Democrats in March 2005 who voted against a proposal to require credit card companies to provide more effective warnings to consumers about the consequences of paying only the minimum amount due each month,” the Times noted.

3. Hunter Biden sought to monetize off his father’s political standing on Wall Street.

In 2006, shortly before Joe Biden assumed the chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and launched his second presidential campaign, Hunter purchased a hedge fund called Paradigm Global Advisors with his uncle, James. Although neither had a strong background in finance, James and Hunter believed they could leverage Joe Biden’s political connections to their benefit.

“Don’t worry about investors,” James Biden, the former vice president’s younger brother, purportedly told Paradigm’s senior leadership upon taking over the fund, as reported by Politico. “We’ve got people all around the world who want to invest in Joe Biden.”

Paradigm’s executives claim that James and Hunter Biden saw the hedge fund as a way to “take money from rich foreigners who could not legally give money” to Joe Biden’s campaign account.

“We’ve got investors lined up in a line of 747s filled with cash ready to invest in this company,” James Biden allegedly told Paradigm’s staff.

As part of their effort to cash in on Joe Biden’s political influence, Hunter and James also tried to solicit labor unions to invest their pension funds with Paradigm. The duo’s main argument when pitching to unions was their access and ties to Joe Biden, who has a long record of advocating for collective bargaining.

The entire approach proved unsuccessful after a series of bad investments — including a partnership with a Ponzi scheme. James and Hunter eventually chose to strip the hedge fund of all its assets in 2010, selling them to the highest bidder before shuttering it indefinitely.

4. Hunter Biden’s firm scored a $1.5 billion deal with the Bank of China only days after his father paid an official visit to the country.

As Peter Schweizer, a senior contributor at Breitbart News, revealed in his bestselling book — Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends — Hunter Biden inked a multi-billion dollar deal with a subsidiary of the state-owned Bank of China in 2013. The deal, which was the first of its kind, created a private equity fund, Bohai Harvest RST (BHR) to invest Chinese money overseas.

The timing of the lucrative deal has been brought into question as it came only 12 days after Hunter visited China with his father aboard Air Force Two. Officially, the then-vice president was visiting the country amid escalating tensions over islands in the South China Sea and decided to bring his granddaughter and son along. In a March 2018 interview with Breitbart News Tonight, however, Schweizer detailed the political machinations that preceded Hunter Biden’s $1.5 billion venture with China. Schweizer said:

In December of 2013, Vice President Joe Biden flies to Asia for a trip, and the centerpiece for that trip is a visit to Beijing, China. To put this into context, in 2013, the Chinese have just exerted air rights over the South Pacific, the South China Sea. They basically have said, ‘If you want to fly in this area, you have to get Chinese approval. We are claiming sovereignty over this territory.’ Highly controversial in Japan, in the Philippines, and in other countries. Joe Biden is supposed to be going there to confront the Chinese. Well, he gets widely criticized on that trip for going soft on China. So basically, no challenging them, and Japan and other countries are quite upset about this.

Since its creation, BHR has invested heavily in energy and defense projects across the globe. As of June, Hunter Biden is still involved with BHR, sitting on its board of directors and owning a minority stake of the fund estimated to be worth more than $430,000.

5. The Obama-Biden administration helped facilitate the sale of U.S. company with insight into military technology to BHR and a Chinese state-owned defense firm.

In 2015, BHR and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) — an aerospace and defense conglomerate owned and operated by the Chinese government — made a $600 million bid to purchase Henniges, a Michigan-based automotive company.

The sale required approval from the Obama-Biden administration’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) as AVIC was a subsidiary of the Chinese government and Henniges produced “dual-use” anti-vibration technology with U.S. “military applications.” CFIUS, which is made up of representatives from 16 different federal bodies including the departments of State, Treasury, and Defense, is required to review any transaction with national security implications.

When the AVIC and BHR’s bid was first announced, alarm bells went off in certain sectors of the defense industry. In particular, many noted that AVIC was “reportedly involved in stealing sensitive data regarding the Joint Strike Fighter program,” which it later “reportedly incorporated … into China’s J-20 and J‑31 aircraft.”

Despite the national security concerns, CFIUS approved the deal with AVIC purchasing 51 percent of the company and BHR taking ownership of the other 49 percent. Upon purchase, an industry newsletter stated the deal was the “biggest Chinese investment into US automotive manufacturing assets to date.”

Although the deal was approved by the Obama administration, it has not escaped congressional scrutiny. In August, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) launched a probe into whether or not the CFIUS decision was influenced by either Joe Biden or former Secretary of State John Kerry, whose stepson was also involved in the venture.

“The direct involvement of Mr. Hunter Biden and Mr. Heinz in the acquisition of Henniges by the Chinese government creates a potential conflict of interest,” Grassley noted when launching the probe."

At a CNN town hall in March in Jackson, Mississippi, she talked boldly about the enduring stain of chattel slavery and her plans to address lingering racial inequality.

A month later, she got a standing ovation at the ""She The People"" conference where she set the pace on black maternal health care policy. Jesse Jackson lavished her with praise, seeming to single her out after her speech at the Rainbow Push conference in June.

And at Congressional Black Caucus event in Washington, DC, in early September, she drew the largest applause of all the candidates, two of whom were CBC members. She has also grabbed endorsements from prominent black women, such as Roxane Gay.

Yet, Warren, whose campaign feels most like a movement, has struggled to translate that appeal to black voters on the ground. On the campus of a small historically black college here this weekend that was very much evident -- she only drew a handful of black voters in a crowd of about 1,000 people. Event attendance, particularly on a Saturday afternoon in 90 degree weather, is a very rough metric -- Biden's crowd at the same venue was mostly white as well. But it's clear that Warren, like Bernie Sanders before her, is struggling with black voters. She is all the rage on black twitter, not so much elsewhere. A new CNN poll has her lagging Biden in this state among black voters by 41 points -- she notches 4% among black voters. (Sanders gets 13%).

Asked Saturday about closing this gap and why she thinks it persists, she answered:

""The way I see this is that African American women have really been the backbone of the Democratic Party for generations now. They get out there and they fight for you. What I'm doing is showing up and trying to talk to people about why I'm in this fight. About what's broken and how to fix it and how we're building a grassroots movement to get it done. And it's not just one policy, it's everywhere. Education it is. It's about our historically black colleges and universities. It's about closing the black white wealth gap by canceling a lot of the student loan debt that's out there. It's there in health care to deal with the maternal health mortality rates that hit black women so much harder than any other group. It's about housing and attacking redlining straight on. I've got a lot of plans and what I want to do talk to people about all of them. Because ultimately we have a country that keeps working better and better for those at the top and isn't working for much of anyone else and I think we got a chance to change that.""

Her very specific plans are certainly breaking through with some voters. Casey McClure, who came with her mother and father to Warren's event here with very specific reasons why she backs the Massachusetts senator.

""I'm voting for Warren because I can't afford college anymore. I also like her plan for black women so we won't die so much in labor,"" McClure, 26, said. ""And she reminds me of Obama because she gives us hope.""

McClure said she is trying to convince her dad, Willie McClure, 65, to back Warren. He seems to lean-Biden because of the Obama connection, but is still making up his mind.

""I like Warren because of the fire she brings. What she's bringing to the table is the main issues and that's what we need,"" McClure said. ""And I like Biden ... he's got this calm attitude about himself. If one of them is not elected, I'd like to see them each at least serve in administration.""

Deitra Pichey, 32, came with her brother Marcus Bigger, 34, to hear Warren. While she backs Andrew Yang, she thinks Warren has a shot with black voters.

""I think her policies definitely align with the African American community, it's just that we need to hear her more,"" Pichey said. ""She needs to go to more HBCUs to speak to our community because there's a lot of issues that affect us as a whole that people running for the Democratic nomination need to hear about.""

Bigger has settled on Warren because of her plan to forgive student loan debt.

""I think she is hitting on the right points,"" he said. ""I don't know if a lot of black voters have tuned in to hear her message.""

After her event at Clinton College, Warren went to nearby soul food restaurant where she posed for pictures and signed the wall. She will return in the coming weeks for an event with Rep. Jim Clyburn, the venerable South Carolina congressman who the Democratic candidates are all courting for an endorsement.

As in 2016, there is likely to be a generational divide among black voters, with younger voters opting for the not-Biden candidates.

Sanders got 52% of black voters under 30 in 2016, yet those voters were only about 3% of voters in a CNN analysis of 27 states with exit or entrance polls. Among black voters over age 30, it was 82% Hillary Clinton to 17% Sanders. That block of older black voters were about one-fifth of Democratic voters, giving Clinton a big base of support in 2016 that has now largely shifted to Biden.

While Biden has drawn criticism for his praise of his work with segregationist senators and his rambling answer (record players?) to a question about slavery in the last debate, there remains a reservoir of good will toward him, particularly among older black voters.

Biden's retort when people question him on issues, particularly on race, is to say that people know him. And in this state, and all across the South among black voters that carries a lot weight. Southerners figure out who you are by figuring out who your people are. And Biden still has the clearest answer.

""When people see Biden, they see Obama's VP and they feel like he can relate,"" said Tracey Easter, 44. ""He is human. We saw him lose his son. He is a good and decent man."""

Now he's opening up about their 2020 'adventure',https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/30/politics/elizabeth-warren-bruce-mann-cnntv/index.html,"Cambridge, Massachusetts (CNN) As Elizabeth Warren's candidacy for president caught fire this summer, so did images of her seemingly endless energy: running on to the stage at campaign events; punching the air when she speaks; working the photo line for hours after rallies.

In the evenings, Warren keeps moving, often doing laps around the hotel grounds or pacing in the lobby. But she does it with a different kind of intensity -- this is when she is starting to unwind, talking on the phone with her husband, Bruce Mann.

A professor at Harvard Law School specializing in legal history and property law, Mann is unquestionably the quieter half of the couple. Friends, colleagues and campaign aides say Mann has never been one to seek the public spotlight. But as Warren climbs in the polls, there may be no escaping it.

On a recent Friday morning, Mann and Bailey, the couple's rambunctious 16-month-old golden retriever, answered the side door of their Cambridge home, letting CNN reporters inside for the couple's first joint interview of the campaign. Mann's left hand was in a hard cast -- he had recently broken a bone while trying to break up a fight between Bailey and a neighbor's dog. (""Bailey got jumped, let's be clear,"" Warren would later insist -- she's never known Mann to get caught up in a scuffle. ""Bruce went to Bailey's rescue."")

Asked about the couple's contrasting personalities, Mann, 69, responded with a smile: ""It just works.""

Seated next to her husband of almost 40 years in a white wicker chair in their back sunroom, Warren chimed in in agreement. ""I don't want to be married to somebody like me. I want to be married to somebody like him.""

If Warren is elected, Mann would play an unprecedented role as the first male presidential spouse. That role once seemed likely to go to Bill Clinton , a man thoroughly accustomed to the political stage. Mann would be a very different kind of first husband -- a longtime observer of politics, but far from a politician himself. A little more than four months out from the Iowa caucuses, Mann said he has not been closely involved in the ins and outs of the Warren campaign, and remains a mystery to most voters.

But those close to the couple say that Mann's influence on his wife's candidacy is not to be underestimated -- he has a unique ability to help his famously energetic wife decompress after long days of travel and campaigning, they said. ""He brings a sense of calm to her more than anyone else could,"" said Nora Keefe, Warren's bodywoman.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, husband Bruce Mann and dog Bailey.

""When you see the images of Elizabeth up in front of a crowd, waving her hands, just being part of the crowd, I can't quite imagine Bruce up there waving his hands,"" said Drew Faust, the former president of Harvard University who has been friends with the couple for years. ""There's this enormous warmth between them. And he is obviously -- they are both obviously devoted to one another and take pride in their differences.""

Warren noted that much of her life over the last year has been ""different motel rooms every night, hotel rooms every night, different food, different people around, but I always know the last person I'll have a good conversation with, the last person I'll talk to before I go to sleep, is you.""

Of those late-night phone calls, she said: ""It's like letting all the pieces go.""

That morning was looking like it could shape up to be what Warren describes as a ""really good day"": when she is home long enough to fit in two walks around Fresh Pond with Bailey and Mann, once early in the morning and again at night.

""There's really nothing better than a golden retriever puppy to create the illusion of normalcy,"" Mann joked.

""If you don't run and Democrats lose, you'll feel guilty""

In two wide-ranging interviews -- first with Mann and, later, the couple speaking together -- they discussed what has been anything but a normal year.

They couldn't pinpoint one moment when it became clear that Warren would run for president, something she had decided against doing four years ago. In the months leading up to the 2019 New Year, Warren had begun to quietly consult people whose advice she trusted, asking each of them for three reasons she shouldn't run, and three reasons she should.

""She saved me for last, and finally, she asked me for three reasons, pro and con. And I said, no, I'm not going to do it,"" Mann recalled. ""I said, you're gonna run anyways. So just doesn't matter. Because if you don't run and Democrats lose, you'll feel guilty because then that means there'd be no one to fight for the people and the issues that you care about.""

He was right. Warren would announce her exploratory campaign on New Year's Eve.

A registered Democrat and a self-described ""political junkie"" and ""compulsive reader of newspapers,"" Mann said he has been exercising discipline to avoid being consumed by news about his wife's campaign. He is sparing in what he flags to Warren, who has said she doesn't follow the news about the election closely.

US Senator from Massachusetts (D) Elizabeth Warren is flanked her husband Bruce Mann as she is sworn in by Vice President Mike Pence.

Warren has also taken a similar approach to polling, repeatedly declining to engage questions from reporters about who's up and who's down. At one point in the joint interview, when Mann was asked why he believes his wife has been leading in recent polls, Warren leaned into her husband with a reminder: ""And you remember, we don't do polls.""

""That's right, we do not do polls,"" Mann said. But he offered up a theory on what has been attracting voters to his wife this year.

""She's always had just an extraordinary ability to explain complex issues, clearly, memorably,"" he said. ""Watching people who hear her respond to her as she reaches them, as she helps them see how the issues touch their lives -- it's, I'm watching her teach on a larger stage.""

""I just fell for her from 25 yards out""

The couple's first meeting in the summer of 1979 was, as Mann describes, ""improbable."" He and Warren were both 29 and new to teaching, and had traveled to Key Biscayne, Florida, to attend an economics and law conference.

He spotted Warren, who had recently separated from her first husband, Jim Warren, across the lawn at an opening reception. ""Even from that distance, I was just drawn to her,"" he said. ""She was so just lively, so animated, so engaged. And I just fell for her from 25 yards out before even meeting her.""

Admittedly, it wasn't quite love at first sight for Warren.

""That was a Sunday, late afternoon,"" she mused of their first meeting. ""I wasn't completely in love with him until sometime mid-morning on Monday.""

What sealed the deal for Warren: ""It was on Monday when I actually saw him in shorts. And good-looking legs. That's when I was all in.""

""She completely objectified me,"" Mann responded with a grin.

If there was an immediate physical attraction, the pair also bonded over their similar upbringings.

Warren was born in Oklahoma City, the baby of four. As she has told voters on the campaign trail this year, Warren vividly remembers watching her mother walk out of the house one day to look for a job after her father suffered a heart attack. Mann's parents didn't have much money, either. ""They stretched and stretched and mortgaged to the hilt to buy the cheapest house in the town with one of the best public school systems,"" he said.

Within months of their first meeting in Florida, Warren visited Mann at the University of Connecticut, where he was teaching at the time. She sat in on one of his classes, and after all of the students had left, Mann recalled asking her: ""What'd you think?'""

""And she just said, 'What can I say? Will you marry me?' And I said, 'OK.' That is a direct quote, I remember every word.""

The couple juggled living in different cities long after they were married. Warren would continue teaching in Texas, before eventually getting hired at the University of Pennsylvania, where Mann also taught for almost 20 years. But when Warren landed a full-time teaching position at Harvard University in the 1990s, it would be years before Mann would also get a professorship at the school.

They leaned on Warren's aunt, ""Aunt Bee,"" to help raise Warren's two children from her first marriage, Amelia and Alex. In campaign speeches, Warren credits her aunt, after whom she is named, for changing the course of her life. She credits Aunt Bee, who lived with the family for 16 years, for having allowed her to continue teaching.

""Oh, she'd be so proud. She loved Elizabeth dearly,"" Mann said of Aunt Bee, who died in 1999. If she were still alive and observing Warren's 2020 campaign, Mann said, ""Her first response would probably be: 'How can I help?'""

""You just jump into the deep end and you swim""

Something else that seemed improbable to Mann in 1979 was that politics would be in the couple's future.

Warren was a Republican when they first met. She wouldn't change her party registration to Democrat until 1996. ""However conservative she might've been at the time, it was not particularly apparent and we really didn't discuss politics,"" Mann said.

But by 2011, Warren had made a name for herself in Washington, overseeing the Trouble Assets Relief Program after the financial crisis and conceiving of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under President Barack Obama. That September, she mounted her first political campaign against Massachusetts Republican Sen. Scott Brown.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren onstage which her husband Bruce Mann and dog Bailey.

It was during this closely watched Senate race that Warren first came under fire for her past claims to Native American heritage. She would defeat Brown, handing the Democrats a major pick-up in the Senate, but the criticism of how Warren handled her family history lingered. Her campaign's decision last year to release the results of a DNA test, which showed distant Native American ancestry, was widely panned.

For Mann, who was close to Warren's extended family in Oklahoma, these criticisms were particularly painful.

""I knew everyone in her family, loved her family, knew all the stories that they had grown up with,"" Mann said. ""Because it was an attack on her family, it was one that was sort of probably the least pleasant of the attacks she's endured.""

As for the possibility that Warren would be up against Trump if she were to win the Democratic nomination, Mann was matter of fact.

""I'm not sure if anyone -- how anyone trains for it,"" he said. ""I mean for all of this, you just jump into the deep end and you swim.""

The couple also insisted that they do not talk about what life could be like at the White House. ""It's a bit early for that,"" Mann said. In the classroom, Mann said he never mentions his wife's name or the campaign, a boundary that his students have been respectful of.

""They observe that separation. It's probably killing them, but they're very good,"" he said.

Mann has not done any interviews this year, with the exception of a brief encounter with reporters outside of their Cambridge home on New Year's Eve, hours after Warren announced her exploratory campaign. Prompted for a comment, Mann had said that day: ""We've been married a long time and it's always been an adventure. So this is just another one.""

Asked how that adventure was going, Mann told CNN: ""Extraordinarily well.""

""Certainly back then, I had no idea what it would look like -- only that we would do it,"" he said. ""Every part of it remains an adventure. So I stand by that statement."""

Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren are knotted up in Nevada, according to new CNN polls conducted by SSRS in the third and fourth states to cast ballots for the 2020 Democratic nomination .

Biden tops Warren by 21 points in South Carolina -- 37% of likely voters back the former vice president, 16% Warren and 11% Sanders. In Nevada, there is no clear leader, with Biden and Sanders tied at 22% of likely caucusgoers with 18% for Warren, all within the poll's margin of sampling error. In neither state does any other candidate reach double-digits.

Biden's strong standing in South Carolina rests on support from black voters. Overall, 45% of black likely primary voters back Biden, more than 30 points ahead of his closest competitor. Among white likely primary voters, however, Biden and Warren are deadlocked: 29% favor Biden, 28% Warren.

Nevada's three-way race rests on the demographic and political divides that are driving the contest nationwide. Liberal likely caucusgoers break heavily for Sanders, while moderate and conservative caucusgoers give Biden a wide edge. Those under age 50 break toward Sanders: 35% for him vs. 13% for Warren and 12% for Biden. Among those over 50, 32% back Biden, 23% Warren and 11% Sanders. Voters with college degrees are more in Warren's corner, while those without degrees split between Sanders and Biden with Warren lagging behind.

There is room in both states for these numbers to move. So far, 44% of likely caucusgoers in Nevada and 45% of likely voters in South Carolina say they've chosen a candidate and made up their mind. Another 38% in each state say they have a preference but could change their mind and 18% in Nevada and 17% in South Carolina don't have a preference yet.

Biden stands alone in South Carolina when likely voters are asked to rate their level of enthusiasm. Nearly half, 48%, would be enthusiastic about a Biden nomination, outpacing Warren's 35%, Sanders' and California Sen. Kamala Harris's 23% and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg's 19%. In Nevada, more than 4 in 10 say they would be enthusiastic about each of the top three -- 47% for Sanders, 44% for Biden and 42% for Warren -- while 22% each would be enthusiastic about a Harris or Buttigieg nomination.

In both states, however, majorities would at least be satisfied with any of these five candidates. The share saying they would be dissatisfied or upset with any of these five peaks at 37% for Buttigieg in South Carolina and 28% for Harris or Buttigieg in Nevada.

On the issues and electability

About six in 10 likely Democratic voters or caucusgoers say it's more important to nominate a candidate with a strong chance of beating President Donald Trump than it is to nominate one who shares their views on the issues. And in both states, the group that is focused on beating Trump is more apt to favor Biden over Sanders. In Nevada, they are also more apt to favor Warren than are those focused on issues, her numbers are about the same across those groups in South Carolina.

Regardless of how they rate the importance of a candidate's positions on the issues, Nevada and South Carolina Democrats seem to differ over who can best handle the top issues facing the field. On health care, South Carolina's likely voters favor Biden -- 34% say he'd do the best job on it vs. 17% for Sanders and 16% for Warren -- while those in Nevada give Sanders an edge -- 32% say the Vermonter would do the best job on health care, 25% Biden, 17% Warren.

In Nevada, there's a massive divide within likely caucusgoers over health care along ideological lines, mirroring the debate the candidates have had publicly over the merits of ""Medicare for All."" Fully 50% of liberal likely caucusgoers say they trust Sanders most on health care with 20% naming Warren and 15% Biden, while Sanders trails Biden by 11 points among moderate and conservative likely caucusgoers (31% Biden, 20% Sanders and 14% Warren). The ideological gap is narrower in South Carolina.

Biden holds a wide edge overall on each of the five issues tested in South Carolina (health care, the climate crisis, gun policy, the economy and immigration. In Nevada, however, things get tighter outside of health care. On no other issue does a single candidate earn the trust of even 25% of likely caucusgoers, with Sanders, Biden and Warren clustered near the top across all five.

Rating Trump

Looking beyond the primaries, the President's approval rating in Nevada -- likely to be a critical battleground state in 2020 -- is underwater, 51% disapprove while 41% approve. That's about the same as it was last October just before Democrats won a Senate seat there, one of two picked up from Republicans in the 2018 midterms. In South Carolina, Trump's ratings outpace his national marks, which currently hover around 40% approval, with 49% approving and 47% disapproving. In both states, there is a 90-point gap between where Republicans and Democrats stand on Trump's approval, with independents tilting negative.

The surveys were conducted from September 22 through 26, during which time House Democrats announced a formal impeachment inquiry into the President . Looking at interviews conducted before and after the announcement of the inquiry, there does not appear to be a shift in Trump's ratings.

The Republican Party in both states has canceled its Republican nominating contest for 2020. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents largely back their party's decision, though. In South Carolina, 62% approve of canceling the primary, while 52% approve of the Nevada GOP's cancellation of its caucus. But even among those Republicans and Republican-leaners who disapprove of the decision to cancel the primary or caucus, the President is still deeply popular (83% approve of his job performance in Nevada, 74% in South Carolina).

The CNN polls in Nevada and South Carolina were conducted by telephone among random samples of adults in each state. In Nevada, results among the 1,203 adults have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points, it is 7.1 points for results among the 324 likely Democratic caucusgoers. In South Carolina, results among 1,200 adults carry an error margin of 3.4 percentage points, while those among the 406 likely Democratic primary voters have an error margin of 5.9 points."

Nevada is right next door to California, her home state. South Carolina has a large black population.

Instead, she’s at 5% in Nevada and 3% in South Carolina.

When you dig a little deeper, there doesn’t seem to be any untapped well of support. Just 22% of likely caucus-goers in Nevada and 23% of likely primary voters in South Carolina say they would be enthusiastic about her winning the nomination. That’s more than 20 points behind the leader in each contest.

Harris tied with Pete Buttigieg in Nevada and only statistically insignificantly ahead of him in South Carolina when it comes to enthusiasm. Both states have been among the South Bend, Indiana, mayor’s weakest.

These numbers suggest that Harris is making the right call by planting herself in Iowa. Even if these states should be stronger for her in theory, she polls about as well in Iowa. These states are not anywhere close to a backstop for Harris. What she needs is to somehow use Iowa as a catapult to improve her standing in these later contests.

Perhaps the only encouraging sign for Harris is she’s at 6% among black voters in South Carolina compared to Elizabeth Warren’s 4%. That is, she is in no worse position than Warren among a pivotal bloc of voters, even as she struggles overall. It suggests Harris has more room to grow with black voters -- if her campaign can ever get going."

""How is it possible that after the country was torn apart by the Russian interference in the 2016 election and its aftermath, and after (President Donald) Trump himself endured almost two years under the searing spotlight of an investigation into that very thing, how is it possible that he could reach out to another country and -- according to a whistleblower complaint -- attempt another round of election interference? How is that possible?""

In a word from ancient Greece: hubris.

described it another way: ""Trump's decision to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate a political opponent one day after the country heard special counsel Robert Mueller testify before Congress suggests a man with a political death wish .""

One thing worked well for candidate Donald Trump in 2016. His ability to nickname and define his political rivals swiftly and mercilessly froze everyone else out of the Republican nomination and then helped secure him an Electoral College victory over Hillary Clinton. So, according to documents released this past week, he decided to do it again -- by tarring 2020 frontrunner Joe Biden as dishonest and mired in a Ukraine corruption investigation -- despite the lack of evidence that the former vice president had done anything wrong.

But is this election fundamentally different from 2016, with Trump as President seeking re-election rather than as an unlikely candidate?

Peter Bergen: "" Last week's disclosures explained why House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an inquiry that could lead to Trump's impeachment, wrote: "" A sitting president appears to have abused his office for political gain, and White House officials allegedly engaged in a cover-up of that effort.""

Elie Honig noted that the whistleblower complaint ratcheted up the odds of impeachment, partly by showing Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani's key role: ""Giuliani's involvement in Trump's efforts to have Ukraine gather dirt on political opponents is itself a major problem for Trump: noted that the whistleblower complaint ratcheted up the odds of impeachment, partly by showing Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani's key role: ""Giuliani's involvement in Trump's efforts to have Ukraine gather dirt on political opponents is itself a major problem for Trump: Why on earth was Giuliani -- a private citizen and not an employee of the US government -- involved in any of this at all? The answer, it seems, is that Trump's dealings with Ukraine were intended for his own personal and political benefit and not for (or perhaps at the expense of) the best interests of the United States.""

Josh Campbell said we can expect more of what we saw from the President during the Mueller investigation: "" Trump famously punches back at critics. And former FBI supervisory special agentsaid we can expect more of what we saw from the President during the Mueller investigation: "" President Trump has already started muddying the waters in the latest Ukrainian scandal , publicly blasting the whistleblower as a 'partisan,' even though Trump admitted in the same setting that he doesn't know who the person is. The President denied knowing which phone call media reports were even referring to, and then minutes later described the same call as having been 'beautiful.' And, of course, he has returned to a familiar lexicon, labeling the latest incident as 'the Ukraine witch hunt.'""

Now what?

As congressional committees investigate, people are looking ahead to the debate over whether Trump's actions are indeed impeachable.

Frank Bowman III is a University of Missouri law professor who has written a 478-page history of impeachment, and his verdict this week was unequivocal: is a University of Missouri law professor who has written a 478-page history of impeachment, and his verdict this week was unequivocal: ""If what Trump did here isn't impeachable, nothing is.""

Forty-five years ago, the House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal. Nixon resigned within two weeks. Bowman wrote, ""Nixon's conduct was penny-ante compared to Trump's. Trump didn't cover up a second-rate burglary by a group of inept 'plumbers' looking for dirt on Democrats. Rather, he appears to have wielded the entire economic, military and moral authority of a great nation to, effectively, extort another democratically elected head of state.""

Paul Callan: ""President Trump appears to be using his official position as President to coerce the Ukrainian President to investigate possibly false corruption claims in an attempt to smear his Democratic political rival. Trump's tendency to ""speak in a code,"" as Trump fixer Michael Cohen explained to a Congressional committee, is worth remembering when you read the rough transcript of the President's call with Zelensky, wrote: ""President Trump appears to be using his official position as President to coerce the Ukrainian President to investigate possibly false corruption claims in an attempt to smear his Democratic political rival. The 'stick' or threat that can be wielded is a cut-off of US aid unless Trump gains a personal benefit, the destruction of a political rival.""

Marc Thiessen of The Washington Post wrote that the Democrats favoring impeachment are getting ahead of the evidence relating to Trump's request for an investigation of Biden: ""Should Trump have done this? Absolutely not. of The Washington Post wrote that the Democrats favoring impeachment are getting ahead of the evidence relating to Trump's request for an investigation of Biden: ""Should Trump have done this? Absolutely not. But the reality of this call is a far cry from overheated charges that Trump used US aid to repeatedly pressure Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden. At a news conference with Trump at the United Nations, Zelensky said the call was 'normal' and 'nobody pushed me.' Career public integrity prosecutors at the Justice Department also reviewed the transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call and found there was no campaign finance crime to pursue.""

Julian Zelizer. ""There is a compelling argument that Many have written about the pressure a vote for impeachment would place on moderate Democrats elected in districts where Trump won in 2016. But the real test is of Republicans, who profess faith in limited government and the rule of law, wrote. ""There is a compelling argument that impeaching him could be the only way to demonstrate the GOP's genuine commitment to conservative principles . In some ways, the most damaging step the Republicans could take is to continue stifling the investigation and blindly defending the President even as most can see before their very eyes the way that he is running roughshod over everything they have claimed to stand for.""

Michael D'Antonio wrote. ""This will work for as long as they believe he is truly powerful. Now that the cracks are beginning to show, he cannot count on anyone's genuine affection or loyalty. So far, congressional Republicans have been more lukewarm than usual in their support of Trump, amid reports that a majority of GOP senators would oppose the President, if they could vote to remove him in secret (they can't).

""We have nearly 35,000 donors who have been helping us make this goal. We've raised $1.5 million plus,"" Booker told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" Sunday. ""We've actually already crossed the threshold to make the November debates of 165,000 unique donors. The surge and the momentum is great, but yeah, I still need help.""

Booker has already qualified for the October Democratic presidential debate , which will be moderated by CNN and The New York Times, but he has not yet met the polling threshold to qualify for the November stage. The DNC has not yet announced the date for that debate.

(CNN) The whistleblower complaint is certainly worthy of investigation, but is an inappropriate phone call an impeachable offense? Is there evidence of a quid pro quo? Is there a case to be made that President Trump engaged in a ""betrayal of his oath of office""? Or is this a rush to judgment at a time we need to slow down and look at the facts?

It's not a heavy lift to find Republicans who have, at some point, looked at President Trump's actions and said, ""I would not have done that"" or ""I would not have said it that way."" I count myself among them. With that as a starting point, it's important to consider the credibility of the whistleblower complaint, the calculation of the Democrats and the collateral damage that will likely result from the impeachment proceedings.

Credibility of complaint:

Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified Thursday that the whistleblower did the right thing and the complaint was ""credible"" and ""important.""

That's true, from the standpoint that the complaint follows the appropriate protocol and reporting procedures. The official complaint is a clearly calculated document, more likely prepared by an attorney than the work of a rank-and-file member of the intelligence community.

""So that's your answer? You're not going to cooperate?"" Stephanopoulos asked.

Andreii Telizhenko, who worked in the Ukrainian embassy in Washington between December 2015 and May 2016, says Rudy Giuliani approached him for a face-to-face meeting in May of this year.

And Sergeii Leschenko, an advisor to President Volodymyr Zelensky, says Giuliani began applying pressure on Zelensky's team to dig up dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter shortly after the former comedian was elected in April 2019.

Each has a different perspective on the crisis -- Telizhenko believes that the issues surrounding Biden merit further investigation -- but both agree that Giuliani was open in his motivations.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Joe or Hunter Biden.

Telizhenko is known for his repeated claims in the media that Democrats colluded with Ukrainian officials to dig up dirt on then-candidate Donald Trump and his team in an effort to boost Hilary Clinton's chances in the 2016 elections. These claims have been repeatedly debunked.

According to Telizhenko, he and Giuliani spent about six hours in New York in late May of this year and discussed a range of issues including the business dealings of Hunter Biden in Ukraine.

Asked what was discussed, he replied: ""My insights on what's happening with the US-Ukrainian relationship and the DNC Ukraine collusion was also mentioned. Mr. Giuliani also asked me about Vice President Biden, what my thoughts was, what were my insights on him.""

When asked if this line of inquiry was a priority for Giuliani, Telizhenko responded, ""Yes, he doesn't hide it, it's his work, that's what he was hired to do -- to represent the President of the United States and his personal interests.""

Telizhenko, who is 29 and a frequent visitor to Washington, says he has met with Giuliani about two or three times since their initial meeting, and insists that the debunked conspiracy theories against the Democratic Party should be investigated by both the US and Ukraine.

""No, there is no conspiracy theories. We need to investigate this properly to show to the public there is no conspiracy theories, or maybe there are, but that's what we have to find out.""

Leschenko is clear about Giuliani's motives. ""For Giuliani it was the only interest in Ukraine,"" Leschenko told CNN. ""To get this information about Biden and to use this information in the US. He was not interested in Ukraine at all -- what is going on here, [the] reform process, or anti-corruption effort, nothing. He was just focused on this topic.""

When asked if he believed Giuliani was acting on behalf of Trump, Leschenko says there was little room for doubt. ""For sure (it was) not for his private purposes. He is not, let's say, a private person to be interested in this whole mess, but just because he had relations with [the] American President.""

He recounted a conversation with a close associate of President Zelensky: ""I met with some official from this administration before this inauguration and he said we know who Giuliani is, we know what is his role, we know that he is acting not just a private person but on behalf of his client (Trump).""

He added, ""It was a clear fact that Giuliani acted on behalf of Trump and they are interested in Biden.""

Giuliani's probes did not go unnoticed by an incoming Ukrainian administration desperate for US support and military aid to battle Russian-backed separatist rebels fighting for control of the country's eastern regions. ""No one wanted to start the presidency with a conflict with American counterparts,"" Leschenko said.

CNN has asked Giuliani for comment. He has previously denied any wrongdoing and defended his efforts to get a Ukrainian investigation launched.

The poll shows both Biden and Warren tied for first place, earning 25 percent support each among Democrat primary voters. Sanders – who has been struggling to overtake his ideological ally, Warren, came in third place with 16 percent support. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) came in fourth with seven percent, and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) dropped to fifth place with six percent support. Ten percent of respondents said they are “not sure,” and the remaining candidates garnered two percent support or less.

The margin of error is +/- 2.8 percent when adjusted for weighting and +/- 2.9 percent for registered voters.

The September 2019 Emerson poll – taken September 21-23 – told a similar story, with Biden, Warren, and Sanders dominating the top tier with a three-point spread.

The poll shows Biden with 25 percent support and Warren and Sanders closely behind with 23 percent and 22 percent support, respectively. While Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) have dominated the top of the second tier, Andrew Yang came in fourth place, earning eight percent support, followed by Buttigieg with six percent and Harris with four percent. The remaining candidates did not crack two percent support. The margin of error is +/- 4.6 percent, indicating a dead heat for first place among Biden, Warren, and Sanders.

The Economist/YouGov poll shows Sanders continuing to hold the edge with voters under 50 and Biden continuing to appeal to older voters:

Sanders continues to hold an advantage with voters under 50, with 28% support from that group of voters. Conversely, Biden continues to dominate the older vote with 42% support from those aged 50 or over. Warren competes with her rivals with both age groups, as she receives 23% support from those under 50 and 23% support among those 50 and over. Among voters who supported Sanders in 2016, 37% still support him, 23% now support Warren, 10% now support Biden and 9% now support Yang. In contrast, among those who supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, 41% now support Biden, 22% support Warren, 14% support Sanders, and 6% support Harris.

Emerson Polling also showed the top three Democrat candidates in tight head-to-head general election matchups. It showed Warren performing the best, beating President Trump 51 percent to 49 percent.

Biden appears to be losing footing in Nevada, a CNN poll found.

SSRS conducted the poll, surveying 324 likely Democrat caucus-goers September 22-26, 2019. The poll shows Sanders and Biden tied for first place with 22 percent support each. Warren fell just four points behind with 18 percent support. With a margin of error of +/- 7.1 percent, the race is locked in a dead heat.

The remaining candidates fell well outside the margin of error. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who came in fourth place, only saw five percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) and Tom Steyer (D) with four percent support each.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), a top candidate for the 2020 Democrat presidential nomination, says amnesty for every illegal alien living in the United States is “good for” American workers who will be forced to compete against newly legalized low-skilled foreign workers.

During a town hall with the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) union in Madison Heights, Michigan, Warren said she will give amnesty to all 12 to 22 million illegal aliens living in the country, a move that would immediately drive up foreign competition in the labor market for America’s working and blue-collar class.

Warren said:

We need a pathway to citizenship for the people who are here and here to stay. They are our neighbors; they are our brothers and sisters. They are here. We need a path — not just for DREAMers — but also a path for grandmas, and for little kids, and for people who came here to work on farms, and for students who overstayed their visas. We need a path that is fair and achievable. Bring people out of the shadows. It is good for all workers, and we need to get them into our unions. [Emphasis added]

Similarly, Warren is promising to expand legal immigration levels, which are already at historically record-high rates. About 1.2 million mostly low-skilled legal immigrants are admitted every year, not including the hundreds of thousands who arrive on temporary visas to compete against Americans for jobs.

“We need to expand legal immigration,” Warren said. “The Trump administration has cut it. Families are separated now for years through the legal system. People are frustrated with what they can’t do.”

Though Warren has taken a populist-nationalist stance on various economic policies, her plan to support more immigration to the U.S. is a key component of the globalist ideology supported by the nation’s donor class.

High levels of immigration, illegal and legal, put downward pressure on U.S. wages while redistributing about $500 billion in wealth away from America’s working and middle class and towards employers and new arrivals, research by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine has found.

Research by analyst Steven Camarotta has found that every one percent increase in the immigrant portion of American workers’ occupations reduces their weekly wages by about 0.5 percent. This means the average native-born American worker today has his weekly wages reduced by perhaps 8.5 percent because of current legal immigration levels.

While Warren seeks to increase foreign competition against American workers in the labor market, President Donald Trump has pursued policy initiatives to decrease competition, increasing U.S. wages and giving American workers leverage over businesses.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) winning the 2020 Democratic nomination for president, saying it would be a good thing for President Donald Trump.

Sanders said Warren “has moved so far to the left” that Americans will not be able to support her.

“The only person who is been on a steady incline and continuing to gain momentum and gain support seems to be Elizabeth Warren,” Sanders told host John Catsimatidis. “There couldn’t be better news for President Trump. I think that she has moved so far to the left in the way that she wants to fix the country I think that it will certainly help reelect the president. You know, it’s interesting — if you look at some of the things that she’s talking about and some of the things the president is talking about of what the problems in the country are — they’ve actually identified a lot of the same problems. But if you listen to how they want to solve them, you couldn’t find a more stark contrast than between the two of them.”

She continued, “I think that the far-left radical ideas that she’s bringing to the table are just not going to sell in most of America. And I think that is a great thing for the president, and frankly, it’s a good thing for the country because it helps make sure that we get four more years under this president.”

Sanders went on to say she thinks a Warren presidency would be a “scary thing for America” because of how far to the left she is.

“[Democratic presidential candidates] are so beholden to this far left-wing part of the party – the AOCs and The Squad – that they’re trying to appease them,” she explained. “And I think it’s going to be impossible to come back to the middle and try to regain some of those independent voters. And some of the people like Elizabeth Warren, I don’t think she wants to come back to the middle. I think she believes that the far left side is right. I think that’s a scary thing for America if she became president.”

Breaking: @AOC Was spotted with Bernie Sanders in Burlington Vermont earlier today. Could an endorsement be coming?? pic.twitter.com/dRTjqcq3vS — CNM (@CNMneews) September 29, 2019

The nature of their discussion remains a mystery, but it has reignited rumors of a potential endorsement on the horizon, as the Burlington Free Press noted:

INTERESTING meeting today in Burlington, VT:@BernieSanders sat down with @AOC.

The two were spotted at a diner in town and AOC’s team confirms they met. No word on what they discussed…. — Ryan Nobles (@ryanobles) September 29, 2019

The meeting follows weeks of internal frenzy for the Sanders campaign, which recently shook up its staffers in New Hampshire following concerns of Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) surge in the early primary state — one Sanders won handily against former opponent Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Shortly after, the Sanders campaign shook things up in Iowa, removing Jess Mazour as the campaign’s Iowa political director. “We’ll continue to make moves that we feel best position this campaign to win,” Shakir told the Washington Post of the move.

Both moves followed Sanders’ loss of the Working Families Party (WFP) endorsement to Warren.

“Senator Warren strikes fear into the hearts of the robber barons who rigged the system, and offers hope to millions of working people who have been shut out of our democracy and economy,” WFP National Party Director Maurice Mitchell said in a statement following the endorsement, according to Politico.

Democrat operatives — as well as former and current Sanders supporters — are worried about Sanders’ style and general ability to adapt, and those concerns are driving some to Warren instead.

As Politico reported:

As Sanders has stagnated and Warren has soared, even some of the Vermont senator’s supporters are expressing alarm. Something is off, they say privately, adding to the chorus of people in establishment political circles saying the same thing. Maybe he should explain how he’s different from Warren — he has deliberately avoided any hint of criticism of her — or commit to out-organizing her in the early nominating states. Or perhaps he needs to make nice with the media and hire more seasoned pros. Or what about going all-in on Iowa? The ideas from his volunteers, former aides, past delegates, steering committee members, and even some people within his campaign, vary. But they almost all come back to the same fundamental question, a question that has confounded the campaign since its earliest days: Can Bernie Sanders — a 78-year-old iconoclast whose entire identity is about standing firm in his beliefs, damn it — change?

Ocasio-Cortez, a fellow socialist, has yet to endorse a presidential candidate, but it is possible that the Sanders campaign is seeking one in hopes of a boost, particularly among idealistic and ultra-leftist millennial supporters.

Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are on the same page on a variety of hot-button Democrat issues — particularly the Green New Deal. Sanders rolled out the most aggressive climate change agenda of any of his competitors last month, clocking in around $16 trillion. The two socialist lawmakers are also strong advocates for Medicare for All.

While the New York lawmaker has praised Sanders in the past for wielding “enormous political courage” on behalf of others, she has stopped short of endorsing him:

One thing that is completely undeniable about Bernie Sanders is the enormous political courage he consistently wields on behalf of others. This statement is a big deal. He’s not just standing up for two members – he’s standing for the integrity of the entire US Congress. https://t.co/dZ8jPIyrLU — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) August 16, 2019

She told CNN in May that she was looking for a candidate who has a “coherent worldview and logic from which all these policy proposals are coming forward.”

“I think Sen. Sanders has that. I also think Sen. Warren has that,” she added:"

“We would appreciate any and all support US citizens can give,” Zaid tweeted.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) confirmed Wednesday that the identity of the unknown “whistleblower” has a political bias in favor of one of Trump’s 2020 rivals.

The “whistleblower”— who is reported to be a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer— said in the complaint the knowledge was obtained from “White House officials” but was not firsthand knowledge, according to a Justice Department official.

Members of Congress had opinions largely along partisan lines about whether the “whistleblower” was really a true “whistleblower.”

Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) said in a Thursday interview with Breitbart News Daily’s Alex Marlow that the purported government bureaucrat not only does not meet the standard as a “whistleblower,” but is also someone with a political bias.

2020 Democrat candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said in a Friday CNN interview she feared for the “whistleblower’s” safety, framing the person as someone “trying to get to the truth.”"

Although the Bidens are denying any wrongdoing, even going to the extent of accusing Trump of abusing his power, the situation only underscores the shadowy nature of Hunter Biden’s professional life.

Breitbart News is providing an indepth breakdown of instances in which Hunter Biden’s business interests directly intersected with his father’s position in elective office.

1. Joe Biden’s top campaign contributor hired Hunter fresh out of law school.

Shortly after Joe Biden was reelected to the U.S. Senate in 1996, his largest campaign contributor, the credit card issuer MBNA Corp., hired Hunter for an undisclosed role. The job raised eyebrows from ethics watchdogs since MBNA employees had just donated $63,000 to Joe Biden’s reelection campaign in what appeared to be a coordinated manner designed to sidestep federal campaign finance regulations.

Clouding the picture even further was the fact that then 26-year-old Hunter Biden was a recent graduate of Yale Law School with no banking or business experience. Both father and son defended the job offer, claiming nothing improper had or would result because of the arrangement.

“Unfortunately, no matter where I went to work, some people would make an issue of it,” the younger Biden told the Delaware News Journal in November 1996 when the job was announced.

Despite his role being unknown at the time of his hiring, when Hunter Biden left the company in 1998 to join the Clinton-era Commerce Department it was as a senior vice president.

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Joe Biden was championing bankruptcy reform legislation endorsed by financial interests and credit card companies such as MBNA.

2. Hunter Biden was on MBNA’s payroll while Joe Biden was writing bankruptcy reform legislation.

In the early-2000s, Hunter Biden remained on MBNA’s payroll as a consultant while his father was writing and pushing the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. The arrangement, which did not become public until after the law was passed, started in 2001 after Hunter Biden had left his position in the Commerce Department. Hunter Biden was paid monthly consulting fees, with some claiming they ranged upwards of $100,000, to advise the company on online banking issues.

The 2005 bankruptcy law tightened regulations to make it extremely difficult to declare bankruptcy. The law was heavily favored by MBNA and other giants in the banking and finance sectors. Many consumer protection advocates, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), have claimed the bill benefited special interests at the expense of consumers. Some have even suggested the law only served to hasten and aggravate the recession of the late 2000s.

As previously reported by the New York Times, Biden worked against many of his own fellow Democrats in Congress to ensure the final version of the bill was free of provisions opposed by companies such as MBNA.

Biden “was one of five Democrats in March 2005 who voted against a proposal to require credit card companies to provide more effective warnings to consumers about the consequences of paying only the minimum amount due each month,” the Times noted.

3. Hunter Biden sought to monetize off his father’s political standing on Wall Street.

In 2006, shortly before Joe Biden assumed the chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and launched his second presidential campaign, Hunter purchased a hedge fund called Paradigm Global Advisors with his uncle, James. Although neither had a strong background in finance, James and Hunter believed they could leverage Joe Biden’s political connections to their benefit.

“Don’t worry about investors,” James Biden, the former vice president’s younger brother, purportedly told Paradigm’s senior leadership upon taking over the fund, as reported by Politico. “We’ve got people all around the world who want to invest in Joe Biden.”

Paradigm’s executives claim that James and Hunter Biden saw the hedge fund as a way to “take money from rich foreigners who could not legally give money” to Joe Biden’s campaign account.

“We’ve got investors lined up in a line of 747s filled with cash ready to invest in this company,” James Biden allegedly told Paradigm’s staff.

As part of their effort to cash in on Joe Biden’s political influence, Hunter and James also tried to solicit labor unions to invest their pension funds with Paradigm. The duo’s main argument when pitching to unions was their access and ties to Joe Biden, who has a long record of advocating for collective bargaining.

The entire approach proved unsuccessful after a series of bad investments — including a partnership with a Ponzi scheme. James and Hunter eventually chose to strip the hedge fund of all its assets in 2010, selling them to the highest bidder before shuttering it indefinitely.

4. Hunter Biden’s firm scored a $1.5 billion deal with the Bank of China only days after his father paid an official visit to the country.

As Peter Schweizer, a senior contributor at Breitbart News, revealed in his bestselling book — Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends — Hunter Biden inked a multi-billion dollar deal with a subsidiary of the state-owned Bank of China in 2013. The deal, which was the first of its kind, created a private equity fund, Bohai Harvest RST (BHR) to invest Chinese money overseas.

The timing of the lucrative deal has been brought into question as it came only 12 days after Hunter visited China with his father aboard Air Force Two. Officially, the then-vice president was visiting the country amid escalating tensions over islands in the South China Sea and decided to bring his granddaughter and son along. In a March 2018 interview with Breitbart News Tonight, however, Schweizer detailed the political machinations that preceded Hunter Biden’s $1.5 billion venture with China. Schweizer said:

In December of 2013, Vice President Joe Biden flies to Asia for a trip, and the centerpiece for that trip is a visit to Beijing, China. To put this into context, in 2013, the Chinese have just exerted air rights over the South Pacific, the South China Sea. They basically have said, ‘If you want to fly in this area, you have to get Chinese approval. We are claiming sovereignty over this territory.’ Highly controversial in Japan, in the Philippines, and in other countries. Joe Biden is supposed to be going there to confront the Chinese. Well, he gets widely criticized on that trip for going soft on China. So basically, no challenging them, and Japan and other countries are quite upset about this.

Since its creation, BHR has invested heavily in energy and defense projects across the globe. As of June, Hunter Biden is still involved with BHR, sitting on its board of directors and owning a minority stake of the fund estimated to be worth more than $430,000.

5. The Obama-Biden administration helped facilitate the sale of U.S. company with insight into military technology to BHR and a Chinese state-owned defense firm.

In 2015, BHR and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) — an aerospace and defense conglomerate owned and operated by the Chinese government — made a $600 million bid to purchase Henniges, a Michigan-based automotive company.

The sale required approval from the Obama-Biden administration’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) as AVIC was a subsidiary of the Chinese government and Henniges produced “dual-use” anti-vibration technology with U.S. “military applications.” CFIUS, which is made up of representatives from 16 different federal bodies including the departments of State, Treasury, and Defense, is required to review any transaction with national security implications.

When the AVIC and BHR’s bid was first announced, alarm bells went off in certain sectors of the defense industry. In particular, many noted that AVIC was “reportedly involved in stealing sensitive data regarding the Joint Strike Fighter program,” which it later “reportedly incorporated … into China’s J-20 and J‑31 aircraft.”

Despite the national security concerns, CFIUS approved the deal with AVIC purchasing 51 percent of the company and BHR taking ownership of the other 49 percent. Upon purchase, an industry newsletter stated the deal was the “biggest Chinese investment into US automotive manufacturing assets to date.”

Although the deal was approved by the Obama administration, it has not escaped congressional scrutiny. In August, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) launched a probe into whether or not the CFIUS decision was influenced by either Joe Biden or former Secretary of State John Kerry, whose stepson was also involved in the venture.

“The direct involvement of Mr. Hunter Biden and Mr. Heinz in the acquisition of Henniges by the Chinese government creates a potential conflict of interest,” Grassley noted when launching the probe."

Warren later reflected on how faith influences many people's beliefs towards the LGBTQ community, including her own, and recited the first song she remembers learning as a child in Oklahoma.

The responses were humbling and show there are no easy answers.",2019-10-19,CNN,Opinion: Your pregnancy discrimination stories prove there are no easy answers,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/19/opinions/elizabeth-warren-pregnancy-discrimination-reader-response-carr/index.html,"(CNN) ""Back then, you had to be married for nine months before delivering your baby or your maternity insurance wouldn't kick in.""

That's what BJ, who was living in Connecticut in 1971 and working as a bank teller, remembers about her first pregnancy. After she started to show, she had to work at a back desk away from the customers, she writes. Now living in North Carolina, BJ is one of the hundreds of women and men who wrote to us after CNN Opinion invited readers to share their experiences with pregnancy discrimination. When thinking about her own life and those of her three daughters and their pregnancies, she said, ""We have come a long way.""

When it emerged that Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren may have faced job discrimination over a pregnancy, the backlash against the claim was swift. One reason Warren's story of pregnancy discrimination prompted such an outcry from Americans on social media earlier this month and from so many of you in response to our call for stories is that for many American women -- and men -- the Pregnancy Discrimination Act feels too much like a historical footnote and little else. The Act amended Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to ""prohibit sex discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, childbrth, or related medical conditions."" Before it was signed into law in 1978, it was perfectly legal to refuse to hire, or to fire, a woman because of pregnancy.

Women who, like BJ, were working parents in the 1960s and 1970s, described what it was like seeking work as a woman of childbearing years before 1978; they recalled having to show prospective employers their birth control pills or disclose the dates of their last period to prove they weren't pregnant or wouldn't try to get pregnant if hired. Other women shared heartbreaking stories with us, ones not consigned to the pre-1978 past. Companies denying benefits after a stillbirth, demanding employees return to work one week after delivery.

For those women, it might come as no surprise to consider that as recently as this year, federal courts have been called upon to adjudicate pregnancy discrimination cases; in 2015, UPS lost a pregnancy discrimination case before the Supreme Court (in a decision that united Ruth Bader Ginsburg with Samuel Alito, two justices with very different judicial worldviews).

As recently as 2007, Melanie K. -- who worked for a staffing company and was a 39-year-old mother herself -- reported a client telling her, ""Don't bring me any women who are going to have kids."" When she asked in disbelief for clarification, her client -- a national company seeking IT professionals-- reiterated: ""Avoid any woman of child-bearing age.""

Several years after Melanie's experience, Becca K., of Cleveland, recalled her boss's words to her when she returned from maternity leave after her second child. She needed to ""dial it back to basics while getting back into the swing of things"" because ""changing diapers for three months isn't the same thing as managing a multimillion-dollar business."" For Laura Astorino of Massachusetts, the comments came from a founding partner at the firm where she worked (and where she was told she couldn't have a raise since she was going on maternity leave): he called employees with children ""breeders.""

For women today, pregnancy discrimination is ""is real, it is harrowing, and it is wrong,"" wrote our op-ed contributor Kara Alaimo

These stories of pregnancy discrimination weren't just about pregnancy -- they were also about miscarriage. They were also about adoption. They were also about supporting a pregnant partner.

I was told by my CEO that I couldn't use any of my sick leave because I wasn't theoretically 'sick'. (I was pregnant with twins and would likely have a Cesarean.) I asked the CEO if a man who has back surgery is considered 'sick'. He backed down. — Linda Avey (@lindaavey) October 9, 2019

Jeff from Provo, Utah -- now a stay-at-home dad and a writer -- was a college student when his wife lost the baby she was carrying. He described being told by one of his professors that he could only take time away from class if he provided his wife's medical documentation.

Angela from Oklahoma, wrote: ""I adopted my daughter at birth and I was basically told I wasn't going to get FMLA [12 unpaid weeks for employees who qualify under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993] for a decision I was making. However, the company policy would have allowed me to take time off if I had a drug problem, etc. Just not to take care of my child, because I CHOSE to have her, because I didn't give birth to her. I also CHOSE to leave that company.""

CNN Opinion reached out to you because Elizabeth Warren put pregnancy discrimination in the public eye and we wanted to know how you felt about it. Your willingness to share your most intimate, painful experiences humbled and honored us. Your responses showed us that for so many Americans -- past and present -- who are working to bring families into the world and support them, there are no easy answers.

""She's taken full advantage""

In 1996, I was a 4th year attorney starting a new job with a well-respected boutique firm in Houston. On my first day, one of the named partners took me to lunch. As we were entering the elevator, a visibily pregnant woman was exiting and the partner introduced her to me as one of their associates. Once on the elevator, he snidely said to me, ""This is Catherine's third child. She's taken full advantage of our maternity leave program."" I've never forgotten that comment or his tone and it definitely was in mind when I had my first, and only, child a few years later while still at the firm. I felt pressured to do a fair amount of work remotely during my 3 months of leave, so as to not damage my chance at partnership, which I eventually got. Catherine never made partner and eventually left, as I did in 2007.

I'm due in January. Things need to change

In 2011, I discovered I was pregnant after starting a new job. I work in a male-dominated field, and my pregnancy seemed to confuse my male bosses. My employer's response was, ""I've been in this industry for 10 years and I've never heard of such a thing!"" I assure you, my reproductive system works the same way as any other woman's. They didn't want to work with me on appointments. They didn't understand why I needed to miss hours for glucose tolerance testing, an amniocentesis, my anatomy scan. They were upset I could no longer lift 50 pounds or more.

I live in a state that isn't really pro-women's rights. I'd been on the job for 6 months when I was placed on modified bed rest for the last 4 weeks of my pregnancy. My company kept my job open. However, when I finally delivered, I was expected to return to work just two weeks later. I had a difficult delivery, and my doctor wouldn't authorize a return to work until 8 weeks postpartum. I didn't qualify for FMLA.

I lost that position. I was a single parent. The loss of income was devastating. I had to put my children on Medicaid to insure them. We went on SNAP for a while. In the end, I spent 18 months as a stay-at-home parent, and I cherish that time. But I'd rather have been employed.

Now, in 2019, seven years later, I find myself in the exact same position. I started a new job and discovered I was pregnant. Nothing has changed. If anything, the current environment is even more hostile to mothers in the workplace. I work for a really good company, so that helps, but I still find myself with no job protection. I still don't qualify for FMLA. My state still has no provision for pregnant women. Health care costs have skyrocketed, and as have the costs of having a baby.

I'm due in January. Things need to change. This country is lacking in women's rights. Many mothers would love to stay home with their new baby for a year [as other countries mandate in terms of paid leave]. We simply can't afford to. At the very least, we need a maternity program that isn't dependent on how long you've been working. Let us collect Social Security during that time. If our employers can't afford to hold our jobs, which is especially hard for smaller companies, let us collect unemployment. Humanity literally depends on women having babies. It's time for this country to realize that.

Men are also punished

When my wife was pregnant with our third child, we had some significant health scares for the baby requiring weekly ultrasounds. I didn't miss more work than I had sick time, but I used my accrued sick leave to help take care of my wife and children when needed. When the opportunity for promotion came up, my supervisor told me that they needed someone more dependable and that because I had taken so much time off to care for my family, I wouldn't be eligible. (I also never took time off for this without finding someone to cover as well.) I am sure that it is worse for the women who are pregnant, but men who actually take time off for pregnancy/paternity leave are also punished.

Discrimination isn't the problem. Entitlement is

Having a child as a working parent is difficult. I know because I have two children. Both were delivered via Caesarian and I was fortunate to have eight weeks with each baby after delivery. Before deciding to have children, consideration was given to the time and effort required to raise a child. It became glaringly apparent that parenting would not come without sacrifice. Never did my employer indicate that pregnancy, nursing or parenting would impact my job. Had they suggested that, I would not have blamed them. I spent 9 months mostly in the office bathroom vomiting (pre-delivery) and a significant amount of time pumping when I returned from maternity leave. Guess what, my male cohorts didn't.

I am not denying that there are ignorant people out there, but I think the prevalent problem facing us is that of entitlement. We want to be successful career women, but don't want to sacrifice having children. We want to have children, but expect to be given advantages, excuses, for sub-par performance. The reality is that life is about choices. I have made mine after careful consideration. Lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine. This is my experience. Please consider it as valid before dismissing it because it doesn't align with your storyline.

Pregnant? You still have to lift a Labrador retriever

I worked as a veterinary technician and was told that while they understood I could no longer assist with X-rays, I was expected to continue lifting dogs up to 75 lbs by myself and that I would not be allowed extra breaks or time off during my pregnancy. I considered quitting, but felt certain that another veterinary establishment would choose not to hire me if they knew I was pregnant.

What it was like the year the Pregnancy Discrimination Act became law

In 1978, I was a 21-year-old female interviewing for my first management position after college. I remember, distinctly, making it to the final round of interviews with four different corporations in which the hiring manager doing the final interview was always a white male. In three of the four interviews, I was asked when I was planning to get married and have children. My response was I wasn't in a relationship and couldn't see that happening for many years to come. After convincing them my career was my priority, each of these men followed up with a sentiment similar to, ""Of course you understand why we have to ask that question. Training new management recruits and investing in their careers is expensive. If you were to go off and start having babies, you wouldn't be able to give us the same level of commitment."" I was offered a position with all four corporations; I accepted a position with the corporation that never approached that question.

You're forced to choose and live with the consequences

I was a married PhD student. When my dissertation director found out I was expecting my first child, he was furious. ""You can't have a baby AND write a dissertation. It can't be done,"" he said. I did both, but had even more resistance about being a new mom when I defended my dissertation -- this time by the women on my committee. Even though they teach, higher ed is NOT mom-friendly. And this was in 2006!

I had another discriminatory incident when I gave birth to my second child. I was adjunct teaching at the university level and had my course load cut in half when my second child was born. I was told the cut would only last a semester, to accommodate my schedule, but the program director never reassigned the courses next semester. So my salary was permanently cut in half. I knew something like that would happen, and came back to work 3 weeks after giving birth to try to protect my job. Obviously, that didn't work.

This is the reality for women in America's higher education system. You're forced to choose, and live with the consequences. I just don't understand why Warren's comment is even a question. It happens every day.

With a baby in the NICU, I lost my job

I went into the hospital with pregnancy complications at 29 weeks and was [put on] 24-hour bed rest. I delivered my daughter 6 weeks early at 34 weeks. I notified my employer of her birth per being told to a few days later. I was then informed that I only had 2 weeks of leave left and would need to return to work after or be terminated. They ran my short-term disability and FMLA concurrently without telling me so I used up 6 out of the 8 weeks while on bed rest. I asked if I could work from home because I physically couldn't come back in two weeks (C-section delivery). It was up to my supervisor to approve and he denied stating he didn't believe I would truly work. With a new baby in the NICU and fresh from surgery, I was terminated from my job.

I never forgot the fear I had from my first pregnancy

I am Elizabeth Warren's vintage. Interviewing for my first professional job In 1978, I was pregnant but did not disclose it. Part of the hiring process was passing a physical. I actually prayed it would not disclose the pregnancy, knowing I would not get hired. After many months of working to make myself indispensable (and still hiding my pregnancy), I told my manager I would need a maternity leave. Annoyed, he said if he'd known I was pregnant he would not have hired me. Nevertheless, he did not fire me and I returned to work after a six-week leave. Four years later, I again became pregnant. My manager was then a VP and I was then a director. By that time, it was assumed I would take a leave and return to work, which I did. But I never forgot the fear I had from my first pregnancy.

""You better not be pregnant""

I was working at a law firm in 2014 and was called into my boss' office and he inappropriately told me that another attorney had just told him she was pregnant, so his direct quote to me was, ""She is pregnant so you better not be."" He then went on to tell me that only one of us could be pregnant on the team at once and that we all better coordinate that. The truth was I had just found out the day before that I was pregnant and was then completely terrified. I unfortunately suffered a miscarriage with that pregnancy, but knew that I would never be able to have a healthy pregnancy at that office. I had seen them fire a pregnant woman and also fire a woman who came back to work post pregnancy who was then hospitalized for severe postpartum depression. She was fired while still out on leave for her postpartum. I had also been told that my career would be ruined if I got pregnant. Rather than continue my career as a law firm attorney and continue in that environment, I chose to take a corporate job where I remain today, happily the mom of 2.

I've been one of the ""lucky"" ones

I went for an interview at 10 weeks pregnant. I had 2 previous consistent miscarriages, so I didn't feel comfortable disclosing I was pregnant. After I reached 16 weeks, out of joy and need for emotional support, I told my supervisor and the owner of the business I was pregnant. A week later, I was fired because ""I just wouldn't be happy there due to personality conflicts."" It took me 4 months, without unemployment benefits (which means all of our bills, rent and car payments fell way behind and my husband was pulling 12- to 14-hour shifts, 7 days a week, as well as being threatened with eviction every month) to find another place to work. By that time, my pregnant belly was already showing, and I had very limited choices since I would obviously need maternity leave within a few months. I've been one of the lucky ones who found an office full of new and experienced moms and I was hired and still work there now.

Three of my colleagues stood up for me

In 1998, I was the only female doctor in a medical clinic. When I got pregnant with my first child, the director told me I should find another job because managing a primary care practice after having a baby was not going to be possible. Fortunately for me the clinic nurse manager, a woman, and two of my male colleagues stood up for me. I had to make concessions and be in clinic 5 days a week in order to keep my job though. Twelve years later, I became the clinic director. By then the majority of our physicians were women and motherhood was not only accommodated but celebrated.

I am a better person today because I had kids

I became pregnant with my first daughter in 2015. I was working at a rapidly growing tech company in the Midwest, and I was quickly excelling in my career. The company was mostly male but still had some female representation. The problem was that I was the FIRST female to have a baby (while working there). As soon as I told my boss and HR I was pregnant, fear set in with everyone it seemed. How do we handle this? Where will she be able to pump that's private and NOT a bathroom (which is legally required)? I also learned that the company had a paternity leave policy but NO maternity leave. I could take unpaid FMLA but no paid leave -- I couldn't even save up vacation time to use after having the baby.

Once the management team was aware, I was told to announce this to the team. After the announcement, crickets. I was on an island now. No one knew what to do with me or how to work with me. The first question was, ""Are you leaving?"" At first, I said ""No!"" That answer quickly changed. I ended up quitting that job and staying home with my baby and working as a part-time freelancer for about 3 years. It was wonderful. I will never regret that decision. However, I am now managing a growing agency (based on continuous business growth from freelancing) and I will NEVER put one of my team members in that position. I want flexibility and freedom for moms and dads that I work with. I never want to lose talent and potential because someone chooses to have a child. I know I am a better person today than I was before I had kids. I work harder. I work smarter. And I credit a lot of that to being a mom AND a bad ass businesswoman.

(CNN) Some people are questioning presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren's claim that she was basically fired from a teaching job in the early 1970s because she was pregnant. It's hard to imagine that many of them understand what it's like to be a working mother -- then or now.

Kara Alaimo

Media outlets have dug up a 2007 interview in which Sen. Warren recalled that teaching job, saying she remembered thinking ""I don't think this is going to work out for me. I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby and stayed home for a couple years,"" to suggest she left her job of her own volition. That's insane.

Whether she was fired or left because she saw the writing on the wall that her job would be incompatible with motherhood -- and who can blame her for not remembering the precise details of something that happened nearly five decades ago -- the point is that our society makes it extraordinarily tough to be a working mom, especially a new mom. It's bad now, but it was even worse when Warren had her children. She deserves credit for overcoming obstacles that her male opponents simply didn't face. And our next president, whoever that is, needs to be someone who understands these barriers.

I know because I'm a new mom. I have three graduate degrees and have been awarded tenure in my university teaching job. This means that I have much more flexibility than most working moms. Outside of classes, I can name my own office hours and manage to take my baby to the pediatrician during the workday. But, since becoming a mom last year, I've still found it incredibly tough to continue to work.

A big part of the challenge is that the cost of full-time, quality childcare rivals my own take-home pay -- and, as a university professor, my salary vastly exceeds the income of the average American and the salary of schoolteachers in positions like the one Warren held. Many women paying taxes on their own income and then paying a child care provider on the books might actually lose money by going to work -- and that's before taking account of other costs associated with jobs, like commuting and professional clothes. According to Child Care Aware of America, the average cost of child care is over $20,000 per year in most parts of the country . Yet the median income is only $56,000 per year -- before taxes."

It was the most crowded debate stage in the history of US presidential primaries.

Twelve candidates shared the spotlight Tuesday at the Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus. The event was hosted by CNN and The New York Times on the campus of Otterbein University.

This was the fourth Democratic debate of the campaign season, and it came three and a half months before the Iowa caucuses.

The first two debates had so many candidates that they had to be split up over two nights. But the Democratic National Committee raised the polling and fundraising thresholds that candidates need to qualify.

Those thresholds will be raised once again ahead of next month's debate in Georgia, so Tuesday might have been a make-or-break night for some of the lower-polling candidates."

5. Trump, unleashed: Donald Trump has spent the last week talking and tweeting almost nonstop as he tries to fight his way out of mounting allegations over his pressure campaign to get the Ukrainians to look into debunked allegations of wrongdoing against Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

And the rhetoric from Trump has gone to previously unseen heights -- even for Trump. He's accused Rep. Adam Schiff (California) of treason, he's attacked Mitt Romney in deeply personal terms -- more on that directly below -- and he's repeating, repeating, repeating long disproven lies.

All of which means that when Trump travels to Minneapolis on Thursday for a ""Keep America Great"" rally, well, look out. Trump is always at his most, well, Trump-y at these campaign rallies -- and, given the walls closing in on him in Washington, he could well use the Minnesota rally as a venting session the likes of which even longtime Trump observers rarely see.

Stay tuned. It's going to be a doozy.

4. Any other Mitt Romneys out there?: Republicans have, almost uniformly, closed ranks around Trump even as a Republicans have, almost uniformly, closed ranks around Trump even as a second whistleblower has emerged regarding the President allegedly using the power of his office for political gain during interactions over the summer with Ukraine.

Only Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) has publicly criticized Trump in any way, calling the President's urgings of China and Ukraine to investigate the Bidens ""wrong"" and ""appalling."" Trump immediately struck back, referring to Romney as a ""pompous 'ass'"" (I have no idea why he put ""ass"" in quotes) and suggesting that the 2012 Republican nominee was ""begging"" to be his secretary of state.

Any Republican who was weighing speaking out about Trump's behavior with Ukraine (and his plea for China to investigate his main rival for the 2020 nomination) now can have no illusions about what such criticism will be met with: Pure, unadulterated anger from Trump -- and likely vilification from the President's base.

Is any prominent Republican other than Romney willing to risk speaking out when that reaction is assured? Principle vs. politics, anyone?

3. Fundraising losers...: With the With the third fundraising quarter ending at the close of last month , most of the major candidates have released how much they brought in and how much they spent between July 1 and September 30.

Let's go through the losers first.

* Joe Biden: When you are a former vice president and the race's frontrunner, you need to be at or very close to the top of the money chase. Biden's $15 million raised in the third quarter is well off the pace and a significant drop-off from when Biden raised $21.5 million from April 1 to June 30 -- his first three months of active fundraising. His numbers will re-ignite the debate over whether he has real grassroots energy behind his establishment candidacy. Think about this: The mayor of South Bend, Indiana -- Pete Buttigieg -- raised $4 million more than Biden in the third quarter and has now out-raised the former vice president for six months straight.

* Cory Booker: The New Jersey senator's plea for $1.7 million in the final days of the quarter -- in order, he said, for him to remain in the race -- drew a ton of publicity. Even though Booker met his goal, he still only brought in $6 million for the entire three-month period. That likely means he will be facing another dire financial deadline in the not-too-distant future.

2. ... and fundraising winners:

* Bernie Sanders: Even as his poll numbers have stagnated somewhat, the Vermont senator's small-dollar, online fundraising network continues to deliver. Sanders topped the field in the third quarter with more than $25 million raised and has now raised more than $71 million this year. That ensures he will not only have real organizations in all of the early states but will also be able to continue fighting for the nomination for months.

* Elizabeth Warren: While Sanders edged out Warren for the top spot by about $500,000, Warren's third quarter fundraising is yet another data point proving how much momentum she has built behind her candidacy. Warren already has the best organization in Iowa, and fundraising like she put on the board over the last three months ensures her campaign will be able to fund a (TV) air assault as well.

* Andrew Yang: The tech entrepreneur raised $10 million in the third quarter, which, at least to me was the single most surprising result of the fundraising race. Yang's total put him well above what Booker, as well as Sen. Michael Bennet (Colorado) and Gov. Steve Bullock (Montana) raised, and within shouting distance of Sen. Kamala Harris (California). That's a stunner, and shows how far he's come since the year started and almost no one knew who he was.

1. The age/health debate is here: It was probably inevitable, given that the four most likely candidates to be president in 2021 are 70+ years old, but Bernie Sanders' recent heart attack has officially injected the issue of age and health into the 2020 campaign.

After several days of uncertainty, Sanders' campaign confirmed that he had suffered a heart attack on the campaign trail and, following his release from the hospital late last week, he has returned to Vermont. His campaign has canceled its events until further notice but has said Sanders will be at the next debate -- set for October 15 in Ohio.

While the relatively advanced ages of Sanders (78), Joe Biden (76) and Elizabeth Warren (70) has been a sort of low buzz in the background of the Democratic race so far, those days are now over. All three candidates had previously pledged to release their medical records before the Iowa caucuses on February 3, 2020, but the urgency of those releases is significantly higher now than it was even a week ago.

(Remember that Donald Trump was the oldest person ever elected to a first term when he won the presidency in 2016 at age 70. During the campaign, his personal physician released a letter proclaiming that Trump ""would be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency."" Trump is now 73. In January of this year, he underwent a physical which found him in ""very good health overall."")"

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said this week he wants to convene hearings to examine allegations of corruption in Ukraine.

""Given the House of Representatives' behavior, it is time for the Senate to inquire about corruption and other improprieties involving Ukraine,"" said Graham in a tweet. ""Therefore I will offer to Mr. Giuliani the opportunity to come before the Senate Judiciary Committee to inform the committee of his concerns.""

(CNN) Tuesday's Democratic debate featured something we have never witnessed before on a presidential debate stage: 15 full minutes of open back-and-forth about how the government should contend with the increasing power of Silicon Valley .

At the center of the exchange was a tussle between Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has been pushing for the break-up of tech giants like Facebook and Google, and Sen. Kamala Harris, who pointedly asked whether Warren would join her in demanding that Twitter suspend President Donald Trump's account on the platform.

This debate moment set the stage for what will doubtless be an election-long spat over what form regulations against internet companies should take.

This is a highly-charged and heavily politicized question, particularly for Democratic candidates. Last month, Facebook formalized a bold new policy that shocked many observers, announcing that the company would not seek to fact-check or censor politicians -- including in the context of paid political advertising, and even during an election season.

Over the past few days, this decree has pushed US political advertising into something like the Wild West: President Donald Trump, who will likely face the Democratic candidate in next year's general election, has already taken the opportunity to spread political lies with no accountability.

A frightening new world of political communication

In the aftermath of Facebook's announcement, Trump's presidential campaign disseminated an advertisement on Facebook's platform claiming that 2020 Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden had used his power as vice president to try to influence Ukraine to help his son, Hunter Biden.

The ""facts"" behind the Trump advertisement implicating Biden — which has been viewed on Facebook no fewer than five million times — have been definitively debunked , and CNN declined to air the ad for that reason.

This new Facebook policy opens a frightening new world for political communication — and for national politics. It is now the case that leading politicians can openly spread political lies without repercussion. Indeed, the Trump campaign was already spreading other falsehoods through online advertising immediately before Facebook made its announcement — and as one might predict, most of those advertisements have not been removed from the platform.

Should our politicians fail to reform regulations for internet platforms and digital advertising, our political future will be at risk. The 2016 election revealed the tremendous harm to the American democratic process that can result from coordinated misinformation campaigns ; 2020 will be far worse if we do nothing to contain the capacity for politicians to lie on social media.

The same capabilities by which political campaigns sliced up audience segments in 2016 via Facebook's advertisements will continue to exist in 2020. The difference will be that this time, the lies can be distributed by agents of the Trump campaign, instead of shell accounts operated by the Russian government and others.

Facebook's derogation of fact-checking will thus only lend greater credibility to coordinated disinformation operations — as in the case of the recent Trump campaign ad.

Warren responded to the Trump ad with a cheeky point: In an ad she has circulated over Facebook, she claims that ""Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election."" Later in the ad, she acknowledges this is a falsehood, and contends that ""what [Mark] Zuckerberg has done is given Donald Trump free rein to lie on his platform — and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters.""

Warren's mockery of the ad — and of the underlying policy that allowed its dissemination — helps illuminate how Facebook's new policy will have grave implications for our political future. Facebook's decision not to take down the Trump ad amounts to knowingly enabling the insidious political manipulation of American voters.

Facebook's power and ""free expression""

The irony is that Facebook already censors advertisements -- including those placed by presidential campaigns in the United States -- for a host of reasons. One investigation found that the company had taken down paid content from four of the Democratic candidates, including 117 ads that had been placed by the Biden campaign, for reasons ranging from the use of profanity to the display of fake buttons.

It is disconcerting to think that by fiat, Facebook can deem a political ad to be dishonest because it contains fake buttons (which can deceive the viewer into clicking on a survey button when in fact there is no interactive feature in the ad), but the company will refuse to take action against ads containing widely-debunked political lies, even during an American presidential election.

This perilous inconsistency in Facebook's policy decisions is a sign that its corporate power has grown too great. Concern for the public interest and the health of our democracy should compel us to action. And the only entity that has the power to do anything to improve the situation for the American people is Congress.

Facebook has one principal counterargument against regulation: that the company must maintain strong commitments to free speech and freedom of political expression. This came across in Mark Zuckerberg's speech at Georgetown University on Thursday, in which he described social media as a kind of ""Fifth Estate"" and characterized politicians' calls to take action as an attempt to restrict freedom of expression. Quoting at times from Frederick Douglass and Supreme Court jurisprudence, Zuckerberg said ""we are at a crossroads"" and asserted: ""When it's not absolutely clear what to do, we should err on the side of free expression.""

Unfortunately for Facebook, this argument holds little water. If you determine that an ad containing a fake button is non-compliant because it ""[entices] users to select an answer,"" then you certainly should not knowingly broadcast ads that entice voters to unwittingly consume publicly-known lies -- whether they are distributed by the President or any other politician. Indeed, as one official in Biden's presidential campaign has noted , Zuckerberg's argumentation amounts to an insidious ""choice to cloak Facebook's policy in a feigned concern for free expression"" to ""use the Constitution as a shield for his company's bottom line.""

Behind what the company claims to be a commitment to free speech lies a commercial convenience.

Regulatory policy is the way forward

If Facebook cannot take appropriate action and remove paid political lies from its platform, the only answer must be earnest regulation of the company -- regulation that forces Facebook to be transparent about the nature of political ads and prevents it from propagating political falsehoods, even if they are enthusiastically distributed by President Trump.

Our nation has always aspired to place the interests of our democratic purpose over the interests of markets. Silicon Valley should be no exception."

The people familiar told the paper that witnesses have been questioned by investigators since at least August about Giuliani, President Donald Trump's personal lawyer.

Part of the questioning involves any potential role Giuliani played in an alleged conspiracy involving two of his business associates , Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were indicted on campaign finance-related charges last week.

The Journal's report builds on reporting from The New York Times l ast week that Giuliani is facing an investigation by federal prosecutors into whether his involvement with Ukraine violated federal lobbying laws.

Giuliani told CNN on Monday that he was unsure if prosecutors were looking into his work with the mayor of Kharkiv, with whom he had met on a December 2017 trip as part of his international consulting business.

""It was a security report focusing on an emergency management center which was concluded in (December) or so 2017. I have no knowledge they are looking at it but let them. Maybe they should ask me instead of leaking it (if they are doing it) and I can save them unnecessary work,"" Giuliani said.

When asked if he was aware of prosecutors looking into any other area of his Ukraine business dealings, Giuliani told CNN, ""No l don't think they are but my bank records are fine.""

The former New York mayor has faced a wave of scrutiny following the release of a whistleblower complaint that alleges Trump abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the 2020 election and that the White House took steps to cover it up. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.

The whistleblower complaint labels Giuliani a ""central figure"" in the controversy.

US officials were concerned, the whistleblower said, with Giuliani and his contacts with Ukrainian officials. The whistleblower alleges that US officials believed Giuliani was a conduit for messages between the President and officials in Kiev and that he was at the helm of a problematic ""circumvention of national security decision making processes.""

Giuliani has previously told CNN he has ""no knowledge of any of that crap"" in the complaint."

WARREN CLAPPED BACK AND SAID YOU ARE MAKING MY POINT. YOU ARE NOT REGULATED. TAYLOR: WE HAVE THE TWEET SHOWING THE FCC, BASICALLY WHAT ELIZABETH WARREN IS SAYING, YOU ARE MAKING MY POINT. IS UP TO YOU WHETHER YOU TAKE THE MONEY TO PROMOTE LIES. AGAIN, SORT OF MAKING HER POINT, IF YOU WILL. SARAH: ABSOLUTELY. WHAT I THINK WHAT THIS SHOWS US IS THE ELECTION IS GOING TO BE ABOUT FACEBOOK -- THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE ELECTION AS MUCH EASIER TO RUN AGAINST FACEBOOK THAN THE OPPOSING CANDIDATE BECAUSE FACEBOOK DOES HOLD A LOT OF CONTROL, SUBTLE OR DIRECT CONTROLS OVER WHAT VOTERS WILL SEE. TAYLOR: ERIC, IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE INTERSECTION OF TECH AND NOW POLITICS, WHAT DOES THIS FIGHT SHOWED YOU FROM THE POLITICAL ANGLE ABOUT HOW MUCH TENSION THERE IS BETWEEN BIG TECH AND SOME OF THESE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES? ERIC: I AGREE WITH SARAH. THEY ARE WORKING THE LEFT RIGHT NOW. THERE IS A PUSH AMONG CONSERVATIVES TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT FACEBOOK AND GOOGLE ALLOW A WIDE RANGE OF SITES. SOME THAT JOURNALISTS MIGHT SAY MAY NOT PASS FACT CHECKERS. DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN ARGUING THAT AS WELL. YOU SEE THIS JOCKEYING UP PRESSURE -- CONSERVATIVES ON ONE SIDE, ELIZABETH WARREN AND DEMOCRATS ON THE OTHER, PUSHING FACEBOOK TO POLICE WHAT IS ON ITS ADVERTISEMENTS. IT IS NOT SO MUCH LEGISLATION AT THE MOMENT. IT IS JUST SORT OF POLITICAL PRESSURE. FACEBOOK KNOWS THIS PRESSURE IS COMING AS ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT POLITICIANS GETS TO WEIGH IN ON ANTITRUST INVESTIGATIONS THAT WILL PROGRESS AND PRIVACY LEGISLATION THAT COULD COME UP. THEY NEED TO STAY CLOSE TO THESE POLITICIANS WHILE THEY HAVE THE POLITICIANS HAVE THESE INTERESTS AROUND WHAT SPEECH IS ALLOWED ON THE PLATFORM. TAYLOR: AS A POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR, WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THIS FIGHT BETWEEN ELIZABETH WARREN AND MARK ZUCKERBERG? GUEST: I THINK IT IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF HOW FAR WE HAVE COME. IT IS ASTOUNDING THAT NOW YOU HAVE ONE OF THE LEADING CANDIDATES IN THE RACE FOR 2020 TAKING ON A BIG TECH COMPANY. SHE'S LEADING THE CHARGE AND OTHER DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ARE SURE TO FOLLOW. THAT IS FAR AND AWAY FROM WHERE WE WERE JUST FOUR YEARS AGO, LET ALONE EIGHT YEARS AGO. I AM OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER BARACK OBAMA'S CAMPAIGN WHEN HAVING A WEBSITE WAS A BIG DEAL. YOU THINK ABOUT HOW FAR WE HAVE COME NOW. I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM HERE IS WE LOOK AT WHAT ELIZABETH WARREN IS SAYING IS THAT IT IS NARROWLY FOCUSED ON FACEBOOK AND MARK ZUCKERBERG IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS 2016 AND WHAT THE DEMOCRATS DID. CERTAINLY NOT HER PLAN. BUT THE WAY SHE TALKS ABOUT IT -- I THINK THERE ARE LARGER QUESTIONS BEYOND FACEBOOK AND MARK ZUCKERBERG THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED, BUT STILL HAS NOT RESONATED POPULARLY. CERTAINLY, HER PLAN DOES ADDRESS -- SHE HAS A FOUR-PART PLAN BREAKING UP TECH COMPANIES. BREAKING UP IS PROBABLY AN OVERSTATEMENT, BUT ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES. A LOT OF POTENTIAL LEGISLATION. ALL OF THE ATTENTION AT THIS POINT SEEMS TO BE FOCUSED ON FACEBOOK BECAUSE OF ITS ROLE IN 2016. TO ME, I THINK FROM A LEGISLATIVE PERSPECTIVE, THAT IS A BIT OF A PROBLEM. TAYLOR: IS FACEBOOK TAKING THE RIGHT APPROACH IN YOUR OPINION OF BEING HANDS-OFF? NOT WANTING TO POLICE CONTENT? NOT WANTING TO DO A LOT OF FACT CHECKING. IS THAT THE RIGHT STRATEGY? JEANNE: I'M ASTOUNDED AND I THINK SARAH SAID IT EARLIER BY THEIR RESPONSE TO ELIZABETH WARREN. IT IS NOT A GOOD IDEA NORMALLY FOR A CORPORATION TO SAY WE ARE LIKE THOSE NETWORKS THAT ARE REGULATED BY THE FCC BECAUSE WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS INVITING IN REGULATION. THEY ARE FAR BETTER OFF STAYING THE PLATFORM THEY ARE WHERE, BY THE WAY, SINCE 1996, THEY HAVE BEEN PROTECTED BY CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF LIBEL AND ARE NOT REGULATED. IF THEY HAVE PUBLIC PRESSURE, SELF POLICING MAKES SENSE. BUT THE STATEMENT THEY MADE REALLY OPENS THEM UP TO THE ARGUMENT THAT SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE BEEN MAKING, WHICH IS THAT YOU TOO SHOULD BE REGULATED. THAT IS NOT A GOOD STRATEGY IN MY ESTIMATION. I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT GOT THROUGH FACEBOOK AND THEY ALLOWED THAT TO BE THE STATEMENT THEY PUT OUT. TAYLOR: WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THEM AS WE APPROACH 2020? THE PRESSURE WILL ONLY HEAT UP. SARAH: ABSOLUTELY. I THINK JEANNE MADE A GREAT POINT IS THAT FACEBOOK FOR YEARS SAID WE ARE NOT A MEDIA COMPANY. WE ARE A TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM. A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE CAN TALK ABOUT WHATEVER THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT AND SEE WHATEVER THEY WANT TO SEE. THAT IS NOT A NEUTRAL STANCE. I THINK WHAT WE ARE GOING TO SEE AHEAD OF THE 2020 ELECTION IS POLITICIANS PRESSURING FACEBOOK AND PRESSURING FACEBOOK IF FACEBOOK MAKES A CHANGE, IT WILL HELP THEIR CAMPAIGNS IN THE WAY FACEBOOK ENDED UP HELPING DONALD TRUMP IN THE 2016 ELECTION. NOT JUST BY IGNORING THE RUSSIAN INFLUENCE, BUT ALSO BY ASSISTING HIS CAMPAIGN IN RUNNING THEIR ADVERTISING THAT ENDED UP"

257,"Paul R. La Monica, CNN Business",,"Some business leaders, inlcuding Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, have expressed reservations about Elizabeth Warren. But others argue that even if she goes on to win the presidency, that won't be a problem for Wall Street or the economy.",2019-10-11,CNN,What would an Elizabeth Warren presidency mean for the economy and markets? - CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/11/investing/elizabeth-warren-stock-market-economy/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) The possibility that Elizabeth Warren could win the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination — and perhaps even defeat Donald Trump — is starting to unnerve some in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street.

But would a President Warren actually be a bad thing for big business and the stock market?

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees this summer that a Warren White House would not be good for the social media networking company, because of her calls to break upand other big tech companies.

Tech news site The Verge reported earlier this month that, according to leaked audio clips, Zuckerberg said ""if [Warren] gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah.""

And a recent survey by RBC Capital Markets showed that investors are nervous about Joe Biden's poll numbers and Warren's ascent.

""Investors clearly think Biden is better for the stock market than Warren,"" said Lori Calvasina, head of US equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, in the report. In fact, Warren was viewed as ""the least market friendly"" candidate, Calvasina noted.

Warren has a populist platform and has talked about doing more to regulate the financial, tech, health care and energy industries. She has also proposed a wealth tax of 2% annually on households with a net worth above $50 million and 3% on households with a net worth higher than $1 billion.

So it's understandable why Wall Street has concerns about Warren.

The reasons why Warren wouldn't tank the stock market

Still, some experts think that worries about Warren are way overdone.

For one, few believe that the Senate will flip to Democratic control in 2020 — even if President Trump loses his reelection bid.

So there are limits to how much a President Warren could do with executive orders if Congress is split, said Matt Daly, a managing director and head of corporate credit research at Conning.

And a Warren win could boost some parts of the market and economy, Daly told CNN Business. He pointed to clean energy and infrastructure as sectors that likely would benefit if Warren were to win the race for the White House.

Even though Mark Zuckerberg may not be a fan of the Massachusetts senator, other leaders in the tech industry support Warren's candidacy.

Big Tech starting to warm to Warren

According to a Vox/Recode story earlier this month, numerous tech insiders said they liked Warren because of her rigorous approach to coming up with policy ideas. Many also viewed her as a more palatable alternative to Bernie Sanders, who is also on the far-left, progressive side of the Democratic party.

Alphabet GOOGL Amazon AMZN Apple AAPL Microsoft MSFT AT&T T Disney DIS IBM IBM To that end, employees and PACs tied to Google ownerandare listed by the Center for Responsive Politics' OpenSecrets.org site as among the biggest donors to Warren's campaign. CNN ownerandwere also among the top 20 contributors.

Analysts at tech, media and telecom research firm MoffettNathanson don't seem worried about Warren either, noting that there's a difference between campaign rhetoric and actual policy.

""We're relatively sanguine. Sure, a Warren presidency would heighten regulatory risks. But a Warren presidency would heighten regulatory risks for lots of industries,"" the MoffettNathanson analysts said in a report. The analysts added that ""her platform has more planks than a pirate ship; she's got plans for everything.""

JUST WATCHED Warren: This is what fossil fuel wants us talking about Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Warren: This is what fossil fuel wants us talking about 02:25

Warren has also talked tough about China. That actually could be good for the markets, despite current concerns about the trade war.

Even though Trump's tactic of imposing more tariffs on China has hurt American companies and consumers — including from China's retaliatory measures — there is support in the business community for Washington to enforce intellectual property rights more forcefully with Beijing.

Warren would probably continue that approach. So it may not be in China's best interests to drag out trade talks and hope that it will no longer have to deal with Trump in 2021 if Warren continues to gain ground in the polls.

""There is growing consensus that China may hold out, trying to 'run out the clock' on the Trump administration through next November. These dynamics are changing, however, as Elizabeth Warren emerges and Joe Biden fades,"" said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide, in a report this week.

""Warren is running on populist policies and could be as challenging an adversary to the Chinese than Trump,"" Hackett added.

Continued pressure on China in a Warren White House?

A likely strong approach to dealing with China is a key reason why Kyle Bass, founder of the Hayman Capital Management hedge fund, said he is backing Warren too.

Bass told CNN Business in August that he would ""immediately"" vote for Warren because of her stance on China. She has criticized the country's environmental and labor/human rights policies and has also accused China of currency manipulation.

It's also worth noting that Wall Street was initially wary of Barack Obama in 2008 because of similar fears about the prospects for tougher regulations on the health care and financial sectors. (Of course, Wall Street was scared about lots of things unrelated to politics in 2008, such as the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the Great Recession.)

But the Obama presidency wound up being far more friendly to businesses than many had expected. So the same thing could happen if Warren wins the White House."

Joe Biden (D) has been under fire in recent days after it was reported that his campaign dropped short of $1 million – $924,000 – on private jet usage in the third quarter (July 1 – September 30) alone. The expenses were attributed to the EJCR, LLC Dba Advanced Aviation Team, recent Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings show.

While Biden leads the pack, he is not alone in his exorbitant private air travel expenditures. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) reportedly spent just short of $500,000 – $479,000 – on private air travel. That is a $179,000 increase from his private air travel expenses in the previous quarter, according to the Hill.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) also put her climate change-related concerns aside, spending $253,000– $236,000 more than the $17,000 she spent in the previous three months.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) – who once described climate change as the “greatest threat to our national security” – spent $360,000 on private air travel in the third quarter. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) – who described climate change as an “existential crisis that threatens all of us” – also utilized private air travel, spending $132,000 in the third quarter. However, a campaign aide told the Hill that Warren makes an effort to offset her carbon output and gave $10,150 to Native Energy in the third quarter.

An outline of the Democrat-backed Green New Deal, released this year, lamented the existence of cows and air travel but admitted that neither could be totally eliminated.

The outline stated:

We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast, but we think we can ramp up renewable manufacturing and power production, retrofit every building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul transportation and agriculture, plant lots of trees and restore our ecosystem to get to net-zero.

The excessive air travel of the candidates calls their authenticity into question.

Warren has called climate change an “existential crisis that threatens all of us” and called for “bold action now to stop it before it’s too late”:

Climate change is an existential crisis that threatens all of us—and we need to take bold action now to stop it before it's too late. That's why we need to have a #ClimateDebate. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) August 24, 2019

Biden – who spent nearly $1 million on private jet usage in a three-month span – warned that it is going to take “leadership” to combat the “climate crisis”:

It’s critical to have a plan to combat climate change, but it’s going to take more than plans — it’s going to take leadership. I have the experience and relationships necessary to rally the world to meet the urgency of this climate crisis. #ClimateTownHall pic.twitter.com/aXvhwUDHMq — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 5, 2019

Harris has called climate change an “imminent threat to our planet,” while Buttigieg warned that the threat “isn’t theoretical”:

Climate change is an imminent threat to our planet unless we correct course. It’s within our power to do so. Now is the time. pic.twitter.com/q1mToVv6GE — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) February 18, 2019

Climate change isn't theoretical. Parts of California are on fire, in Florida they're talking about sea level rise. In South Bend I had to activate the emergency operation center twice in two years: the first time was a 1000-year flood, the next was a 500-year flood. #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/xx7SFoImuv — Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) June 28, 2019

Sanders, who unveiled a $16 trillion climate change proposal in August, called President Trump an “idiot” for not taking climate change seriously:

Donald Trump believes climate change is a hoax. Donald Trump is an idiot. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) August 10, 2019

Nevertheless, critics argue that Democrats are demonstrating that they are not taking the matter seriously, as their actions do not always coincide with their rhetoric.

For instance, Democrats came under fire last month after attending the Polk County Democrats Steak Fry, which featured thousands of steaks. While climate change alarmists argue that red meat consumption is contributing to the “crisis,” several Democrat candidates happily assisted in grilling the juicy cuts of meat, despite some of the presidential hopefuls previously floating limiting beef consumption in order to curb the looming threat:

Here's the latest:

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo: 'I was on the phone call' with Trump and Ukrainian President

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo admitted Wednesday that he was on the July 25 phone call in which President Donald Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.

""I was on the phone call,"" Pompeo said Wednesday during a news conference in Rome with Italy's foreign minister.

Some key context: A whistleblower complaint released last week alleges Trump abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the 2020 election and that the White House took steps to cover it up. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.

A rough transcript released by the White House shows Trump repeatedly pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, Trump's potential 2020 political rival, and his son Hunter Biden.

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.

State Department inspector general requests urgent briefing on Ukraine with congressional staff

The State Department's inspector general on Tuesday requested an urgent briefing with senior congressional staff members after Pompeo pushed back on House Democratic demands to turn over documents related to Ukraine and to depose current and former State officials, according to sources briefed on the matter.

It remains unclear exactly what State Department Inspector General Steve Linick plans to provide Congress during the private briefing Wednesday.

Deposition for House impeachment investigation delayed

The aide said on Tuesday the testimony of former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, which had been scheduled for Wednesday, would now occur Oct. 11, following an agreement between the committee's and the former ambassador's counsel.

Three committees -- the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight panels -- have scheduled the depositions as part of their probe into whether Trump solicited help from a foreign government to dig up dirt on his political opponent.

Yovanovitch and Volker were two of the five depositions that the committees have scheduled during the next two weeks while Congress is on recess.

Giuliani hires a Watergate prosecutor as his attorney in impeachment inquiry

Florida attorney Jon Sale , who worked as an assistant prosecutor on the legal team investigating the Watergate scandal, is representing Giuliani in the matter of the congressional impeachment inquiry, both of them confirmed to CNN on Tuesday.

Giuliani was subpoenaed on Monday by the three committees in the House of Representatives investigating Trump's interactions with the Ukrainian government. The subpoena requests documents and correspondence from Giuliani related to Ukraine.

As a reminder, the whistleblower complaint labels Giuliani as ""central figure"" in the controversy. US officials were concerned, the whistleblower said, with Giuliani and his contacts with Ukrainian officials.

Key GOP senator breaks with Trump in saying the whistleblower 'ought to be heard out and protected'

Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chamber's most senior Republican and a longtime defender of whistleblowers, rebuked Trump on Tuesday when he said the whistleblower at the center of the impeachment inquiry ""appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected.""

His comments mark a clear departure from Trump and his allies, who in recent days have repeatedly maligned the whistleblower's motives and pushed to reveal the individual's identity.

Ukraine's President says he never met with Giuliani

""I never met Rudy Giuliani -- never. And never had any phone calls with him,"" Zelensky said Tuesday at a news conference in Kiev.

According to the White House transcript of the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky, the Ukrainian President said he was aware of Giuliani's efforts to uncover information that would help Trump politically, and Trump encouraged Zelensky to speak with his lawyer because Giuliani ""very much knows what's happening.""

Pompeo accuses House Democrats of intimidation and bullying over Ukraine controversy

""I'm concerned with aspects of the Committee's request that can be understood only as an attempt to intimidate, bully, & treat improperly the distinguished professionals of the Department of State, including several career FSOs,"" he tweeted.

The comments prompted House Democrats to issue a stark warning to the top US diplomat. The chairmen of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees told Pompeo that any effort to prevent those officials from speaking to Congress ""is illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry.""

CNN reported Monday that Pompeo was on Trump's July call with Zelensky despite previously denying knowledge of the whistleblower complaint.

More news around Washington

How Lindsey Graham's support for Trump -- a man he once called a 'jackass' -- has evolved

Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is one of Trump's most vociferous defenders on Capitol Hill, but it wasn't always like that. In fact, Graham called Trump ""crazy and a ""jackass"" four years ago when he was running in the GOP presidential primary.

At the time, Trump wasn't so kind to Graham either, calling him a ""nut job.""

""This guy Lindsey Graham, he's one of the dumbest human beings I have ever seen,"" Trump said at a rally in South Carolina. ""He starts hitting me, saying vicious things, ends up with 0%. He left in disgrace.""

Don't assume the Senate would *never* impeach Trump

With the House headed down a path that virtually guarantees Trump will be impeached, conventional wisdom has settled on the idea that the Republican-led Senate will never, ever, remove him from office.

And, well, it's true that the strong likelihood is that the Senate acquits Trump, CNN's Chris Cillizza writes.

But if the Trump presidency -- and the way in which he became President -- teaches us anything, it should be this: Never assume. Anything.

Fact-checking Trump's false claim that the US is the only country providing aid to Ukraine

Trump has offered several explanations to justify his decision to delay military aid to Ukraine, first suggesting he was worried about ""corruption,"" then claiming the delay was a mechanism to pressure other countries to contribute.

On September 23, Trump voiced his complaint to reporters alongside Polish President Andrzej Duda, asking, ""Why is it always the United States spending money?"" and ""I don't like it that it's only us.""

Facts First: The US is not ""the only one"" contributing aid to Ukraine. Germany and France have both sent millions of euros to Ukraine, along with other European nations.

Connected by subpoenas: Giuliani and his Ukrainian middleman Lev Parnas face increased scrutiny

Parnas, a Ukrainian American businessman who has been subpoenaed as part of the House impeachment inquiry, has spent thousands of dollars on Trump properties and donated to the main super PAC supporting the President's reelection effort, according to documents produced in an unrelated federal lawsuit.

Starting in November 2018, Parnas introduced Giuliani to former and current Ukrainian officials, according to Giuliani.

Financial records uncovered as a result of a lawsuit filed in federal court in Florida earlier this year show Parnas spent thousands of dollars at Trump hotels in the fall of 2018, donated hundreds of thousands to the pro-Trump super PAC and received checks from Ballard Partners, a lobbying firm with deep connections to the Trump White House.

The financial ties between Trump's world and Parnas raise new questions about the nature of Parnas' relationship with Giuliani and who was paying the former New York mayor and Parnas for their research on Ukraine."

He cautioned ahead of Tuesday evening’s debate that Democrat candidates need to tell voters how they will practically implement their lofty policy proposals.

Bloomberg wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post urging Democrat candidates to explain how they would make their grandiose proposals a reality.

The former mayor said it is likely the next president will face a “closely divided Congress.” Because of that, candidates need to explain how they would implement their ideas – such as Medicare for All and their multi-trillion-dollar Green New Deal proposals.

“Rarely are the candidates asked, and more rarely still do they talk about, how they would go about achieving their goals,” Bloomberg wrote.

“The fact is: A legislative proposal is only as good as the execution plan that accompanies it. And even the best plans must be flexible enough to accommodate necessary changes, to prevent the perfect from being the enemy of the good,” he continued.

He added:

The presidential aspirants are not short on big ideas. But voters must demand they explain how they intend to move from proposing plans to actually implementing them, including passing them through Congress. Those who dodge the question by speaking of revolution and the bully pulpit aren’t up to the job.

The op-ed follows reports of Bloomberg’s rumored reconsideration of a presidential bid. While he announced his intention of staying out of the presidential race due to the “difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field” in March, Biden’s slow and steady fall has the former mayor rethinking his decision.

Bloomberg has told associates that he is considering throwing his hat in the presidential ring of Biden drops out.

“Bloomberg is in if Biden is out,” a source, described as a “New York billionaire with ties to Bloomberg,” told CNBC.

As CNBC reported:

Bloomberg has signaled he’s “still looking at” running for president, but people close him say that the only way he could even go down that path is if Biden’s fortunes suffer so much that he drops out before or during the early stages of the primary. Bloomberg could then enter the race as one of the rare moderates with enough name recognition and campaign funding to make a run. Forbes estimates his net worth at $51 billion, and he was planning to spend over $100 million on a campaign for president if he ran.

While Biden has not signaled any intention to drop out of the race, his lackluster debate performance is not expected to elevate his position in the polls. The former vice president failed to have a breakout moment during the three-hour debate and experienced at least seven gaffes, mistakenly pronouncing exponentially as “expodentially,” mentioning Roe. v Wade before correcting himself to the subject of gun sales, and claiming that people are “clipping coupons in the stock market” during a discussion on the economy:

If Bloomberg does, in fact, jump into the presidential ring in coming months, he would likely face questions surrounding his recent praise of China– particularly that Chinese Communist Party chairman Xi Jinping is “not a dictator”:

271,"Brian Fung, CNN",,"A days-long feud between Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Facebook intensified over the weekend as Warren openly accused the company of ""taking money to promote lies.""",2019-10-13,CNN,Elizabeth Warren escalates Facebook ad feud,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/13/politics/elizabeth-warren-facebook-feud/index.html,"(CNN) A days-long feud between Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Facebook intensified over the weekend as Warren openly accused the company of ""taking money to promote lies.""

Warren, a leading Democratic 2020 candidate, has taken aim at the social media giant over its role in spreading disinformation against her and other candidates. Her campaign ran an ad on Facebook this past week that contained a deliberate lie to draw further attention to the issue.

That provocative move came after a recording leaked earlier this month of CEO Mark Zuckerberg telling employees that a Warren presidency would ""suck"" for the company.

Facebook fired back at Warren over the weekend via another social media platform, Twitter, where the company compared itself to broadcast television stations that ran the Trump ad and are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission.

The ""FCC doesn't want broadcast companies censoring candidates' speech,"" Facebook said in a tweet. ""We agree it's better to let voters -- not companies -- decide.""

The comparison opened the door to additional scrutiny of Facebook's role in handling political speech. Facebook declined to comment for this story.

In response, Warren said the company's decision to compare itself to heavily regulated broadcasters raised even more questions about how it should be managed.

""You're making my point here,"" she tweeted. ""It's up to you whether you take money to promote lies.""

The episode underscores how Facebook is trying to maintain its position as a neutral platform even as it acquires ever more influence over public discourse and information -- and as it seeks to address weaknesses that made it a vehicle for Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

Under current policy, Facebook exempts ads by politicians from third-party fact-checking -- a loophole, Warren says, that allows Zuckerberg to continue taking ""gobs of money"" from President Donald Trump's campaign despite Trump's ads telling untruths about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Trump's efforts to pursue unfounded claims about the Bidens are at the heart of the burgeoning impeachment inquiry facing the President.

The Warren fight over ads highlights the collapsing distinction between traditional broadcast media and 21st-century digital platforms, experts say, raising fresh questions about how decades-old regulations concerning political speech should apply to massive online platforms that can influence millions of voters.

And according to some legal analysts, it exposes the limits of Facebook's arguments that it is not a media company.

Beginning with the Radio Act of 1927, Congress mandated that radio stations, and later TV stations, cannot pick and choose which political candidates' ads to run.

Broadcasters may choose not to air political ads at all, though that is rare in today's media environment and the law still requires them to carry ads by federal candidates, said Harold Feld, senior vice president at the technology think tank Public Knowledge. But broadcasters that do accept political ads must air all advertisements from qualified candidates, without a view toward their truthfulness or accuracy.

Broadcasters can still decline to air political ads from non-candidates, such as political action committees. And none of these rules apply to cable networks, which is why CNN could legally decline to air the Trump ad.

Facebook's comparison to broadcasters raises difficult questions about whether it is appropriate to import rules meant for TV and radio stations to the internet, Feld said.

""We face the same choices that we had when radio and television were the big gatekeepers,"" he said. ""How much discretion do you want to give to these powerful shapers of public opinion while still being faithful to the principles of the First Amendment and letting the public decide?""

Broadcasters also obey a slew of other rules that companies such as Facebook do not, Feld said -- should Facebook have to comply with those as well?

For example, the government limits how many stations a media company may own in a particular market to limit anti-competitive behavior. Other FCC regulations require broadcasters to air a certain amount of children's programming, or to air sensitive content only after certain hours.

For a platform that targets content to users based on their interests and according to detailed data, reworking such rules for Facebook could be immensely complex and perhaps inadvisable, said Andrew Schwartzman, senior counselor to the Benton Foundation Institute for Broadband & Society, a civil society group.

""You can't apply that effectively, probably, to cable -- but certainly not to internet platforms,"" he said. ""It's just impossible.""

Facebook's reference to broadcasters also highlights a double standard. Schwartzman added that Facebook wants the benefit of the doubt afforded to regulated broadcasters, but ""without the responsibility of being a regulated broadcaster.""

Even those who have represented the broadcast industry say it is an odd and challenging position for Facebook to adopt.

""Facebook obviously doesn't want to be regulated like a broadcaster, so in a way it's strange they're citing this,"" said Jack Goodman, a former general counsel for the National Association of Broadcasters. ""Because they're not regulated, and they certainly don't want to be regulated.""

Warren's ads, which began running widely on Thursday, started with a bold but obvious falsehood: That Facebook and Zuckerberg had endorsed Trump's reelection campaign.

""You're probably shocked,"" read the ad, which reached tens of thousands of viewers nationwide. ""And you might be thinking, 'how could this possibly be true?' Well, it's not.""

On Saturday, Warren explained her ad was meant ""to see just how far"" the policy goes.

""We intentionally made a Facebook ad with false claims and submitted it to Facebook's ad platform to see if it'd be approved,"" she tweeted. ""It got approved quickly."""

Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday detailed a new environmental justice plan aimed at bolstering and protecting vulnerable communities on the front lines of the climate crisis.

""Our crisis of environmental injustice is the result of decades of discrimination and environmental racism compounding in communities that have been overlooked for too long,"" Warren writes in a Medium post.

The Massachusetts Democrat would direct one-third of her proposed climate investment to the most vulnerable communities, which she writes would funnel at least $1 trillion into those areas over the next decade.

Warren's Wednesday release offers new insight into how she would use presidential powers to orchestrate what climate activists often call a ""just transition"" toward a green energy economy. While covering a broad range of policy issues, the post is primarily focused on what her administration would do to prioritize neighborhoods, cities and entire regions with heavy minority populations -- many of them still suffering from the effects of racist policies like redlining, which often placed families of color in harm's way.

Throughout her campaign, Warren has frequently sought to weave in detailed proposals directed specifically at communities of color. Here, she warns that ""'one-size-fits-all' solutions,"" though often well-intentioned, open up space for the exploitation of those minorities and the poor. Because of that, Warren argues, more narrowly ""targeted"" policies are required.

(CNN) Within the first 10 minutes of Tuesday's fourth presidential debate, you could tell something fundamental had changed in the race: Elizabeth Warren is the new front-runner.

The Massachusetts senator was attacked from all sides from the get-go -- on how she planned to fund her ""Medicare for All"" plan, on the ""punitive"" nature of her policy solutions, and on her supposed claims to be the only one in the field who had bold ideas.

By our count, at least seven other candidates on the stage attacked Warren at some point during the three-hour debate. That dynamic ensured that the fourth debate wouldn't be as successful for Warren as the previous three -- no one can take that amount of incoming and emerge unscathed -- but also proved, very clearly, that no matter what the polls show, her rivals believe her to be the one to beat in this race.

We've reflected that changed reality in our latest 2020 rankings. Below, the 10 men and women with the best chance of emerging as the Democratic nominee in 2020.

278,"Eric Bradner, Dan Merica and Gregory Krieg, CNN",,"Polls show that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is now a front-runner for the 2020 Democratic nomination. And on Tuesday night in Ohio, her 11 rivals acted like it.",2019-10-16,CNN,7 takeaways from the debate,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/16/politics/october-democratic-debate-highlights/index.html,"Westerville, Ohio (CNN) Polls show that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is now a front-runner for the 2020 Democratic nomination . And on Tuesday night in Ohio, her 11 rivals acted like it.

The party's fourth presidential debate , hosted by CNN and The New York Times, showcased the shifting dynamics of the Democratic primary. Warren was under attack all night -- though it's far from clear whether anyone dented her status at the top of the field. Former Vice President Joe Biden , the other front-runner, stayed out of the fray for much of the event -- until a late clash with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders that featured the same one-on-one, progressive-against-moderate battle that defined the 2016 Democratic contest.

And moderate candidates -- some, like South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, fighting to climb into the top tier; others, like Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, just desperate to make the next debate stage -- dropped the euphemisms and pressed their progressive foes in direct and sometimes personal terms.

Here are seven takeaways from Tuesday night's debate:

Warren under attack for the first time

JUST WATCHED Warren attacked from all sides on the debate stage Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Warren attacked from all sides on the debate stage 02:42

Warren's months-long march to the front of the polls finally put her in the position of being the most heavily targeted and scrutinized candidate on stage.

Buttigieg and Klobuchar led the charge, assailing Warren over her answers on health care.

Warren supports Sanders' proposal for ""Medicare for All"" -- replacing private insurance with everyone receiving coverage through a government-run plan. And while Sanders has acknowledged that Americans' taxes would need to increase to pay for the plan, Warren refused to say whether the middle class's taxes would go up -- instead only saying that, because deductibles, premiums and co-pays would be eliminated, overall costs would decrease.

Buttigieg accused her of dodging a yes-or-no question. ""Your signature is to have a plan for everything, except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this plan that Sen. Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in,"" he said.

Klobuchar accused Warren of being dishonest. ""We owe it to the American people to tell them where we will send the invoice,"" she said.

Warren later addressed the question of taxes, when former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke asked her -- during a discussion about Warren's proposed wealth tax and child care coverage -- whether she would raise middle-class taxes. ""No,"" she said -- but the moment was mostly lost amid cross-talk.

Bernie Sanders won the night

And it had nothing to do with what happened on stage.

In the debate's final moments, the Washington Post broke the news that New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez plans to endorse Sanders. CNN then reported that two other members of the ""Squad,"" Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar and Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, will do the same.

The pick-ups are huge. Some Democratic strategists think that outside of the Obamas, Ocasio-Cortez represents the most influential potential endorsement of the 2020 primary race.

It also comes at a key moment for Sanders. Warren's months-long ascent, fueled in part by progressives as she advocated some similar policies to Sanders, was on display Tuesday night, when the rest of the field treated her as the front-runner. If Ocasio-Cortez had supported her, it could have been the beginning of the end of Sanders' chances.

Instead, he gets a major injection of energy -- and sends the signal that he's far from done yet.

Echoes of 2016 as the front-runners fight

JUST WATCHED Warren takes a jab at Biden while complimenting Obama Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Warren takes a jab at Biden while complimenting Obama 01:41

For most of the night, as Warren wore the biggest target, Biden slipped into the background. That changed near the end of the debate, when the field's top tier -- Biden, Warren and Sanders -- finally unloaded on each other.

The question that loomed over their: Biden has a lengthy record -- but is it one that's in line with where the Democratic electorate is now?

It began when Biden touted his record in former President Barack Obama's administration, pressuring Republicans to vote for measures such as the federal stimulus package.

""We all have good ideas. The question is who is going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done?"" Biden said. ""And I'm not suggesting they can't, but I'm suggesting that's what we should look at.""

That's when Sanders pounced, attacking Biden -- in a moment that felt similar to the Vermont senator's 2016 debates with Hillary Clinton -- over legislation Biden had supported and Sanders opposed over the last three decades.

""Joe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done. But you know what, you also got done, and I say this as a good friend,"" Sanders said. ""You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle class families all over this country. You got trade agreements like NAFTA and (trade relations) with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs.""

Then Warren jumped in.

Responding to Biden's assertion that he is best able to get things done, she pointed to her role in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Obama administration.

Seemingly miffed to be denied a share of the credit, Biden interjected, nearly shouting, ""I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it, so let's get those things straight, too.""

Warren responded by thanking Obama -- but notably omitting Biden.

""I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law,"" she said.

Trouble for Biden?

For the former vice president, fading into the background of a debate is a troubling sign because of what it suggests: that his foes view him as less of a threat than they once did.

But just as the good news had come late for Sanders, the real bad news for Biden's campaign came even later Wednesday night.

In a scheduling oddity, reports covering the third quarter of 2019 were due in to the Federal Election Commission by midnight -- an hour after the debate ended.

Biden's report revealed that his campaign ended September with just $9 million on hand. That's far short of Sanders' $33.7 million, Warren's $25.7 million and Buttigieg's $23.4 million -- and is even below California Sen. Kamala Harris' $10.5 million.

A more aggressive Buttigieg

JUST WATCHED Buttigieg to O'Rourke: I don't need lessons from you Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Buttigieg to O'Rourke: I don't need lessons from you 03:29

The South Bend, Indiana, mayor had made it obvious he planned to come out swinging. In the days before the debate, he'd launched an ad that was critical of Warren and Sanders over Medicare for All, criticized Warren's grassroots fundraising strategy for the general election as being reliant on ""pocket change,"" and attacked O'Rourke over his support for mandatory buy-backs of assault-style rifles in an interview on Snapchat's ""Good Luck America.""

The exchanges with Warren over health care might be the night's most memorable.

But he also got a chance to tout an element of his own biography -- his military service -- in clashing with Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, the only other military veteran in the field, over her call to end ""endless wars.""

""The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this President of American allies and American values,"" he said.

Buttigieg also sharply criticized O'Rourke -- at one point, in personal terms -- over the former Texas congressman's proposed mandatory buy-backs of assault-style rifles.

""You just made it clear that you don't know how this is going to take weapons off the street,"" he said. ""If you can develop the plan further, we can have a debate. But we can't wait.""

O'Rourke responded that mass shootings are a ""crisis"" and that Democrats should make the case for farther-reaching gun control measures. ""Let's decide what we are going to believe in, what we are going to achieve, and let's bring this country together in order to do that,"" he said.

Buttigieg shot back: ""The problem isn't the polls, the problem is the policy. And I don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.""

""I don't care what that meant to me or my candidacy,"" O'Rourke replied. But to survivors of gun violence, and March For Our Lives, the gun control advocacy group founded by students after the Parkland, Florida, shooting last year, ""that was a slap in the face to every single one of those groups,"" he said. Moments later, the organization tweeted praise for O'Rourke's position.

Klobuchar, unleashed

With the Democratic National Committee raising its fundraising and polling thresholds for the November debate, Klobuchar walked on stage facing the real possibility that this debate could be her last.

Her response: Go hard at the Democratic primary's most ascendant candidate, Warren.

""The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done,"" she said of Warren at one point, as she criticized her support for Medicare for All.

Klobuchar's performance on Tuesday stands in stark contrast to her first three debate performances, which were more muted.

And there is a reason for that: After qualifying for the first four debates, Klobuchar is on the verge of not qualifying for the fifth Democratic debate in November. While Klobuchar has the required number of donors, she has yet to reach the polling threshold, something that her team believes she can boost with a well-reviewed debate.

Then there's the portion of her approach that's in the eye of the beholder: One of her trademarks as a candidate -- goofy humor -- continued on Tuesday night.

""Vladimir Putin is someone who has shot down planes over Ukraine, who has poisoned his opponent and we have not talked about what we need to do to protect ourselves from Russia invading our election,"" Klobuchar said. ""This wasn't meddling. That's what I do when I call my daughter on a Saturday night and ask her what she's doing.""

Yang's 'Freedom Dividend' gets an airing

Andrew Yang launched his presidential campaign in 2017 with a plan to give every American $1,000 a month to combat job losses and automation -- and very little attention from media and voters.

Almost two years later, Yang's plan for a universal basic income, which he's calling a ""freedom dividend,"" remains his signature policy proposal. But his impact on the race has increased dramatically -- a reality that was on display on Tuesday night when the candidates on stage debated a universal basic income and job losses to automation in depth on national television.

""We have a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month, it recognizes the work in our families and communities. It helps all Americans transition,"" Yang said. ""When we put the money into our hands, we can build a trickle up economy from our people, our families and our communities up. It will enable us to do the work that we want to do. This is the sort of vision in response to the fourth industrial revolution that we have to embrace.""

Yang has talked about his universal basic income at previous debates. What made Tuesday different was that other candidates -- some of whom largely ignored Yang in previous debates -- began to seriously debate automation and a basic income.

""I believe that we need to address a community being impacted by automation,"" said former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro.

""I agree with my friend Andrew Yang. Universal basic income is a good idea to help provide that security so people can make choices that they want to see,"" Gabbard said.

But what clearly cemented Yang's rise is that the debate over universal basic income got him into a direct argument with Warren, who said the issue is broader.

After the debate, Yang told CNN that Warren -- who, with Biden, is at the top of the Democratic field -- had asked him to send her details on his proposal. ""She said she wanted to see the data,"" he said."

“Too many immigrants have died in ICE custody,” Warren said. “We need to ensure asylum seekers are welcomed, treated humanely, receive the medical care they need, and are not detained unnecessarily. I have a plan to rebuild a more humane immigration system.”

Warren’s statement came in response to a report that a Cameroon national detained by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency had died while in custody. Unmentioned, though, is that migrant deaths under the Trump administration are 20 percent lower than the rate of migrant deaths under former President Obama.

The promise is just the latest remark where Warren has promoted the donor-class platform of hemispheric open borders between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, as well as Central and South America. The same position has been accepted by the billionaire Koch brothers donor network, failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and the big business lobby.

On Sunday, Warren told American union workers that increasing foreign competition against them in the labor market by giving amnesty to the roughly 11 to 22 million illegal aliens living in the U.S. would be “good” for them.

“[Amnesty for all illegal aliens] is good for all workers, and we need to get them into our unions,” Warren said.

High levels of immigration, illegal and legal, put downward pressure on U.S. wages while redistributing about $500 billion in wealth away from America’s working and middle class and towards employers and new arrivals, research by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine has found.

Research by analyst Steven Camarotta has found that every one percent increase in the immigrant portion of American workers’ occupations reduces their weekly wages by about 0.5 percent. This means the average native-born American worker today has his weekly wages reduced by perhaps 8.5 percent because of current legal immigration levels.

While Warren seeks to increase foreign competition against American workers, President Trump has pursued policy initiatives to decrease foreign competition, increasing U.S. wages and giving American workers leverage over businesses.

""I have a lot of respect for Senator Warren, but last night she was more specific and forthcoming about the number of selfies she's taken than about how this plan is going to be funded.

Buttigieg was among several Democratic presidential candidates who took aim at Warren during the fourth Democratic primary debate hosted CNN and The New York Times on Tuesday night. He has criticized Warren over her support for Medicare for All and criticized her again during the debate for not directly answering a ""yes-or-no"" question on how she would fund such a proposal.

Warren supports Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' proposed plan, which would create a national government-run health care program and eliminate the private insurance industry -- something several candidates criticized during the debate.

Buttigieg, who has fashioned himself as a centrist candidate as the Democratic Party has veered leftward, was among the Democrats onstage Tuesday night who challenged Warren, who has emerged as a front-runner in the 2020 field. The Massachusetts senator was constantly on defense throughout the debate, underscoring a marked shift in the Democratic race that has been underway for many weeks: while former Vice President Joe Biden has remained strong in the polls, the other candidates in the race clearly now see Warren as the real competition.

Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday released a new plan outlining how she would use the revenue generated by her proposed tax on ""excessive lobbying"" to beef up federal agencies charged with regulating major industries.

""This tax will reduce the incentive for excessive lobbying, and raise money that we can use to fight back against this kind of onslaught when it occurs,"" Warren wrote in a Medium post explaining the strategy.

First unveiled in broad strokes last month , Warren's plan would impose a 35% tax on lobbying expenditures between $500,000 and $1 million. The cost would escalate from there, with a 60% rate placed on every dollar beyond $1 million that rises to 75% once a company's lobbying costs surpass $5 million.

The proposal represents the newest piece of Warren's broad anti-corruption platform, which she has made central to her candidacy. It is the subject matter that Warren is most fluent in discussing and passionate about on the trail, where she often jokes that the ""good news"" is she has ""the biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate,"" before waiting a beat and adding: ""Here's the bad news, we need the biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate.""

In this chapter of her wider agenda, Warren stresses that the issue goes beyond Congress, lawmakers and the ""revolving door"" between Capitol Hill and K Street -- and addresses lobbyist influence on regulatory bodies.

She was open, when asked, about her affection and appreciation for both Democratic candidates. A decision, if it was going to come at all, wasn't expected until later this year.

""To preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached,"" the former vice president said of the current White House occupant, adding: ""He's shooting holes in the Constitution. And we cannot let him get away with it.""

Biden had previously indicated that he favored considering impeachment for Trump only if the administration refused to turn over documents to Congress related to the ongoing Ukraine investigation. On Tuesday night, the White House made clear they would not cooperate in any way with the House impeachment probe.

On its face then, Biden's hand was forced by the White House's decision not to cooperate at all. And that undoubtedly was a factor! But so likely did this fact: In four of the last five national polls aggregated by Real Clear Politics, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren takes a larger share of the national primary vote than Biden. And for the first time in this race, Warren's polling average is now above Biden's -- albeit by .2 percentage points.

What those numbers mean is that Biden is really starting to feel the heat from Warren. While she has been rising in polls for months now, it's become clear of late that she isn't slowing down much, even as she approaches and passes Biden, who has been the race's frontrunner since the day he announced his candidacy."
285,"Analysis by Harry Enten, CNN",,First things first: The theme song of the week is the closing credits to Timon & Pumbaa.,2019-10-12,CNN,"Why it's Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and then everybody else",https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/12/politics/joe-biden-elizabeth-warren-polls/index.html,"A new Fox News poll of Democratic primary voters nationwide finds that 32% want former Vice President Joe Biden to be the Democratic presidential nominee in 2020. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren comes in at 22%. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders stands at 17%. No one else polls better than 5%.

An average of polls taken since the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump began have Biden at 29%, Warren at 25%, Sanders at 15% and no one else above 5%.

What's the point: Right now, there's little doubt that Biden and Warren are the top tier in the Democratic primary fight. With the exception of Sanders, no one is even close to Biden and Warren nationally. The question now is how likely are we to be looking at the potential nominee when focusing on the top three at this point.

A look back at history suggests there is a high likelihood that either Biden, Sanders or Warren will be the Democratic nominee.

There have been 16 primaries in the modern era in which an incumbent was not running in said primary. For those 16, I looked at the polling averages for each candidate who ultimately ran or was running in the second half of the year before the primary. These averages were calculated by FiveThirtyEight

There have been a number of candidates not close to leading in the polls at this point who went on to win the nomination. A trailing candidate has gone on to win 7 of 16 times (44%). You may recall Barack Obama was trailing Hillary Clinton at this point in the 2008 Democratic primary. Of course, Obama was running second to Clinton.

When you look outside the top three polling candidates in past primaries, there really hasn't been a lot of success. Only three times has a candidate not in the top three at this point won a nomination. Those were George McGovern in 1972, Jimmy Carter in 1976 and John Kerry in 2004.

Another way to look at this is to look at the percentage everyone was polling at. When the leader in the national polls in the second half of the year before the primary was at greater than 20% (12 times), there has been just one instance of someone polling below 15% going on to win the nomination: McGovern in 1972. And even he was polling at 6%, which is greater than all the Democrats outside of the top three at this point in the 2020 cycle.

We can formalize this analysis through a simple model looking at where candidates were polling and whether they won the nomination. When one candidate is polling at about 30% and another is polling at about 25% in contests with no incumbent running, together they have about 75% chance of winning the nomination. Add in a candidate polling at about 15%, the chance that one of the top three wins is about 85%.

Indeed, the average of our three statistical exercises suggest there's about an 85% chance Biden, Warren or Sanders wins the nomination.

This means that the national polls indicate the chance that someone not named Biden, Sanders or Warren wins the nomination is about 15%.

Now, 15% isn't nothing. It leaves open the possibility that one of the candidates at 5% or below may end up strongly challenging for the nomination. The fact that there are so many of them this year perhaps heightens the chance of a non-top three polling candidate wins this year. Perhaps, it will be someone like South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is polling very close to the top three in Iowa

Still, the most likely outcome is that the Democratic nominee will be Biden, Sanders or Warren, with Biden and Warren having particularly strong chances."

W. Norton. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) If there's one thing that seems to scare Mark Zuckerberg to the bone, it's the threat of a functional government that represents the interests of its citizens. To him, government appears to be the faceless bureaucracy that slaps him on the wrist with a $5 billion fine when his company spies too much or too illegally on his users.

So when one of his employees asked him at an open meeting what he thought of Elizabeth Warren, Zuck was uncharacteristically candid -- as if triggered by the mere thought of the possibility that someone with so much faith in the power of big government could become our chief executive. She ""thinks the right answer is to break up the companies,"" he said . And even though he believes he would win a legal battle against the US government, he added, ""Does that still suck for us? Yes.""

Considering the company's actions over the past couple of years, this is a battle Zuckerberg has been anticipating and preparing for. Ever since the suggestion of breaking up Facebook was raised at the infamous congressional hearings Zuckerberg underwent in April 2018, he has been effectively circling the wagons.

Facebook's greatest vulnerability is the fact that it's not just one company, but a collection of different platforms and technologies they've purchased over the years. Breaking them up is as simple as, well, separating out these acquisitions. That's why his first move after Congress began asking questions was to integrate his various messaging platforms -- Instagram, WhatsApp -- into the Facebook platform. He argued that this was to offer greater interoperability and convenience. The real reason for such integration was to pre-empt any efforts to split up the company along its obvious fault lines.

Shortly after, Facebook announced it was going to launch a new cryptocurrency, already branded with a freedom-from-tyranny inspiring name, the ""Libra."" It has been widely assumed that Facebook's 2.4-billion user base would give the currency an instant edge over bitcoin and everybody else, perhaps even becoming a default global currency.

So, the new question becomes, will Zuckerberg peg the Libra on the dollar, supporting the United States' role as the world's most central banker? Or will the company base the Libra's value on a commodity, a basket of currencies, or something else entirely? The mere suggestion of such plans gives Facebook leverage over the government that might undertake to control it.

Would Zuckerberg really think and act this way? Of course he would. After all, as he told his gathering of employees, he's the one who sees this as a life-or-death battle: ""At the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.""

That's actually a scary thought to me. Facebook screwed up our 2016 elections -- and, arguably, civil society -- by serving as the unintentional conduit for divisive propaganda from near and far.

In a 2018 blog post , Facebook detailed how it planned to better prepare for future elections, which included identifying and removing fake accounts. So Facebook will begin using its employees' and AI's ""judgment"" to determine what sorts of messaging is appropriate for us.

Imagine how much influence the platform could have if its founder really perceived one of the candidates as an existential threat. Do we want to see what an election looks like where Facebook is actively involved, fighting for its life?

What Zuckerberg doesn't get is that Elizabeth Warren isn't simply protecting America from Facebook, but Facebook from itself. While government is responsible for making sure companies don't compete in unfair ways or infringe on people's basic civil liberties, it is also responsible for providing businesses with safe monetary and legal systems through which to operate.

As Warren tweeted , ""What would really 'suck' is if we don't fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.""

Breaking up Facebook is far from the worst thing that could happen to the company. That would likely play out like the brooms in the Sorcerer's Apprentice, where each piece of the company animates and grows into its own threat to privacy and democracy. Instead of being bitten by a single great white shark, we get consumed by a thousand piranhas.

No, the real nightmare for Zuckerberg is not being broken up, but being regulated. And the more Facebook integrates its various pieces into one big platform, the easier it will be to monitor, legislate and penalize.

Regulation may be less dramatic than a breakup, but it's also more effective and ongoing. A living and perpetual responsibility. Facebook could grow so big and ubiquitous, it might even become a utility -- publicly owned and operated.

With her penchant for big government and detailed plans, Elizabeth Warren may be the only candidate willing to finally parent and discipline petulant CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg, who too easily mistake corporate power for personal liberty."

Elizabeth Warren seeks to put the social media giant on the defensive — by telling a lie.,2019-10-11,CNN,Elizabeth Warren targets Facebook's ad policy -- with a Facebook ad,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/11/politics/elizabeth-warren-facebook-ad/index.html,"(CNN) A fresh series of Facebook ads this week by Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren seeks to put the social media giant on the defensive — by telling a lie.

The ads, which began running widely on Thursday, start with a bold but obvious falsehood: That Facebook and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg have endorsed President Trump's reelection campaign.

""You're probably shocked,"" reads the ad, which has already reached tens of thousands of viewers nationwide. ""And you might be thinking, 'how could this possibly be true?' Well, it's not.""

The ad's own admission of a lie seeks to draw attention to a controversial Facebook policy Warren has spent days criticizing. Under the policy, Facebook exempts ads by politicians from third-party fact-checking — a loophole, Warren says, that allows Zuckerberg to continue taking ""gobs of money"" from Trump's campaign despite Trump's ads telling untruths about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.

On Saturday, Warren explained her ad was meant ""to see just how far"" the policy goes.

""We intentionally made a Facebook ad with false claims and submitted it to Facebook's ad platform to see if it'd be approved,"" she tweeted. ""It got approved quickly.""

Facebook's willingness to run the ad, she said, shows how the company prioritizes profits over protecting democracy.

Warren's escalating criticism of Zuckerberg highlights the backlash Facebook has faced as it has defended its policy on political advertising. Sen. Amy Klobuchar , another Democratic candidate, tweeted on Thursday that online platforms like Facebook need a ""truth standard for paid ads."" And Biden's campaign has compared Trump's ads to Russian-backed disinformation.

""Whether it originates from the Kremlin or Trump Tower, these lies and conspiracy theories threaten to undermine the integrity of our elections in America,"" Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo said on Tuesday.

In a statement Friday responding to Warren's ad, Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone said the company believes political speech should be protected.

""If Senator Warren wants to say things she knows to be untrue, we believe Facebook should not be in the position of censoring that speech,"" Stone said.

Facebook's policy on truthfulness in political ads has been in place for over a year, according to Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global affairs and communications. In a recent speech, Clegg said Facebook demotes third-party content shared by politicians on its platform if it has been previously debunked by fact-checkers and rejects its inclusion in advertisements. That could include links, photos or videos created by others. But it does not cover misleading ads or other content created under politicians' own names.

The Warren ad puts Facebook in a challenging position, said Dave Karpf, an associate professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University.

""Either Facebook doesn't touch the ad and the ad is therefore noteworthy, or they touch the ad and it's noteworthy,"" he said. ""It's a smart tactical move.""

Warren has become one of Facebook's key antagonists after first calling for it and other Silicon Valley giants — such as Amazon, Google and Apple — to be broken up. But her rift with Facebook deepened after leaked audio published by The Verge revealed Zuckerberg fretting about the potential consequences of a Warren presidency.

""If she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,"" Zuckerberg is heard saying at a companywide meeting. ""And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. ... But look, at the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.""

Warren responded via Twitter, ""What would really 'suck' is if we don't fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.

And earlier this week, she said Facebook ""already helped elect Donald Trump once. Now, they're deliberately allowing a candidate to intentionally lie to the American people.""

Other analysts say Facebook has made the right decision not to involve itself in regulating political speech. Lee Goodman, a former Republican chairman of the Federal Elections Commission, told CNBC Thursday that he believed Facebook's policy is ""fair"" because it ""doesn't want to be the arbiter and doesn't want to take sides in these political debates.""

Shannon McGregor, an assistant professor of communication at the University of Utah who has studied the impact of tech platforms on political speech, agreed that Facebook's policy provides greater transparency about its role in political discourse.

But she added that Facebook's efforts to remain neutral — particularly now, with respect to Warren — could itself affect the course of the 2020 campaign.

""The limits of what our political discourse is these days is, of course, largely shaped by these platforms where a lot of these politics happen,"" she said."

Her rising 2020 polling numbers are also striking fear in the heart of Big Oil.,2019-10-17,CNN,How Elizabeth Warren could 'vaporize' America's oil boom,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/17/business/elizabeth-warren-oil-fracking-ban/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Elizabeth Warren doesn't just pose a threat to Wall Street. Her rising 2020 polling numbers are also striking fear in the heart of Big Oil.

Warren, currently the odds-on favorite to be the Democratic presidential nominee, wants to ban fracking ""everywhere."" And the Massachusetts senator pledged to immediately sign an executive order to stop all new offshore drilling leases. Both steps go further than her main rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.

It would be wildly bullish for crude oil prices. We'd be heading back to triple-digit prices very fast.""

Warren's aggressive plan for fighting the climate crisis could have profound consequences for the oil and gas industry. Although an outright fracking ban seems unlikely to get through Congress and the courts, such a move would halt America's historic shale oil boom in its tracks, drive up gasoline prices, threaten good-paying jobs and make the nation more dependent on foreign oil.

""It would vaporize the oil and gas boom in the United States,"" said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, a consulting firm that advises energy companies and investors. ""There is palpable concern in the oil and gas industry.""

Wall Street analysts are already warning shareholders about the potential hit to the share prices of oil companies, which remain widely held in portfolios despite the climate crisis.

Pioneer Natural Resources PXD ExxonMobil XOM Chevron CVX ""We think the greatest risk to energy companies would occur if Democratic candidate Elizabeth Warren wins,"" RBC Capital Markets wrote in a report published on Monday. The firm said it would be ""very bearish"" for a wide range of oil companies, including drillers such as, oilfield service firms and even integrated companies likeand

Warren's campaign declined to comment. But the candidate has defended her aggressive stance by arguing the world doesn't have the luxury of playing it safe.

""Taking bold action to confront the climate crisis is as important — and as urgent — as anything else the next president will face. We cannot wait,"" Warren wrote in a Medium post last month.

The best-case scenario for the oil industry could be the reelection of President Donald Trump, a climate skeptic who has actively supported the fossil fuel industry by slashing environmental regulations and promoting energy exports.

Democrats have taken a much more skeptical approach towards Big Oil than Trump as they pledge to tackle climate change. The leading candidates have called for ending fossil fuel subsidies

Besides Warren, Democratic presidential nominees Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker have also pushed to ban fracking , the controversial drilling technique that involves shooting water, sand and other compounds underground to release trapped oil and gas. Fracking has sparked concerns of contaminated drinking water, methane emissions and even earthquakes.

That's why environmental groups strongly support a fracking ban.

""A clean energy economy built to tackle the climate crisis cannot include fracked gas, which is a bridge to climate disaster,"" Ariel Hayes, national political director at the Sierra Club, said in a statement to CNN Business.

'Wildly bullish' for oil prices

Fracking, which gained popularity in the early 2000s, has made the United States the world's leading producer of natural gas and, more recently, the top oil producer . In 2016, fracking accounted for more than two-thirds of all oil and natural gas wells drilled in the United States, according to the Energy Information Administration

Driven by the shale revolution, US oil production has more than doubled over the past decade to about 12 million barrels per day. That surge of oil has cushioned the blow from recent events, including oil barrels sidelined by the attack on Saudi Aramco and US sanctions on Iran and Venezuela.

An outright fracking ban would probably send crude oil prices soaring because the United States produces more oil than any other country on the planet. The world is relying on US oil shale oil as the main source of growth for the next several years.

""It would be wildly bullish for crude oil prices. We'd be heading back to triple-digit prices very fast,"" said McNally, a former energy official under President George W. Bush.

Oil jobs at risk

But it wouldn't be bullish for the oil industry. That's because the fracking ban would probably cause highly leveraged US shale oil producers to go bankrupt, or at least have limited financial firepower to take advantage of high prices.

""They will have been regulated out of business,"" McNally said. ""And the US oil companies that remain will get blamed for high oil prices.""

A fracking ban could wipe out countless good-paying jobs in the oil and gas industry.

""You'd have layoffs, everything from the field hands up to the C-Suite,"" said Jeff Bush, president of oil and gas recruiting firm CSI Recruiting.

A 2017 study paid for by the American Petroleum Institute found that a fracking ban would cause the loss of nearly 6 million jobs and lift household energy spending by $4,500 a year.

Warren has pledged to create new jobs to help workers who are hurt by the transition to a greener economy.

Senator Elizabeth Warren has pledged to immediately put a stop to new fossil fuel leases for drilling offshore and on public lands.

""We will no longer force workers to make the impossible choice between fossil fuel industry jobs with superior wages and benefits and green economy jobs that pay far less,"" Warren wrote in the Medium post.

A fracking ban might not have a large impact on prices if oil demand weakened because of a rapid shift towards electric vehicles

However, most forecasters expect the world's appetite for oil will rise for many years, if not decades. And even Warren's own energy plan doesn't call for 100% zero emissions for new vehicles until 2030.

That means diminished domestic oil production would likely make America more dependent on foreign crude, undoing its strides toward energy independence.

""It's not going to reduce consumption,"" said Bush. ""It just means we'd be buying more oil from overseas. I don't think anybody wants that.""

An outright fracking ban also would require an act of Congress, according to analysts.

Such legislation would be unlikely to get through Congress because Republicans are widely expected to maintain control of the Senate. Even if the Senate flipped, moderate Democrats in oil-producing states such as Colorado and New Mexico would face pressure to oppose such a ban.

""There is no real clean path towards a fracking ban,"" said Josh Price, senior analyst at Height Capital Markets. ""It seems completely unrealistic, close to impossible.""

Federal drilling ban could slow oil boom

Still, Warren could take regulatory and executive actions aimed at discouraging fracking.

For instance, RBC said Warren would probably be able to ban fracking and all output on federal lands. Oil output on federal lands is about 2.7 million barrels per day, or 22% of total output.

If such a ban took effect in early 2021, it would slash US oil production by about 300,000 barrels per day that year, RBC said. And by 2025, the firm's US oil production forecast would decline by 1.2 million barrels per day.

The loss of US barrels would drive global oil prices $5 to $10 higher, lifting gasoline prices by 10 cents to 25 cents a gallon, according to RBC. And federal oil and gas revenue would tumble by up to $20 billion.

In sum, even though energy investors might respond negatively to a Warren victory, her proposed crackdown on Big Oil would face enormous challenges, from court fights and economic pressure to a potential political backlash.

""The market could overreact,"" RBC analysts wrote, ""which may provide fundamental buying opportunities.""

In other words, Warren's bark may be tougher than her bite, at least when it comes to oil."

The poll – which surveyed 423 registered New Hampshire voters likely to vote in the Democrat primary from September 25-29, 2019 – showed Warren leading the primary field with 25 percent support and Biden on her heels with 24 percent support. Sanders, however, struggled to keep up, falling to a distant third place with just 11 percent support.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) came in fourth place, just one point behind the socialist senator, with ten percent support. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) tumbled to fifth place, failing to garner double digits in the Granite State, seeing just five percent support.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MI) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) saw three percent support, followed by Andrew Yang (D) and Tom Steyer (D), who garnered two percent support each. The remaining candidates saw one percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.8 percent:

New Hampshire Institute of Politics Executive Director Neil Levesque highlighted the sense of “fluidity” in the race, due to the fact that “65% of Warren supporters, 72% of Biden supporters, 56% of Sanders supporters, and 73% of Buttigieg voters indicate that they expect that their choice could change between now and the primary election.”

Levesque added:

Among voters who are not firm in their choice, Warren is the 2nd choice of 26%, well ahead of Biden with 12%, Buttigieg with 11%, Sanders with 7% and Harris with 7%. This suggests that when the field begins to winnow down, Warren may in the best position to pick up other candidates’ support. However, if this turns into a two-person race, the nomination may ultimately turn on what sort of candidate Democrats want to send against Donald Trump: one that they believe would make the best president, or one that they believe has the best chance of beating him. If the former, Warren has a clear 27% to 19% advantage over Biden on the question of whom respondents think would make the best President. However, Biden is seen as the strongest nominee against Trump by 37% of voters compared to Warren with 26%. As in our April poll, Warren leads Biden among ‘extremely interested’ and ‘very liberal’ voters, at 28% – 24% and 35% – 11% respectively.

The poll spells trouble for Sanders, who has been slipping in New Hampshire, as recent polls indicate.

A Monmouth Poll released last Tuesday showed a similar trend, with Warren edging out Biden (27 percent to 25 percent) and leading Sanders – who garnered 12 percent support – by double digits:

Reports emerged of a staffer shakeup for the Sanders campaign last month. The Sanders campaign moved presidential campaign operations state director Joe Caiazzo from New Hampshire to Massachusetts and replaced him with Shannon Jackson, who served as a senior adviser during Sanders’ 2016 presidential bid and ran his Senate reelection campaign.

While the Sanders campaign continues to reconfigure and strategize on how to win over New Hampshire as it did in 2016, the campaign reported a monstrous $25.3 million received in the third quarter, signaling that his campaign is in it for the long haul."
290,"MJ Lee, CNN Political Correspondent",,"Elizabeth Warren and her husband, Bruce Mann, were sitting down together for their first joint interview of the 2020 campaign in their home in Cambridge.",2019-10-02,CNN,"Elizabeth Warren's husband explains how their dog, Bailey, sent him to the ER",https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/01/politics/elizabeth-warren-dog-bailey/index.html,"Cambridge, Massachusetts (CNN) Elizabeth Warren and her husband, Bruce Mann, were sitting down together for their first joint interview of the 2020 campaign in their home in Cambridge.

In the middle of the interview, Mann got stuck on a question: What was something he could share about his wife that the public didn't already know?

Suddenly, turning her attention towards the kitchen, Warren yelled out: ""Oooh!"" Bailey, the couple's 16-month-old golden retriever, had bounded into the sunroom, making a beeline for the senator and her husband.

""To the rescue! Bailey!"" Mann joked.

""Good boy,"" Warren said.

Hours earlier, Mann and Bailey had opened the side door of their Cambridge home, letting CNN reporters inside for the couple's first joint interview of the campaign. Mann's left hand was in a cast.

As Mann explained it, Bailey had recently been roaming off-leash in the neighborhood. He started playing with another dog, but soon ""the play stopped, and the other dog attacked him."" Mann got between the two dogs, and his hand caught on Bailey's harness, resulting in a broken finger.

Mann, a professor at Harvard Law School, headed over to campus to teach a class before taking himself to the emergency room.

Later, when Warren joined Mann for the joint interview, she wanted to set the record straight: ""Bailey got jumped.""

""Let's be clear. Bailey was jumped by another dog,"" she said. ""And Bruce went to Bailey's rescue.""

Sen. Elizabeth Warren's dog Bailey stands with her husband Bruce Mann as Warren addresses the media outside of her home after announcing she formed an exploratory committee for a 2020 Presidential run on December 31, 2018 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Both Warren and Mann have long been dog people. As Warren writes in her autobiography, ""A Fighting Chance,"" when she was teaching at the University of Pennsylvania years ago, a group of students surprised her with a golden retriever puppy on the last day of class.

In the course of their wide-ranging interview, Warren and Mann pointed to Bailey as one of the most important ways in which they have tried to keep a sense of calm this year as the Massachusetts senator has been running for President.

Their previous golden retriever, Otis, ""had gotten Elizabeth through"" her first Senate campaign in 2012, Mann said -- ""just by being this big fluffy golden.""

""Otis was the calm. You can do this. We'll get through this together,"" Warren said. ""I would often brush Otis while I'd be on a phone call.""

Otis died just days before Warren's Senate victory. It was a painful loss for the couple, and for years, they said, they couldn't fathom taking on everything that came with taking care of a dog again as Warren juggled her new job in Washington and Mann continued to teach at the law school.

But last summer, Mann saw an opening. One of their grandchildren was visiting, so he would be home in Cambridge for an extended period of time rather than commuting back and forth to Washington, DC. He seized the moment and brought Bailey home.

Now, as Warren runs for President, whenever she is home in Cambridge, the couple makes time to drive over to Fresh Pond with Bailey. A ""really good day,"" Warren said, is when they can do the loop around the pond twice in one day.

Getting Bailey last year ""probably made no sense at all,"" Warren said, but now, they ""can't imagine life without him.""

""And besides, there's really nothing better than a golden retriever puppy to create the illusion of normalcy,"" Mann said."
291,"Gregory Krieg and MJ Lee, CNN",,"Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren raised $24.6 million over the past three months, her campaign said Friday morning, falling just short of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' massive haul.",2019-10-04,CNN,"Elizabeth Warren raises $24.6 million in third quarter, reinforcing status among 2020 front-runners",https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/04/politics/elizabeth-warren-third-quarter-fundraising/index.html,"(CNN) Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren raised $24.6 million over the past three months, her campaign said Friday morning, falling just short of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' massive haul.

Warren's momentum in the polls, in which she has emerged as a front-runner alongside former Vice President Joe Biden, has been mirrored by a continued rise in small dollar fundraising. She brought in only $6 million during a disappointing first quarter, then jumped to $19.1 million in the second before a breakout summer that saw her outpace Biden by more than $9 million

Earlier in the week, Sanders announced a $25.3 million third quarter total, which set the pace for the 2020 Democratic field. Warren landed just shy of that number, but is well-positioned now to expand her campaign, which has $25.7 million in cash-on-hand, according to the campaign, as the first round of caucuses and primaries approach.

Campaign manager Roger Lau, in an email to supporters, said more than 500,000 people made more than 940,000 contributions to the campaign during the third quarter. The majority of those donors -- 300,000 -- gave to Warren for the first time during that period, Lau said, for an average contribution of $26. Since she entered the race on New Year's Eve, an estimated 750,000 people have given to Warren's campaign.

Warren's impressive total underscores the power of small dollar donors in the 2020 Democratic contest. Both she and Sanders have forsworn high-dollar fundraisers, but combined, they outraised Biden, California Sen. Kamala Harris and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, all of whom have tapped wealthy donors, by $4 million this quarter: $49.9 million to $45.9 million.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is causing him to rethink his decision to stay out of the presidential race, according to CNBC.

Bloomberg is reportedly mulling the possibility of entering the race – if Biden drops out – “according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were deemed private,” CNBC reported.

The former New York City mayor’s reconsideration has been ignited by Warren’s growing support over Biden.

Via CNBC:

Bloomberg has signaled he’s “still looking at” running for president, but people close him say that the only way he could even go down that path is if Biden’s fortunes suffer so much that he drops out before or during the early stages of the primary. Bloomberg could then enter the race as one of the rare moderates with enough name recognition and campaign funding to make a run. Forbes estimates his net worth at $51 billion, and he was planning to spend over $100 million on a campaign for president if he ran.

Bloomberg ruled out a presidential bid in March, telling supporters that he was “clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field.”

“While there would be no higher honor than serving as president, my highest obligation as a citizen is to help the country the best way I can, right now. That’s what I’ll do, including the launch of a new effort called Beyond Carbon,” he stated at the time.

Warren has positioned herself as a viable threat to Biden, who held the frontrunner status in the early months of the Democrat primary. The Massachusetts senator has surged in recent weeks, besting Biden in a number of national polls as well as early primary and caucus state polls. A YouGovUS/CBSNews poll released over the weekend showed Warren leading Biden in early states by six points– 31 percent to 25 percent:

Warren surpassed Biden in the Real Clear Politics average last week and currently sits less than two points behind Biden in the current average, with 26 percent to Biden’s 27.8.

Biden’s loss of his previously held frontrunner status has Bloomberg mulling a bid, although a source told CNBC that Bloomberg would not make a move unless Biden dropped out of the race.

“I think it’s something he wants. He has not been shy about that,” a Bloomberg ally told CNBC. “Nothing can happen unless Biden drops out, and that’s not happening anytime soon.”

“He’s like everyone else. They can’t get it out of their system,” another source, described as a banking executive, told CNBC.

“Bloomberg is in if Biden is out,” another source added.

The former mayor told the Associated Press this year that – if he ran for president – his campaign would focus on “climate change, education, and public health.”

“Climate change could destroy the whole world and kill everyone on it,” Bloomberg said. “It’s frustrating that a lot of people don’t understand that.”

The gun-control activist joined California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) in September, announcing the Satellites for Climate Action initiative, which is “dedicated to monitoring climate change and the impact of the state’s policies,” as Breitbart News reported."

Patrick Murray, Monmouth University's polling director, acknowledged that their August poll -- which found Warren, Sanders, and Biden in a three-way tie -- was an outlier compared with other polling conducted around the same time. But the new Monmouth poll confirms other recent polling suggesting a far tighter race for the Democratic nomination.

It, along with a late-September Quinnipiac University poll , is the second recent national poll to show Warren and Biden topping the field and within the margin of error of each other, and the third to show Warren in the mid- to upper-20s in support.

While eight in 10 registered Republicans and Republican-leaning independent voters say Donald Trump ought to be re-elected President in 2020, 15% said someone else should be in office.

The responses were humbling and show there are no easy answers.",2019-10-19,CNN,Your pregnancy discrimination stories prove there are no easy answers,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/19/opinions/elizabeth-warren-pregnancy-discrimination-reader-response-carr/index.html,"(CNN) ""Back then, you had to be married for nine months before delivering your baby or your maternity insurance wouldn't kick in.""

That's what BJ, who was living in Connecticut in 1971 and working as a bank teller, remembers about her first pregnancy. After she started to show, she had to work at a back desk away from the customers, she writes. Now living in North Carolina, BJ is one of the hundreds of women and men who wrote to us after CNN Opinion invited readers to share their experiences with pregnancy discrimination. When thinking about her own life and those of her three daughters and their pregnancies, she said, ""We have come a long way.""

When it emerged that Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren may have faced job discrimination over a pregnancy, the backlash against the claim was swift. One reason Warren's story of pregnancy discrimination prompted such an outcry from Americans on social media earlier this month and from so many of you in response to our call for stories is that for many American women -- and men -- the Pregnancy Discrimination Act feels too much like a historical footnote and little else. The Act amended Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to ""prohibit sex discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, childbrth, or related medical conditions."" Before it was signed into law in 1978, it was perfectly legal to refuse to hire, or to fire, a woman because of pregnancy.

Women who, like BJ, were working parents in the 1960s and 1970s, described what it was like seeking work as a woman of childbearing years before 1978; they recalled having to show prospective employers their birth control pills or disclose the dates of their last period to prove they weren't pregnant or wouldn't try to get pregnant if hired. Other women shared heartbreaking stories with us, ones not consigned to the pre-1978 past. Companies denying benefits after a stillbirth, demanding employees return to work one week after delivery.

For those women, it might come as no surprise to consider that as recently as this year, federal courts have been called upon to adjudicate pregnancy discrimination cases; in 2015, UPS lost a pregnancy discrimination case before the Supreme Court (in a decision that united Ruth Bader Ginsburg with Samuel Alito, two justices with very different judicial worldviews).

As recently as 2007, Melanie K. -- who worked for a staffing company and was a 39-year-old mother herself -- reported a client telling her, ""Don't bring me any women who are going to have kids."" When she asked in disbelief for clarification, her client -- a national company seeking IT professionals-- reiterated: ""Avoid any woman of child-bearing age.""

Several years after Melanie's experience, Becca K., of Cleveland, recalled her boss's words to her when she returned from maternity leave after her second child. She needed to ""dial it back to basics while getting back into the swing of things"" because ""changing diapers for three months isn't the same thing as managing a multimillion-dollar business."" For Laura Astorino of Massachusetts, the comments came from a founding partner at the firm where she worked (and where she was told she couldn't have a raise since she was going on maternity leave): he called employees with children ""breeders.""

For women today, pregnancy discrimination is ""is real, it is harrowing, and it is wrong,"" wrote our op-ed contributor Kara Alaimo

These stories of pregnancy discrimination weren't just about pregnancy -- they were also about miscarriage. They were also about adoption. They were also about supporting a pregnant partner.

I was told by my CEO that I couldn't use any of my sick leave because I wasn't theoretically 'sick'. (I was pregnant with twins and would likely have a Cesarean.) I asked the CEO if a man who has back surgery is considered 'sick'. He backed down. — Linda Avey (@lindaavey) October 9, 2019

Jeff from Provo, Utah -- now a stay-at-home dad and a writer -- was a college student when his wife lost the baby she was carrying. He described being told by one of his professors that he could only take time away from class if he provided his wife's medical documentation.

Angela from Oklahoma, wrote: ""I adopted my daughter at birth and I was basically told I wasn't going to get FMLA [12 unpaid weeks for employees who qualify under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993] for a decision I was making. However, the company policy would have allowed me to take time off if I had a drug problem, etc. Just not to take care of my child, because I CHOSE to have her, because I didn't give birth to her. I also CHOSE to leave that company.""

CNN Opinion reached out to you because Elizabeth Warren put pregnancy discrimination in the public eye and we wanted to know how you felt about it. Your willingness to share your most intimate, painful experiences humbled and honored us. Your responses showed us that for so many Americans -- past and present -- who are working to bring families into the world and support them, there are no easy answers.

Here is a further sampling of your responses. Some have been lightly edited for clarity and flow, and the views belong to the authors.

""She's taken full advantage""

In 1996, I was a 4th year attorney starting a new job with a well-respected boutique firm in Houston. On my first day, one of the named partners took me to lunch. As we were entering the elevator, a visibily pregnant woman was exiting and the partner introduced her to me as one of their associates. Once on the elevator, he snidely said to me, ""This is Catherine's third child. She's taken full advantage of our maternity leave program."" I've never forgotten that comment or his tone and it definitely was in mind when I had my first, and only, child a few years later while still at the firm. I felt pressured to do a fair amount of work remotely during my 3 months of leave, so as to not damage my chance at partnership, which I eventually got. Catherine never made partner and eventually left, as I did in 2007.

Sherri Wagner, Houston, TX

I'm due in January. Things need to change

In 2011, I discovered I was pregnant after starting a new job. I work in a male-dominated field, and my pregnancy seemed to confuse my male bosses. My employer's response was, ""I've been in this industry for 10 years and I've never heard of such a thing!"" I assure you, my reproductive system works the same way as any other woman's. They didn't want to work with me on appointments. They didn't understand why I needed to miss hours for glucose tolerance testing, an amniocentesis, my anatomy scan. They were upset I could no longer lift 50 pounds or more.

I live in a state that isn't really pro-women's rights. I'd been on the job for 6 months when I was placed on modified bed rest for the last 4 weeks of my pregnancy. My company kept my job open. However, when I finally delivered, I was expected to return to work just two weeks later. I had a difficult delivery, and my doctor wouldn't authorize a return to work until 8 weeks postpartum.

I lost that position. I was a single parent. The loss of income was devastating. I had to put my children on Medicaid to insure them. We went on SNAP for a while. In the end, I spent 18 months as a stay-at-home parent, and I cherish that time. But I'd rather have been employed.

Now, in 2019, seven years later, I find myself in the exact same position. I started a new job and discovered I was pregnant. Nothing has changed. If anything, the current environment is even more hostile to mothers in the workplace. I work for a really good company, so that helps, but I still find myself with no job protection. I still don't qualify for FMLA. My state still has no provision for pregnant women. Health care costs have skyrocketed, and as have the costs of having a baby.

I'm due in January. Things need to change. This country is lacking in women's rights. Many mothers would love to stay home with their new baby for a year [as other countries mandate in terms of paid leave]. We simply can't afford to. At the very least, we need a maternity program that isn't dependent on how long you've been working. Let us collect Social Security during that time. If our employers can't afford to hold our jobs, which is especially hard for smaller companies, let us collect unemployment. Humanity literally depends on women having babies. It's time for this country to realize that.

Men are also punished

When my wife was pregnant with our third child, we had some significant health scares for the baby requiring weekly ultrasounds. I didn't miss more work than I had sick time, but I used my accrued sick leave to help take care of my wife and children when needed. When the opportunity for promotion came up, my supervisor told me that they needed someone more dependable and that because I had taken so much time off to care for my family, I wouldn't be eligible. (I also never took time off for this without finding someone to cover as well.) I am sure that it is worse for the women who are pregnant, but men who actually take time off for pregnancy/paternity leave are also punished.

Discrimination isn't the problem. Entitlement is

Having a child as a working parent is difficult. I know because I have two children. Both were delivered via Caesarian and I was fortunate to have eight weeks with each baby after delivery. Before deciding to have children, consideration was given to the time and effort required to raise a child. It became glaringly apparent that parenting would not come without sacrifice. Never did my employer indicate that pregnancy, nursing or parenting would impact my job. Had they suggested that, I would not have blamed them. I spent 9 months mostly in the office bathroom vomiting (pre-delivery) and a significant amount of time pumping when I returned from maternity leave. Guess what, my male cohorts didn't.

I am not denying that there are ignorant people out there, but I think the prevalent problem facing us is that of entitlement. We want to be successful career women, but don't want to sacrifice having children. We want to have children, but expect to be given advantages, excuses, for sub-par performance. The reality is that life is about choices. I have made mine after careful consideration. Lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine. This is my experience. Please consider it as valid before dismissing it because it doesn't align with your storyline.

Pregnant? You still have to lift a Labrador retriever

I worked as a veterinary technician and was told that while they understood I could no longer assist with X-rays, I was expected to continue lifting dogs up to 75 lbs by myself and that I would not be allowed extra breaks or time off during my pregnancy. I considered quitting, but felt certain that another veterinary establishment would choose not to hire me if they knew I was pregnant.

What it was like the year the Pregnancy Discrimination Act became law

In 1978, I was a 21-year-old female interviewing for my first management position after college. I remember, distinctly, making it to the final round of interviews with four different corporations in which the hiring manager doing the final interview was always a white male. In three of the four interviews, I was asked when I was planning to get married and have children. My response was I wasn't in a relationship and couldn't see that happening for many years to come. After convincing them my career was my priority, each of these men followed up with a sentiment similar to, ""Of course you understand why we have to ask that question. Training new management recruits and investing in their careers is expensive. If you were to go off and start having babies, you wouldn't be able to give us the same level of commitment."" I was offered a position with all four corporations; I accepted a position with the corporation that never approached that question.

You're forced to choose and live with the consequences

I was a married PhD student. When my dissertation director found out I was expecting my first child, he was furious. ""You can't have a baby AND write a dissertation. It can't be done,"" he said. I did both, but had even more resistance about being a new mom when I defended my dissertation -- this time by the women on my committee. Even though they teach, higher ed is NOT mom-friendly. And this was in 2006!

I had another discriminatory incident when I gave birth to my second child. I was adjunct teaching at the university level and had my course load cut in half when my second child was born. I was told the cut would only last a semester, to accommodate my schedule, but the program director never reassigned the courses next semester. So my salary was permanently cut in half. I knew something like that would happen, and came back to work 3 weeks after giving birth to try to protect my job. Obviously, that didn't work.

This is the reality for women in America's higher education system. You're forced to choose, and live with the consequences. I just don't understand why Warren's comment is even a question. It happens every day.

With a baby in the NICU, I lost my job

I went into the hospital with pregnancy complications at 29 weeks and was [put on] 24-hour bed rest. I delivered my daughter 6 weeks early at 34 weeks. I notified my employer of her birth per being told to a few days later. I was then informed that I only had 2 weeks of leave left and would need to return to work after or be terminated. They ran my short-term disability and FMLA concurrently without telling me so I used up 6 out of the 8 weeks while on bed rest. I asked if I could work from home because I physically couldn't come back in two weeks (C-section delivery). It was up to my supervisor to approve and he denied stating he didn't believe I would truly work. With a new baby in the NICU and fresh from surgery, I was terminated from my job.

I never forgot the fear I had from my first pregnancy

I am Elizabeth Warren's vintage. Interviewing for my first professional job In 1978, I was pregnant but did not disclose it. Part of the hiring process was passing a physical. I actually prayed it would not disclose the pregnancy, knowing I would not get hired. After many months of working to make myself indispensable (and still hiding my pregnancy), I told my manager I would need a maternity leave. Annoyed, he said if he'd known I was pregnant he would not have hired me. Nevertheless, he did not fire me and I returned to work after a six-week leave. Four years later, I again became pregnant. My manager was then a VP and I was then a director. By that time, it was assumed I would take a leave and return to work, which I did. But I never forgot the fear I had from my first pregnancy.

""You better not be pregnant""

I was working at a law firm in 2014 and was called into my boss' office and he inappropriately told me that another attorney had just told him she was pregnant, so his direct quote to me was, ""She is pregnant so you better not be."" He then went on to tell me that only one of us could be pregnant on the team at once and that we all better coordinate that. The truth was I had just found out the day before that I was pregnant and was then completely terrified. I unfortunately suffered a miscarriage with that pregnancy, but knew that I would never be able to have a healthy pregnancy at that office. I had seen them fire a pregnant woman and also fire a woman who came back to work post pregnancy who was then hospitalized for severe postpartum depression. She was fired while still out on leave for her postpartum. I had also been told that my career would be ruined if I got pregnant. Rather than continue my career as a law firm attorney and continue in that environment, I chose to take a corporate job where I remain today, happily the mom of 2.

I've been one of the ""lucky"" ones

I went for an interview at 10 weeks pregnant. I had 2 previous consistent miscarriages, so I didn't feel comfortable disclosing I was pregnant. After I reached 16 weeks, out of joy and need for emotional support, I told my supervisor and the owner of the business I was pregnant. A week later, I was fired because ""I just wouldn't be happy there due to personality conflicts."" It took me 4 months, without unemployment benefits (which means all of our bills, rent and car payments fell way behind and my husband was pulling 12- to 14-hour shifts, 7 days a week, as well as being threatened with eviction every month) to find another place to work. By that time, my pregnant belly was already showing, and I had very limited choices since I would obviously need maternity leave within a few months. I've been one of the lucky ones who found an office full of new and experienced moms and I was hired and still work there now.

Three of my colleagues stood up for me

In 1998, I was the only female doctor in a medical clinic. When I got pregnant with my first child, the director told me I should find another job because managing a primary care practice after having a baby was not going to be possible. Fortunately for me the clinic nurse manager, a woman, and two of my male colleagues stood up for me. I had to make concessions and be in clinic 5 days a week in order to keep my job though. Twelve years later, I became the clinic director. By then the majority of our physicians were women and motherhood was not only accommodated but celebrated.

I am a better person today because I had kids

I became pregnant with my first daughter in 2015. I was working at a rapidly growing tech company in the Midwest, and I was quickly excelling in my career. The company was mostly male but still had some female representation. The problem was that I was the FIRST female to have a baby (while working there). As soon as I told my boss and HR I was pregnant, fear set in with everyone it seemed. How do we handle this? Where will she be able to pump that's private and NOT a bathroom (which is legally required)? I also learned that the company had a paternity leave policy but NO maternity leave. I could take unpaid FMLA but no paid leave -- I couldn't even save up vacation time to use after having the baby.

Once the management team was aware, I was told to announce this to the team. After the announcement, crickets. I was on an island now. No one knew what to do with me or how to work with me. The first question was, ""Are you leaving?"" At first, I said ""No!"" That answer quickly changed. I ended up quitting that job and staying home with my baby and working as a part-time freelancer for about 3 years. It was wonderful. I will never regret that decision. However, I am now managing a growing agency (based on continuous business growth from freelancing) and I will NEVER put one of my team members in that position. I want flexibility and freedom for moms and dads that I work with. I never want to lose talent and potential because someone chooses to have a child. I know I am a better person today than I was before I had kids. I work harder. I work smarter. And I credit a lot of that to being a mom AND a bad ass businesswoman.

Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren .

The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents 1.4 million workers, is among the largest in the country. Over the last month or so, nearly a dozen candidates have sat down on-camera to make their cases to union voters. Nine hopefuls, including former Vice President Joe Biden, have signed a pledge promising their support on issues Teamsters members recently voted to prioritize ahead of the primary.

""I think the candidates are trying to resonate and talk about what issues are important to working people more than what they did last time (in 2016),"" Teamsters General President James P. Hoffa said in an interview. ""And I think they're doing a good job.""

Hillary Clinton finished nine percentage points ahead of President Donald Trump (51% to 42%) with union households in 2016. Democrats will hope that margin widens come 2020. Warren, Biden and Sanders have all actively sought labor support and appeared on picket lines with striking United Automobile Workers members. Sanders in particular has made labor a focal point of his campaign, and been a fixture alongside workers protesting for higher wages and a union.

To be eligible for the Teamsters' official backing, candidates -- including Trump -- must agree to a three-point pledge assuring their support for labor-friendly trade deals, federal efforts to enhance and protect collective bargaining rights, and legislative action to protect endangered pension funding. Union members can track the process on a new website launched late Thursday. The candidates are also being asked to promise official neutrality should their staffs, as a number have already done, move to unionize.

The Teamsters also announced plans to hold a candidate forum on December 7 in Iowa.

When the union chose Clinton over Trump in 2016, the announcement came in late August. Hoffa didn't specify when a choice would be made this time around, suggesting it might not come until, or after, the Democratic National Convention next summer in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The process, which is meant to more deeply engage candidates and rank-and-file union members, will culminate with Hoffa delivering a recommendation -- based in part on a survey of local leaders -- to the general executive board.

Hoffa pointed to the fluid nature of the crowded race, and the increased attention on labor issues, as reasons the Teamsters might take their time in picking a horse. So far, most major unions have been slower to jump behind a single candidate.

""This is changing so fast. You know, who would have imagined that Bernie would have a heart attack, who would imagined the controversy with regard to Biden and his son,"" Hoffa said. ""Those are unknown things. And there's always unknown things that happen in campaigns, especially when you have a long time like this.""

There are, however, already a number of clear divides among the candidates publicly vying for Teamster support. Most notable is their backing -- or opposition -- to ""Medicare for All"" single-payer health care, the signature proposal of Sanders' campaign. A number of labor leaders and some vocal union members have expressed concern over a move to Medicare for All.

Hoffa is among the skeptics.

""The Teamsters have health care for all. And I just think we have to educate (the candidates) on that issue. I can't believe they would say that we're going to give up our insurance,"" he said. ""That's something we would be very, very strong on. That's just not something that we would concede.""

Still, he spoke warmly of his and the union's relationship with all of the leading candidates -- and the efforts of union members to engage them on the trail. According to the union, Teamsters have made more than 100 contacts with candidates over the last three months, asking them 95 questions. Twenty Teamsters locals in 14 states, with a focus on the early-voting hubs, have taken active roles. Midwestern swing states like Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania will also see a burst of door-knocking, phone calls, text messaging and other digital outreach.

""I'm very heartened because I happen to know all these candidates. One way or another, over the years, we got to talk -- when Biden was vice president, Warren in the Senate. Bernie we've known for years and (New Jersey Sen. Cory) Booker we've known forever,"" Hoffa said. ""And all these people come together with a lot of experience and it's a very talented group of people."""

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont by name for their support of ""Medicare for All.""

The ad -- titled ""Makes More Sense"" -- highlights Buttigieg's Medicare for All Who Want It health care plan, a middle-of-the-road approach that would not force people onto government health coverage but would offer a public option for people who choose to enroll. That is a key distinction between Buttigieg's plan and the sweeping overhaul that would be instituted under a full Medicare for All program.

The ad represents an escalation by the South Bend, Indiana, mayor's campaign, after he's mostly kept his Medicare for All critiques nameless and primarily focused on policy.

Buttigieg's ad uses reporters and media figures to describe the differences between the plans, including CNN political commentator Joe Lockhart saying, ""Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren believe that we have to force ourselves into Medicare for all, where private insurance is abolished.""

His campaign said in a news release, ""The ad highlights Pete's bold approach to health care would not kick millions of people off their private health care, and would give them the option to choose the plan that's right for their them.""

Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday met swift criticism from her 2020 Democratic rivals after she would not explicitly state that, under the ""Medicare for All"" plan she supports, many middle class families will see a tax hike.",2019-10-16,CNN,Warren comes under fire from 2020 Democratic rivals over 'Medicare for All',https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/15/politics/warren-medicare-for-all-debate/index.html,"(CNN) Elizabeth Warren got a taste of the front-runner life during a heated debate on Tuesday in Ohio , as the moderate candidates onstage bombarded her throughout the night and, during an especially pointed exchange, assailed the Massachusetts senator over her refusal to directly explain how she would fund ""Medicare for All.""

The question during the CNN/New York Times debate that set off the onslaught was a familiar one: Would Warren raise taxes on middle class Americans to pay for a single-payer health care program? Warren's response, too, was consistent with what she's said in the past -- but didn't provide a clear answer.

""My view on this and what I have committed to is, costs will go down for hard-working middle-class families,"" Warren said, again stressing that taxes on ""the wealth and big corporations"" would fulfill the bulk of the financing before pledging that she would ""not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle class families.""

But the stage was not satisfied. And with that, a nearly three-hour storm began -- and it was Warren most often standing under the angriest clouds.

South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg , who was aggressive throughout the night, called Warren ""evasive"" and, addressing her directly, said: ""Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this."" Sen. Amy Klobuchar , who repeatedly pivoted to Warren when asked a question, also took direct aim at her Senate colleague's murky explanation.

""We owe it to the American people,"" she said, ""to tell them where we will send the invoice.""

Sen. Bernie Sanders , who has been careful not directly criticize his progressive ally, defended Medicare for All after Buttigieg zeroed in on the policy itself -- but added, as he's stated before, that taxes would go up nearly across the board in order to pay for the plan.

""As somebody who wrote the damn bill, let's be clear: Under the Medicare for All bill I wrote, premiums are gone, copayments are gone, deductibles are gone. All out-of-pocket expenses are gone,"" Sanders said, before adding, ""But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up"" mostly for the wealthy, but also for some middle class Americans.

Sanders, as he's done on the trail, argued that the implementation of Medicare for All would, despite those tax hikes, mean that most Americans would be paying significantly less overall. Warren makes the same point, but her consistent demurrals when faced with the tax question -- on the campaign trail, when it's been posed by voters at rallies, and on the debate stage -- set up Medicare for All critics for a predictable pile-on.

But the scrap over health care was only a modest preview of what was coming for Warren, who has topped the field in a number of recent polls of early-voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire. Lower-performing rivals like former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and Sen. Kamala Harris gave the debate a feeling, at times, of being a referendum on Warren.

After the debate, Warren's campaign described the incoming volleys as more evidence of the candidate's growing stature and prospects.

""Elizabeth Warren has built momentum by running a campaign of substance, identifying problems facing the country and laying out her plans for big structural change to fix them,"" communications director Kristen Orthman said. ""She took heat tonight as a result of that momentum, but she stayed focused on what's broken and how she plans to fix it with a government and an economy that works for the people.""

Former Vice President Joe Biden was more tempered than some others in his language, but he also accused Warren of being ""vague"" in her discussion of Medicare for All and, as he livened up as the debate pushed into its third hour, claimed to the be the only one the stage who had accomplished anything ""big.""

Warren answered that suggestion with a sharply confident reminder of her work in crafting and establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

""Following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people,"" Warren recalled. ""And all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, don't even try because you will never get it passed.""

Biden jumped in after Warren finished to talk about his role in seeing that it did, telling her: ""I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it, so let's get those things straight, too.""

Warren answered his aggressive claims with a deadpan: ""I am deeply grateful to President Obama,"" she said, ""who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law.""

Harris picked a more narrow line of attack, pushing Warren -- who has been critical of Facebook's ad policy, which doesn't vet candidate's claims -- to follow her lead and demand Twitter suspend President Donald Trump's account.

""Sen. Warren, I just want to say that I was surprised to hear that you did not agree with me that, on this subject of what should be the rules around corporate responsibility for these big tech companies,"" Harris said.

Warren responded by implicitly belittling the ambition of Harris' demand: ""I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter,"" she said. ""I want to push him out of the White House. That's our job.""

When Harris continued pushing, asking Warren to ""join me in saying that his Twitter account should be shut down,"" Warren turned her down with a flat ""no.""

In a Democratic primary campaign that has yet to see a candidate rewarded for explicitly attacking a particular rival, the attempts to wallop Warren are as likely to backfire as cut her down.

O'Rourke zeroed in after the wealth tax plans by Warren and Sanders became a point of contention, with businessman Andrew Yang saying the policy ""makes a lot of sense in principle,"" but questioned whether and how it would work in practice.

""Sometimes I think that Sen. Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other,"" O'Rourke said, ""instead of lifting people up and making sure this country comes together around those solutions.""

""I'm really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I'm punitive,"" Warren said. ""Look, I don't have a beef with billionaires,"" before reprising an argument that she's been making for years: that the wealthiest Americans owed a financial -- and moral -- debt to the country that helped facilitate their success.

Ultimately, it was Sen. Cory Booker who sought to pull Warren out of the barrel and tsk-tsk his rivals over both the tone and text of their criticisms.

""I have seen this script before. It didn't work in 2016 and it will be a disaster for us in 2020,"" Booker said, warning Democrats against ""tearing each other down because we have different plans."""

Based on the results of the investigation, the campaign determined that his reported conduct was inconsistent with its values and that he could not be a part of the campaign moving forward.""

In a statement provided to CNN, McDaniel confirmed that he is no longer with the Warren campaign, saying that ""departing at this time is in the best interest of both parties.""

""I would never intentionally engage in any behavior inconsistent with the campaign or my own values,"" McDaniel said. ""If others feel that I have, I understand it is important to listen even when you disagree.""

McDaniel declined a request from CNN for an interview. In the same written statement, McDaniel said he had ""tremendous respect"" for his former colleagues on the campaign ""despite any disagreements,"" and that he wished the campaign well.

Now he's opening up about their 2020 'adventure',https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/30/politics/elizabeth-warren-bruce-mann-cnntv/index.html,"Cambridge, Massachusetts (CNN) As Elizabeth Warren's candidacy for president caught fire this summer, so did images of her seemingly endless energy: running on to the stage at campaign events; punching the air when she speaks; working the photo line for hours after rallies.

In the evenings, Warren keeps moving, often doing laps around the hotel grounds or pacing in the lobby. But she does it with a different kind of intensity -- this is when she is starting to unwind, talking on the phone with her husband, Bruce Mann.

A professor at Harvard Law School specializing in legal history and property law, Mann is unquestionably the quieter half of the couple. Friends, colleagues and campaign aides say Mann has never been one to seek the public spotlight. But as Warren climbs in the polls, there may be no escaping it.

On a recent Friday morning, Mann and Bailey, the couple's rambunctious 16-month-old golden retriever, answered the side door of their Cambridge home, letting CNN reporters inside for the couple's first joint interview of the campaign. Mann's left hand was in a hard cast -- he had recently broken a bone while trying to break up a fight between Bailey and a neighbor's dog. (""Bailey got jumped, let's be clear,"" Warren would later insist -- she's never known Mann to get caught up in a scuffle. ""Bruce went to Bailey's rescue."")

Asked about the couple's contrasting personalities, Mann, 69, responded with a smile: ""It just works.""

Seated next to her husband of almost 40 years in a white wicker chair in their back sunroom, Warren chimed in in agreement. ""I don't want to be married to somebody like me. I want to be married to somebody like him.""

If Warren is elected, Mann would play an unprecedented role as the first male presidential spouse. That role once seemed likely to go to Bill Clinton , a man thoroughly accustomed to the political stage. Mann would be a very different kind of first husband -- a longtime observer of politics, but far from a politician himself. A little more than four months out from the Iowa caucuses, Mann said he has not been closely involved in the ins and outs of the Warren campaign, and remains a mystery to most voters.

But those close to the couple say that Mann's influence on his wife's candidacy is not to be underestimated -- he has a unique ability to help his famously energetic wife decompress after long days of travel and campaigning, they said. ""He brings a sense of calm to her more than anyone else could,"" said Nora Keefe, Warren's bodywoman.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, husband Bruce Mann and dog Bailey.

""When you see the images of Elizabeth up in front of a crowd, waving her hands, just being part of the crowd, I can't quite imagine Bruce up there waving his hands,"" said Drew Faust, the former president of Harvard University who has been friends with the couple for years. ""There's this enormous warmth between them. And he is obviously -- they are both obviously devoted to one another and take pride in their differences.""

Warren noted that much of her life over the last year has been ""different motel rooms every night, hotel rooms every night, different food, different people around, but I always know the last person I'll have a good conversation with, the last person I'll talk to before I go to sleep, is you.""

Of those late-night phone calls, she said: ""It's like letting all the pieces go.""

That morning was looking like it could shape up to be what Warren describes as a ""really good day"": when she is home long enough to fit in two walks around Fresh Pond with Bailey and Mann, once early in the morning and again at night.

""There's really nothing better than a golden retriever puppy to create the illusion of normalcy,"" Mann joked.

""If you don't run and Democrats lose, you'll feel guilty""

In two wide-ranging interviews -- first with Mann and, later, the couple speaking together -- they discussed what has been anything but a normal year.

They couldn't pinpoint one moment when it became clear that Warren would run for president, something she had decided against doing four years ago. In the months leading up to the 2019 New Year, Warren had begun to quietly consult people whose advice she trusted, asking each of them for three reasons she shouldn't run, and three reasons she should.

""She saved me for last, and finally, she asked me for three reasons, pro and con. And I said, no, I'm not going to do it,"" Mann recalled. ""I said, you're gonna run anyways. So just doesn't matter. Because if you don't run and Democrats lose, you'll feel guilty because then that means there'd be no one to fight for the people and the issues that you care about.""

He was right. Warren would announce her exploratory campaign on New Year's Eve.

A registered Democrat and a self-described ""political junkie"" and ""compulsive reader of newspapers,"" Mann said he has been exercising discipline to avoid being consumed by news about his wife's campaign. He is sparing in what he flags to Warren, who has said she doesn't follow the news about the election closely.

US Senator from Massachusetts (D) Elizabeth Warren is flanked her husband Bruce Mann as she is sworn in by Vice President Mike Pence.

Warren has also taken a similar approach to polling, repeatedly declining to engage questions from reporters about who's up and who's down. At one point in the joint interview, when Mann was asked why he believes his wife has been leading in recent polls, Warren leaned into her husband with a reminder: ""And you remember, we don't do polls.""

""That's right, we do not do polls,"" Mann said. But he offered up a theory on what has been attracting voters to his wife this year.

""She's always had just an extraordinary ability to explain complex issues, clearly, memorably,"" he said. ""Watching people who hear her respond to her as she reaches them, as she helps them see how the issues touch their lives -- it's, I'm watching her teach on a larger stage.""

""I just fell for her from 25 yards out""

The couple's first meeting in the summer of 1979 was, as Mann describes, ""improbable."" He and Warren were both 29 and new to teaching, and had traveled to Key Biscayne, Florida, to attend an economics and law conference.

He spotted Warren, who had recently separated from her first husband, Jim Warren, across the lawn at an opening reception. ""Even from that distance, I was just drawn to her,"" he said. ""She was so just lively, so animated, so engaged. And I just fell for her from 25 yards out before even meeting her.""

Admittedly, it wasn't quite love at first sight for Warren.

""That was a Sunday, late afternoon,"" she mused of their first meeting. ""I wasn't completely in love with him until sometime mid-morning on Monday.""

What sealed the deal for Warren: ""It was on Monday when I actually saw him in shorts. And good-looking legs. That's when I was all in.""

""She completely objectified me,"" Mann responded with a grin.

If there was an immediate physical attraction, the pair also bonded over their similar upbringings.

Warren was born in Oklahoma City, the baby of four. As she has told voters on the campaign trail this year, Warren vividly remembers watching her mother walk out of the house one day to look for a job after her father suffered a heart attack. Mann's parents didn't have much money, either. ""They stretched and stretched and mortgaged to the hilt to buy the cheapest house in the town with one of the best public school systems,"" he said.

Within months of their first meeting in Florida, Warren visited Mann at the University of Connecticut, where he was teaching at the time. She sat in on one of his classes, and after all of the students had left, Mann recalled asking her: ""What'd you think?'""

""And she just said, 'What can I say? Will you marry me?' And I said, 'OK.' That is a direct quote, I remember every word.""

The couple juggled living in different cities long after they were married. Warren would continue teaching in Texas, before eventually getting hired at the University of Pennsylvania, where Mann also taught for almost 20 years. But when Warren landed a full-time teaching position at Harvard University in the 1990s, it would be years before Mann would also get a professorship at the school.

They leaned on Warren's aunt, ""Aunt Bee,"" to help raise Warren's two children from her first marriage, Amelia and Alex. In campaign speeches, Warren credits her aunt, after whom she is named, for changing the course of her life. She credits Aunt Bee, who lived with the family for 16 years, for having allowed her to continue teaching.

""Oh, she'd be so proud. She loved Elizabeth dearly,"" Mann said of Aunt Bee, who died in 1999. If she were still alive and observing Warren's 2020 campaign, Mann said, ""Her first response would probably be: 'How can I help?'""

""You just jump into the deep end and you swim""

Something else that seemed improbable to Mann in 1979 was that politics would be in the couple's future.

Warren was a Republican when they first met. She wouldn't change her party registration to Democrat until 1996. ""However conservative she might've been at the time, it was not particularly apparent and we really didn't discuss politics,"" Mann said.

But by 2011, Warren had made a name for herself in Washington, overseeing the Trouble Assets Relief Program after the financial crisis and conceiving of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under President Barack Obama. That September, she mounted her first political campaign against Massachusetts Republican Sen. Scott Brown.

It was during this closely watched Senate race that Warren first came under fire for her past claims to Native American heritage. She would defeat Brown, handing the Democrats a major pick-up in the Senate, but the criticism of how Warren handled her family history lingered. Her campaign's decision last year to release the results of a DNA test, which showed distant Native American ancestry, was widely panned.

For Mann, who was close to Warren's extended family in Oklahoma, these criticisms were particularly painful.

""I knew everyone in her family, loved her family, knew all the stories that they had grown up with,"" Mann said. ""Because it was an attack on her family, it was one that was sort of probably the least pleasant of the attacks she's endured.""

As for the possibility that Warren would be up against Trump if she were to win the Democratic nomination, Mann was matter of fact.

""I'm not sure if anyone -- how anyone trains for it,"" he said. ""I mean for all of this, you just jump into the deep end and you swim.""

The couple also insisted that they do not talk about what life could be like at the White House. ""It's a bit early for that,"" Mann said. In the classroom, Mann said he never mentions his wife's name or the campaign, a boundary that his students have been respectful of.

""They observe that separation. It's probably killing them, but they're very good,"" he said.

Mann has not done any interviews this year, with the exception of a brief encounter with reporters outside of their Cambridge home on New Year's Eve, hours after Warren announced her exploratory campaign. Prompted for a comment, Mann had said that day: ""We've been married a long time and it's always been an adventure. So this is just another one.""

Asked how that adventure was going, Mann told CNN: ""Extraordinarily well.""

""Certainly back then, I had no idea what it would look like -- only that we would do it,"" he said. ""Every part of it remains an adventure. So I stand by that statement."""

Elizabeth Warren said she will not solicit wealthy donors and hold high-dollar fundraisers if she wins the Democratic presidential nomination, in a shift from earlier this year when she said that fundraising strategy was just for the primary contest.",2019-10-09,CNN,Elizabeth Warren says she won't do big dollar fundraisers if she wins the nomination,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/09/politics/elizabeth-warren-fundraisers/index.html,"(CNN) Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she will not solicit wealthy donors and hold high-dollar fundraisers if she wins the Democratic presidential nomination, in a shift from earlier this year when she said that fundraising strategy was just for the primary contest.

When asked in an interview with CBS News released Tuesday whether she'd ""pivot"" or be ""forced"" to have big-dollar fundraisers if she won the nomination, Warren responded: ""No.""

""I will not be forced to make changes in how I raise money,"" the Massachusetts Democrat said. ""Look, for me this is pretty straight forward. Either you think democracy works and electing a president is all about going behind closed doors with bazillionaires and corporate executives and lobbyists and scooping up as much money as possible. Or you think it's about a grassroots, let's build this from the ground up.""

She later added: ""I'm not going to go do the big-dollar fundraisers. I'm just not going to do it.""

Despite her success with small-dollar donors during the primary, declining to raise big sums could put Warren at a significant financial disadvantage in a general-election battle with President Donald Trump. Trump and the Republican National Committee raised $125 million during the July-to-September fundraising quarter -- fueled, in part, by six-figure donations collected at ritzy events. On a single day in August, for instance, Trump and the RNC raised $12 million at two fundraisers in the Hamptons.

Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday challenged her Democratic primary rivals to release the names of contributors and fundraisers with influential positions on their campaigns, while pledging to champion legislation that would effectively disqualify big-dollar donors from being appointed to cushy diplomatic posts.

The requests were written into a series of mostly new proposed campaign finance restrictions, which would ban corporate PACs from donating to federal candidates and make it illegal for certain super PACs to be run by operatives with professional or personal ties to the candidate they're backing.

Now firmly among the front-runners for the Democratic presidential nomination, Warren has increasingly centered her campaign on a broad anti-corruption platform . In past rollouts, she promised to forbid lobbyists from making political contributions, acting as bundlers or hosting fundraisers for candidates. Former top federal officials -- including presidents, vice presidents, members of Congress, judges, and cabinet secretaries -- would also be permanently prohibited from taking lobbying jobs.

While Warren does not name any of her competitors in her Medium post, the new call for campaigns to ""disclose any donor or fundraiser who has a special title on their campaign, including national and regional finance committee members and bundler designations"" is an apparent nudge to a number of top rivals, like former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and California Sen. Kamala Harris, who all regularly attend big-dollar fundraising events.

Warren's call to cut off the donor-to-ambassador pipeline, which she acknowledges has been common practice in both Republican and Democratic administrations, comes with increased resonance now that President Donald Trump's EU ambassador, Gordon Sondland , a Republican megadonor who gave $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee, has emerged as a key figure in the Ukraine scandal.

But she still needs to win over black voters,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/10/politics/elizabeth-warren-black-voters/index.html,"Charleston, South Carolina (CNN) At an annual awards dinner hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington, DC, last month, Rev. Jesse Jackson watched as a stream of attendees walked over to one 2020 Democratic candidate, looking to shake her hand, chat and take a photo together.

It was Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , being approached ""all night long,"" Jackson said: ""People coming across the room to get a picture.""

The overwhelmingly positive reception that Warren received at the black-tie CBC gala wasn't the first time the senator has stood out this year at a forum of a largely black audience. Warren received a standing ovation at the ""She The People"" conference this summer as she presented her idea for bringing down the maternal mortality rate among black women ; in June, Jackson lavished her with praise at the Rainbow Push conference; and Warren appeared to be a crowd favorite at Al Sharpton's National Action Network conference in April, when she spoke about the acute challenges facing African-American homeowners.

But as Warren continues a steady climb in the national polls and now shares the front-runner status with former Vice President Joe Biden, Warren confronts a tough political reality. Those standout moments, coupled with public praise from African American leaders and activists, have yet to fully translate to support among black voters

According to a Quinnipiac national poll released on Tuesday, Warren is the top-choice candidate for 20% of black Democratic or Democratic-leaning voters. It is a notable improvement from the 10% support Warren had among black voters in an August Quinnipiac survey, but Biden still remains well ahead in support among blacks, at 36%.

Whether Warren can continue to improve her standing with this critical demographic group will be particularly important in the early voting state of South Carolina. A recent CNN poll showed Biden with a strong lead in the state, with the support of 45% of black likely primary voters. The same survey showed Warren with only 4% support among black voters in the state.

In an earlier Quinnipiac poll released at the end of September, seven in 10 black voters said they would be ""excited"" if Warren were the Democratic nominee, and 60% said they had a favorable view of the senator. But around two in 10 black voters said they still had not heard enough about Warren to have a favorable or unfavorable view of her. In contrast, 70% of those black voters said they had a favorable view of Biden, and only 5% said they hadn't heard enough about the former vice president to have a positive or negative opinion of him.

It has not gone unnoticed that some of Warren's events in South Carolina have featured largely white audiences. And despite the warm reception at the CBC dinner, Warren has not received endorsements from any black lawmakers in that caucus, unlike Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris.

On Wednesday, after another ""walking tour"" through a Charleston, South Carolina, neighborhood, Warren held a roundtable meeting with local residents, activists and leaders.

Asked by CNN how she would win over black voters who are far more familiar with Biden, Warren responded: ""I'm showing up, because I think that's really important -- showing up and shaking hands and talking with people.""

State Sen. Marlon Kimpson, who joined Warren in the discussion and applauded her for visiting his constituents, told reporters that he believes Biden has a ""head start"" with black voters because of name recognition.

""But I caution all candidates: Things in the rear mirror are closer than they appear. It's a wide-open race, there are some built-in advantages based on name recognition, but all candidates including the vice president has to make the case,"" said Kimpson, who has not yet made an endorsement.

According to Jackson, who himself ran for President twice in the 1980s, he and Warren speak ""quite often."" The civil rights activists told CNN in an interview the senator has reached out to him periodically as she has mounted a bid for the White House.

""She appears to be fearless,"" Jackson said. He has not endorsed in the Democratic primary and said he is undecided on whether he will publicly back someone before the Iowa caucuses. ""People hear her and they respond to her. She has the capacity to arouse the base.""

""It's not enough to talk about black people as if we're a monolith""

The Warren campaign has sought to reach out to the black community through its policy plans.

From her student loan debt forgiveness plan to her housing proposal to plans on closing private prisons and assisting entrepreneurs of color, Warren has integrated measures aimed specifically at African Americans in many of her policy outlines. Asked about outreach the senator has been doing this year to the black community, the campaign also pointed to ""listening sessions"" she has held with black activists and leaders throughout the year, including in Philadelphia ahead of the Netroots Nation conference.

And even as early as the spring, Warren was spending time in the south, in states that hold contests in March after the all-important early states. In March, she visited the Mississippi Delta for a ""walking tours"" of Cleveland and Greenville, Mississippi, to promote her rural housing plan, and also held campaign events in Tennessee and Alabama.

Ashlee Marie Preston, an African American transgender activist who has endorsed Warren, said she spoke with several other Democratic candidates before settling on Warren. It was in some ways an unexpected choice, she said, particularly given that there are two black candidates in the Democratic race: Sens. Harris and Cory Booker.

""I think it's easy to talk about racism in America -- it's another thing to be specific about the different layers about structural racism and systemic racism and how it continues to stand as a barrier to the poor and disenfranchised communities,"" Preston said. ""It's not enough to talk about black people as if we're a monolith.""

Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families Party, which endorsed Warren last month, echoed Preston's sentiment.

""Identity is important but identity is insufficient. Simply because candidates happen to occupy the same racial identity of black voters doesn't mean it's in the bag for any candidate,"" Mitchell said. ""And black voters are incredibly sophisticated. They want to understand a candidate's history, a candidate's platform.""

Other African American Warren supporters -- particularly those who have known the senator voters will for years -- insist that her standing with black voters will improve as they get to know the candidate better.

""I'm troubled by the numbers in South Carolina, only because I know that folks in South Carolina don't know her like we know her -- members of the African American community in Boston,"" said Rev. Jeffrey Brown, an associate pastor of the 12th Baptist Church in Roxbury, Massachusetts.

For years, Warren has periodically attended services at the 12th Baptist Church, one of the oldest black churches in the Boston area. Brown said Warren personally calls to give him a heads-up before attending Sunday services, and that while he has asked her on multiple occasions to speak to the congregation, she has largely declined.

Remarking upon the Bible that Warren brings to church -- ""What I love about her Bible is that it's not brand new. And I've seen it. I've looked at it. It's a well-worn thing"" -- Brown said it is what he sees as the senator's understanding of the unique needs of African-Americans that leads him to believe that there is room for black support for Warren to grow.

But the reality is that Warren has less than four months left to introduce herself to black voters across the country and intensively court them, in contrast to the years she has had to get to know black voters in Massachusetts.

""I wish I could go down to South Carolina to some of these places and say look -- this is not a show... She's a real advocate for us,"" said Brown, who added he is ""a thousand percent"" behind Warren's candidacy. ""I wish I could go down there to some southern churches and preach about that."""

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris all unveiled plans to expand LGBTQ protections and promote equal rights on Thursday, the day of an LGBTQ town hall hosted by CNN and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation.

The three candidates, whose plans are all similar, list passing the Equality Act as a top priority. The bill, which has passed the House of Representatives but has not been taken up by the Senate, would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other civil rights laws to include sexual orientation and gender identity as protected characteristics.

Warren, Buttigieg and Harris, along with several other 2020 Democrats, have been vocal about LGBTQ issues and rights throughout their presidential campaigns. Buttigieg stands out in the crowded 2020 Democratic field as someone who, if elected, would be the first man married to a same-sex partner to be president of the United States.

These plans come ahead of the CNN/Human Rights Campaign Foundation town hall, where Democratic presidential candidates will take questions from the audience and CNN journalists on specific LGBTQ concerns as well as their plans to promote equality and civility. The town hall will air Thursday from 7:30 p.m. to 12 a.m. ET.

The three candidates pledge to reverse the Trump administration's rollbacks of LGBTQ protections, including the ban on transgender military service members and religious exemption policies. Warren writes the US must end ""the weaponization of religion to discriminate against or harm LGBTQ+ people.""

Bernie Sanders on how his sweeping health care plan -- which Warren has endorsed -- would be paid for.

""She's reviewing the revenue options suggested by the 2016 Bernie campaign along with other revenue options. But she will only support pay-fors that meet the principles she has laid out in multiple debates,"" a Warren campaign aide said in a statement provided to CNN.

The campaign aide also said that the total cost of Medicare for All is unknown and that estimates vary by trillions of dollars. They did not provide details on what ""other revenue options"" the campaign is studying, and declined to comment on whether Warren may eventually put out her own details on paying for Medicare for All.

A new study by the Urban Institute , released Wednesday, said that federal spending on health care would increase by roughly $34 trillion under a single-payer plan similar to Medicare for All. That's in line with earlier studies that pegged the cost at around $32 trillion.

While Sanders has not detailed how he would raise the revenue needed to pay for Medicare for All, he included a variety of options when he released his 2016 campaign proposal and his updated bill in April. Among those listed in his most recent iteration are a 4% levy on employees, exempting the first $29,000 in income for a family of four. He also suggests imposing new taxes on employers, hiking the marginal tax rate on those making above $10 million, boosting the estate tax and establishing a wealth tax.

Warren's campaign statement comes on the heels of a contentious presidential debate Tuesday night in Ohio, where Warren was asked no less than half a dozen times on stage about whether Sanders' signature health care platform would raise taxes on the middle class and how she would like to pay for it.

Every time, the Massachusetts Democrat -- standing squarely center stage as a new front-runner in the 2020 Democratic race for President -- refused to state that taxes would, in fact, go up for some Americans under her colleague's plan. Instead, she stuck to a well-rehearsed response about how costs would go up for corporations and the wealthy and come down for middle class families. She pledged that as President, she would not sign a health care bill into law unless it lowered costs for average Americans.

Sanders has also stressed that while he would impose taxes on the middle class, they would see their overall costs go down because they would no longer have to pay premiums, deductibles or co-payments when they seek care.

Warren's repeated dodges on questions about whether Medicare for All would result in higher taxes are notably out of character for the senator, whose candidacy for the White House has gained steady political momentum in large part thanks to her abundance of policy plans and a knack for explaining and advocating for those ideas clearly out on the campaign trail.

Less than four months out from the Iowa caucuses, Warren's support for Medicare for All has stood out as a rarity. Even as she has unveiled policy plans at a rapid clip since launching her campaign on New Year's Eve, on the issue of health care, Warren has chosen to hold back from releasing a proposal of her own. Instead, she has stuck to publicly backing Sanders' Medicare for All -- a bill that she co-sponsored in the Senate -- and has not said that she will release a comprehensive health care plan of her own in the 2020 race.

""I'm with Bernie,"" Warren has previously said when asked about her vision on health care.

Tuesday's debate laid bare the political risks of Warren's backing of Sanders' Medicare for All, and foreshadowed that she is likely to continue confronting questions and criticism about tax hikes that could result from Sanders' proposal.

South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg summed up Warren's predicament this way: ""Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this."" Former Vice President Joe Biden accused Warren of being ""vague.""

Minnesota Sen. Klobuchar also joined the chorus, imploring her Senate colleague to acknowledge what Sanders himself had said earlier in the evening: ""I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up.""

""At least Bernie is being honest here, saying how he's going to pay for this -- taxes are going to go up,"" Klobuchar said. ""Sorry Elizabeth, you haven't said that. We owe it to the American people to tell them where we will send the invoice.""

The grilling continued well after the debate ended. In an interview with CNN anchors and analysts later that spanned close to 20 minutes, Warren was again pressed multiple times to acknowledge that Sanders' Medicare for All plan would result in tax hikes for some American families. Once again, she stuck to her script.

""My commitment is: I will not sign a bill into law that raises costs on middle class families,"" Warren said.

There have been earlier signs that Warren and her campaign were leaving open wiggle room on Medicare for All.

At a town hall in Keene, New Hampshire, last month, Warren referred to Medicare for All as a ""framework,"" saying: ""Right now, what we've got in Medicare for All is a framework and it doesn't have the details.""

The senator's senior adviser on the campaign, Joe Rospars , echoed that sentiment in a recent podcast interview, saying that some significant details have yet to be filled in on Sanders' Medicare for All plan.

""The question of the pay-for is: There's still a lot of details still to be filled in, in terms of both Bernie's bill that's out there but also the other versions of it, other candidates have their specific plans,"" Rospars said.

A veteran of Barack Obama's presidential campaigns, Rospars also said that he believes it's the ""overall cost"" of Medicare for All that most voters are focused on.

""I think there's a kind of disingenuousness to the — well, let's talk about taxes part of it,"" he said."

Bernie Sanders on his right and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to his left, for the next presidential debate, which will also feature a new face and a returning candidate among the dozen Democrats onstage vying for their party's nomination.

The stakes are incredibly high for the candidates participating in the CNN/New York Times Democratic presidential debate on October 15, as several candidates will likely need a breakout performance to remain competitive in this crowded primary field. For businessman Tom Steyer , it will be his first presidential debate, while Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard returns to the stage after failing to qualify for the September debate.

In all, 12 Democratic hopefuls will appear on the same stage for the debate: Biden, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, Gabbard, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, Sanders, Steyer, Warren and businessman Andrew Yang.

The Democratic National Committee's fourth sanctioned primary debate will air live at 8 p.m. ET from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, a northeast suburb of the state capital, Columbus. CNN anchors Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper and New York Times national editor Marc Lacey will serve as the debate moderators.

The 12 campaigns were required to submit paperwork to the DNC Wednesday morning certifying that their respective candidate achieved the fundraising and polling thresholds required to participate in the October debate. To receive an invitation to this debate, candidates needed to attain at least 2% in four separate DNC-approved polls and receive contributions from at least 130,000 unique donors, including at least 400 donors from 20 different states.

The two senators raised millions more in the third quarter, which ended Sept. 30, than the combination of the next three candidates who have so far announced their numbers.

Former Vice President Joe Biden amassed $15.2 million, according to his campaign, marking a decline from his previous fundraising haul, as did South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who raised $19.1 million. California Sen. Kamala Harris came in at $11.6 million, a sum consistent with her previous hauls.

Not every candidate has released their fundraising numbers yet. The deadline to file their third-quarter reports with the Federal Election Commission is October 15.

1. More upheaval at Homeland Security

""He had actually been able to curb border crossings and implement some of the administration's harshest policies, but he never really developed a trust with the President,"" Washington Post White House reporter Josh Dawsey said.

""Immigration is the core issue of his presidency,"" Dawsey said. ""So he has to find the fifth person in three years to lead the agency that's really key to his reelection.""

2. Democrats move closer to obtaining Trump's taxes

Democrats are closer than ever to getting their hands on a copy of Trump's tax returns.

The DC Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on Friday that Congress has every right to subpoena Trump's accounting firm for the returns as part of its oversight authority.

""The courts are starting to come to House Democrats' rescue,"" Washington Post congressional reporter Rachael Bade said. ""The problem for them is that the President of course is going to appeal this decision -- all of the decisions are going to end up in the Supreme Court, so it might not matter for now because they're going to keep dragging this out.""

Bade said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has suggested legislation that would require courts to move faster -- though it would have to pass the Republican-controlled Senate to become law.

3. A runoff in Louisiana

Bad news for Democrats in Saturday's Louisiana gubernatorial election.

Incumbent Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards failed to secure 50% of the vote against two Republicans who split the GOP vote -- which means now he's got a tougher one-on-one race with Republican Eddie Rispone.

""That makes his prospects much more difficult,"" Associated Press Washington Bureau Chief Julie Pace said, adding that it's a bad omen for the few Democratic elected officials left in the South.

""Edwards is the perfect profile for a Democrat in the deep South,"" Pace said. ""Another Democrat to watch in a similar circumstance is Alabama's Doug Jones, he's up for reelection next year. And Democrats need to hang on to that seat if they have any prospects of getting the Senate back. They have really, really tough prospects in the South.""

4. Warren on health care

But can the 2020 Democratic presidential contender get away with that line again at Tuesday's debate?

""I'm going to be looking out for how she responds to questions about Medicare for all,"" Wall Street Journal national political reporter Tarini Parti said. ""This is an issue her primary opponents have really been questioning her on, how she's going to pay for it.""

Parti said a source familiar with Warren's thinking told her they don't know yet what Medicare for All would cost, and so don't know yet what kind of revenue is needed to pay for it.

""So that's why they say she isn't responding to whether it's going to lead to an increase in taxes or not,"" Parti said. ""Different plans have different costs associated with them, so they're still trying to figure that part out.""

5. What's Gabbard's game?

And from CNN senior political reporter Nia-Malika Henderson:

While Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has said she is ""seriously considering"" boycotting Tuesday's Democratic presidential debate over what she says is a rigged process, our guess is that the Democratic presidential candidate will very likely be there in Ohio.

And if her July debate appearance is any guide, a few people on that stage should worry. Gabbard has proven to be a wild card in the Democratic primary, where she is polling at about 2%.

She got the best of California Sen. Kamala Harris in a previous debate, and Tuesday is a chance for a rematch. And for Gabbard it's also a chance to go after any number of other candidates -- like South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar -- as they vie to move up in the polls.

While those candidates look to make gains by going after candidates in the center of the stage, they might also want to be ready for what could come from the far ends of it, where some of the sharpest attacks have often been launched by candidates with little to lose."

The law that established the CFPB says the President may not remove the director except for ""inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.""

But critics -- including the Trump administration, current director Kathleen Kraninger , as well as a law firm fighting a CFPB-led investigation -- argue in court briefs that a restriction on the President's authority to remove the director at will, including over policy disagreements, ""violates the Constitution's separation of powers.""

In a move that could prove critical, the court also said it will entertain the question of whether the provision of the Dodd-Frank Act that created the bureau should also be struck.

That move ""radically ratchets up the stakes of what was already a high-stakes separation-of-powers dispute,"" said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.

The tagline — with its unfortunate double-meaning — was reported by the Washington Post, which obtained excerpts of the speech in advance, merely hours after several new polls suggested that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) had surged past Biden into first place in the race for the Democratic Party’s 2020 presidential nomination.

A Monmouth Poll of early primary states released Wednesday found Warren (28%) ahead of Biden (25%) by 3% — barely within the poll’s 3.1% margin of error. A new YouGov/Economist poll found Warren (28%) ahead of Biden (22%) by 6%.

Moreover, the breaking news that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), 78, had been admitted to hospital for emergency heart surgery also drew attention to Biden’s age (76) and his own history of health problems.

Still, Biden wanted Trump — and Democrats — to know that he would fight on, in response to Trump’s charges that he and his son, Hunter, were “stone-cold crooked.” The Washington Post reported from his remarks, as prepared for delivery:

“Let me make something clear to Trump and his hatchet men and the special interests funding his attacks against me — I’m not going anywhere,” Biden will say. “You’re not going to destroy me. And you’re not going to destroy my family. I don’t care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get.” … Biden said Trump sought to discredit him and his family because, “like every bully in history—he’s afraid. He’s afraid of just how badly I would beat him next November.”

The Post concluded its story by quoting Biden: “Nobody has ever asserted that I did anything wrong except he and what’s that fellow’s name? Rudy Udi? Giuliani?”

It was a rough-and-tumble welcome in the arena for a candidate who has gamely sidestepped attacks in previous debates. But at the CNN/New York Times debate Tuesday night in the crucial swing state of Ohio, the Massachusetts senator was constantly on defense driving her central argument that Democrats must ""dream big"" and ""fight hard."" All the fire sent in Warren's direction at Otterbein University underscored a marked shift in the Democratic race that has been underway for many weeks: while former Vice President Joe Biden has remained strong in the polls, the other candidates in the race clearly now see Warren as the real competition.

It was one of the first times Warren had to face a barrage of critiques from her Democratic competitors, navigating many of the critical comments usually aimed toward Biden or Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

It was the moderates in the race who targeted the newly minted front-runner the most. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg set that aggressive tone from the opening moments of the debate as he sought to seize the centrist lane within the Democratic field. Challenging Warren on her refusal to answer a yes-or-no questions about whether her plan would lead to tax hikes from the middle class, he said her evasiveness embodied the very reason why Americans are so frustrated with Washington.

""Your signature is to have a plan for everything, except this,"" Buttigieg said to Warren. ""No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this plan that Sen. Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.""

In a strong performance, Buttigieg repeatedly argued that Democrats would not be able to sell some of Warren's more liberal ideas -- namely ""Medicare for All"" -- to the broader universe of voters that the party must sway to win the White House.

""I don't understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage is to obliterate private plans,"" Buttigieg said to Warren. ""We're competing to be president for the day after Trump. Our country will be polarized, more than now. After everything we have been through, after everything we are about to go through, this country will be more divided. Why divide this country over health care when there's a better way to deliver coverage for all?""

Warren did not back down, but at times seemed surprised by the force of the attacks against her -- even from the normally mild-mannered former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke who accused her of embracing a philosophy that was punitive.

""Look, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,"" she said.

Buttigieg's arguments were often amplified by Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who also leaned heavily on her Midwestern roots to argue that Warren and Sanders have driven the party too far to the left. In one tense exchange, the Minnesota senator referred to ""Medicare for All"" -- a proposal that was crafted by Sanders and endorsed by Warren -- as a ""pipe-dream.""

""The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done,"" Klobuchar said.

""At least Bernie is being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this -- and that taxes are going to go up,"" she added. ""We owe it to the American people to tell them where we will send the invoice.""

At another point Warren was repeatedly badgered by California Sen. Kamala Harris, who tried to force her into agreeing with Harris's proposal that Trump should be thrown off Twitter. It was then that Warren showed a touch of exasperation.

""Look, I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter, I want to push him out of the White House,"" Warren said.

Biden touts record, Sanders thanks well-wishers

While he often receded into the background on Tuesday night, Biden argued that he had done bigger things than anyone else on stage, citing the Violence Against Women Act as one example.

Though he did not take on Warren as aggressively as some of the others, he tried at one point to take credit for getting the votes in Congress to make her idea for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau a reality. ""I got votes for that bill,"" Biden said, referring to the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act that established the bureau. ""I convinced people to vote for it, so let's get those things straight too,"" he said.

Pushing back on that idea, Warren offered her thanks to Biden's then-boss, President Barack Obama and everyone else who helped create the agency -- pointedly not mentioning the former vice president.

""I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law,"" Warren said.

Biden, grinning as he stood beside her, graciously offered a compliment: ""You did a hell of a job in your job,"" he said to her.

""Thank you,"" she replied.

When the conversation turned to the age of the three leading candidates -- Biden, Sanders and Warren -- who are all in their 70s, Biden also sought to frame his age as an asset. He promised to release his health records, along with some two decades of his tax information.

""Look, one of the reasons I'm running is because of my age and my experience,"" Biden said. ""With it comes wisdom. We need someone to take office this time around who on day one can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders from Putin to our allies, and know exactly what has to be done to get this country back on track.""

Sanders, who was back on the trail for the first time since his heart attack, tried to allay any concerns about his stamina by stating that he's ""healthy"" and ""feeling great."" The 78-year-old also offered his thanks for the well wishes he has received over the past two weeks.

""Let me take this moment if I might to thank so many people from all over this country, including many of my colleagues up here, for their love, for their prayers, for their well wishes,"" he said. ""And I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, and I'm so happy to be back here with you this evening.""

Gabbard spars with Buttigieg

Facing the Democratic Party's increasingly difficult threshold to make the next debate in Georgia, some of the lower tier candidates clearly knew that they needed to generate a jolt of energy for their campaigns on Tuesday night. But the only candidate at that level who drew notice was Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii.

Gabbard, an Iraq War veteran who served in the Army, has called for US troops to leave Syria and she sparred with Buttigieg -- the only other veteran on the stage -- over US engagement in that conflict.

The Hawaii congresswoman criticized Trump's sudden decision to abandon Kurdish forces near the northern Syrian border -- a move that essentially opened the door for a Turkish military offensive against the longtime US allies. She described the ""slaughter of Kurds"" by Turkey as a consequence of ""the regime-change war that we've been waging in Syria.""

""Donald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hands -- but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime-change war in Syria that started in 2011,"" Gabbard said, ""along with many in the mainstream media, who have been championing and cheerleading this regime-change war.""

Buttigieg, who served in the Navy Reserve, told Gabbard she was ""dead wrong.""

""The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this President of American allies and American values,"" Buttigieg said.

He noted that he did not support going into Iraq and believes that the US should get out of Afghanistan, but said it was also the case that ""a small number of specialized, special operations forces and intelligence capabilities were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and what we're seeing now, which is the beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS.""

""When I was deployed I knew one of the things keeping me safe was the flag on my shoulder represented a country that kept its word,"" Buttigieg said. ""You take that away, it takes away what makes America America."""
313,"Analysis by Brandon Tensley, CNN",,"It was another instance of that most common of events: a woman, diminished.",2019-10-09,CNN,Analysis: Warren pregnancy debate another example of sexism in the guise of scrutiny,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/09/politics/elizabeth-warren-pregnancy-discrimination-sexism/index.html,"Washington (CNN) It was another instance of that most common of events: a woman, diminished.

Earlier this week, Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator and Democratic presidential candidate, was asked about a story that she's mentioned often on the campaign trail: In 1971, when she was 22 years old and completing her first year of teaching, she lost her job once it became clear that she was visibly pregnant. It was, she tweeted , ""an experience millions of women will recognize.""

But over the past few days, conservative news sites and mainstream outlets either have sought to directly refute Warren's account or have disputed it in such a way that it seems as if there's some reason to doubt that a school in the early 1970s would fire a pregnant woman. But that kind of discrimination continues today. (As The New York Times documented earlier this year , American companies still ""systematically sideline"" pregnant women by, for instance, passing them over for promotions.)

Warren's story, however, fits into a much larger pattern, one that will indeed be familiar to many women: It's the tradition of sexism in the guise of scrutiny.

Consider how, this same week, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, another Democratic presidential hopeful, was pulled into a case at the global law firm DLA Piper , where a junior partner alleges that one of the company's higher-ups sexually assaulted her four times. Harris' only connection to the firm is that her husband is one of its hundreds of partners.

Yet that hasn't prevented the junior partner's lawyer from trying to use Harris' star power to bring attention to a case not meaningfully related to the senator. (In response, a statement from Harris' communications director underscores that the senator ""has been and continues to be a staunch advocate for survivors and believes all people must be guaranteed their day in court."")

By contrast, in the wake of the revelation last week that Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont suffered a heart attack , that gendered line of questioning has been noticeably absent from political chatter. Sanders, instead, has received the kid-gloves treatment.

Each of these examples is, in its own way, a distillation of age-old policing mechanisms and double standards. Each also shines a light on the inveterate sexism -- women as unreliable narrators, women as answerable for their husbands' professional lives, women as weak -- that still, today, takes up so much space in the narrative.

Or to use Warren's own words, ""I don't know what else you'd call it."""

CNBC reports that during a livestreamed employee Q&A call this week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed a number of topics including politics. Zuckerberg was asked to respond to Senator Bernie Sanders’s comment that billionaires should not exist, and gave a surprising answer given that Zuckerberg himself is worth $69 billion.

“I understand where he’s coming from,” Zuckerberg said. “I don’t know that I have an exact threshold on what amount of money someone should have but on some level no one deserves to have that much money.”

Zuckerberg was also asked about comments he made during two separate leaked internal Q&A sessions he had with employees in July. Zuckerberg is quoted as saying: “You have someone like Elizabeth Warren that thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies … I mean, if she gets elected president then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge.”

Zuckerberg adds: “And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don’t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. I mean, that’s not the position that you want to be in when you’re, you know, I mean … It’s like, we care about our country, and want to work with our government and do good things. But look, at the end of the day, if someone’s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and fight.”

Zuckerberg stated in the recent public Q&A that he stands by his comments about Warren but added: “let’s try not to antagonize her further.” Zuckerberg was also asked about how the firm determines what counts as fake news that should be removed, Zuckerberg clarified that the main objective is to stamp out “complete and obvious hoaxes.”

“When we talk about misinformation, a lot of people focus on a statement that isn’t clear if it’s a shade of true or partially false,” he said. “There’s a lot of stuff that people say that is completely false. That’s the thing that I’m really focused on and making sure that we [stop].”

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has been hospitalized with serious heart problems, what had already been a bad week for former Vice President Joe Biden has just gotten even worse.

I’ll get to the why of that in a bit, but let’s first take a look at all the other bad news.

The Polls

As I have said since the beginning, the only polls I’m going to take seriously are post-Labor Day, after summer is over and people are actually paying attention to the race. It was and still is my belief that while enjoying the summer months, Democrat voters parked their votes on tried-and-true Uncle Joe but that this could change after people started to tune in.

Well, tuning in, they are, and Biden’s slide is very real and may not have yet reached bottom.

According to the Real Clear Politics poll of polls, Biden went from a double-digit national lead ten days ago to just a two-point lead today.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is climbing, is attracting the crowds, while Slow Joe falls and can hardly attract flies.

In the all-important early primary states, Biden is losing in Iowa, is only three points up in New Hampshire (Warren leads in the two most recent polls), and only two points up in Nevada. (Warren and Biden are tied in the latest poll.)

Biden’s firewall in South Carolina remains strong — he’s up by 22 points, but if he loses New Hampshire and Iowa, he will have to make history to win the Democrat nomination.

The Picture

Last month, Joe Biden told us, “I’ve never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.”

That is a flat-out lie.

This entire scandal revolves around Biden’s son Hunter, who made more than $50,000 a month — a month! — for sitting on the board of a Ukrainian oil company. The problem, of course, is that Hunter has no experience whatsoever in that field and that when Hunter scored that sweet gig, then-President Obama had put Joe Biden in charge of dealing with Ukraine.

What’s more, once a Ukrainian prosecutor began to look into Hunter’s company, Joe threatened to withhold crucial U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired — which he was.

Now, liars in the media, serial liars like Jake Tapper, are lying about this — saying the prosecutor was not looking into Hunter Biden’s company when Daddy Joe forced him out, but this very same prosecutor has signed an affidavit under penalty of perjury saying that he was.

Anyway, back to the lie…

To begin with, we know Daddy Joe spoke to Hunter about his shady, overseas business dealings because in an interview with the New Yorker, Hunter said they spoke about his shady, overseas business dealings.

But now, we have nothing less than photographic proof…

Look at this, y’all… An actual photograph of then-Vice President Joe Biden and his ne’er-do-well son out golfing with a board member of the company that hired No-Experience-Hunter.

That’s whatchoo call a clean bust.

The Pulmonary

While we all hope and pray Bernie Sanders makes a full and speedy recovery, the political reality of the matter is still the political reality of the matter.

While on the campaign trail, Bernie felt chest pains, was rushed to the hospital, and surgery was performed to implant two heart stents. Bernie is still in the hospital, his presidential campaign is suspended, as is his political advertising.

This is a serious and significant development, but not just for Bernie.

Bernie Sanders is 78-years-old.

Joe Biden will be 77 next month.

And let’s not forget that until today’s news, Bernie was by far the most robust and energetic of the two.

After all, it was Joe Biden’s eye that filled with blood on TV just a few weeks ago, and it was Joe Biden’s teeth that came loose during a national debate last month, and it has been Joe Biden taking it easy on the campaign trail, going on vacation, disappearing for days at a time, etc.

If Democrats are smart, they will remember the lesson of 2016 when an obviously frail, sickly, and weak Hillary Clinton collapsed into a van at that September 11 memorial event.

While I have always made fun of Bernie’s age, I have also always used him as an example of what a robust 78-year-old looks like, how it is possible to be virile and vibrant into your late seventies. In fact, I have used Bernie as an example to explain just how frail and old Joe Biden looks by comparison.

Nothing terrifies Democrats more than the idea of Trump’s second term, and Bernie’s health scare will probably serve as a reality check that will have them rethinking their support for these pushing-80 candidates. What they are imagining right now is what a catastrophe this would have been had Bernie won the general election.

Naturally, then, these thoughts are going to turn to Slow Joe and the fact that if this happened to Bernie, there is an even bigger chance it will happen to Joe, who was never as energetic or full of fire as Bernie.

This reality check could also hurt Warren, who is 70. If she wins the nomination, she will be 71 and the oldest presidential nominee (from either party) in history.

Sure, Warren seems spry and energetic but … so did Bernie.

Regardless, this has been a very bad week for Quid Pro Joe … and it is only Wednesday.

In public, Zuckerberg is all humility. Mark Zuckerberg: “I’m Really Sorry That This Happened” could be any headline about a Facebook data scandal in the past two years. His 2018 speech to European politicians was an apology. His remarks before Congress were an apology. After the Cambridge Analytica affair, Facebook took out full-page newspaper ads in ten newspapers, apologizing.

In private, however, the Facebook CEO sings a different tune, promising defiance against regulators and politicians, and joking about how he can’t be fired.

In leaked audio obtained by the Verge, Zuckerberg pledges to fight against any regulation of big tech pushed by Elizabeth Warren or any other politician.

That doesn’t mean that, even if there’s anger and that you have someone like Elizabeth Warren who thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies … I mean, if she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge….at the end of the day, if someone’s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.

He said it was particularly important that Facebook and other big tech companies aren’t broken up, because only they’re big enough to censor everyone — or stop “hate speech,” in the Facebook founder’s words.

You know, [breaking up big tech] doesn’t make election interference less likely. It makes it more likely because now the companies can’t coordinate and work together. It doesn’t make any of the hate speech or issues like that less likely. It makes it more likely because now … all the processes that we’re putting in place and investing in, now we’re more fragmented. [emphasis added]

He also mocked Twitter for not being big enough to censor as efficiently as Facebook.

It’s why Twitter can’t do as good of a job as we can. I mean, they face, qualitatively, the same types of issues. But they can’t put in the investment. Our investment on safety is bigger than the whole revenue of their company. [laughter]

Zuckerberg’s answer to global scrutiny from national governments? Just ignore them, if they’re not big enough to matter! (Fun fact, Facebook has revenues greater than the GDP of Serbia, and would be the 90th-wealthiest country in the world if it were a country).

I did hearings in the US. I did hearings in the EU. It just doesn’t really make sense for me to go to hearings in every single country that wants to have me show up and, frankly, doesn’t have jurisdiction to demand that.

Does the arrogance and the commitment to massive investments to fight “hate speech” concern you? Too bad — Zuckerberg isn’t going anywhere:

kind of have voting control of the company, and that’s something I focused on early on. And it was important because, without that, there were several points where I would’ve been fired. For sure, for sure…

In the early days of Facebook, reporters obtained a now-infamous message from Zuckerberg in which he mocked the platform’s users as “dumb f**cks” for trusting him with their personal data.

Insincere contrition in public, and cavalier arrogance in private. Not much has changed!

Candidates will have to reach 3% in at least four DNC-approved polls of Democratic voters nationally or in one of the four early-voting states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. The change is a 1 percentage point increase over the threshold for the September and October debates. Candidates also have a new option of reaching at least 5% in two polls of the early-voting states.

Candidates hoping to qualify need contributions from at least 165,000 individuals, coming from at least 600 unique donors in 20 or more states. The deadline for qualifying polls and donations for the November debate will be November 13 at 11:59 p.m., according to the DNC.

In Thursday's letter, Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz blasted Facebook for what he called a ""deeply flawed"" policy, saying it gives ""blanket permission"" for candidates to use the platform to ""mislead American voters all while Facebook profits from their advertising dollars."" The ad was paid for by a political action committee called The Committee to Defend the President.

Schultz wrote that the campaign will continue to mount challenges, saying, ""In the coming days and weeks, Facebook will be hearing from us about these concerns, which are shared by countless other candidates, citizens, and organizations that prioritize the health of American democracy.""

In an email obtained by CNN from Facebook's head of global elections policy, Katie Harbath, Facebook replied that the ad in question is not currently active on the platform.

""The ad you wrote us about is currently inactive on our platform and is not running. Should it become active it would then be sent to third party fact checkers where they would have the option to review it,"" Harbath said."

Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are riding waves of small donations. Billionaire Tom Steyer plowed eye-popping sums into his presidential campaign. And one White House contender reported raising just $5 during an entire three-month period. That's not a typo: yes, $5.

Here's a look at some of the key takeaways from third-quarter reports Democratic candidates just filed with federal election regulators:

Joe Biden burned through his money

Biden burned through his campaign donations over the summer -- spending more money than he took in and leaving him with just a fraction of the cash available to several of his better-funded rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Biden's campaign entered October with $8.98 million remaining in its bank account, after spending more than $17.6 million during the July-to-September quarter.

Biden raised nearly $15.7 million during the quarter, according to a report filed by his campaign late Tuesday, shortly after the conclusion of the Democratic presidential debate in Westerville, Ohio, sponsored by CNN and The New York Times.

Biden's cash position a little more than three months before the Iowa caucuses puts him at a big financial disadvantage to rivals such as Sanders, who reported having $33.7 million stockpiled for the primary slog ahead.

Two other Democratic presidential candidates -- Warren and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg -- have each stockpiled more than $20 million.

What's Biden spending money on? One-quarter of Biden's spending in the three-month period went to payroll, his filings show. His campaign also spent more than $920,000 on private planes.

Speaking to reporters Tuesday night following the debate, Biden's aides downplayed the campaign's financial hurdles.

""We've always said that we think this race is going to be a dog fight, that it's going to go long,"" campaign spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield said. ""We are 100% confident that we have what we need to run our race.""

Small donations add up for Sanders, Warren

Sanders relied on small-dollar donations for about 60% of his contributions over the summer -- giving him a pool of donors to tap repeatedly before they hit legal contribution limits.

Nearly $15 million -- or about 61% -- of the money Warren raised from individual contributors during the July-to-September fundraising quarter came from donors who donated $200 or less to the senator's presidential campaign. That helped her post one of the biggest fundraising hauls in the crowded field of Democrats vying to face President Donald Trump next year.

By comparison, small donations accounted for less than a third of Biden's donors.

Warren and Sanders, who represent the ultra-progressive wing of their party, swore off big-dollar fundraising in their campaigns for the Democratic presidential nomination, and their financial strength underscores the enthusiasm of online donors in the 2020 election.

They both outraised Biden and Buttigieg -- candidates who have relied, in part, on larger donors to fuel their White House ambitions.

""The concept is now proven: Candidates who want to focus on the people's agenda and be fueled by the people can totally succeed,"" Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and a Warren supporter, told CNN this week. ""That's a sea change.""

Warren recently promised to go further and forgo high-dollar fundraisers in the general election should she win the nomination, a stance that drew sharp criticism from Buttigieg.

""We're not going to beat Donald Trump with pocket change,"" he told Snapchat host Peter Hamby this week.

Staying power for Buttigieg, too

Buttigieg also spent heavily in the July-to-September period -- as he raced to assemble a staff of more than 300 nationally and build a ground game in Iowa ahead of the February 3 caucuses.

He raised a solid $19.1 million during the third quarter -- falling behind only Sanders and Warren. Despite his heavy spending, Buttigieg's strong fundraising over the course of the year has left him flush with cash. He started October with nearly $23.4 million available in his campaign accounts.

His campaign attracted some bold-faced donors in recent months, including designer Isaac Mizrahi and actresses Alyssa Milano and Jennifer Garner.

But here's a sobering statistic for Buttigieg and the entire Democratic field: Trump's campaign committee started October with $83.2 million in leftover funds. That's more cash on hand than held by the three top Democratic fundraisers combined.

Self-funding candidates

Steyer plowed a staggering $47.6 million of his hedge-fund fortune into his longshot bid for the White House, filings show. Other contributors donated $2 million, helping him fulfill the minimum donor threshold set by the Democratic National Committee to join Tuesday's debate.

Steyer is not the only self-funder in the race.

Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney continues to put his own money into the race. He donated $400,000 of his own funds to the campaign in the third quarter of this year.

How low can you go?

Among the 12 Democratic candidates who faced off on Tuesday night's debate stage, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro faces the biggest financial peril. The former mayor of San Antonio, Texas, raised nearly $3.5 million, but had just $672,000 remaining in his bank account at the end of September.

Former Reps. Beto O'Rourke of Texas and Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii had $3.3 million and $2.1 million, respectively, remaining in their bank accounts. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who also joined Tuesday's debate and made forceful attacks on Warren, had nearly $3.7 million left over in her campaign accounts.

Way, way back in the fundraising pack: Wayne Messam, the Miramar, Florida, mayor who has never gained traction in the Democratic presidential nomination.

His campaign reported receipts of exactly $5 in the July-to-September fundraising period in its filing with the Federal Election Commission. And because federal law doesn't require candidates to report details on donors who provide $200 or less to a campaign, it's hard to tell who provided the money. (Messam has had to correct his filings in the past; earlier this year he filed an amended report after mistakenly reporting he had raised nearly twice as much as he had actually collected.)

Tuesday's reports show the Democrat still had a little more than $31,000 remaining in his campaign's bank account.

(CNN) President Donald Trump's ears must have been burning as Democrats met in Ohio at the most crowded presidential debate in US history on Tuesday.

The 12 candidates at the CNN/New York Times debate conjured up visions of a vastly different America should they evict him from the White House in 2020. They'd reverse Trump's erratic, ""America First"" twists and turns, and restore the US leadership in the world -- somehow. But as the heated exchanges on health care, tax and billionaires showed, the Democratic Party still doesn't know how far left it wants to go.

Who won and lost a debate often takes a few days to become clear as viral moments ignite on social media and voters chew over the post-game analysis. But the early money suggests that this debate will not shake up the wider shape of the race. Former Vice President Joe Biden is a wobbly front runner. Elizabeth Warren has joined him in the top tier (and attacks that she faced on Tuesday night -- the most withering of her career -- show that the rest of the field knows it.)

While some outsiders did well -- like 30-something Pete Buttigieg and centrist Senator Amy Klobuchar, who brought sharp knives for Warren -- everyone else is still struggling to get a look in.

Four takeaways that will shape the campaign

The shadow of impeachment

Joe Biden, reaching for gravitas, said Trump's presidency was ""the most corrupt in modern history and all of our history."" Kamala Harris said the President had ""committed crimes in plain sight."" Elizabeth Warren said this was ""bigger than politics."" Whatever happens with the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump will tear America even further apart. And if one of the men or women on stage beats him at the polls, they'll end up with the job of trying to put it back together.

What about the Kurds?

All of the candidates agreed Trump was wrong to abruptly remove US troops from the side of Kurdish allies in Syria. But there was a strong isolationist strain onstage, in keeping with the mood of a nation exhausted by foreign wars. Co-frontrunner Warren did not quarrel with Trump's instinct to bring troops home, just with how he's doing it. ""I think we want to get out of the Middle East. I do think we should do it responsibly,"" she said. Until further notice, that is America's message to the rest of the world.

So that's what it's like to be a front-runner

Elizabeth Warren now knows what it's like to have a target on her back. Her rise to effective co-front-runner status exposed her to attacks from all sides on Tuesday. Both Buttigieg and Klobuchar piled on -- seeking to grab the middle ground of many Democrats who fear Warren and Sanders are too left wing. ""The difference between a plan and a pipedream is something you can actually get done,"" said Klobuchar, desperate for a viral moment as she struggles to reach polling thresholds to get her into the next debate.

In one of the most electric moments of the campaign, Biden and Warren -- the two most likely nominees -- clashed directly for the first time.

What heart attack?

Those two stents inserted into one of Bernie Sanders' arteries did the trick. The Vermont senator was ""feeling great"" and keen to wrest the debate away from Trump-bashing and back to his wheelhouse: health care, student debt and getting rid of billionaires. Sanders supporters will be relieved. But millions of moderate Americans watching at home might be more concerned at his frank admission that taxes will go up to pay for his ambitious social reforms.

Shameful. Shameful!

That was Biden letting off steam at Trump's decision to let Syria roll into northeastern Syria at the expense of America's Kurdish allies. The former vice president has much to vent about the President.

Brexit interlude

There's a generally held view of the European Union as an 11th hour decision-maker, working its way out of difficulties with late-night summits fueled by dozens of cups of coffee and pastries, and prime ministers and presidents only staggering out after midnight to announce a breakthrough.

Sometimes that really is what happens (it's also not uncommon for heads of state convening in Brussels to nip out for frites and a beer during negotiating breaks) but that's not how the EU likes to do things.

In fact, the European Council prefers to have its agenda set two weeks ahead of each summit. That gives the Commission -- its executive body -- time to analyze everything and make recommendations to member states, who also have to prepare. But Brexit is no ordinary agenda item.

This month, the EU has blown through one self-imposed deadline after another, as they try to settle the conditions of a UK exit from the union, before heads of government start turning up in Brussels. On Tuesday, they missed another deadline. As things stand now, no one will have time to digest any Brexit deal before the Thursday summit -- which could mean more stale pastries, fries and head-scratching in the middle of the night, instead.

Who said it? Debate edition

""I don't need lessons from you on courage — political or personal.""

""That is dead wrong.""

""It didn't work in 2016 and it will be a disaster for us in 2020.""

What good is a 12-person debate anyway?

Glad you asked.

The US electoral map is so vast that most Americans only see presidential candidates on TV, so these events are necessary for Democratic officials to build enthusiasm among voters, reaching tens of millions of viewers -- and not just Democrats. And the crowded field offers more than a soundbite fest — it fleshes out a broader divide between liberal and moderate positions that grassroots voters must adjudicate before choosing a candidate.

There is something quintessentially American about opening the White House race to everyone. The last two US presidents have been a rookie senator from Illinois and a businessman from New York with almost no political experience between them and little in common. Debates are part of a process that must be sufficiently elastic to accommodate sharp shifts in public opinion over a four year cycle.

In a populist age, party elites fear charges of dictating voters' choices, and the field will narrow soon enough anyway. When it does, the debates will have been good practice for the eventual Democratic nominee, who must debate Donald Trump a year from now. Whether they're the right way to pick a decent president is a whole other ballgame."

Zuckerbe… [+1595 chars]","Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is set to deliver what he says is his most ""comprehensive take"" yet on freedom of expression Thursday in Washington, amid a roiling controversy over how the company handles political speech.",2019-10-17,CNN,Mark Zuckerberg giving speech on freedom of expression,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/17/tech/mark-zuckerberg-free-expression-speech-georgetown/index.html,"Washington (CNN Business) Facebook ( FB ) CEO Mark Zuckerberg sought to recast the challenges facing his company in a historical light on Thursday, describing social media as a kind of ""Fifth Estate"" and describing politicians' calls to clamp down on tech companies as an effort to restrict the freedom of expression.

In a speech citing landmark Supreme Court cases and historical figures such as Frederick Douglass, Zuckerberg told an audience at Georgetown University that during times of social upheaval, policymakers have instinctively sought to limit the freedom of speech.

""The impulse is to pull back from free expression,"" he said. But, he continued, ""We are at a crossroads. We can either stand for free expression ... or we can decide the cost is simply too great. We must continue to stand for free expression.""

Zuckerberg had said in a Facebook post Wednesday that the speech would reflect his lengthy, ""unfiltered"" views on threats to free speech worldwide and the speech-related problems that the internet has created.

Speaking with a tinge of wonder and amazement in his voice, Zuckerberg offered soaring assessments of social media's promise, citing powerful movements that organized digitally such as #MeToo and Black Lives Matter — the latter of which, he said, first became a hashtag on Facebook itself.

But invoking civil rights icons like Martin Luther King, Jr. and historic cultural uprisings didn't sit well with Zuckerberg's critics in the civil rights community. Alicia Garza, a cofounder of Black Lives Matter, said Thursday that Zuckerberg had co-opted the organization's name to make a point.

""If he wants to use our movement to claim support for Black communities, then Black lives have to matter more than his bottom line,"" Garza tweeted

Color of Change, a civil rights advocacy group, said Facebook needs to be held to a higher standard.

""Facebook's ultimate hypocrisy,"" it said, ""is touting the platform's contributions to social justice movements like Black Lives Matter, but simultaneously rejecting any of the rules or regulations that would actually protect Black lives.""

Last spring, the largest Black Lives Matter page on Facebook was shut down after CNN revealed that the page was a scam tied to a middle-aged white man in Australia. The page helped raise thousands of dollars for the movement, but at least some of the money was later transferred to Australian bank accounts. Black Lives Matter had contacted Facebook about the page months earlier, suspecting it was a scam, but Facebook did not suspend the page until CNN's reporting.

During the speech, Zuckerberg pushed back on criticism of Facebook's handling of political advertising, saying he briefly considered banning political ads entirely from Facebook.

""From a business perspective,"" he said, ""the controversy certainly is not worth the very small part of our business that they make up."" But he ultimately decided against a ban, he said, concluding that political ads ""can be an important part of voice"" and that even if Facebook eliminated political ads from its platform, other types of ads could come under scrutiny as well, and it would be difficult to draw a line.

""I don't think most people want to live in a world where you can only post things that tech companies judge to be 100 percent true,"" Zuckerberg said.

Zuckerberg went on to discuss how tech companies — including his — pose a potential threat to freedom of expression, and returned to a familiar argument: That independent bodies should be responsible for developing rules and norms surrounding content.

He then pivoted to argue for his company's forthcoming oversight board , which will give users the ability to appeal Facebook's content decisions to a panel of outside experts.

Zuckerberg also reiterated another claim: That efforts to restrict US tech companies could lead to unintended consequences such as allowing Chinese competitors to dictate the terms of speech and innovation.

""If another nation's platforms set the rules, our nation's discourse could be set by a completely different set of values,"" he said. ""We should be proactive and write policies that help free expression triumph around the world.""

The entrepreneur said his concerns about freedom of expression extend beyond the United States, underscoring how Zuckerberg views himself and his company as being at the center of an epic struggle of ideas that has stretched on for centuries.

""Increasingly, we're seeing countries try to impose their speech restrictions beyond their country,"" Zuckerberg said during a question-and-answer session with students. He slammed a recent ruling by the European Court of Justice holding that Facebook can be required to delete content worldwide that is considered illegal in individual European countries.

""This is incredibly problematic and troubling,"" Zuckerberg added, saying there will undoubtedly be future litigation that Facebook will participate in seeking to establish how that ruling should be implemented.

Faced with two questions — one about allegations of Facebook's bias against conservatives and one about Facebook's outreach to conservatives — Zuckerberg quipped, to laughter: ""I think it would be hard to be biased against both sides.""

Facebook has recently found itself at the center of a debate about truthfulness in political ads after Facebook declined to remove an ad by President Trump's campaign that contained unfounded allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden. The result has been an uproar over Facebook's policy allowing politicians to lie in their campaign advertisements.

Bill Russo, a spokesman for Biden's campaign, accused Zuckerberg on Thursday of having ""attempted to use the Constitution as a shield for his company's bottom line.""

""His choice to cloak Facebook's policy in a feigned concern for free expression,"" he added, ""demonstrates how unprepared his company is for this unique moment in our history and how little it has learned over the past few years.""

Facebook and many legal experts have defended the company's right not to censor political candidates, but some critics including Sen. Elizabeth Warren have slammed the company for running what Warren termed a ""disinformation-for-profit machine.""

Asked about calls by politicians including Warren for the breakup of Facebook, Zuckerberg referred to a previously leaked recording of his remarks at a companywide meeting at which he'd acknowledged that a Warren presidency could mean an antitrust lawsuit filed by the US seeking that breakup. Zuckerberg at first said he didn't have much more to add. But in the event of a lawsuit to break up the company, he said, ""of course we'll stand up for ourselves and for what we believe is right.""

Despite the companies' efforts, concerns about the tech industry's handling of offensive speech and disinformation have continued to mount as the 2020 election cycle gets underway.

Google GOOG Facebook has launched a civil rights task force to monitor for election and census interference, andhas hired some 10,000 employees worldwide to tackle content moderation.

But skeptics say the companies have dragged their feet for too long. At a congressional hearing Wednesday, Oregon Republican Rep. Greg Walden said social media companies have been too ""slow to clean up"" their platforms while too quick to claim legal immunity for content under a law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.

""Many of our concerns can be readily addressed if companies just enforce their terms of service,"" said Walden."

(CNN) In Tuesday night's Democratic presidential debate, I'm afraid most of the candidates blended into the stage for me at some point. But that doesn't mean there wasn't a star among them. Here's how each candidate performed:

Bernie Sanders: A

Throughout the three-hour event, Sen. Sanders was consistently sharper than normal, and he outperformed the others, especially Elizabeth Warren, when explaining the financials of his healthcare plan. I liked his attitude about his health: we can judge it by watching him take the campaign by storm. He was the star of the evening.

Sanders remained firm and defiant when it was called for, asserting that nobody can trust our foreign policy because President Donald Trump is unpredictable. And when Joe Biden heated up toward the end of the debate, saying,""I'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done,"" Sanders was ready to put things in perspective by replying: ""You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country. You got trade agreements, like NAFTA (The North American Free Trade Agreement) and PNTR (Permanent Normal Trade Relations), with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs.""

Overall, Sanders' nonverbal communication -- typically hyper with lots of hand-waving -- was reined in, and that served him well. His animation was kept to a minimum, which was smart and effective.

Kamala Harris: A-

Sen. Harris flourished by doing the opposite of Sanders. Rather than being restrained, she brought a bit more energy to her debate performance, which she needed.

On the topic of abortion, nobody was more powerful than Harris, who declared: ""Women are the majority of the population in this country. People need to keep their hands off of women's bodies and let women make the decisions about their own lives."" And Harris got the better of Elizabeth Warren when asking Warren to support the suspension of President Trump's Twitter account.

But a couple of stories didn't land. For instance, when debating a tax credit to close the income gap, Harris told a childhood anecdote about her mom sitting at the kitchen table wondering how to ""make it all work."" In the past, Harris has hit home runs with these personal stories, but this time around, she had none that were especially memorable.

Pete Buttigieg: B

Mayor Pete was pretty effective in policy arguments. He provided several options for depoliticizing the Supreme Court, and more than held his own on health care and gun control. Buttigieg also won most of the direct skirmishes he entered with other candidates. He got the best of Tulsi Gabbard when discussing Syria and keeping our military commitments. He called out Elizabeth Warren when she failed to satisfactorily explain how she'd pay for Medicare for All.

But then he slipped up when he made a back-and-forth about gun control with Beto O'Rourke needlessly personal. After O'Rourke remarked that policymakers should ""lead and not be limited by the polls and the consultants and the focus groups,"" Buttigieg retorted: ""I don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal."" The remark seemed to come from left field. Mayor Pete responded as if he was called a coward, but that simply wasn't the case.

Phantom attacks like these happen often in competitive debates when expectations of an opponent's arguments don't always match the reality of what has been said. It was an unfortunate miscalculation by Buttigieg.

Cory Booker: B

Sen. Booker had a good tone throughout the evening. He was conversational, which is what I teach my students to strive for. Booker was also solid on content, consistently taking arguments one step further, like when he mentioned how anti-abortion laws disproportionately affect low-income women and the need to talk about child poverty when discussing tax systems.

On the downside, Booker focused too much energy on chastising everyone else over their tones and argument style when talking to one another (he was right, but then he overplayed his hand and his criticism seemed canned). Speaking of canned, what was the joke about Bernie Sanders being a fan of medical marijuana? Round peg, meet square hole.

Andrew Yang: B-

Bold ideas suit him well. While Yang's defense of his Freedom Dividend (a universal basic income of $1,000 a month) was lacking in support in this debate, he made up for it by defending other unconventional ideas. Yang floated the idea of decriminalizing opioids, which impressively got support from O'Rourke. Yang was smart to point out that Elizabeth Warren's plan to implement a wealth tax has been tried. ""The problem is that it's been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all those countries ended up repealing it, because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they'd projected,"" Yang said.

There were a few arguments where Yang was less successful. Booker overshadowed him on the topic of breaking up large tech companies. While Yang expressed skepticism over some benefits of breaking them up, Booker pointed out that the issue is not just competition, but that these large monopolies ""undermine our democracy.""

Yang also could use a bit more practice finishing his arguments. While he made a good point that our data should be treated as our property, his analysis was incomplete. Yang needed to more fully explain what having control of our data would mean for Americans.

Julian Castro: C+

He all but disappeared in parts of the debate, so it was difficult for him to climb the grading scale. However, Castro had some on-point analysis when discussing why communities don't want cops coming to their house under the guise of confiscating assault weapons. This approach was bold but risky. It could work against him if his criticism of weapon confiscation is interpreted as anti-police.

Elizabeth Warren: C

Sen. Warren needs to answer the questions. She is simply too smart to ignore the topic she is being asked to address -- especially when she's asked the same thing multiple times. Should Trump's Twitter account be suspended? I personally don't know -- and neither, it seems, does Warren. How is she planning to pay for Medicare for all? Again, she left us wondering,

Warren also came across as petty by implying it was not Biden but President Obama who should be credited with helping some of her bills become laws during the Obama administration.

Amy Klobuchar: C

While I found her delivery to be less than optimal at times, Klobuchar had some good points. She spoke thoughtfully on Roe v. Wade, taking on Big Pharma and income inequality.

Unfortunately, Klobuchar got caught in an awkward nonverbal moment when Castro was speaking on the topic of monopolies and the camera panned over to her. Her blank expression reminded me of when I catch a student on a cell phone during class. It's a good reminder to look engaged at all times -- you never know when you'll be in the spotlight.

If I could give her one piece of advice it would be to please stop using the scripted jokes. No one is laughing.

Beto O'Rourke: C

O'Rourke was simply average the entire time. He argued better than he did during the first debate, but was an expected let-down from his last debate. Unfortunately, the issue of guns, which he has made a central point of his campaign, was probably the worst part of his performance on Tuesday. O'Rourke needed more evidence to support his belief that owners of AR-15s and AK-47s will voluntarily give up their weapons under an assault rifle ban.

Joe Biden: C-

The best part of former Vice President Joe Biden's debate came toward the end when he highlighted his accomplishments. While still not as smooth as it could have been, he made a convincing argument: ""I'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done, from the Violence Against Women Act to making sure that we pass the Affordable Care Act to being in a position where we, in fact, took almost a $90 billion act that kept us from going into a depression...""

Unfortunately, this came a bit late in the night. And for every good answer, Biden had multiple slipups. Examples include whatever this means: ""And lastly, and I apologize for going on, but lastly, what is happening in Iraq is going to -- I mean, excuse me, in Afghanistan, as well as all the way over to Syria, we have ISIS that's going to come here ..."" Once you've fumbled that much, you've lost the audience.

Biden needs to take his own advice and eliminate some of the clutter in his mind when he's answering questions. As he said in the debate, ""And this is one of the reasons why these debates are kind of crazy, because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given."" Exactly.

Tulsi Gabbard: D

Congresswoman Gabbard probably put off a lot of people with her responses. Drawing from the Republican playbook, she complained about the mainstream media and pointed out that she disagreed with Hillary Clinton on many issues. At the end of the night, when candidates were asked to explain a surprising friendship, Gabbard talked about her relationship with Republican Trey Gowdy. The same Trey Gowdy that Trump tried to hire for his impeachment defense team

However, my favorite part of the whole debate was when apparently Gabbard tried to take over the moderators' jobs and pose a question to the other candidates. She was quickly shut down when moderator Erin Burnett jumped in and announced a commercial break.

Tom Steyer: D

This was Steyer's first debate, and I had no problem with any of his answers, so in that regard, it was a success. But on public speaking 101, he failed. Have you ever met a person who never breaks eye contact until you feel uncomfortable? Steyer's nonstop eye contact with the camera made me feel the need to look away. It looked totally unnatural. We can only hope that he watches himself back and makes a note to blink in the next debate."
325,"Jeff Zeleny and Arlette Saenz, CNN",,Joe Biden has long wanted nothing more than this: a head-to-head matchup with President Donald Trump to show Democrats that he is the party's best chance of winning the White House.,2019-10-07,CNN,Joe Biden grapples with attacks from Trump and the rising Warren threat,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/07/politics/joe-biden-elizabeth-warren-ukraine-challenges/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Joe Biden has long wanted nothing more than this: a head-to-head matchup with President Donald Trump to show Democrats that he is the party's best chance of winning the White House.

But as his extraordinary battle with Trump enters its third week -- and the impeachment inquiry intensifies -- Biden is struggling to prove that point as he searches for the proper footing to fight the President without being sullied by the fallout. He's under siege by Trump and the explosive Ukraine investigation even as he tries to regain command of the Democratic primary race.

""I'm not going anywhere,"" Biden told donors this past weekend during a closed-door retreat in Philadelphia, a person in attendance told CNN -- a message he also delivered in a speech late last week and in a Washington Post op-ed aimed squarely at Trump. ""You won't destroy me and you won't destroy my family.""

At this critical juncture for Biden's candidacy, the official position inside the campaign is that this noisy feud with Trump elevates the former vice president's standing in the Democratic race.

Yet even his most loyal supporters and longtime advisers concede they can't be certain whether that's true, given the uncertainty surrounding the politics of impeachment and his fragile position in the primary fight.

""I'm not going to sit here and say there is no concern,"" a Biden confidant told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal campaign conversations. ""As this drags on, we just don't know. No one knows.""

Challenges ahead

For all of the planning and deliberations that went into his presidential bid, more than a dozen aides, donors and top supporters to Biden acknowledged in weekend interviews the campaign was entering almost entirely uncharted terrain as it grappled with the confluence of three distinct challenges.

First, the threat Elizabeth Warren's candidacy presents to Biden is more serious than ever. Not only did she announce Friday that she had outraised him by nearly $10 million over the last three months, she also has the ability to return to those grassroots donors again and again as she works to consolidate the party's progressive wing. Biden has been far more reliant on traditional fundraising, which places him at a distinct disadvantage among his leading primary rivals.

Second, the utter unpredictability of Trump and his attempts to draw Biden into the fray presents an unwieldy challenge. Biden does not want to get pulled into ""a mud fight,"" as he told donors last week in California, yet early attempts to respond to the President's bombastic claims left many senior Democrats saying Biden looked weak and imploring the campaign to ramp up its response.

Third, the injection of Hunter Biden into the fray complicates an already fraught private family dynamic. Despite unfounded allegations that the former vice president intervened to help his son in Ukraine and China, the campaign has struggled to respond to almost daily taunts from Trump and his followers.

Fighting a war on these three distinct fronts has awakened anxieties inside the Biden campaign and among his supporters. While Warren's ascendancy may typically spark the most worry in a typical campaign season, aides say she is almost relegated to the back burner, which could create challenges of its own.

""None of this is going away,"" said a senior Democrat official who admires Biden, but is troubled by the campaign's response to Trump. ""He needs to show more emotion and find a way to turn all of this into an advantage.""

Over the weekend in Philadelphia, dozens of Biden donors gathered for a tour of campaign headquarters and to receive an update on the state of the race from top Biden advisers, including campaign manager Greg Schultz and longtime adviser Steve Ricchetti. The event was scheduled long before the impeachment inquiry began, aides said, but, in the context of the drama unfolding in Washington, it took on a heightened sense of urgency.

After initially taking a far more measured approach to the crisis, Biden and his campaign have stepped up their attacks on Trump on multiple fronts in recent days, from paid advertising to fundraising appeals to more aggressive responses. The shift in strategy comes after the campaign received a fusillade of advice from Democrats watching in frustration.

""This campaign will continue to focus on the issues that impact people's lives,"" deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield wrote in a weekend memo, ""while simultaneously hammering Donald Trump for his unprecedented abuse of power and correcting the record on the mountain of lies Trump and his allies continue to spread about Joe Biden.""

Striking a proper balance between offensive and defensive moves -- juggling primary opponents and a potential general election rival -- has proven remarkably tricky. The challenges from Trump come just as more voters are tuning into the 2020 campaign and as Biden loses his frontrunner's advantage in on the race.

Democratic Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania said he had little doubt Trump was trying to weaken Biden's candidacy because Republicans would prefer to run against Warren or another candidate with positions far more liberal than Biden. He said Democratic voters should not allow Trump to hijack their primary campaign.

""The American people know Joe Biden and his character and values,"" Casey said in an interview. ""We should not allow Trump to change the subject and distract from a clear abuse of power.""

Warren was already a rising threat, but raising $24.6 million -- compared to Biden's $15.2 million -- sent alarm bells throughout the campaign and among top donors. Several Biden campaign officials used the fundraising comparisons, along with Bernie Sanders' $25 million haul, as a plea for donors to step up their efforts.

""Sanders and Warren have been building an online fundraising mechanism for six years. Joe Biden's been building one for six months,"" said Dick Harpootlian, a South Carolina Democratic state senator who has hosted a fundraiser for Biden. ""We've got to raise some money. His online efforts are getting better, but he's going to continue to have to do fundraisers which takes away from his time to campaign.""

On the policy front, advisers to Biden say they will gradually sharpen differences, particularly on Warren's support for the single-payer ""Medicare for All"" proposal. But they have no plans to use a scorched-earth campaign against the Massachusetts senator -- largely because they believe it would backfire -- and they hope other Democratic rivals will assume that role.

This week, Biden is traveling to New Hampshire, which will be a critical battleground between the two leading candidates.

""You know how difficult it is to be the frontrunner from the start and maintain that over time,"" said Lou D'Allesandro, a longtime New Hampshire Democratic legislator and top Biden supporter in the state. ""There are always ups and downs, but we're holding our own. And give her credit where credit is due, but by the same token, we've got to work harder.""

Biden's advisers have acknowledged Iowa and New Hampshire could be tough terrain for his candidacy, but they routinely emphasize his appeal in South Carolina, particularly among black voters in the fourth nominating state; A CNN South Carolina poll released last month found he had a huge lead over his opponents -- 37% over Warren's 16% and Sanders' 11%. His team is also building out its operations in Super Tuesday states, with announcements for key campaign organizers expected this week, in hopes of building a firewall in states with more minority voters to help slow Warren's momentum if she wins early contests.

""We have a broader base and coalition than anyone else,"" said Pete Kavanaugh, deputy campaign manager for Biden who is overseeing early-state contests. ""Once you get past South Carolina, it's a delegate game.""

But in conversations with more than a dozen campaign advisers and Biden loyalists, it is the subject of Hunter Biden that comes up again and again as the most worrisome aspect of the moment. He is seen by many inside Biden's orbit as something of the former vice president's kryptonite, who presents unique and uncertain challenges.

On the campaign trail, Biden's discussion of his son and his business dealings have been limited. Biden bristled at a recent question about whether his son's position on the board of a Ukrainian gas company -- at the very time the former vice president served as the point man on Ukraine in the Obama administration -- presented a potential conflict. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

""There has been no indication of any conflict of interest from Ukraine or anywhere else. Period,"" Biden told reporters, his voice raising. ""I'm not gonna respond to that. Let's focus on the problem. Focus on this man, what he's doing as President that no president has ever done."""

But there's a growing chorus on Wall Street for investors to look beyond the FANG momentum plays and more toward value stocks.,2019-10-16,CNN,Invest like Warren Buffett — Is this value's time to finally shine?,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/16/investing/value-stocks-growth/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Is the market's love affair with Big Tech finally coming to an end? That might be a stretch. But there's a growing chorus on Wall Street for investors to look beyond the FANG momentum plays and more toward value stocks.

In other words, investors are pulling a Warren Buffett.

Companies in sectors like banking, energy and health care have started to mount a comeback after lagging growth stocks for the past half-decade. Those sectors typically don't trade at prices as high asand other large tech firms.

Theis up about 40% in the last five years while thehas soared more than 80% during the same time frame. But value stocks have narrowed the gap considerably as of late. The value index is up nearly 18.5% this year — not far behind the gain of 20% for the growth index.

Materials, industrials, energy and tech firms will probably show the strongest earnings growth in 2020, predicts John Augustine, chief investment officer for Huntington Private Bank — especially if the US and China reach a trade deal and the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates to keep the economy growing.

Slower global growth could make value more attractive

With the exception of tech, Augustine cites three other sectors that tend to trade at more reasonable prices than growth stocks. But even within tech, Augustine points out that much of the earnings growth for next year may come from semiconductor stocks, which are typically a lot cheaper than cloud software, social networking and e-commerce companies.

""If these earnings projections hold up, we could see more investors start to shift from growth to value,"" Augustine told CNN Business. ""These are all cyclical companies and could have a strong 2020.""

But there's more to value than cyclical companies. Many investors also flock to slower-growth but dependable companies that pay big dividend yields. That trend should continue now that interest rates are expected to fall further in the United States, and yields for Japanese debt and many government bonds in Europe have fallen into negative territory.

Coca-Cola KO Verizon VZ So Dow components likeandand other high-yielding stocks will become increasingly attractive.

""Given that companies in defensive sectors like utilities, consumer goods, telecommunications and real estate generally sport higher dividend yields than their cyclical counterparts, falling interest rates have also helped drive defensive stock leadership,"" said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research for FTSE Russell, in a recent report.

Growth — but at the right price

Still, some fund managers warn investors to not bail on momentum tech darlings just yet.

Brian Macauley, a portfolio manager with Broad Run Investment Management, which subadvises the Hennessy Focus Fund, told CNN Business he'd be wary of many big banks and materials companies due to concerns about slowing global growth. Just because a stock looks like a bargain does not mean that it can't fall further.

""Some stocks are cheap for the right reasons,"" Macauley said.

The key, Ficklin told CNN Business, is to find market leaders that can weather any economic, political or other macro storms. It almost doesn't matter if they are value stocks or growth stocks. You just want dependability.

The New York Times was first to report the meeting on Sunday, noting the financiers were treated to a behind-the-scenes view of the campaign’s headquarters and strategy, including a private address by the former vice president.

“In a sign of the attendees’ significant financial firepower, Mr. Biden himself addressed the several dozen donors who came to the retreat on Saturday, rallying them for 45 minutes about the months ahead, people there said,” the Times reported. “The campaign kept the session with Mr. Biden behind closed doors, despite pledging to open them to the press.”

The meeting comes as the campaign is besieged by questions over Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine as well as polls showing the former vice president is no longer the frontrunner among 2020 Democrats. Biden, who once led the field by as much 26 percentage points, now trails Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire.

Adding to the campaign’s trouble is the fact that their fundraising numbers were eclipsed this quarter not only by Warren but also Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg — who polled significantly below the former vice president.

Biden’s mounting problems and the emergence of Warren as the most direct threat was not far from the minds of those gathered in attendance in Philadelphia.

“We need him to get the nomination because he’s the one who can win,” Denise Bauer, a Biden bundler and former ambassador to Belgium, told the Times. To stress the point, she added that the former vice president’s donors were “going to try to raise every single dollar we can.”

It is unclear if such efforts will be successful enough to save the 76-year-old Biden’s third White House bid. Unlike Warren or Sanders, the former vice president’s fundraising has failed to diversify past the top-dollar level. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, more than 2,800 donors have already maxed out to Biden’s campaign since his announcement in late April. Top-dollar donors make up a far higher percentage of Biden’s campaign’s coffers than those of his competitors.

In comparison, only 38 percent of the campaign’s funds to date have come from individuals donating less than $200. Such a ratio poses an issue for the former vice president, especially now that his top contributors are prohibited by law from donating again until after he’s secured the nomination. David Kochel, the former chief strategist for Jeb Bush’s failed 2016 presidential bid, explained the problem to Politico on Friday.

If you don’t have that perpetual, low-dollar fundraising machine, you can’t compete,” Kochel said. “Biden looks like he can’t compete with Warren, Bernie and Buttigieg. How’s he going to compete with Trump?”

Despite Biden’s money woes, the former vice president is also facing scrutiny over his son’s shadowy ties to foreign governments, which have taken center stage in the battle to impeach President Donald Trump. The controversy started last month when Trump suggested the Ukrainian government probe Hunter Biden’s role with Burisma Holdings. The younger Biden joined the Ukrainian oil and gas giant in 2014 around the same time his father was appointed to oversee Obama administration policy in the region.

As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his book Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden secured the position, which paid as much as $83,000 per month despite having no background in the energy industry or Ukraine. Hunter Biden’s lack of experience, coupled with his father’s influence over Ukraine, immediately raised questions from ethics watchdogs in both the U.S. and Europe about a conflict of interest.

Furthering the ethical cloud over the appointment is that it came during the same month that Mykola Zlochevsky, Burisma’s founder, had his assets seized in the United Kingdom for suspicion of money laundering. Some have speculated Hunter Biden’s ascension to Burisma’s board was an attempt by Zlochevsky to curry favor with western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of his business dealings.

A brazen attempt would not be totally ill-suited for Zlochevsky. The Burisma founder is rumored to be one of eastern Europe’s top oligarchs, a position obtained while serving in the Ukrainian government under former President Viktor Yanukovych — a staunch ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. It was during his tenure in government as Ukraine’s minister of natural resources that Burisma received its oil and gas licenses.

It is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky’s legal troubles that Joe Biden’s political influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016. Biden, who has publicly bragged about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than one billion dollars in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor’s ability to tackle corruption.

Unofficially, though, it was known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster he was warned to back off the matter. Regardless of what occurred, Shokin’s successor dropped the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky, allowing the oligarch to return to the country after having fled in 2014.

Biden, for his part, has refused to discuss the matter, even lashing out at the media for asking if his son’s work with Burisma posed a conflict of interest during his tenure in the vice presidency. The tactic, however, does not seem to be doing Biden or his campaign any favors. A new poll released on Friday indicates that 57 percent of Americans support the Department of Justice opening an investigation into Hunter Biden’s work abroad.

Some of the donors gathered in Philadelphia this weekend, though, saw the issues surrounding Hunter Biden and Ukraine in a different light. Sheila Nix, who once served as chief of staff to Dr. Jill Biden, told the Times the former vice president’s struggles were the result of him having to run two campaigns at once.

“He’s running a primary campaign and a general at the same time and I think he’s doing a great job,” Nix said. “It’s a little unprecedented having to do both at the same time.”"

Sen. Elizabeth Warren promised her nominee to the Department of Education would have to earn the approval of a nine-year-old child who claimed to be transgender.

The invited child, flanked by the mother, asked, “What are you doing … to make sure that kids like me feel safer in schools? And what do you think schools need to do better to make sure that I don’t have to worry about anything but my homework?”

Warren responded:

So let me start by saying, I want to have a secretary of education who both believes in public education and believes in the value of every one of our kids, and is willing to enforce our civil rights laws. It turns out that when the Department of Education was set up many years ago, the secretary of education was given a whole lot of power over the public schools, and over the rules and how they’re enforced. And we’ve had some secretaries of education who’ve been better. And we’ve had one that’s been a whole lot worse. Her name is Betsy DeVos. And when I’m President, she’ll be gone. And here’s my plan … I’m going to find just the right secretary of education. But here’s what I plan to do. I want to make sure that the person I think is the right secretary of education meets you and hears your story. And then I want you to tell me if you think that’s the right person, and then we’ll make the deal. Does that sound good?

“The Equality Act is essential,” said New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, referring to the House-passed Equality Act, which would establish the transgender ideology as law, and so outlaw and stigmatize any recognition of the complementary differences of women and men.

“If we can get five [Senate] votes, we will pass the Equality Act the next day,” said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. “We urgently need an Equality Act,” said Mayor Pete Buttigieg. “We would pass the Equality Act right off the bat, number one,” said Joe Biden.

The candidates promised to promote the status of gay and transgender people in K-12 schools, to roll back restrictions on blood donations, to appoint gay generals, and to subordinate national diplomacy to the goal of gay acceptance. “I would, in fact, curtail aid, curtail foreign assistance to countries who, in fact, engage in this kind of [anti-gay] behavior,” said Biden.

The audience picked by the pr0-transgender HRC was delighted with the river of promises and praise. “This means the world to all of us … I cannot believe this is happening,” said activist Julia Goldman, an author of a podcast about gay politics.

The Pentagon must treat male soldiers as if they are women once they say they are transgender, said Buttigieg. “The trans military ban is an outrage … That is dead wrong … I will put an end to that,” he said.

Religious rights must end when “religion is being used an excuse to harm other people,” Buttigieg said. Religious-based opposition to gay status “makes God smaller … It is an insult to faith to believe it can be used to hurt people in that way,” he said.

Religious groups must agree to arrange adoptions for gay couples, said Klobuchar. “You have got to have agencies that follow the law … You have got to [endorse] adoptions for gay families,” she said.

Conservatives & (some) feminists agree biology shapes our personalities & politics. They're uniting to stop the progressives' ruthless ""transgender"" demand that we deny biology's impact on people & politics despite the known hazards to adults, teens & kids https://t.co/gND8VfyMOl — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 9, 2019

Warren jeered at critics of single-sex marriage and transgenderism. One questioner asked her:

Senator, thank you for being here. Now, let’s say you’re on the campaign trail, and a supporter approaches you and says, “Senator, I’m old-fashioned. And my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.” What is your response?” Well, I’m going to assume it’s a guy who said that. I’m going to say, just marry one woman. Assuming you can find one!

A moment later, Warren declared her deep belief in charity towards other people:

It’s about what I learned in the church I grew up, in first song I ever remember singing: “There is yellow, black and white, they are precious in His sight. Jesus loves all the children in the world.” … That was the basis of the faith that I grew up in. And it truly is about the preciousness of each and every life, it is about the worth of every human being.

Former California Attorney General, Kamala Harris, boasted of her refusal to defend California’s marriage law in 2008 from advocates for single-sex marriage.

Tom Steyer backed body-changing drugs for teenagers who say they are transgender. “All of that care should be available for all transgender youth,” he said. “It has to be part of the public [healthcare] option I believe in … It is an absolute right, and this is a critical part of healthcare for these young people.”

Warren promised taxpayer funding for cosmetic surgery for people who want to live as members of the opposite sex:

I believe that everyone is entitled to medical care and medical care that they need, and that includes people who are transgender, who — it is the time for them to have gender-affirming surgery. I just think that’s important and the appropriate medical care.

CNN’s announcers excluded any possible critics or skeptical questioners who might spotlight the political risks posed by the candidates’ unreserved support for transgender ideology. That ideology would change women’s status and rights, change education rules, and girls’ sports.

Amy Klobuchar provided the only moment of disagreement when she declined to endorse a call for legal prostitution. “I am not in favor of demineralizing all of sex work,” she said, but quickly backtracked, “but I’d love to talk with you for a few minutes and see if we can find common ground going forward.”

The only loud opposition came from several attendees who described themselves as black transgender women, including one named Blossom. A second person rebuked one CNN announcer for a mispronouncing the person’s name, saying, “it is violence to ‘misgender’ or to alter the name of a transperson.” A group interrupted the event to chant about “black trans” lives.

But Beto O’Rourke pushed the envelope.

“Discrimination” against people who are homosexual or transgender cannot be tolerated, he said. “There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone, any institution… that denies the human rights and full civil rights of every single one of us.”

He promised cheap anti-AIDS medicine: “We’ll bring down that cost … We will take over that patent and make sure it is distributed to every person in America.”

Mental-health professionals should not be allowed to guide adults or children who prefer to detransition from transgender status or to change homosexual feelings. “Conversion therapy … should be illegal,” O’Rourke said. “As president, I will seek to outlaw it everywhere in this country … this is tantamount to torture — a torture we visit on children who are absolutely defenseless,” he said.

Beto also promised a new policy to counter the murder of black transgender women, saying, “they will be the guide on this issue — they will direct our policy.” Countering the murders is “a matter of restoring the very fabric of America,” he said."

Cory Booker, who has made party unity a major theme of his presidential campaign, on Wednesday admonished his rivals for launching ""personal attacks"" during the fourth primary debate, saying if the candidates cannot stay unified, they won't be successful in ""trying to unify the nation.""

""It's fine to delineate your differences with other primary candidates. But the way we do it matters. It cannot be personal attacks, tearing folks down, doing so in a way that wounds us as a party,"" Booker told CNN's John Berman on ""New Day."" ""At the end of the day, we have to show that unity that's necessary to develop the kind of strength it needs to beat Donald Trump.""

""If we can't unify the Democratic Party, you're not going to have a great success in even trying to unify the nation,"" the New Jersey senator added.

On Tuesday night, Booker joined 11 other candidates at the fourth Democratic primary debate, hosted by CNN and The New York Times in Westerville, Ohio. The debate was marked by increasing aggressiveness among the different candidates, who are all looking to break out as the contest inches toward 2020. In particular, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren faced attacks by a number of her rivals who were looking to take shots at her now that she is a front-runner in the contest. At one point during the debate, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg accused Warren of dodging a yes-or-no question, and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar accused her of being dishonest.

""Last night (Warren) was more specific and forthcoming about the number of selfies she's taken than about how (her 'Medicare for All') plan is going to be funded,"" Buttigieg told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day"" Wednesday.

The ad is geared to show a Democratic audience that Biden, who polls show battling Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont at the top of the polls, is the most electable candidate -- or at least the one Trump fears the most -- in the party's 2020 field.

It is also a response to the Trump campaign's ads in early states that include false claims about Biden, his son and Ukraine and hit Democrats for beginning impeachment proceedings over Trump's effort to pressure the Ukrainian President to investigate the Bidens. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden in Ukraine.

The Trump campaign is doing an ad blitz in the same four states starting this weekend, going after Biden. The Biden-focused ad buy totals more than $1 million, campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh confirmed to CNN. That buy is part of an overall $10 million buy from the campaign and Republican National Committee.

Asked if he would put strong measures in place to increase oversight over health care access to LGBTQ asylum seekers if elected president, businessman Tom Steyer said, ""Of course we will.""

He took a shot at President Donald Trump and his treatment of migrants in US Immigration, Customs and Enforcement detention facilities.

""I think it's absolutely critical for the United States of America to treat people in a humane and decent fashion. It's very obvious that this President and this administration has chosen to not only break the international laws in their treatment of asylum seekers, but to break the basic laws of humanity,"" he said.

Steyer continued: ""When I think about why I started the need to impeach campaign two years ago, yeah, he's a criminal, it's true that he more than has earned impeachment, but it goes much beyond this and it goes to exactly this kind of issue. The actual President of the United States committing crimes against humanity, like this, in our name, is something that we should end right now. Certainly the first day of my presidency."""
