* The latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll – the most closely watched of all Iowa polls – found Elizabeth Warren taking the lead in the first Democratic nominating contest with 22%, followed by Joe Biden at 20%. Bernie Sanders was third with 11%, followed closely by Pete Buttigieg at 9%. Kamala Harris rounded out the top five with 6% support. (Of the top five candidates, Warren was the only candidate to see her support grow since June.)

* On a related note, it’s worth noting that in the same Iowa poll, local Democrats were asked for their first and second choices, which matter a great deal given the way the state’s caucus system is structured. When first- and second-choice preferences are combined, Warren’s advantage over Biden is even more striking: 42% to 30%. Sanders is further back at 21%, followed by Buttigieg’s 18%.

* Staff shake-ups on Bernie Sanders’ team continue, with the Vermont senator parting ways with one of his Iowa deputy field directors. Kevin Lata had previously worked on Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign, as well as Hillary Clinton’s 2016 team.

* In keeping with the recent trend, the Alaska Republican Party became the latest state GOP to officially cancel its Republican presidential primary, which had been scheduled for April. Several state parties have taken similar steps to protect Donald Trump from possible embarrassment against his primary rivals.

* As the General Motors strike continues, several Democratic presidential candidates have visited picket lines to show support for members of the United Auto Workers.

* With some evidence of Texas becoming more competitive, Republican officials are making it easier for Green Party candidates to qualify for the ballot, with the obvious hope that the move will undermine Democratic support.

* Though it’s difficult to know if this is a stunt, Cory Booker’s campaign manager wrote in a new memo to staff and supporters that the New Jersey senator’s presidential campaign may come to an end without another $1.7 million before the end of the quarter. (The third quarter ends a week from today.)

* As expected, Rep. Joe Kennedy (D) officially kicked off a primary campaign in Massachusetts against incumbent Sen. Ed Markey (D) over the weekend.

* And following their recent Twitter argument over which one of them is more closely aligned with Trump’s foreign policy, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is reportedly taking steps to undermine Rep. Liz Cheney’s (R-Wyo.) prospective U.S. Senate campaign."

Harris, 30, was on her way to the Big Barn Dance in Taos, N.M., when she allegedly caused a three-vehicle collision with 16-year-old Maria Elena Cruz and another vehicle.

Harris and Cruz died at the scene, while the third driver was reportedly unharmed.

The Taos County Sheriff's Office examined vehicle data recorders from the crash to recreate the scene.

“The information from the data boxes supports our at-scene investigation that two collision events occurred involving the three vehicles and that speed was definitely a contributing factor,"" Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe told the Taos News in a statement.

After reconstructing the crash, the Sheriff's Office alleges that Harris, who was driving a Chevrolet Equinox in the southbound lane, was going 102 mph when she rear-ended a black Chevrolet Avalanche.

Harris allegedly then veered into oncoming traffic in the northbound lane, still going 95 mph, where she struck Cruz's Jeep SUV.

The Sheriff’s Office also suspected speed and intoxication were factors in the accident, though authorities are awaiting a toxicology report from the Office of the Medical Investigator before making an official determination.

Court records indicate that Harris had a history of drinking and driving. In June 2017, she was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated after records indicated she had a blood alcohol content level of over 0.15, nearly twice the legal limit. Harris was convicted in October 2017 and was ordered to have an ignition interlock device installed in her car.

The crooner was also cited for speeding in 2014 when she was clocked going 81 in a 60 mph zone.

Court documents obtained by Fox News show Harris was charged in May 2009 with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. However, she was granted deferred adjudication – a form of probation in Texas that allowed a “guilty” or “no contest” plea to be scrubbed from her record if she completed the terms of the agreement. Court records indicate the charges against Harris were dismissed on May 19, 2012, exactly three years later.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., surged ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden in a new poll of likely Iowa Democratic caucus-goers released late Saturday, with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg slipping into a distant third and fourth, respectively.

The Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll showed Warren as the first choice of 22 percent of the voters surveyed, while Biden was the first choice of 20 percent of the voters. By comparison, the Register poll in June showed Biden leading with 24 percent support, nine percentage points clear of Warren and eight points clear of Sanders.

J. Ann Selzer, president of pollster Selzer & Co., told the Register the survey represented ""the first major shakeup” of the Iowa race, because: ""It’s the first time we’ve had someone other than Joe Biden at the top of the leader board.""

Sanders was in third place with 11 percent support, a five percentage-point drop from the Register's June poll. No other candidate cracked 10 percent of the first-choice vote, with Buttigieg garnering nine percent. That also represents a five percentage-point drop from June.

Warren also had the highest percentage of poll respondents (20 percent) who said she was their second choice in the February caucus. By contrast, Biden and Sanders each garnered 10 percent of the second-choice vote. Warren also had the highest favorability rating of any candidate, with 75 percent of respondents saying they had a very or mostly favorable view of her compared to 66 percent for Biden and 58 percent for Sanders.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., rounded out the top five, with six percent of voters saying she was their first choice. Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Cory Booker, D-NJ, both received three percent. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, former Congressman Beto O'Rourke, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and hedge fund manager Tom Steyer each received three percent.

The polling shakeup may not be done, as 63 percent of respondents said they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate. Harris, Buttigieg and Booker could still benefit from late deciders, as 39 percent, 37 percent and 35 percent of poll respondents said they were still actively considering those respective candidates.

The poll came from a sample size of 602 likely Democratic caucusgoers with a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points. It was conducted from Sept. 14-18.

The most recent Fox News poll of Democratic primary voters nationwide showed Biden with 29 percent support, down six percentage points from his peak in May. Sanders was in second place at 18 percent, up eight percentage points from the previous month's poll, while Warren was on 16 percent, down four points from August."

Todd questioned O'Rourke at an event in Colorado Thursday and stated his credentials as a shooting survivor, before asking how far he planned to take his gun ban. ABC later reported the exchange as if Todd was supporting the plan, when, in fact, he is against it.

""I went to hear Beto speak and if I got the opportunity to ask him where he drew the line as far as his gun confiscation plans -- and I wanted to phrase it in a way that allowed him to speak his mind and he did, Todd said. ""He really is open to... banning and confiscating nearly all firearms.""

He claimed members of the media turned cold when they found out he didn't support O'Rourke's plan and accused them of embracing a far-left agenda.

BETO CALLS FOR RED FLAG LAWS, MANDATORY GUN BUYBACK AND NATIONAL REGISTRY ALL IN THE SAME SPEECH

""The media, by and large, is biased and in some cases complicit with pushing the extremists' far-left agenda,"" Todd said. ""There were many that were very interested in talking to me afterward. But, when they found out my true stance, they suddenly were less interested. So it's been crickets since they found out where I truly stood on the issue.""

Todd was injured in 1999 when two students, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, opened fire at Columbine High School in Colorado, killing 13 people and injuring 24. Harris and Klebold eventually killed themselves with gunshot wounds to the head following the massacre that left 12 students and one teacher dead.

Todd also said during his ""Fox & Friends"" interview that the idea of confiscating firearms from private citizens is a personal affront and will leave millions defenseless while creating more problems than it would solve.

""It's insulting and dangerous,"" he said earlier in the interview. ""You're removing the means of protection for millions and millions of law-abiding Americans. I think his ban is misplaced.

""It goes after the wrong people and it goes after the wrong issues,"" Todd continued. ""The law-abiding citizens in this country aren't the problem. There's an element that is a problem. And I think we need to address the realities of mental health and other issues. And the reality is that there's evil in this world."""

UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER DEFENDS TRUMP'S CALL WITH ZELENSKIY: 'I THINK THERE WAS NO PRESSURE'

Trump reportedly has been accused of asking Ukraine’s leader multiple times to work with Rudy Giuliani in investigating former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, and possibly using military aid as leverage. Trump denied making any improper requests – but that didn’t stop Bernstein from comparing it to Watergate.

“If the reporting of Shane Harris and the Wall Street Journal is accurate, and it seems to be, it clearly moved toward a grievous abuse of power by the President of the United States. I keep getting asked, ‘Are there echoes of Watergate in this?’ There are in the following ways,” Bernstein said Sunday. “Watergate was very much an attempt by Richard Nixon to undermine the Democratic electoral process.”

Bernstein said that Nixon used “political espionage and sabotage” to nominate George McGovern, who Nixon considered the “weakest candidate,” as opposed to Edmund Muskie.

BIDEN FACES SCRUTINY FOR DEMANDING OUSTER OF UKRAINE OFFICIAL PROBING FIRM THAT EMPLOYED HIS SON

Back in 1972, Bernstein and Bob Woodward reported that a White House aide fabricated a letter detailing Muskie condoning a racial slur against Americans of French-Canadian descent, which derailed his campaign.

“Something of the same thing seems to be happening here where Biden, who Trump and his people have said they fear the most, in terms of being an opponent, has been the object of these, perhaps, dirty tricks,” Bernstein continued. ""One thing Nixon never did was engage a foreign power to investigate a candidate running for office in the United States. It is a grievous offense if this is what happened.”

The New York Times announced it was shutting down its Spanish-language edition, ""NYT en Espanol,"" which launched in 2016. The venture, management explained, did not prove a financial success, in part because their readers were “less engaged than they were with our core site, and we did not see a path to converting them as subscribers.”

Translation: Spanish-speaking readers perhaps didn’t buy what the anti-Catholic, anti-Trump, pro-abortion New York Times was selling. Who is surprised? The Times, along with other liberal media outlets, imagine Latinos to be a monolithic group both culturally and politically.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN AIMS TO USE IMMIGRATION, TRADE TO WIN HISPANIC VOTE IN 2020

Democrats make the same mistake, taking the Hispanic vote for granted. In 2020, with Hispanics becoming an ever-more important factor in key swing states like Florida and Pennsylvania, that presumption could cost them the election.

In their fealty to tightly bound identity politics, liberals simply cannot imagine that Spanish-speaking people who live in the United States might vote for Trump. And yet, indications are that many will, despite the all-out effort by the Times and other liberal outlets to portray the president as racist.

In 2016, Trump received 28 percent of the Latino vote, slightly more than the 27 percent garnered by Mitt Romney in 2012, shocking those who thought his promise to build a wall would alienate Latino voters.

Since then, as the debate over immigration has become more heated and the president has stepped up efforts to prevent a flood of undocumented people from Central America from crossing the southern border, attacks from Democrats have only intensified.

And yet, Hispanic support for the president appears to grow.

In 2018, Hispanic voters gave Republican congressional candidates 29 percent of the vote, or slightly above Trump’s take in 2016, even as white voters defected from the GOP. The number of Hispanics identifying themselves as Republicans climbed from 24 percent in 2016 to 27 percent in 2018, according to Pew polling. Meanwhile, the president’s approval rating among Hispanics ranges in recent polls between 29 percent and 37 percent.

A New York Times reporter was clearly baffled by this turn of events as she ventured to cover the president’s recent rally in New Mexico, where 47 percent of the electorate is Latino. Jennifer Medina was shocked to find large numbers of Hispanics who had waited in the sun to greet the president, and whose ""identity was something of an afterthought.""

She met Latino Trump supporters who backed his position on illegal immigration, and who felt that ""We need to take care of the people who are already here."" They were not, she reported, ""single-issue voters,"" which seemed to surprise the Times writer. Those proudly announcing themselves as Latinos for Trump also tended to favor his position on abortion, his appointments of conservative judges, and defense of gun rights. (Take that, Beto!)

That said, the common theme among those she spoke with was their opposition to people entering the country illegally. Apparently Democrats' rants about “children in cages” and their push to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement have not swayed these voters.

A recent Harvard/Harris poll confirms this. Some 58 percent of Hispanics said they would vote for a president that stood for “strengthening our border to reduce illegal immigrants” while only 46 percent said they would support “opening our borders to many more immigrants.”

Though Medina confidently concluded that Trump is ""deeply unpopular with most Hispanics in New Mexico,"" she admitted that “brown faces were not hard to find"" at the rally. She offered no proof of Trump’s low approval within the state, but perhaps thought it was a foregone conclusion since the president lost the state by eight percentage points in 2016. She may be right.

But Democrats do themselves no service by underestimating Hispanic support for the president. Or, as they frequently do, assuming that all Latinos think alike.

Many of the Trump supporters interviewed by Medina came from families who had been in the country for more than one generation; they do not, she said, identify with the caravans from Central America or with those crossing illegally. One person told her she had no problem with the more recent arrivals as long as ""they come in, blend in, speak our language."" That language is not Spanish.

Many derided the casual application of the “racist” label to the president, with one person calling the charge of bigotry a “frenzy made by the media.”

As they pursue the Hispanic vote, the Trump campaign will talk up the economic gains made by Latinos and other minorities under the president. Coincident with the New Mexico rally, for instance, the GOP tweeted that 34,600 jobs have been added in the state since 2016, the unemployment rate has dropped from 6.5 percent to 4.9 percent and nearly 15,734 people have gotten off of food stamps.

More broadly, since 2016 the country has added 5.2 million jobs, of which 4.5 million went to people of color. The Washington Post reported that this is the first time in the country’s history that minorities were winning most of the new jobs being created. Hispanic unemployment is currently 4.2 percent, the lowest ever recorded.

Because the jobs picture has improved markedly under Trump, the Wall Street Journal reports that “ The poverty rate among female households declined 2.7 percentage points for blacks, four percentage points for Hispanics and 7.1 percentage points for their children.”

A recent Harvard/Harris poll shows that 41 percent of Hispanics approve of Trump’s handling of the economy, and 44 percent give him high marks for “stimulating jobs.”

Against these achievements, Democrats are campaigning on open borders and on-demand abortion up until birth. These and other positions which could threaten our robust economy, like the Green New Deal or raising taxes on middle-class voters to fund single-payer health care, will alienate those who are increasingly benefiting from our capitalist system.

In 2020, Hispanics could shock Democrats by reelecting a president who is making life better for them. Even if he doesn’t speak Spanish.

WARREN SURGES IN IOWA

Des Moines Register: “Elizabeth Warren has surged in Iowa, narrowly overtaking Joe Biden and distancing herself from fellow progressive Bernie Sanders, the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows. Warren, the U.S. senator from Massachusetts, now holds a 2-percentage-point lead, with 22% of likely Democratic caucusgoers saying she is their first choice for president. It is the first time she has led in the Register’s poll. Former Vice President Biden, who had led each of the Register’s three previous 2020 cycle polls, follows her at 20%. Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont, has fallen to third place with 11%. No other candidate reaches double digits. ‘This is the first major shakeup’ in what had been a fairly steady race, said J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., which conducted the poll. … South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg follows the three leaders as the favorite of 9% of poll respondents. U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California is at 6%. U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey are at 3%. Polling at 2% are U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, businessman Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang.”



Dem candidates take two approaches in Iowa - Des Moines Register: “Former Vice President Joe Biden brought in a fire truck, bouncy house and ice cream truck for a carnival-style ‘Biden fest.’ A Mariachi band played at former U.S. Housing Secretary Juliàn Castro’s rally site and then marched in with the candidate and his supporters. And Lizzo and Prince blared through the speakers at a gathering for U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. But others took a different tack: U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren focused on organizing supporters, gathering voter information and knocking doors rather than big displays of support. Saturday’s Polk County Steak Fry in Iowa was the largest in the event’s storied history, drawing more than 12,000 excited Democrats to Water Works Park, where they heard from 17 presidential candidates vying for their attention and support on caucus day. Many of the candidates gathered with their supporters ahead of the main event, holding rallies where they each tried to outshine their competitors.”



Voters dislike Trump, still have doubts about Dems - NBC News: “As Democratic candidates compete for the opportunity to take on President Donald Trump, the incumbent they hope to oust is more personally disliked than any of his recent predecessors, and half of voters say they’re very uncomfortable with the idea of his re-election. But the electorate at large also expresses doubts about some of the progressive policies being backed by candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and the party’s more moderate frontrunner — Joe Biden — also faces questions about his fitness for the job. Those are the major findings in the latest release from the September NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll… But Trump also continues to benefit from the upside of the polarization of the electorate around him, commanding more enthusiasm than his Democratic competitors as well. A quarter of voters (26 percent) say they’re enthusiastic about him, while fewer say they’re enthusiastic about Warren (17 percent), Sanders (13 percent) and Biden (12 percent.)”



The end may be near for Booker - Politico: “Cory Booker’s presidential campaign is betting it all on the next 10 days, signaling Saturday that it will cease to exist unless it can raise nearly $2 million by the end of the month. ‘We have reached a critical moment, and time is running out,’ campaign manager Addisu Demissie warned in a memo to Booker staff and supporters. ‘It’s now or never: The next 10 days will determine whether Cory Booker can stay in this race and compete to win the nomination.’ The bottom line, Demissie said, is that ‘we do not see a legitimate long-term path forward’ if the campaign can’t raise another $1.7 million by Sept. 30, the third-quarter fundraising deadline. … Demissie made clear on a conference call with reporters later Saturday that the campaign isn’t out of money or at risk of running out of funds.”

TIME OUT: MEET YOU IN ST. LOUIS

History: “Amid much public excitement, American explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark return to St. Louis, Missouri, from the first recorded overland journey from the Mississippi River to the Pacific coast and back. The Lewis and Clark Expedition had set off more than two years before to explore the territory of the Louisiana Purchase. Even before the U.S. government concluded purchase negotiations with France, President Thomas Jefferson commissioned his private secretary Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, an army captain, to lead an expedition into what is now the U.S. Northwest. On May 14, the ‘Corps of Discovery,’ featuring some two dozen men, left St. Louis for the American interior. … On September 23, 1806, after two and a half years, the expedition returned to the city, bringing back a wealth of information about the largely unexplored region, as well as valuable U.S. claims to Oregon Territory.”

IMPEACHMENT PRESSURE BUILDS AROUND TRUMP PHONE CALL

NYT: “President Trump acknowledged on Sunday that he raised corruption accusations against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. during a phone call with Ukraine’s leader, a stunning admission as pressure mounted on Democrats to impeach Mr. Trump over allegations he leaned on a foreign government to help damage a political rival. In public and in private, many Democrats said the evidence that has emerged in recent days indicating that Mr. Trump pushed the Ukrainian government to investigate Mr. Biden, and his administration’s stonewalling of attempts by Congress to learn more, were changing their calculations about whether to charge him with articles of impeachment. … The fast-moving developments prompted Speaker Nancy Pelosi to level a warning of her own to the White House: Turn over the secret whistle-blower complaint by Thursday, or face a serious escalation from Congress. In a letter to House Democrats, Ms. Pelosi never mentioned the word ‘impeachment,’ but her message hinted at that possibility.”



Trump continues to defend his call about Biden - Politico: “President Donald Trump on Monday intensified his attempts to justify a phone call with Ukraine’s president in which he reportedly pushed for an investigation into one of his chief political rivals, maintaining that he’s merely concerned about stamping out corruption. He once again dismissed the accusations that he was using his position of power to pressure a foreign government into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son as a ‘witch hunt.’ For the first time, however, Trump appeared to connect the idea to the issue of foreign aid. ‘If we're supporting a country, we want to make sure that country is honest,’ Trump told reporters after arriving for the U.N. General Assembly. … Also at issue with critics of the president is $250 million in foreign aid meant for Ukraine that the White House mysteriously withheld before releasing under bipartisan pressure early this month. There is no evidence that Trump directly tied the release of foreign aid to an investigation into Biden and his son.”



Schumer insists on hearings over whistleblower complaint - Politico: “Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is requesting that the Republican Senate conduct hearings and issue a subpoena to the Trump administration in response to a whistleblower complaint about President Donald Trump's alleged request that Ukraine investigate one of his political opponents. In a letter to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Monday morning, the New York Democrat said the Senate should hold hearings regarding any connection between delayed aid to Ukraine and Trump's reported request that the country probe the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic contender in next year's presidential election. Schumer also asks McConnell to compel the Senate to issue a subpoena to bring the whistleblower complaint to Congress ‘as required by law.’”



Giuliani accuses Ukraine of laundering $3M to Hunter Biden - Fox News: “Rudy Giuliani channeled President Trump Monday with a wee-hours Twitter blitz aimed at turning the Ukraine story currently roiling Washington into a big problem for Democrats. Giuliani, the personal attorney for Trump and outspoken critic of presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son’s relationship with Ukraine, accused Kiev of laundering $3 million to Hunter Biden, suggested that the Obama administration turned a blind eye, and made the prediction that the scandal is in its infancy. ‘If Dem party doesn’t call for an investigation of Bidens’ millions from Ukraine and billions from China, they will own it,’ he tweeted. ‘Bidens’ made big money selling public office. How could Obama have allowed this to happen? Will Dems continue to condone and enable this kind pay-for-play?’”



CONGRESS SET TO PASS STOPGAP SPENDING BILL THIS WEEK

Roll Call: “The Senate needs to act this week to clear a stopgap spending bill before recessing through the end of the government’s fiscal year, but that is really the only must-pass business for either chamber. The House passed the measure Thursday, 301-123, after resolving hangups that included a debate over assisting farmers who have seen demand for crops plummet thanks to the ongoing sparring over trade with China. … There is no expectation the Senate will have trouble reaching an agreement to clear the measure to keep the government funded through Nov. 21, but it is certainly not the only piece of business that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wants to advance. … Once the House is back Tuesday, Democrats will once again turn their attention to border politics as the chamber considers two measures designed to improve the Department of Homeland Security’s treatment of migrants.”

LET’S GET THIS BREAD

UPI: “A raccoon went for a 16-mile ride on top of a Florida bread delivery truck that reached speeds of over 50 mph during the trip. The driver of the Wonder Bread truck said other drivers called his attention to the raccoon on top of his truck, and he had already traveled about 10 miles before calling 911 from the parking lot of a fast food restaurant. Police and the driver attempted to get the raccoon to safety by pulling the truck up to a convenient tree branch, but the animal refused to climb down. The driver said he eventually had to drive the final 6 miles of his journey with the raccoon still riding on the roof. He said the animal eventually apparently climbed down on its own once the truck was parked at his company's headquarters in North Fort Myers.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“Over the past hundred years, Americans have elected 13 Republican Administrations and 12 Democratic ones. Power could not be more evenly divided. American presidential elections are essentially a flip of the coin. This time the coin landed on its edge.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in Time magazine on Nov. 20, 2000.

* The latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll – the most closely watched of all Iowa polls – found Elizabeth Warren taking the lead in the first Democratic nominating contest with 22%, followed by Joe Biden at 20%. Bernie Sanders was third with 11%, followed closely by Pete Buttigieg at 9%. Kamala Harris rounded out the top five with 6% support. (Of the top five candidates, Warren was the only candidate to see her support grow since June.)

* On a related note, it’s worth noting that in the same Iowa poll, local Democrats were asked for their first and second choices, which matter a great deal given the way the state’s caucus system is structured. When first- and second-choice preferences are combined, Warren’s advantage over Biden is even more striking: 42% to 30%. Sanders is further back at 21%, followed by Buttigieg’s 18%.

* Staff shake-ups on Bernie Sanders’ team continue, with the Vermont senator parting ways with one of his Iowa deputy field directors. Kevin Lata had previously worked on Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign, as well as Hillary Clinton’s 2016 team.

* In keeping with the recent trend, the Alaska Republican Party became the latest state GOP to officially cancel its Republican presidential primary, which had been scheduled for April. Several state parties have taken similar steps to protect Donald Trump from possible embarrassment against his primary rivals.

* As the General Motors strike continues, several Democratic presidential candidates have visited picket lines to show support for members of the United Auto Workers.

* With some evidence of Texas becoming more competitive, Republican officials are making it easier for Green Party candidates to qualify for the ballot, with the obvious hope that the move will undermine Democratic support.

* Though it’s difficult to know if this is a stunt, Cory Booker’s campaign manager wrote in a new memo to staff and supporters that the New Jersey senator’s presidential campaign may come to an end without another $1.7 million before the end of the quarter. (The third quarter ends a week from today.)

* As expected, Rep. Joe Kennedy (D) officially kicked off a primary campaign in Massachusetts against incumbent Sen. Ed Markey (D) over the weekend.

* And following their recent Twitter argument over which one of them is more closely aligned with Trump’s foreign policy, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is reportedly taking steps to undermine Rep. Liz Cheney’s (R-Wyo.) prospective U.S. Senate campaign."

Harris, 30, was on her way to the Big Barn Dance in Taos, N.M., when she allegedly caused a three-vehicle collision with 16-year-old Maria Elena Cruz and another vehicle.

Harris and Cruz died at the scene, while the third driver was reportedly unharmed.

COUNTRY SINGER KYLIE RAE HARRIS FOUGHT BACK TEARS IN EMOTIONAL VIDEO HOURS BEFORE DEATH

The Taos County Sheriff's Office examined vehicle data recorders from the crash to recreate the scene.

“The information from the data boxes supports our at-scene investigation that two collision events occurred involving the three vehicles and that speed was definitely a contributing factor,"" Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe told the Taos News in a statement.

After reconstructing the crash, the Sheriff's Office alleges that Harris, who was driving a Chevrolet Equinox in the southbound lane, was going 102 mph when she rear-ended a black Chevrolet Avalanche.

AUTHORITIES BELIEVE KYLIE RAE HARRIS CAUSED DEADLY CRASH

Harris allegedly then veered into oncoming traffic in the northbound lane, still going 95 mph, where she struck Cruz's Jeep SUV.

Cruz was reportedly going 51 mph.

Cruz's father, Pedro Cruz, a Taos County firefighter/EMT, responded to the scene and found his daughter dead upon arrival.

KYLIE RAE HARRIS' MOTHER SAYS SHE STRUGGLED WITH ALCOHOL

The Sheriff’s Office also suspected speed and intoxication were factors in the accident, though authorities are awaiting a toxicology report from the Office of the Medical Investigator before making an official determination.

Court records indicate that Harris had a history of drinking and driving. In June 2017, she was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated after records indicated she had a blood alcohol content level of over 0.15, nearly twice the legal limit. Harris was convicted in October 2017 and was ordered to have an ignition interlock device installed in her car.

The crooner was also cited for speeding in 2014 when she was clocked going 81 in a 60 mph zone.

Court documents obtained by Fox News show Harris was charged in May 2009 with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. However, she was granted deferred adjudication – a form of probation in Texas that allowed a “guilty” or “no contest” plea to be scrubbed from her record if she completed the terms of the agreement. Court records indicate the charges against Harris were dismissed on May 19, 2012, exactly three years later.

If you did, hold on to those memories. It might be the last relaxing moment you'll have for a while. We're about to wreck your peace of mind.

It turns out that all is not well on this blue planet of ours, far from it. Indeed, it appears that the Earth itself is facing what we're going to call tonight, an existential threat from climate change.

Now, what does the term ""existential threat"" actually mean, you ask? Honestly, we don't know. But it sounds absolutely terrifying.

CLIMATE CHANGE PROTESTS SNARL DC TRAFFIC AS BIZARRE SCENES UNFOLD IN CAPITAL

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., presidential candidate: The climate change is real. It is an existential threat to our country and the entire planet.

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., presidential candidate: If NATO is about the common defense, the biggest existential threat is climate change.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, presidential candidate: This is climate change. It really is the existential threat.

Julian Castro, presidential candidate: We're going to have to address the most existential threat to our nation and the world, climate change.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

Beto O'Rourke, presidential candidate: On climate change, the greatest existential threat that we face.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., presidential candidate: We are facing a climate crisis, it represents an existential threat to who we are as human beings.

""A threat to who we are as humans."" Well, there are a number of questions here. Let's see if we can unpack them.

The first one: is climate change real? That's an easy one. Of course, it's real. Climate always changes.

If you're in the United States, for example, the ground that you're standing on right now was not so long ago really covered with glacial ice a mile thick. Now, it's not covered in glacial ice a mile thick. So what happened?

What happened is climate change. That's been happening since the Earth cooled. Is human activity accelerating climate change? Can we reverse or slow climate change? Despite what they tell you, no one really knows.

But the real question here has nothing to do with climate science. It has to do with people who pretend they understand climate science. Do those people actually believe what they're saying?

This is what climate activism has become -- a performative stunt, mixed with hypocrisy. These are the people who promised to crack down on your cheeseburgers while flying across the country, on private jets.

Well, let's see. Here was Kamala Harris recently talking at a CNN town hall about how red meat contributes to the absolutely existential threat of climate change.

Harris: As a nation, we have actually have to have a real priority at the highest level of government around what we eat and in terms of healthy eating, because we have a problem in America.

Erin Burnett, CNN host: But would you support changing the Dietary Guidelines?

Harris: Yes.

Burnett: You know, the food pyramid, what people are eating?

Harris: Yes.

Burnett: So reduce red meat specifically.

Harris: Yes, I would.

Got that? Kamala Harris is a good person, and because she is a good person -- a much better person than you are -- she cares about the existential threat of climate change so much, that she is willing to forgo red meat. That's what she told CNN viewers recently.

But when she is in the pork producing state of Iowa, though, it's a very different story. Just this past weekend, Harris attended the Annual Polk County Democratic Party Steak Fry. She took her turn working the grill posing for the cameras.

And by the way, so did all of the other Democratic candidates. Liz Warren was there, Beto O'Rourke, even Cory Booker, who says he is a vegan. Organizers grilled more than 10,000 steaks over the weekend. Tape of the event shows plumes of ozone destroying meat smoke rising heavenward. The candidates standing amidst all of this seemed wholly unconcerned.

Are you surprised? Don't be surprised. This is what climate activism has become -- a performative stunt, mixed with hypocrisy. These are the people who promised to crack down on your cheeseburgers while flying across the country, on private jets. No one says a word about it.

Last week, millions of concerned progressives took part in the so-called climate strike. In their wake, they left mountains of litter. On Monday in Washington, climate activists demanded change by blocking roads, causing gridlock, and throwing confetti on the ground.

Well, if you're under 40, you might be surprised to learn that people didn't use to express concern about the environment by littering. That used to seem weird, but then the point of environmentalism used to be about nature and preserving it and protecting it.

The point now is very different. The point now is political power. You gin up a crisis and you demand the population submit to your will, or else. And as you do that, of course, you don't need to fight fair or acknowledge democracy or make a rational case for your position. You do whatever it takes. You'll even use children, if it helps.

Just today, for example, a 16-year-old Swedish girl named Greta Thunberg addressed the United Nations at the behest of climate activists. Here's part of what she said:

Thunberg, climate change activist: This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school, on the other side of the ocean. Yet, you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you? You have stolen my dreams, my childhood with your empty words.

We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is the money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you? If you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil, and that I refuse to believe.

You stole my childhood? Do what I want you to do, or else you're evil?

How do you respond to statements like that? The truth is you can't respond. And of course, that's the point.

When you use children to demand power, they become a kind of human shield. You can hide safely behind them, no one can criticize you.

But who would do something that unscrupulous? Anyone who would do that is someone who would literally do anything to seize control. And that's exactly what they're doing.

TRUMP UKRAINE GAMES TIP DEMS TOWARD IMPEACHMENT

Politico: “President Donald Trump on Tuesday shifted his explanation for temporarily withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, citing what he criticized as a lack of similar financial contribution by other Western powers to the Eastern European nation. Trump’s latest remarks are at odds with his assertion Monday that he denied the assistance because he feared bureaucratic corruption within Ukraine’s government. The new claim also comes after weekend reports that he repeatedly pressured newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son. ‘As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid. They were fully paid,’ Trump told reporters Tuesday, ahead of his address to the United Nations General Assembly. ‘But my complaint has always been, and I'd withhold again, and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine,’ he continued.”



Officials say Pelosi quietly making moves - WaPo: “[Speaker Nancy] Pelosi, according to multiple senior House Democrats and congressional aides, has been gauging the mood of her caucus members about whether they believe that allegations that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate a political foe are a tipping point. She was making calls as late as Monday night, and many leadership aides who once thought Trump’s impeachment was unlikely now say they think it’s almost inevitable. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly. Pelosi’s conversations — and reconsideration of her long-held position that impeachment is too divisive — come amid a growing clamor for impeachment that extends beyond the party’s liberal base and many Democratic presidential candidates to moderate lawmakers in competitive House seats.”



Moderate Dems join the effort - Fox News: “A slew of key swing-district Democrats late Monday threw their support en masse behind opening a formal impeachment inquiry, as The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal reported in the evening that President Trump personally ordered acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before he pressed the new Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The rapid-fire declarations by the influential Democrats, after seemingly months of teetering on the brink, came just a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi strongly suggested she was now warming to the idea of impeaching the president. Speaking to Fox News, a House Democratic leadership aide confirmed that the Democratic caucus will meet Tuesday afternoon to discuss the Ukraine matter and how to proceed.”



Trump’s attacks on Biden worry Dems of 2016 repeat - WaPo: “But in a worrisome sign for Democrats anxious about reliving the party’s woes in 2016, [the Biden] campaign’s counterattack is being drowned out by a pro-Trump network on social media and cable news that kicked into gear over the weekend, leveling accusations against Biden that have scant factual basis. … The flurry of online attacks against Biden carries echoes of conspiracy theories spread by Trump and his allies about Hillary Clinton’s health and claims about her foreign entanglements that helped turn voters against her. The onslaught comes at a crucial moment in the Democratic primary contest, as the former vice president attempts to showcase his ability to go toe-to-toe with Trump. But with the Democratic National Committee attempting to be a more neutral arbiter than it was in 2016, when it was accused of aiding Clinton, the party helped monitor viral attacks but publicly remained silent.”



THE RULEBOOK: PROVE YOURSELF

“To reverse and undo what has been done by a predecessor, is very often considered by a successor as the best proof he can give of his own capacity and desert… and that the less he resembles him, the more he will recommend himself to the favor of his constituents.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 72



TIME OUT: ONE OF A KIND

Smithsonian: “The guitar Prince plays in [the Purple Rain video] was custom-made for him by a luthier at a Minneapolis music shop called Knut-Koupee Enterprises. … It made sense, even then, that Prince would require an instrument that didn’t resemble anything anyone else was playing. Knut-Koupee made three so-called ‘cloud’ guitars for Prince in the early 1980s. … In 1993, Prince gave a cloud guitar to the Smithsonian Institution, but he didn’t include any information about the instrument’s origins. But earlier this year, John Woodland, the conservator for Prince’s guitar collection … reached out to the Smithsonian with a sneaking suspicion. After the guitar underwent a CT scan and extensive paint analysis, what they found was a shocker… This wasn’t just a cloud guitar, in other words, it was the cloud guitar—the instrument responsible for some of the most iconic sounds and images in American popular music.”

WARREN CLOSING IN ON BIDEN IN NEVADA

USA Today: “Elizabeth Warren has pulled within striking distance of Joe Biden for the lead in Nevada's influential presidential caucuses. A new Suffolk University/USA TODAY Network Poll, taken after this month's Democratic debate, shows Biden at 23% and Warren at 19% in Nevada, the state that follows Iowa and New Hampshire in the opening presidential contests next year. Bernie Sanders is at 14%. While Warren trailed Biden, the Massachusetts senator was within the margin of error of the former vice president for the first time in a public poll in the Silver State. … Among the second tier of candidates in Nevada, California Sen. Kamala Harris was at 4% and South Bend (Ind.) Mayor Pete Buttigieg, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and activist Tom Steyer at 3%. … The survey showed Warren positioned to increase her support as the Democratic field narrows. She was the ‘second choice’ of 19%, compared to 16% for Biden, 12% for Sanders and 10% for California Sen. Kamala Harris.”



She also joins him upfront in New Hampshire - Monmouth University: “Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has joined former Vice President Joe Biden at the front of the pack in New Hampshire, according to the latest Monmouth University Poll. … Among registered New Hampshire Democrats and unaffiliated voters who are likely to participate in the February 2020 Democratic primary, 27% currently support Warren and 25% support Biden. The only other candidates in double digits are Sanders at 12% and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 10%. Others with measurable support are California Sen. Kamala Harris (3%), New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (2%), Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (2%), Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar (2%), former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer (2%), and entrepreneur Andrew Yang (2%).”



Gabbard is the 12th Dem to qualify for October debate - Politico: “Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has qualified for the October Democratic presidential primary debate, making her the twelfth candidate to hit the Democratic National Committee's thresholds. Gabbard got 2 percent support in a New Hampshire poll conducted by Monmouth University and released on Tuesday.

DNC raises qualifying thresholds for November debate - Fox News: “The DNC announced on Monday that to qualify for the November showdown, candidates must reach at least 3 percent in four approved national or early-voting-state polls. That’s up from the 2 percent needed to reach the stage at the September and October debates and up from the 1 percent needed in three approved surveys for the June and July debates. But, to tamper down any criticism from the early voting states, the DNC added another way to satisfy the polling criteria – reaching 5 percent in two qualifying surveys in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina – the first four states to vote in the nominating calendar. The window for the polling is from Sept. 13 to seven days before the still-unannounced November debate. In previous debates, candidates had until two weeks before the showdown to reach the polling criteria.”

Fox News: “A Russian navy boat embarking on a research expedition in the Arctic Sea sunk after being attacked by a female walrus that was defending her young, according to reports Monday. The Altai, a tugboat operated by the Russian navy’s Northern Fleet, carried researchers from the Russian Geographical Society and other expedition participants into waters near a remote island chain called Franz Josef Land in the Arctic Sea, Ars Technica reported. The boat dispatched a smaller inflatable landing craft in shallow waters off Wilczek Island to bring researchers ashore near Cape Heller. Before the boat could reach the beach, it was attacked by a female walrus who was probably ‘fearing for her cubs,’ according to a press release from the Russian Geographical Society. ‘The boat sank, but a tragedy was avoided thanks to the prompt action by the squad leader. All landing participants safely reached the shore,’ the press release said.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“The first week, I thought, the terrible thing is that people are going to judge me now by a different standard. If I can just muddle through life, they'll say it was a great achievement, given this. I thought that would be the worst, that would be the greatest defeat in my life -- if I allowed that. I decided if I could make people judge me by the old standard, that would be a triumph and that's what I try to do. It seemed to me the only way to live.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) speaking with the Washington Post on Aug. 17, 1984.

Todd questioned O'Rourke at an event in Colorado Thursday and stated his credentials as a shooting survivor, before asking how far he planned to take his gun ban. ABC later reported the exchange as if Todd was supporting the plan, when, in fact, he is against it.

""I went to hear Beto speak and if I got the opportunity to ask him where he drew the line as far as his gun confiscation plans -- and I wanted to phrase it in a way that allowed him to speak his mind and he did, Todd said. ""He really is open to... banning and confiscating nearly all firearms.""

He claimed members of the media turned cold when they found out he didn't support O'Rourke's plan and accused them of embracing a far-left agenda.

BETO CALLS FOR RED FLAG LAWS, MANDATORY GUN BUYBACK AND NATIONAL REGISTRY ALL IN THE SAME SPEECH

""The media, by and large, is biased and in some cases complicit with pushing the extremists' far-left agenda,"" Todd said. ""There were many that were very interested in talking to me afterward. But, when they found out my true stance, they suddenly were less interested. So it's been crickets since they found out where I truly stood on the issue.""

Todd was injured in 1999 when two students, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, opened fire at Columbine High School in Colorado, killing 13 people and injuring 24. Harris and Klebold eventually killed themselves with gunshot wounds to the head following the massacre that left 12 students and one teacher dead.

Todd also said during his ""Fox & Friends"" interview that the idea of confiscating firearms from private citizens is a personal affront and will leave millions defenseless while creating more problems than it would solve.

""It's insulting and dangerous,"" he said earlier in the interview. ""You're removing the means of protection for millions and millions of law-abiding Americans. I think his ban is misplaced.

""It goes after the wrong people and it goes after the wrong issues,"" Todd continued. ""The law-abiding citizens in this country aren't the problem. There's an element that is a problem. And I think we need to address the realities of mental health and other issues. And the reality is that there's evil in this world."""

""The president is extremely concerned about this because of the epidemic that could occur and so we're looking at both short term and long term,"" Carson told host Harris Faulkner.

Carson said the first step to fixing the problem is to remove the homeless from their current situation.

""We have to actually get the people out of there. Put them in a clean place,"" Carson said.

But in the process of doing that, we're also looking at wraparound services so that we can get these people out of dependency.""

Carson said ""compassion"" is a motivating factor for this federal intervention.

""But as a compassionate society, it is something that we have to do. Something about we can't just talk about it. Should it be the responsibility of the federal government? No,"" Carson said.

But, the upping of polling and donor thresholds – more modest than the doubling of the criteria from July’s second round to this month’s third round – may not significantly winnow the field of White House contenders still standing after October’s debate.

The DNC announced on Monday that to qualify for the November showdown, candidates must reach at least 3 percent in four approved national or early-voting-state polls. That’s up from the 2 percent needed to reach the stage at the September and October debates and up from the 1 percent needed in three approved surveys for the June and July debates.

OCTOBER DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY DEBATE TO BE HELD IN OHIO

But, to tamper down any criticism from the early voting states, the DNC added another way to satisfy the polling criteria – reaching 5 percent in two qualifying surveys in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina – the first four states to vote in the nominating calendar.

The window for the polling is from Sept. 13 to seven days before the still-unannounced November debate. In previous debates, candidates had until two weeks before the showdown to reach the polling criteria.

""Qualification period ends 1 week (not 2 weeks) before the debate, giving candidates more time to qualify,"" DNC communications director Xochitl Hinojosa tweeted.

The other threshold – fundraising – also saw a slight raising of the bar. To make the cut, candidates will have to receive campaign contributions from 165,000 individual donors. That’s up from 130,000 for the September and October debates and from 65,000 for the first two rounds of showdowns. Candidates also will have to receive 600 unique contributions from each of 20 states, the District of Columbia or U.S. territories.

The DNC’s faced criticism over its thresholds for months from many of the lower and middle-tier candidates, who argued that the criteria forced them to concentrate on boosting donor contributions at the expense of retail politicking in the early voting states. And, some activists and party leaders in the early voting states have also criticized the DNC for winnowing the record field of candidates – which topped off at roughly two-dozen contenders this summer – before voters actually got to vote in the primaries and caucuses starting this coming February.

""The DNC is using polling to winnow the field even further, when it's voters and caucus-goers who should be determining our nominee,"" said Shannon Beckham, a spokeswoman for Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet's presidential campaign.

And, Galia Slayen, a spokeswoman for Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, told Fox News that ""as the DNC continues to make the rules up as they go along, Governor Bullock will remain focused on bringing his message of a fair shot for every American directly to voters on the ground.""

Both Bennet and Bullock were on the debate stage in July for the third round but failed to qualify for this month's showdown and it appears unlikely either will make the cut for October's debate.

The new thresholds shouldn’t be much of a problem for many of the leading contenders – such as former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Kamala Harris of California, as well as South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

2020 DEMOCRATS FUME AT DNC OVER DEBATE THRESHOLDS

Some of the other six candidates likely to make the October debate are not sure bets to qualify for November’s showdown. That group consists of Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

As he has in the past, Yang praised the DNC, tweeting, ""Kudos to the DNC for raising the thresholds in a fair and transparent manner as well.""

Some of the candidates, including Booker and Buttigieg, quickly used news of the new thresholds to reach out to supporters with fundraising emails.

Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro and billionaire philanthropist and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer – who've also made the cut for October’s showdown – have yet to hit 3 percent in any polls since the November qualifying period kicked off earlier this month. And, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who's just one poll away from making the October debate, also has yet to reach 3 percent in any approved surveys.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has surged and now enjoys a slight 2-point advantage over former Vice President Joe Biden, the longtime front-runner in the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

The Monmouth University survey, released Tuesday, also shows Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont fading to a distant third.

WARREN EDGES OUT BIDEN IN NEW IOWA POLL, SANDERS DISTANT THIRD

Warren stands at 27 percent among likely Democratic presidential primary voters in the state, with Biden at 25 percent. Warren’s 2-point edge is well within the survey’s sampling error.

Warren’s support has soared by 19 points from the previous Monmouth poll in the Granite State, which was conducted in May. Biden’s dropped 11 points from that survey.

Sanders, meanwhile, is in third in the new poll, at 12 percent, dropping 6 points from Monmouth’s May survey.

New Hampshire, which votes second in the presidential nominating calendar following the Iowa caucuses, is considered by many political analysts and pundits as a must-win for both Sanders and Warren.

The independent senator from Vermont crushed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire, launching the one-time longshot for the nomination into a marathon battle against the eventual nominee. He’s retained a strong organization and devoted supporters in the state as he bids a second time for the White House.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

But Warren, who like Sanders hails from a neighboring state to New Hampshire, has also built up a powerful campaign organization in the Granite State, and has made numerous visits. Warren will return to the state to hold town halls on Wednesday and Friday.

“Warren continues to look stronger with every new poll. She seems to be picking up support across the spectrum with gains coming at the expense of both Biden and Sanders,” said Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray.

The surge from Warren is coming from self-described liberals, among whom she’s up 28 points since the May poll to stand at 39 percent, with Sanders dropping 13 points down to 16 percent. Warren’s also risen 11 points among self-described moderate and conservative voters to stand at 18 percent, with Biden dropping 15 points to stand at 30 percent.

According to the poll, the only other candidate to register in double digits is South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who’s at 10 percent, slightly behind Sanders.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California stands at 3 percent in the survey, with Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, billionaire philanthropist and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii each at 2 percent. The remaining 10 candidates tested in the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls earned 1 percent or less in the poll.

The Monmouth poll in New Hampshire is one of the qualifying surveys the Democratic National Committee uses for their polling thresholds for candidates to make the cut for the primary debates. Gabbard’s 2 percent showing in the new poll means she’s reached 2 percent in four qualifying polls, allowing her to make the stage at next month’s fourth round of nomination debates.

The poll’s findings are similar to those of the latest poll in Iowa this past weekend. A Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom survey indicated Warren at 22 percent, Biden at 20 percent and Sanders a distant third at 11 percent. The Des Moines Register surveys have long been considered the gold standard in Iowa polling.

A new poll released Tuesday in Nevada, which holds it's caucus following the New Hampshire primary, also indicates a close contest between Biden and Warren.

A USA Today/Suffolk University survey puts Biden at 23 percent, Warren at 19 percent and Sanders at 14 percent.

The most recent polls in New Hampshire have been all over the board, with one suggesting Sanders holding a lead; another indicating a three-way tie among Biden, Warren and Sanders; and a third pointing to Sanders trailing Biden and Warren.

The Monmouth University poll was conducted from Sept. 17-21, among 401 New Hampshire voters likely to vote in next February’s Democratic presidential primary questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s sampling error is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.

The poll’s release comes with four-and-a-half months to go until the New Hampshire primary.

“It is important to keep in mind that the race is still very much in flux,” Murray noted."

UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER DEFENDS TRUMP'S CALL WITH ZELENSKIY: 'I THINK THERE WAS NO PRESSURE'

Trump reportedly has been accused of asking Ukraine’s leader multiple times to work with Rudy Giuliani in investigating former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, and possibly using military aid as leverage. Trump denied making any improper requests – but that didn’t stop Bernstein from comparing it to Watergate.

“If the reporting of Shane Harris and the Wall Street Journal is accurate, and it seems to be, it clearly moved toward a grievous abuse of power by the President of the United States. I keep getting asked, ‘Are there echoes of Watergate in this?’ There are in the following ways,” Bernstein said Sunday. “Watergate was very much an attempt by Richard Nixon to undermine the Democratic electoral process.”

Bernstein said that Nixon used “political espionage and sabotage” to nominate George McGovern, who Nixon considered the “weakest candidate,” as opposed to Edmund Muskie.

BIDEN FACES SCRUTINY FOR DEMANDING OUSTER OF UKRAINE OFFICIAL PROBING FIRM THAT EMPLOYED HIS SON

Back in 1972, Bernstein and Bob Woodward reported that a White House aide fabricated a letter detailing Muskie condoning a racial slur against Americans of French-Canadian descent, which derailed his campaign.

“Something of the same thing seems to be happening here where Biden, who Trump and his people have said they fear the most, in terms of being an opponent, has been the object of these, perhaps, dirty tricks,” Bernstein continued. ""One thing Nixon never did was engage a foreign power to investigate a candidate running for office in the United States. It is a grievous offense if this is what happened.”

Bernstein, along with Woodward, helped take down President Nixon with Pulitzer Prize-winning coverage of the Watergate scandal in the Washington Post.

In addition, Rove claimed Monday on ""The Story"" that the report the whistleblower who brought the issue to the forefront did not have ""firsthand knowledge"" of the call is an important development.

""It's a big news item,"" he said. ""It obscures some of the bigger issues that lie behind it.""

In addition, host Harris Faulkner posited that foreign leaders themselves would expect confidentiality as much as America's head of state.

Rove, a former aide to ex-President George W. Bush, said the issue should not be a partisan one.

He said he believed that Trump would not want a private conversation with a foreign leader being publicized as much as Presidents Clinton, Bush or Obama would have.

""None of them would,"" he said.

Earlier Monday, Trump tore into the press for their coverage of reports he pressured Ukraine's leader to help investigate political rival Joe Biden.

Calling the White House press corps “crooked as hell,” a riled up Trump slammed the media for “double standards” over what he claimed was the failure of the press to report on allegations of unsubstantiated wrongdoing by Biden and his son, Hunter, related to dealings with Kyiv.

“Joe Biden and his son are corrupt, but the fake news doesn’t want to report because they’re Democrats,” Trump said in New York during United Nations meetings. “If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair.”

The New York Times announced it was shutting down its Spanish-language edition, ""NYT en Espanol,"" which launched in 2016. The venture, management explained, did not prove a financial success, in part because their readers were “less engaged than they were with our core site, and we did not see a path to converting them as subscribers.”

Translation: Spanish-speaking readers perhaps didn’t buy what the anti-Catholic, anti-Trump, pro-abortion New York Times was selling. Who is surprised? The Times, along with other liberal media outlets, imagine Latinos to be a monolithic group both culturally and politically.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN AIMS TO USE IMMIGRATION, TRADE TO WIN HISPANIC VOTE IN 2020

Democrats make the same mistake, taking the Hispanic vote for granted. In 2020, with Hispanics becoming an ever-more important factor in key swing states like Florida and Pennsylvania, that presumption could cost them the election.

In their fealty to tightly bound identity politics, liberals simply cannot imagine that Spanish-speaking people who live in the United States might vote for Trump. And yet, indications are that many will, despite the all-out effort by the Times and other liberal outlets to portray the president as racist.

In 2016, Trump received 28 percent of the Latino vote, slightly more than the 27 percent garnered by Mitt Romney in 2012, shocking those who thought his promise to build a wall would alienate Latino voters.

Since then, as the debate over immigration has become more heated and the president has stepped up efforts to prevent a flood of undocumented people from Central America from crossing the southern border, attacks from Democrats have only intensified.

And yet, Hispanic support for the president appears to grow.

In 2018, Hispanic voters gave Republican congressional candidates 29 percent of the vote, or slightly above Trump’s take in 2016, even as white voters defected from the GOP. The number of Hispanics identifying themselves as Republicans climbed from 24 percent in 2016 to 27 percent in 2018, according to Pew polling. Meanwhile, the president’s approval rating among Hispanics ranges in recent polls between 29 percent and 37 percent.

A New York Times reporter was clearly baffled by this turn of events as she ventured to cover the president’s recent rally in New Mexico, where 47 percent of the electorate is Latino. Jennifer Medina was shocked to find large numbers of Hispanics who had waited in the sun to greet the president, and whose ""identity was something of an afterthought.""

She met Latino Trump supporters who backed his position on illegal immigration, and who felt that ""We need to take care of the people who are already here."" They were not, she reported, ""single-issue voters,"" which seemed to surprise the Times writer. Those proudly announcing themselves as Latinos for Trump also tended to favor his position on abortion, his appointments of conservative judges, and defense of gun rights. (Take that, Beto!)

That said, the common theme among those she spoke with was their opposition to people entering the country illegally. Apparently Democrats' rants about “children in cages” and their push to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement have not swayed these voters.

A recent Harvard/Harris poll confirms this. Some 58 percent of Hispanics said they would vote for a president that stood for “strengthening our border to reduce illegal immigrants” while only 46 percent said they would support “opening our borders to many more immigrants.”

Though Medina confidently concluded that Trump is ""deeply unpopular with most Hispanics in New Mexico,"" she admitted that “brown faces were not hard to find"" at the rally. She offered no proof of Trump’s low approval within the state, but perhaps thought it was a foregone conclusion since the president lost the state by eight percentage points in 2016. She may be right.

But Democrats do themselves no service by underestimating Hispanic support for the president. Or, as they frequently do, assuming that all Latinos think alike.

Many of the Trump supporters interviewed by Medina came from families who had been in the country for more than one generation; they do not, she said, identify with the caravans from Central America or with those crossing illegally. One person told her she had no problem with the more recent arrivals as long as ""they come in, blend in, speak our language."" That language is not Spanish.

Many derided the casual application of the “racist” label to the president, with one person calling the charge of bigotry a “frenzy made by the media.”

As they pursue the Hispanic vote, the Trump campaign will talk up the economic gains made by Latinos and other minorities under the president. Coincident with the New Mexico rally, for instance, the GOP tweeted that 34,600 jobs have been added in the state since 2016, the unemployment rate has dropped from 6.5 percent to 4.9 percent and nearly 15,734 people have gotten off of food stamps.

More broadly, since 2016 the country has added 5.2 million jobs, of which 4.5 million went to people of color. The Washington Post reported that this is the first time in the country’s history that minorities were winning most of the new jobs being created. Hispanic unemployment is currently 4.2 percent, the lowest ever recorded.

Because the jobs picture has improved markedly under Trump, the Wall Street Journal reports that “ The poverty rate among female households declined 2.7 percentage points for blacks, four percentage points for Hispanics and 7.1 percentage points for their children.”

A recent Harvard/Harris poll shows that 41 percent of Hispanics approve of Trump’s handling of the economy, and 44 percent give him high marks for “stimulating jobs.”

Against these achievements, Democrats are campaigning on open borders and on-demand abortion up until birth. These and other positions which could threaten our robust economy, like the Green New Deal or raising taxes on middle-class voters to fund single-payer health care, will alienate those who are increasingly benefiting from our capitalist system.

In 2020, Hispanics could shock Democrats by reelecting a president who is making life better for them. Even if he doesn’t speak Spanish.

Des Moines Register: “Elizabeth Warren has surged in Iowa, narrowly overtaking Joe Biden and distancing herself from fellow progressive Bernie Sanders, the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows. Warren, the U.S. senator from Massachusetts, now holds a 2-percentage-point lead, with 22% of likely Democratic caucusgoers saying she is their first choice for president. It is the first time she has led in the Register’s poll. Former Vice President Biden, who had led each of the Register’s three previous 2020 cycle polls, follows her at 20%. Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont, has fallen to third place with 11%. No other candidate reaches double digits. ‘This is the first major shakeup’ in what had been a fairly steady race, said J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., which conducted the poll. … South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg follows the three leaders as the favorite of 9% of poll respondents. U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California is at 6%. U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey are at 3%. Polling at 2% are U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, businessman Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang.”



Dem candidates take two approaches in Iowa - Des Moines Register: “Former Vice President Joe Biden brought in a fire truck, bouncy house and ice cream truck for a carnival-style ‘Biden fest.’ A Mariachi band played at former U.S. Housing Secretary Juliàn Castro’s rally site and then marched in with the candidate and his supporters. And Lizzo and Prince blared through the speakers at a gathering for U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. But others took a different tack: U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren focused on organizing supporters, gathering voter information and knocking doors rather than big displays of support. Saturday’s Polk County Steak Fry in Iowa was the largest in the event’s storied history, drawing more than 12,000 excited Democrats to Water Works Park, where they heard from 17 presidential candidates vying for their attention and support on caucus day. Many of the candidates gathered with their supporters ahead of the main event, holding rallies where they each tried to outshine their competitors.”



Voters dislike Trump, still have doubts about Dems - NBC News: “As Democratic candidates compete for the opportunity to take on President Donald Trump, the incumbent they hope to oust is more personally disliked than any of his recent predecessors, and half of voters say they’re very uncomfortable with the idea of his re-election. But the electorate at large also expresses doubts about some of the progressive policies being backed by candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and the party’s more moderate frontrunner — Joe Biden — also faces questions about his fitness for the job. Those are the major findings in the latest release from the September NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll… But Trump also continues to benefit from the upside of the polarization of the electorate around him, commanding more enthusiasm than his Democratic competitors as well. A quarter of voters (26 percent) say they’re enthusiastic about him, while fewer say they’re enthusiastic about Warren (17 percent), Sanders (13 percent) and Biden (12 percent.)”



The end may be near for Booker - Politico: “Cory Booker’s presidential campaign is betting it all on the next 10 days, signaling Saturday that it will cease to exist unless it can raise nearly $2 million by the end of the month. ‘We have reached a critical moment, and time is running out,’ campaign manager Addisu Demissie warned in a memo to Booker staff and supporters. ‘It’s now or never: The next 10 days will determine whether Cory Booker can stay in this race and compete to win the nomination.’ The bottom line, Demissie said, is that ‘we do not see a legitimate long-term path forward’ if the campaign can’t raise another $1.7 million by Sept. 30, the third-quarter fundraising deadline. … Demissie made clear on a conference call with reporters later Saturday that the campaign isn’t out of money or at risk of running out of funds.”

TIME OUT: MEET YOU IN ST. LOUIS

History: “Amid much public excitement, American explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark return to St. Louis, Missouri, from the first recorded overland journey from the Mississippi River to the Pacific coast and back. The Lewis and Clark Expedition had set off more than two years before to explore the territory of the Louisiana Purchase. Even before the U.S. government concluded purchase negotiations with France, President Thomas Jefferson commissioned his private secretary Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, an army captain, to lead an expedition into what is now the U.S. Northwest. On May 14, the ‘Corps of Discovery,’ featuring some two dozen men, left St. Louis for the American interior. … On September 23, 1806, after two and a half years, the expedition returned to the city, bringing back a wealth of information about the largely unexplored region, as well as valuable U.S. claims to Oregon Territory.”

IMPEACHMENT PRESSURE BUILDS AROUND TRUMP PHONE CALL

NYT: “President Trump acknowledged on Sunday that he raised corruption accusations against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. during a phone call with Ukraine’s leader, a stunning admission as pressure mounted on Democrats to impeach Mr. Trump over allegations he leaned on a foreign government to help damage a political rival. In public and in private, many Democrats said the evidence that has emerged in recent days indicating that Mr. Trump pushed the Ukrainian government to investigate Mr. Biden, and his administration’s stonewalling of attempts by Congress to learn more, were changing their calculations about whether to charge him with articles of impeachment. … The fast-moving developments prompted Speaker Nancy Pelosi to level a warning of her own to the White House: Turn over the secret whistle-blower complaint by Thursday, or face a serious escalation from Congress. In a letter to House Democrats, Ms. Pelosi never mentioned the word ‘impeachment,’ but her message hinted at that possibility.”



Trump continues to defend his call about Biden - Politico: “President Donald Trump on Monday intensified his attempts to justify a phone call with Ukraine’s president in which he reportedly pushed for an investigation into one of his chief political rivals, maintaining that he’s merely concerned about stamping out corruption. He once again dismissed the accusations that he was using his position of power to pressure a foreign government into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son as a ‘witch hunt.’ For the first time, however, Trump appeared to connect the idea to the issue of foreign aid. ‘If we're supporting a country, we want to make sure that country is honest,’ Trump told reporters after arriving for the U.N. General Assembly. … Also at issue with critics of the president is $250 million in foreign aid meant for Ukraine that the White House mysteriously withheld before releasing under bipartisan pressure early this month. There is no evidence that Trump directly tied the release of foreign aid to an investigation into Biden and his son.”



Schumer insists on hearings over whistleblower complaint - Politico: “Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is requesting that the Republican Senate conduct hearings and issue a subpoena to the Trump administration in response to a whistleblower complaint about President Donald Trump's alleged request that Ukraine investigate one of his political opponents. In a letter to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Monday morning, the New York Democrat said the Senate should hold hearings regarding any connection between delayed aid to Ukraine and Trump's reported request that the country probe the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic contender in next year's presidential election. Schumer also asks McConnell to compel the Senate to issue a subpoena to bring the whistleblower complaint to Congress ‘as required by law.’”



Giuliani accuses Ukraine of laundering $3M to Hunter Biden - Fox News: “Rudy Giuliani channeled President Trump Monday with a wee-hours Twitter blitz aimed at turning the Ukraine story currently roiling Washington into a big problem for Democrats. Giuliani, the personal attorney for Trump and outspoken critic of presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son’s relationship with Ukraine, accused Kiev of laundering $3 million to Hunter Biden, suggested that the Obama administration turned a blind eye, and made the prediction that the scandal is in its infancy. ‘If Dem party doesn’t call for an investigation of Bidens’ millions from Ukraine and billions from China, they will own it,’ he tweeted. ‘Bidens’ made big money selling public office. How could Obama have allowed this to happen? Will Dems continue to condone and enable this kind pay-for-play?’”



CONGRESS SET TO PASS STOPGAP SPENDING BILL THIS WEEK

Roll Call: “The Senate needs to act this week to clear a stopgap spending bill before recessing through the end of the government’s fiscal year, but that is really the only must-pass business for either chamber. The House passed the measure Thursday, 301-123, after resolving hangups that included a debate over assisting farmers who have seen demand for crops plummet thanks to the ongoing sparring over trade with China. … There is no expectation the Senate will have trouble reaching an agreement to clear the measure to keep the government funded through Nov. 21, but it is certainly not the only piece of business that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wants to advance. … Once the House is back Tuesday, Democrats will once again turn their attention to border politics as the chamber considers two measures designed to improve the Department of Homeland Security’s treatment of migrants.”

LET’S GET THIS BREAD

UPI: “A raccoon went for a 16-mile ride on top of a Florida bread delivery truck that reached speeds of over 50 mph during the trip. The driver of the Wonder Bread truck said other drivers called his attention to the raccoon on top of his truck, and he had already traveled about 10 miles before calling 911 from the parking lot of a fast food restaurant. Police and the driver attempted to get the raccoon to safety by pulling the truck up to a convenient tree branch, but the animal refused to climb down. The driver said he eventually had to drive the final 6 miles of his journey with the raccoon still riding on the roof. He said the animal eventually apparently climbed down on its own once the truck was parked at his company's headquarters in North Fort Myers.”

* A new national Quinnipiac poll shows Elizabeth Warren inching past Joe Biden, 27% to 25%, in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Bernie Sanders is third with 16%, and Pete Buttigieg, at 7%, was the only other candidate above 5%. In August, Quinnipiac showed Biden leading Warren by 13 points.

* Also of interest from the same poll: among African-American Democrats, Biden’s lead over Warren in July was 49 points. Now, it’s 21 points.

* To the surprise of no one, Donald Trump’s political operation is trying to raise money off the House Democrats’ impeachment effort.

* In New Hampshire, a Monmouth poll released yesterday showed Warren narrowly leading Biden, 27% to 25%. Sanders is third with 12%, followed by Buttigieg at 10%. No other candidate reached double digits.

* In California, a new UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll, conducted for the Los Angeles Times, found Warren leading Biden, 29% to 22%. Sanders was third with 19%, while Kamala Harris, in her home state, was fourth with 8%.

* The former vice president has not, however, lost his lead in all of the latest polls: a national Emerson poll released yesterday showed Biden narrowly leading Warren, 25% to 23%, with Sanders very close behind at 22%. As Rachel noted on last night’s show, this is the same poll that found Andrew Yang at 8%.

* Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, still struggling to break through in the Democratic presidential race, endorsed the impeachment process against Trump yesterday. Marianne Williamson and Andrew Yang reached the same conclusion yesterday. Tulsi Gabbard, however, criticized impeachment as “divisive.”

* Speaking of the Hawaii congresswoman, Gabbard was at 2% support in New Hampshire in the aforementioned Monmouth poll, which appears to qualify her for next month’s presidential primary debate.

* And with just six weeks remaining before Kentucky’s gubernatorial election, incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin (R) shook up his campaign leadership this week, shifting operational control to Michael Antonopoulos, a longtime GOP strategist."

If you did, hold on to those memories. It might be the last relaxing moment you'll have for a while. We're about to wreck your peace of mind.

It turns out that all is not well on this blue planet of ours, far from it. Indeed, it appears that the Earth itself is facing what we're going to call tonight, an existential threat from climate change.

Now, what does the term ""existential threat"" actually mean, you ask? Honestly, we don't know. But it sounds absolutely terrifying.

CLIMATE CHANGE PROTESTS SNARL DC TRAFFIC AS BIZARRE SCENES UNFOLD IN CAPITAL

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., presidential candidate: The climate change is real. It is an existential threat to our country and the entire planet.

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., presidential candidate: If NATO is about the common defense, the biggest existential threat is climate change.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, presidential candidate: This is climate change. It really is the existential threat.

Julian Castro, presidential candidate: We're going to have to address the most existential threat to our nation and the world, climate change.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

Beto O'Rourke, presidential candidate: On climate change, the greatest existential threat that we face.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., presidential candidate: We are facing a climate crisis, it represents an existential threat to who we are as human beings.

""A threat to who we are as humans."" Well, there are a number of questions here. Let's see if we can unpack them.

The first one: is climate change real? That's an easy one. Of course, it's real. Climate always changes.

If you're in the United States, for example, the ground that you're standing on right now was not so long ago really covered with glacial ice a mile thick. Now, it's not covered in glacial ice a mile thick. So what happened?

What happened is climate change. That's been happening since the Earth cooled. Is human activity accelerating climate change? Can we reverse or slow climate change? Despite what they tell you, no one really knows.

But the real question here has nothing to do with climate science. It has to do with people who pretend they understand climate science. Do those people actually believe what they're saying?

This is what climate activism has become -- a performative stunt, mixed with hypocrisy. These are the people who promised to crack down on your cheeseburgers while flying across the country, on private jets.

Well, let's see. Here was Kamala Harris recently talking at a CNN town hall about how red meat contributes to the absolutely existential threat of climate change.

Harris: As a nation, we have actually have to have a real priority at the highest level of government around what we eat and in terms of healthy eating, because we have a problem in America.

Erin Burnett, CNN host: But would you support changing the Dietary Guidelines?

Harris: Yes.

Burnett: You know, the food pyramid, what people are eating?

Harris: Yes.

Burnett: So reduce red meat specifically.

Harris: Yes, I would.

Got that? Kamala Harris is a good person, and because she is a good person -- a much better person than you are -- she cares about the existential threat of climate change so much, that she is willing to forgo red meat. That's what she told CNN viewers recently.

But when she is in the pork producing state of Iowa, though, it's a very different story. Just this past weekend, Harris attended the Annual Polk County Democratic Party Steak Fry. She took her turn working the grill posing for the cameras.

And by the way, so did all of the other Democratic candidates. Liz Warren was there, Beto O'Rourke, even Cory Booker, who says he is a vegan. Organizers grilled more than 10,000 steaks over the weekend. Tape of the event shows plumes of ozone destroying meat smoke rising heavenward. The candidates standing amidst all of this seemed wholly unconcerned.

Are you surprised? Don't be surprised. This is what climate activism has become -- a performative stunt, mixed with hypocrisy. These are the people who promised to crack down on your cheeseburgers while flying across the country, on private jets. No one says a word about it.

Last week, millions of concerned progressives took part in the so-called climate strike. In their wake, they left mountains of litter. On Monday in Washington, climate activists demanded change by blocking roads, causing gridlock, and throwing confetti on the ground.

Well, if you're under 40, you might be surprised to learn that people didn't use to express concern about the environment by littering. That used to seem weird, but then the point of environmentalism used to be about nature and preserving it and protecting it.

The point now is very different. The point now is political power. You gin up a crisis and you demand the population submit to your will, or else. And as you do that, of course, you don't need to fight fair or acknowledge democracy or make a rational case for your position. You do whatever it takes. You'll even use children, if it helps.

Just today, for example, a 16-year-old Swedish girl named Greta Thunberg addressed the United Nations at the behest of climate activists. Here's part of what she said:

Thunberg, climate change activist: This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school, on the other side of the ocean. Yet, you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you? You have stolen my dreams, my childhood with your empty words.

We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is the money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you? If you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil, and that I refuse to believe.

You stole my childhood? Do what I want you to do, or else you're evil?

How do you respond to statements like that? The truth is you can't respond. And of course, that's the point.

When you use children to demand power, they become a kind of human shield. You can hide safely behind them, no one can criticize you.

But who would do something that unscrupulous? Anyone who would do that is someone who would literally do anything to seize control. And that's exactly what they're doing.

TRUMP UKRAINE GAMES TIP DEMS TOWARD IMPEACHMENT

Politico: “President Donald Trump on Tuesday shifted his explanation for temporarily withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, citing what he criticized as a lack of similar financial contribution by other Western powers to the Eastern European nation. Trump’s latest remarks are at odds with his assertion Monday that he denied the assistance because he feared bureaucratic corruption within Ukraine’s government. The new claim also comes after weekend reports that he repeatedly pressured newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son. ‘As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid. They were fully paid,’ Trump told reporters Tuesday, ahead of his address to the United Nations General Assembly. ‘But my complaint has always been, and I'd withhold again, and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine,’ he continued.”



Officials say Pelosi quietly making moves - WaPo: “[Speaker Nancy] Pelosi, according to multiple senior House Democrats and congressional aides, has been gauging the mood of her caucus members about whether they believe that allegations that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate a political foe are a tipping point. She was making calls as late as Monday night, and many leadership aides who once thought Trump’s impeachment was unlikely now say they think it’s almost inevitable. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly. Pelosi’s conversations — and reconsideration of her long-held position that impeachment is too divisive — come amid a growing clamor for impeachment that extends beyond the party’s liberal base and many Democratic presidential candidates to moderate lawmakers in competitive House seats.”



Moderate Dems join the effort - Fox News: “A slew of key swing-district Democrats late Monday threw their support en masse behind opening a formal impeachment inquiry, as The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal reported in the evening that President Trump personally ordered acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine just days before he pressed the new Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The rapid-fire declarations by the influential Democrats, after seemingly months of teetering on the brink, came just a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi strongly suggested she was now warming to the idea of impeaching the president. Speaking to Fox News, a House Democratic leadership aide confirmed that the Democratic caucus will meet Tuesday afternoon to discuss the Ukraine matter and how to proceed.”



Trump’s attacks on Biden worry Dems of 2016 repeat - WaPo: “But in a worrisome sign for Democrats anxious about reliving the party’s woes in 2016, [the Biden] campaign’s counterattack is being drowned out by a pro-Trump network on social media and cable news that kicked into gear over the weekend, leveling accusations against Biden that have scant factual basis. … The flurry of online attacks against Biden carries echoes of conspiracy theories spread by Trump and his allies about Hillary Clinton’s health and claims about her foreign entanglements that helped turn voters against her. The onslaught comes at a crucial moment in the Democratic primary contest, as the former vice president attempts to showcase his ability to go toe-to-toe with Trump. But with the Democratic National Committee attempting to be a more neutral arbiter than it was in 2016, when it was accused of aiding Clinton, the party helped monitor viral attacks but publicly remained silent.”



THE RULEBOOK: PROVE YOURSELF

“To reverse and undo what has been done by a predecessor, is very often considered by a successor as the best proof he can give of his own capacity and desert… and that the less he resembles him, the more he will recommend himself to the favor of his constituents.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 72



TIME OUT: ONE OF A KIND

Smithsonian: “The guitar Prince plays in [the Purple Rain video] was custom-made for him by a luthier at a Minneapolis music shop called Knut-Koupee Enterprises. … It made sense, even then, that Prince would require an instrument that didn’t resemble anything anyone else was playing. Knut-Koupee made three so-called ‘cloud’ guitars for Prince in the early 1980s. … In 1993, Prince gave a cloud guitar to the Smithsonian Institution, but he didn’t include any information about the instrument’s origins. But earlier this year, John Woodland, the conservator for Prince’s guitar collection … reached out to the Smithsonian with a sneaking suspicion. After the guitar underwent a CT scan and extensive paint analysis, what they found was a shocker… This wasn’t just a cloud guitar, in other words, it was the cloud guitar—the instrument responsible for some of the most iconic sounds and images in American popular music.”

WARREN CLOSING IN ON BIDEN IN NEVADA

USA Today: “Elizabeth Warren has pulled within striking distance of Joe Biden for the lead in Nevada's influential presidential caucuses. A new Suffolk University/USA TODAY Network Poll, taken after this month's Democratic debate, shows Biden at 23% and Warren at 19% in Nevada, the state that follows Iowa and New Hampshire in the opening presidential contests next year. Bernie Sanders is at 14%. While Warren trailed Biden, the Massachusetts senator was within the margin of error of the former vice president for the first time in a public poll in the Silver State. … Among the second tier of candidates in Nevada, California Sen. Kamala Harris was at 4% and South Bend (Ind.) Mayor Pete Buttigieg, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and activist Tom Steyer at 3%. … The survey showed Warren positioned to increase her support as the Democratic field narrows. She was the ‘second choice’ of 19%, compared to 16% for Biden, 12% for Sanders and 10% for California Sen. Kamala Harris.”



She also joins him upfront in New Hampshire - Monmouth University: “Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has joined former Vice President Joe Biden at the front of the pack in New Hampshire, according to the latest Monmouth University Poll. … Among registered New Hampshire Democrats and unaffiliated voters who are likely to participate in the February 2020 Democratic primary, 27% currently support Warren and 25% support Biden. The only other candidates in double digits are Sanders at 12% and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 10%. Others with measurable support are California Sen. Kamala Harris (3%), New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (2%), Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (2%), Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar (2%), former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer (2%), and entrepreneur Andrew Yang (2%).”



Gabbard is the 12th Dem to qualify for October debate - Politico: “Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has qualified for the October Democratic presidential primary debate, making her the twelfth candidate to hit the Democratic National Committee's thresholds. Gabbard got 2 percent support in a New Hampshire poll conducted by Monmouth University and released on Tuesday. The Hawaii congresswoman had previously gotten 2 percent in three other DNC-approved polls, and her campaign said she already racked up more than the 130,000 donors she needed to make the debate stage.

DNC raises qualifying thresholds for November debate - Fox News: “The DNC announced on Monday that to qualify for the November showdown, candidates must reach at least 3 percent in four approved national or early-voting-state polls. That’s up from the 2 percent needed to reach the stage at the September and October debates and up from the 1 percent needed in three approved surveys for the June and July debates. But, to tamper down any criticism from the early voting states, the DNC added another way to satisfy the polling criteria – reaching 5 percent in two qualifying surveys in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina – the first four states to vote in the nominating calendar. The window for the polling is from Sept. 13 to seven days before the still-unannounced November debate. In previous debates, candidates had until two weeks before the showdown to reach the polling criteria.”

Fox News: “A Russian navy boat embarking on a research expedition in the Arctic Sea sunk after being attacked by a female walrus that was defending her young, according to reports Monday. The Altai, a tugboat operated by the Russian navy’s Northern Fleet, carried researchers from the Russian Geographical Society and other expedition participants into waters near a remote island chain called Franz Josef Land in the Arctic Sea, Ars Technica reported. The boat dispatched a smaller inflatable landing craft in shallow waters off Wilczek Island to bring researchers ashore near Cape Heller. Before the boat could reach the beach, it was attacked by a female walrus who was probably ‘fearing for her cubs,’ according to a press release from the Russian Geographical Society. ‘The boat sank, but a tragedy was avoided thanks to the prompt action by the squad leader. All landing participants safely reached the shore,’ the press release said.”

I thought that would be the worst, that would be the greatest defeat in my life -- if I allowed that. I decided if I could make people judge me by the old standard, that would be a triumph and that's what I try to do. It seemed to me the only way to live.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) speaking with the Washington Post on Aug. 17, 1984.

WARREN EDGES BIDEN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE POLL, GAINS GROUND IN NEVADA

Warren – the populist senator who’s pushed out one progressive policy proposal after another – stands at 27 percent among Democratic voters and independents who lean Democratic in a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday morning, with the former vice president commanding 25 percent. Warren’s two-point edge is well within the survey’s margin of error.

Warren has surged 8 percentage points since Quinnipiac’s previous national poll, which was conducted late last month, with Biden -- long considered the frontrunner in the race -- dropping seven points.

Sanders, the independent populist longtime lawmaker who’s making his second straight White House bid, stands at 16 percent in the new survey, basically unchanged from last month.

""After trailing Biden by double digits since March in the race for the Democratic nomination, Warren catches Biden,"" Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said. ""We now have a race with two candidates at the top of the field, and they’re leaving the rest of the pack behind.""

Going beyond the poll’s topline numbers, Malloy noted that if you “dig a little deeper…the reasons behind Warren's rise become more clear. She generates a lot of excitement as a potential nominee. On top of that, half of Democrats want a presidential candidate that supports big changes - even if it means things are harder along the way.""

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg stands at 7 percent in the new Quinnipiac poll, with Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 3 percent. Everyone else in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential contenders registered at 2 percent or less.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Many political analysts downplay the results of national polls, pointing to the fact the race for the presidential nomination is a battle for the states and their delegates to the parties' nominating conventions. But the Quinnipiac results follow similar findings in polls released the past couple of days in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, the first three states to vote in the presidential primary and caucus nominating calendar.

Warren stands at 27 percent among likely Democratic presidential primary voters in New Hampshire in a Monmouth University survey released Tuesday, with Biden at 25 percent. Warren’s 2-point edge is well within that survey’s sampling error. Sanders is in third in the poll, at 12 percent.

A couple of hours after the release of the Monmouth poll in New Hampshire, a new survey in Nevada, which holds its caucus following the New Hampshire primary, also indicates a close contest between Biden and Warren.

A USA Today/Suffolk University survey put Biden at 23 percent, Warren at 19 percent and Sanders at 14 percent.

And in Iowa, a Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll released this past weekend indicated Warren at 22 percent, Biden at 20 percent and Sanders a distant third at 11 percent. The Des Moines Register surveys have long been considered the gold standard in Iowa polling.

The release of the surveys come as Warren’s campaign on Tuesday announced they’re spending a whopping $10-million to run digital and TV ads over the next few months in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, which votes fourth in the nominating calendar and holds the first southern primary.

WARREN DISHING OUT $10 MILLION TO RUN DIGITAL AND TV ADS IN ALL FOUR EARLY VOTING STATES

The release of these new live telephone operator polls comes with just over four months to go until the first votes in Iowa. But that can be an eternity in campaign politics.

Warren continues to downplay her surge in the surveys, telling reporters a few days ago that, “I don’t do polls. We are still months away from the Iowa caucuses and the first primary elections.”

The pollsters agree. Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray noted that “it is important to keep in mind that the race is still very much in flux.”

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted September 19-23, with 1,337 registered voters nationwide – including 561 self-described Democratic voters independents who lean towards the Democrats – questioned by telephone. The sampling error for the survey Democratic nomination questions is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points."

Dianna Muller, who served in the Tulsa Police Department for 22 years and is the founder of gun advocacy group The DC Project, was among the witnesses at the House Judiciary Committee hearing. The session on an otherwise contentious issue flew largely under the radar amid the Trump-Ukraine controversy and Democrats' impeachment push. But reflecting the gun control divide in the country -- amid a spate of deadly mass shootings that prompted renewed calls for strict laws -- Muller said that such a ban would force lawful gun owners to either give up their arms or become criminals.

KAMALA HARRIS SAYS SHE SUPPORTS A MANDATORY BUYBACK ON 'ASSAULT WEAPONS'

""Please don't legislate the 150 million people just like me into being criminals. It has happened. You've already done it,"" Muller said, referring to the Trump administration's ban on bump stocks, the devices that use a semi-automatic weapon's recoil to make it rapidly fire like an automatic. ""I was a bump stock owner, and I had to make a decision: do I become a felon, or do I comply?""

Should the government pass an assault-weapons ban, Muller declared, ""I will not comply.""

Muller and others at the hearing focused on the practicality of a ban, pointing out what they claimed were mainly ""cosmetic"" differences between weapons such as the AR-15 and standard semi-automatic hunting rifles. This issue was also raised by Heritage Foundation senior legal policy analyst Amy Swearer when Rep.Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., went down the line of witnesses asking if they believed hunting rifles should be banned if they are semi-automatic.

Swearer said no, stating that there was no difference in the mechanics or function of an ""assault weapon"" or a semi-automatic hunting rifle. Dayton, Ohio Mayor Nan Whaley, who recalled the recent mass shooting in her city, did not give a definitive answer to Sensenbrenner's question, nor did Dr. Alejandro Rios Tovar, a trauma surgeon who treated victims of the attack in El Paso, Texas. Charlottesville, Va., Chief of Police RaShall Brackney indicated she was in favor of a ban on ""any weapon that could be used to hunt individuals.""

Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., countered the idea of a hunting rifle ban by referring to his assault-weapon ban bill. Cicilline said that more than 200 weapons are exempt from the bill, so there is really no issue of eliminating hunting rifles.

Swearer also testified against the idea that law-abiding citizens have no need for weapons like AR-15s, recalling how her mother, a gun novice, had difficulty accurately firing a handgun at a shooting range, but was much more effective when she used an AR-15.

""As I read the Second Amendment, it doesn't say the right to bear arms shall not be infringed unless the gun has scary features,"" Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said.

2020 DEMS EMBRACE FEDERAL GUN BUYBACK PROGRAM IN WAKE OF MASS SHOOTINGS

Swearer also noted that some features like barrel shrouds enhance the safety of a weapon for its user. But David Chipman, senior policy adviser at the Giffords Law Center, raised a counterpoint noting that a barrel shroud could allow a shooter to get a better grip on a weapon ""in a way that would increase your ability to spray fire and kill more people"" without burning their hand.

One feature that was a concern for House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., is the ability for some weapons to be used with high-capacity magazines that allow users to fire dozens of rounds without reloading.

Kristen Rand, legislative director of the Violence Policy Center, testified in agreement with Nadler that a ban on such magazines, along with a clear definition of ""assault weapon"" that would eliminate loopholes under the 1994 crime law, would be effective.

Congress and the Trump administration have been in talks for weeks regarding possible gun legislation, but discussion of taking away guns that are currently legal has led to criticism from both parties. After 2020 Democratic hopeful Beto O'Rourke declared during a debate, ""Hell yes, we are going to take your AR-15, AK-47,"" Cicilline said, ""That message doesn't help."" President Trump said that O'Rourke was making it ""much harder"" to reach a deal on gun legislation with that sort of rhetoric.

Trump's focus when it comes to gun control has mainly been on background checks. The White House was also circulating a one-page document on Capitol Hill detailing a possible gun background-check proposal that would require private sellers – not just licensed vendors – to conduct background checks for all advertised sales, though Attorney General Bill Barr said Trump has not yet made a “firm decision” on what he ultimately will support.

An August USA Today poll showed that most American voters support increased background checks, with 85 percent of Republican voters supporting background checks for all gun sales. Presently, only federally licensed vendors are required to conduct background checks, allowing private individuals to sell without them under what has been referred to as the ""gun show loophole.""

White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News last week that he expected an announcement on new gun legislation “very soon.” Gidley said Trump wanted to make sure that any new laws would address actual problems and not just be “feel-good legislation.”

But the Democrats' impeachment push could complicate matters. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who had resisted impeachment, announced Tuesday that an impeachment inquiry would be launched. Reflecting how policy debates could take a back seat, Pelosi said in private meetings with lawmakers that Trump called her to discuss gun legislation, but she soon changed the subject to his phone call with the Ukrainian president in which they discussed investigating Joe Biden, which stoked the latest calls for impeachment."

But, the upping of polling and donor thresholds – more modest than the doubling of the criteria from July’s second round to this month’s third round – may not significantly winnow the field of White House contenders still standing after October’s debate.

The DNC announced on Monday that to qualify for the November showdown, candidates must reach at least 3 percent in four approved national or early-voting-state polls. That’s up from the 2 percent needed to reach the stage at the September and October debates and up from the 1 percent needed in three approved surveys for the June and July debates.

OCTOBER DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY DEBATE TO BE HELD IN OHIO

But, to tamper down any criticism from the early voting states, the DNC added another way to satisfy the polling criteria – reaching 5 percent in two qualifying surveys in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina – the first four states to vote in the nominating calendar.

The window for the polling is from Sept. 13 to seven days before the still-unannounced November debate. In previous debates, candidates had until two weeks before the showdown to reach the polling criteria.

""Qualification period ends 1 week (not 2 weeks) before the debate, giving candidates more time to qualify,"" DNC communications director Xochitl Hinojosa tweeted.

The other threshold – fundraising – also saw a slight raising of the bar. To make the cut, candidates will have to receive campaign contributions from 165,000 individual donors. That’s up from 130,000 for the September and October debates and from 65,000 for the first two rounds of showdowns. Candidates also will have to receive 600 unique contributions from each of 20 states, the District of Columbia or U.S. territories.

The DNC’s faced criticism over its thresholds for months from many of the lower and middle-tier candidates, who argued that the criteria forced them to concentrate on boosting donor contributions at the expense of retail politicking in the early voting states. And, some activists and party leaders in the early voting states have also criticized the DNC for winnowing the record field of candidates – which topped off at roughly two-dozen contenders this summer – before voters actually got to vote in the primaries and caucuses starting this coming February.

""The DNC is using polling to winnow the field even further, when it's voters and caucus-goers who should be determining our nominee,"" said Shannon Beckham, a spokeswoman for Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet's presidential campaign.

And, Galia Slayen, a spokeswoman for Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, told Fox News that ""as the DNC continues to make the rules up as they go along, Governor Bullock will remain focused on bringing his message of a fair shot for every American directly to voters on the ground.""

Both Bennet and Bullock were on the debate stage in July for the third round but failed to qualify for this month's showdown and it appears unlikely either will make the cut for October's debate.

The new thresholds shouldn’t be much of a problem for many of the leading contenders – such as former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Kamala Harris of California, as well as South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

2020 DEMOCRATS FUME AT DNC OVER DEBATE THRESHOLDS

Some of the other six candidates likely to make the October debate are not sure bets to qualify for November’s showdown. That group consists of Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

As he has in the past, Yang praised the DNC, tweeting, ""Kudos to the DNC for raising the thresholds in a fair and transparent manner as well.""

Some of the candidates, including Booker and Buttigieg, quickly used news of the new thresholds to reach out to supporters with fundraising emails.

Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro and billionaire philanthropist and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer – who've also made the cut for October’s showdown – have yet to hit 3 percent in any polls since the November qualifying period kicked off earlier this month. And, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who's just one poll away from making the October debate, also has yet to reach 3 percent in any approved surveys.

The Monmouth University survey, released Tuesday, also shows Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont fading to a distant third.

WARREN EDGES OUT BIDEN IN NEW IOWA POLL, SANDERS DISTANT THIRD

Warren stands at 27 percent among likely Democratic presidential primary voters in the state, with Biden at 25 percent. Warren’s 2-point edge is well within the survey’s sampling error.

Warren’s support has soared by 19 points from the previous Monmouth poll in the Granite State, which was conducted in May. Biden’s dropped 11 points from that survey.

Sanders, meanwhile, is in third in the new poll, at 12 percent, dropping 6 points from Monmouth’s May survey.

New Hampshire, which votes second in the presidential nominating calendar following the Iowa caucuses, is considered by many political analysts and pundits as a must-win for both Sanders and Warren.

The independent senator from Vermont crushed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire, launching the one-time longshot for the nomination into a marathon battle against the eventual nominee. He’s retained a strong organization and devoted supporters in the state as he bids a second time for the White House.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

But Warren, who like Sanders hails from a neighboring state to New Hampshire, has also built up a powerful campaign organization in the Granite State, and has made numerous visits. Warren will return to the state to hold town halls on Wednesday and Friday.

“Warren continues to look stronger with every new poll. She seems to be picking up support across the spectrum with gains coming at the expense of both Biden and Sanders,” said Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray.

The surge from Warren is coming from self-described liberals, among whom she’s up 28 points since the May poll to stand at 39 percent, with Sanders dropping 13 points down to 16 percent. Warren’s also risen 11 points among self-described moderate and conservative voters to stand at 18 percent, with Biden dropping 15 points to stand at 30 percent.

According to the poll, the only other candidate to register in double digits is South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who’s at 10 percent, slightly behind Sanders.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California stands at 3 percent in the survey, with Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, billionaire philanthropist and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii each at 2 percent. The remaining 10 candidates tested in the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls earned 1 percent or less in the poll.

The Monmouth poll in New Hampshire is one of the qualifying surveys the Democratic National Committee uses for their polling thresholds for candidates to make the cut for the primary debates. Gabbard’s 2 percent showing in the new poll means she’s reached 2 percent in four qualifying polls, allowing her to make the stage at next month’s fourth round of nomination debates.

The poll’s findings are similar to those of the latest poll in Iowa this past weekend. A Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom survey indicated Warren at 22 percent, Biden at 20 percent and Sanders a distant third at 11 percent. The Des Moines Register surveys have long been considered the gold standard in Iowa polling.

A new poll released Tuesday in Nevada, which holds it's caucus following the New Hampshire primary, also indicates a close contest between Biden and Warren.

A USA Today/Suffolk University survey puts Biden at 23 percent, Warren at 19 percent and Sanders at 14 percent.

The most recent polls in New Hampshire have been all over the board, with one suggesting Sanders holding a lead; another indicating a three-way tie among Biden, Warren and Sanders; and a third pointing to Sanders trailing Biden and Warren.

The Monmouth University poll was conducted from Sept. 17-21, among 401 New Hampshire voters likely to vote in next February’s Democratic presidential primary questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s sampling error is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.

The poll’s release comes with four-and-a-half months to go until the New Hampshire primary.

Rove, a former aide to ex-President George W. Bush, said the issue should not be a partisan one.

He said he believed that Trump would not want a private conversation with a foreign leader being publicized as much as Presidents Clinton, Bush or Obama would have.

""None of them would,"" he said.

Earlier Monday, Trump tore into the press for their coverage of reports he pressured Ukraine's leader to help investigate political rival Joe Biden.

Calling the White House press corps “crooked as hell,” a riled up Trump slammed the media for “double standards” over what he claimed was the failure of the press to report on allegations of unsubstantiated wrongdoing by Biden and his son, Hunter, related to dealings with Kyiv.

“Joe Biden and his son are corrupt, but the fake news doesn’t want to report because they’re Democrats,” Trump said in New York during United Nations meetings. “If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair.”

Pelosi made the announcement following a meeting of the House Democratic Caucus at the Capitol, saying that ""the president must be held accountable"" for what she called the ""betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections.""

The only Democratic hopeful to explicitly come out against impeachment was Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii. Speaking on Fox Business' “Kennedy” on Tuesday night Gabbard said she thinks impeachment would be very ""divisive"" for a country that is already divided.

PELOSI ANNOUNCES FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP

“Donald Trump has abused his power, obstructed justice, and violated his oath of office. He puts his political interests over our national interest,” tweeted Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. “I agree with @SpeakerPelosi— no one is above the law. He must be impeached.”

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who first called for impeachment proceedings to begin in May after Special Counsel Robert Mueller spoke publicly about the findings of his Russia investigation, tweeted on Tuesday evening, “In 2016, Trump welcomed foreign adversaries to meddle in our democracy for his own gain. Now he appears to be using the same playbook to remain in power.""

Mueller’s probe was intended to examine Russian election interference and whether President Trump's campaign colluded with Russian officials during the 2016 election. In the report, Mueller said he could not exonerate the president on obstruction of justice but that investigators did not find sufficient evidence to establish charges of criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign.

Booker added, ""I applaud Speaker Pelosi's announcement of an impeachment inquiry—it’s our one remaining path to ensuring justice is served.”

Pelosi specifically charged that the Trump administration had violated the law by not turning over an intelligence community whistleblower's complaint concerning a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Citing testimony that the director of national intelligence is blocking the release of that complaint, she said: ""This is a violation of law. The law is unequivocal.""

GIULIANI ACCUSES UKRAINE OF LAUNDERING $3M TO HUNTER BIDEN, ASKS HOW OBAMA COULD LET THAT HAPPEN

Trump allegedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The president vowed earlier Tuesday to release a ""complete"" transcript of his call with Zelensky on Wednesday, though it's unlikely to settle the issue in Congress.

Joe Biden has acknowledged that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board.

""This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,"" Pelosi said Tuesday. ""Therefore, today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella.”

Following Pelosi’s announcement, Biden tweeted, “Pressuring the leader of another nation to investigate a political opponent — to help win an election — is not the conduct of an American President.”

Earlier Tuesday, Biden called Trump’s alleged actions “an abuse of power.”

“They undermine our national security,” Biden tweeted. “They violate the oath of office. If we allow a President to get away with shredding the United States Constitution — that will last forever.”

In remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Monday, Trump denied linking the Ukraine aid money to an investigation of the Bidens.

“No, I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said. But, he also repeatedly called the Bidens' actions in Ukraine a “disgrace,” acknowledged that Biden had come up during the call and added: ""It's very important to talk about corruption. ... Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?""

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., did not immediately release a statement, but sent out a somewhat-cryptic tweet Tuesday night, writing only: ""Billionaires should not be able to control our political system.""

During a press conference earlier on Tuesday Sanders said, “If you're going to go forward with impeachment. You're going to have grounds to do it. I happen to believe they're authorized to do it, but you got to lay it out.”

In a statement, former Texas rep. Beto O’Rourke said he is “grateful to Speaker Pelosi for opening an impeachment inquiry into President Trump” and called her announcement “a defining moment for our country.”

“For more than two years, even as I was running for Senate in Texas, I have been clear that I support impeachment,” O’Rourke said. “We all must come to terms with what we face: a lawless president who has obstructed justice and undermined our democracy by inviting a foreign power to intervene in 2016, and who is doing it again in 2020.”

Entrepreneur Andrew Yang tweeted on Tuesday, “Given the President’s latest actions I think impeachment is the right path forward.”

Yang added: “Asking foreign leaders for political help in return for aid and then suppressing your own agency’s inquiry is egregious. There have to be limits and Congress is right to act.”

In a follow-up tweet, Yang wrote, “A reminder that successful impeachment requires a majority vote in the House and then two-thirds in the Senate. Given that there are 53 Republican Senators one would need 20 of them to support impeachment to be successful. That is highly unlikely unless there is some huge shift.”

He added that he still agrees that moving forward “is for the best,” saying it will allow for a more thorough investigation “that may unearth new details.”

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., tweeted simply, “The House did the right thing.”

Former Maryland Congressman John Delaney released a statement following the announcement saying he agreed with Pelosi’s decision to move forward with an official impeachment inquiry, adding that “she deserves our support.”

""The President’s behavior, combined with the administration’s refusal to cooperate, leaves her no other choice,"" Delaney added. ""Our nation can only be as strong as the rules that govern it.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called Pelosi's announcement ""an overdue but important step.”

""Now the impeachment inquiry must move forward with the efficiency and seriousness this crisis demands,"" she said. ""The House needs to vote on articles of impeachment—and when it comes to the Senate, I will do what the Constitution requires.”

Billionaire hedge fund manager Tom Steyer said he applauded Pelosi and Democrats in Congress who are calling for an investigation into Trump’s alleged criminal behavior.

“Removing Trump from office has always been about doing what’s right, not what’s politically convenient,” Steyer said. “We built a nationwide movement to impeach a lawless president and defend our democracy. This is just the beginning.”

Earlier this month, Steyer told Fox News' Bret Baier during an interview on “Special Report” that he thinks President Trump is “the most corrupt president in American history” and that he has “more than met the criteria for impeachment.”

Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., did not react on social media, but in an interview on CNN on Tuesday night said the announcement is “a moment of truth for the country,” adding that “sooner or later it had to come.”

He went on to say that the announcement is also “a moment of truth for the Republican Party.""

A total of 172 House Democrats have now signaled support for an impeachment inquiry. A simple majority of House members present and voting would be required to impeach the president. A highly unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-controlled Senate would be needed to convict and remove Trump from office.

Vice President Mike Pence would then take office in that scenario and become the 46th President of the United States.

Reacting on ""Outnumbered Overtime"" to the release of the transcript of the call, which is based on ""notes and recollections"" of those who heard the conversation, Swalwell, D-Calif., said it was ""unacceptable"" for Trump to mention former Vice President Joe Biden's name even one time in the conversation.

""He has no business involving himself in a criminal case against his rival. We just don't do that in America. It's so gross to read that transcript. When I read that, one of my first thoughts was 'geez, what the hell does the Putin transcripts read like?' ... We know what he thinks of Putin, what has he given away to the Russians?"" he asked.

When pressed by anchor Harris Faulkner on the allegations surrounding Biden and his son's business dealings in Ukraine, Swalwell said there is ""no evidence"" of impropriety.

HOUSE DEMOCRAT WHO ENDORSED BIDEN SAYS IT'S TIME FOR HIM TO 'CLEAR UP' QUESTIONS ON SON'S UKRAINE DEALINGS

""If you want to show me evidence, I'm open-minded,"" said the former presidential candidate.

Swalwell, who was vocal in recent years alleging Trump's campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election, said if Trump asked Ukraine for help with his presidential campaign, he could have potentially owed them a favor in return.

""It's so corrupt,"" he said.

The White House on Wednesday released a transcript of Trump’s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky showing he sought a review of Biden family dealings in the country — but the document does not show Trump explicitly leveraging military aid as part of a quid pro quo, as Democrats have suggested in pressing forward with impeachment.

The document, declassified by Trump a day earlier, indicates that the call – which Trump made from the White House residence -- took place July 25 from 9:03 a.m. to 9:33 a.m. A notation on the memo says it does not represent a ""verbatim transcript"" but is based on ""notes and recollections"" of those listening and memorializing the call. It is still presented in transcript form.

The memo begins with the president congratulating Zelensky on his election victory, before Trump eventually broaches the subject of Biden and his son Hunter.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,” Trump said in the phone call.

“Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”

BIDEN HITS THE SKIDS IN NEW Q POLL

Politico: “A new national survey shows Elizabeth Warren now sitting atop the 2020 Democratic field… Twenty-seven percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents polled by Quinnipiac University said they favor Warren, according to a poll released Wednesday morning. Twenty-five percent said they prefer former Vice President Joe Biden. Although Warren’s edge falls within the survey’s margin of error, Biden’s formidable lead over the rest of the field has crumbled since the last Quinnipiac national poll in August, which showed him with 32 percent support and Warren with 19 percent support. The latest survey reinforces other public polling showing Warren and Biden separating from their fellow contenders in the Democratic presidential race. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders ranked third in Tuesday’s poll, achieving 16 percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., with 7 percent, and California Sen. Kamala Harris at 3 percent.”



Trump attacks raise doubts about Biden for Dem voters - NYT: “In public, for the last five days, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his campaign have been on a ferocious offensive, ripping into President Trump for allegedly abusing his powers in asking Ukraine’s leader to help hurt Mr. Biden politically, and castigating the news media for questioning his son Hunter Biden’s financial dealings there. … In private, though, this has been an enraging and uncertain time for the Biden campaign, and for Mr. Biden himself… He and his advisers have long feared that Hunter Biden would become a target for political opponent…And as Mr. Trump’s onslaught has pushed the House of Representatives to start an impeachment inquiry, Mr. Biden now faces a crucial political test where his standing may hinge on how he handles a wildly unpredictable confrontation with Mr. Trump.”



Warren ready for air war with $10 million buy - Politico: “Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign on Tuesday announced an early-state ad campaign of at least $10 million, suggesting that the Massachusetts senator is continuing to raise big money from grass-roots donors after an anemic start. The campaign told POLITICO that a digital ad campaign would begin immediately and that they are currently reserving television time, with the entire buy ramping up over the next few months. The campaign declined to say when its spending on digital and TV ads would reach eight figures. ‘Right now, our biggest expense as a campaign is our staff, but as the campaign heats up, it will be on media to reach potential voters,’ campaign manager Roger Lau wrote in a memo emailed to supporters Tuesday morning. The campaign ‘will be more digital than old-school broadcast television.’ The campaign also released three ads Tuesday — 15-second, 30-second, and 1-minute spots — which highlight Warren’s policy plans and her intention to crack down on corruption in government.”



Buttigieg hitches a ride on McCain’s media strategy - CBS News: “The South Bend, Indiana mayor rolled across Iowa on a four-day bus tour and allowed everything uttered on the bus to be on the record, drawing ready comparisons to the late Senator John McCain's ‘Straight Talk Express,’ the bus he toured the country in when he ran for president in 2000. The coach, which has also been around the country in the service of former President Barack Obama, Justin Timberlake and Tom Hanks, is now styled with Buttigieg signs, marble floors and plays news channels or football in the background. … He and his campaign have ramped up spending in Iowa in the past month, releasing a new TV ad on Monday, hiring more staff on the ground and opening offices. He added that the strategy is not to ‘go around Iowa.’”



Sanders touts dozen of union member endorsements - The Hill: “White House hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) unveiled the endorsements of 85 union members in Iowa as he works to shore up support for his progressive bona fides against a surging Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). The endorsements were announced on the ‘Bernie beats Trump’ tour in Iowa during which Sanders is visiting counties that voted for former President Obama in 2008 and 2012 and for President Trump in 2016 to help ensure skeptical voters that he can beat Trump in a general election. … The endorsements come from members of several unions, including the autoworkers of America and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.”

TIME OUT: WELL PACKAGED PEANUTS

New Yorker: “Timing is the life force of comics. Without a sensitivity to the rhythms and the music—a.k.a. the reality—of life, a comic strip will arrive D.O.A., nothing more than a bunch of dumb pictures. … The reader doesn’t just look at Charlie Brown, Linus, Lucy, and Snoopy but reads them as musical notes in a silently heard composition of hilarity, cruelty, and occasional melancholy. In 1950, the comics page was a more or less settled territory into which very few new features could be shoehorned, and, from the get-go, ‘Peanuts’ was marketed as a space-saver. The strip was created out of four equally sized panels, which allowed it to run horizontally, vertically, or stacked two by two. … Who would’ve thought that such a hard-nosed commercial decision would catalyze one of the greatest works of popular art of the twentieth century?”

TRUMP LEANED ON UKRAINIAN LEADER FOR BIDEN DIRT

WSJ: “President Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, to ‘look into’ former Vice President Joe Biden’s son and said he would direct his personal lawyer and attorney general to reach out to Mr. Zelensky to ‘get to the bottom of it,’ according to a document released by the White House designed to memorialize a July phone call between the leaders. The document also revealed that Mr. Trump, before asking Ukraine to examine actions by Mr. Biden’s son, reminded Mr. Zelensky that the U.S. sends security aid to Ukraine. ‘I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine,’ he said. ‘We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time.’ He contrasted the U.S. aid with what European countries do to help Ukraine. According to the document released by the White House on Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump didn’t make an explicit link on the call between the U.S. aid—which he had ordered a hold on a week earlier—and an investigation into Mr. Biden’s son.”



Trump lawyer: State Department directed involvement - WashEx: “President Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani said he began dealing with Ukrainian officials at the behest of the State Department. During an interview Tuesday evening on Fox News, Giuliani was prompted to respond to a Washington Post report in which White House insiders complained about how he was improperly ‘injecting himself’ into U.S.-Ukraine relations. ‘Man, I really did,’ Giuliani said sarcastically. ‘And you know who I did at the request of? The State Department. I never talked to a Ukrainian official until the State Department called me and asked me to do it.’ Holding up his mobile phone, Giuliani said he reported every conversation he had to the Trump administration and that evidence of this communications with the State Department were all on the device.”



Pelosi heats up impeachment rhetoric, but not her go-slow approach - Roll Call: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s announcement Tuesday that the House is in an ‘official impeachment inquiry’ gave no hints of how or whether it would accelerate any Democratic effort to remove President Donald Trump from office. Pelosi said she directed the six House committees conducting oversight of the Trump administration to move forward ‘under that umbrella’ of an impeachment inquiry — but gave no details about how the day-to-day approach would differ. In that way, Pelosi appeared to stay on a measured Democratic approach that for months has fallen short of raising public support for impeachment — particularly with the Trump administration’s unyielding rejection of congressional subpoena power — and put off potentially stronger moves toward impeachment.”



Poll shows reason for her caution - WaPo: “Amid a groundswell of support for impeachment proceedings among House Democrats, a new poll finds a majority of Americans do not favor ousting President Trump from office. Thirty-seven percent of voters say that Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 57 percent say he should not be impeached, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday morning. … The poll shows a stark partisan divide on the question of impeachment. Among Democrats, 73 percent support impeachment, while 21 percent are opposed. Among Republicans, only 4 percent support impeachment, while 95 percent are opposed. Trump’s overall job approval rating remains in the range it has for nearly his entire presidency, with 40 percent of voters approving of how he is handling his job, and 55 percent saying they disapprove.”



Silver: Will Dems learn lessons of Russia probe? - FiveThirtyEight: “Despite Trump being quite unpopular, and despite the public largely buying Democrats’ interpretation of the fact pattern on Russia — most polls find that a majority of the public thinks that Trump sought to obstruct the investigation into Russia, for instance — impeachment was a soundly unpopular proposition. … The politics of impeachment on Ukraine may be different than on Russia. But Democrats should take public opinion seriously. That doesn’t mean you always have to do the poll-driven thing. But don’t wish the numbers away because you don’t like them, or presume that they’ll change in your favor, or assume there won’t be consequences for taking an unpopular action. More specifically for Democrats, their failure to persuade the public that Russia warranted impeachment offers several potential lessons if they are to proceed on Ukraine.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I just have a political science question regarding the 2020 Senate race in Kansas. Kris Kobach lost the governor’s race in 2018 and is now running for the GOP nomination for Senate (yinz know this already). I was wondering do voters’ think differently when selecting a governor rather than a Senator? Kobach was too right-wing for the Topeka state House as an executive, but as a legislator in Washington? Does it make a difference that electing a Democratic Governor is vastly different than a Democratic Senator with vastly different consequences politically? Hopefully my question makes sense.” – James Belany, Pittsburgh



[Ed. note: The first thing to remember, Mr. Belany, is that there’s precious little science in politics. Like many of the humanities, political theory and the study of campaigns and elections, got squeezed into a faux “science” during the middle of the last century. To that I say: Phooey! The science at play in your question could be social psychology, though. Would the voters of Kansas feel differently about a radical senator than they would a radical governor? Maybe there’s something to that. But maybe there’s another discipline to consider: Mathematics. There were three candidates for governor in 2018, but maybe only two for Senate in 2020. Could Kobach slide by in a binary election especially when Republican voters are storming the polls in a presidential year? Maybe. But that doesn’t change the fact that the GOP would much rather not have to deal with Kobach. Not only does he increase the degree of difficulty in Kansas, but Democrats running in other states can use his comments and record against his fellow Republicans.]



“Just wanted you to know that I came down with a debilitating case of the bird flu this past weekend ... as the hated Cardinals swept my Cubbies at Wrigley Field, and ensured the Cardinals will be Central Division champions this year. The illness hasn't gotten better as Kris Bryant appears out for the season, and my Cubbies appear doomed to sit out the postseason. Chortle if you will at my Cubbies misfortune -- but just wait until next year!” – Stephen J. Tock, Dwight, Ill.



[Ed. note: I can’t go so far as to say that I felt “bad” for the Cubs, but I can say that I admire your determination, Mr. Tock. And we can all be proud to say that the National League Central continues to be the best, most competitive division in baseball. And with three games left against the Cards, I’m sure your squad will try hard to avenge the Wrigley sweep!]

HAPPY HUMP DAY

AP: “A veterinarian has prescribed antibiotics to a camel owned by a Louisiana truck stop petting zoo after a woman bit the 600-pound (272-kilogram) animal to free herself from under its weight. Iberville Parish Sheriff's Office documents obtained by The Advocate on Monday accuse Florida couple Gloria and Edmond Lancaster of throwing treats for their unleashed dog into Caspar the camel's enclosure at Tiger Truck Stop. The couple told deputies the camel attacked the dog, but the sheriff's office said the couple had provoked the animal before it sat on Gloria Lancaster. She'd crawled under barbed wire to retrieve her pet. Gloria Lancaster told officers she had to bite the camel to free herself. Truck stop manager Pamela Bossier said a veterinarian prescribed Caspar antibiotics as a precaution.”

Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, the two populist standard-bearers in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.

The National Union of Healthcare Workers – which backed the independent senator from Vermont in his 2016 Democratic presidential primary bid – announced on Thursday that they’ll provide resources and grassroots support to both Sanders and Warren.

SANDERS CAMPAIGN SWIPES AT WARREN, TESTING TRUCE BETWEEN THE PROGRESSIVE 2020 CHAMPIONS

The union explained that the gap between Warren and Sanders in a vote by union members was close enough that the union’s executive board decided on Wednesday to endorse both candidates.

“This is not your typical union endorsement. We didn’t tell our members how to vote, they told us,” union president Sal Rosselli said. “We trust our members and their judgments and the outcome of this vote reflects the collective will of members from San Diego to the Oregon border. Our members clearly like both Senators Warren and Sanders.”

“After reviewing the vote totals, our executive board felt that an endorsement of both candidates was most fair due to the closeness of the vote,” he explained.

Union members voted from Sunday through Wednesday, with members able to cast a ballot for up to three candidates. Warren received the most votes, appearing on 61 percent of ballots, with Sanders showing up on 50 percent of ballots.

Home-state Sen. Kamala Harris appeared on 34 percent of ballots. She was endorsed by the union in her races for California attorney general and her 2016 election to the U.S. Senate. Former Vice President Joe Biden was fourth in the voting, showing up on 32 percent of ballots.

WARREN SURGES TO TIE BIDEN IN LATEST POLLS, SANDERS SLIPS TO THIRD

The splitting of the endorsement comes as some in the Sanders campaign are starting to take aim at Warren. Both Sanders and Warren have – to date – refrained for criticizing each other.

But new national and early voting state polls released over the past week indicate Warren soaring into a tie with long-time front-runner Biden for the top spot in the 2020 Democratic battle, with Sanders dipping to third.

Earlier this month Warren landed the endorsement of the New York-based progressive group the Working Families Party, which backed Sanders four years ago in his first White House bid."

Amid a spate of deadly mass shootings that prompted renewed calls for strict laws on assault weapons, Muller said, such a ban would force lawful gun owners to either give up their arms or become criminals.

Muller said that there are many law enforcement officers who agree with her, and that opponents are using terms such as “weapons of war” to incite emotion.

“More people are killed with hammers and blunt objects than all rifles combined according to FBI statistics so it doesn’t make sense to me that this is going to solve the problem,” Muller said.

The gun control push from Democrats was evident at a recent presidential debate, where candidate Beto O'Rourke, a former congressman from Texas, generated a huge round of applause by vowing to use a mandatory gun buyback program to take assault weapons from Americans. Meantime, the White House has been in negotiations with lawmakers on measures like increased background checks.

Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News last week that he expected an announcement on new gun legislation “very soon.” Gidley said President Trump wanted to make sure that any new laws would address actual problems and not just be “feel-good legislation.”

WARREN EDGES BIDEN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE POLL, GAINS GROUND IN NEVADA

Warren – the populist senator who’s pushed out one progressive policy proposal after another – stands at 27 percent among Democratic voters and independents who lean Democratic in a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday morning, with the former vice president commanding 25 percent. Warren’s two-point edge is well within the survey’s margin of error.

Warren has surged 8 percentage points since Quinnipiac’s previous national poll, which was conducted late last month, with Biden -- long considered the frontrunner in the race -- dropping seven points.

Sanders, the independent populist longtime lawmaker who’s making his second straight White House bid, stands at 16 percent in the new survey, basically unchanged from last month.

""After trailing Biden by double digits since March in the race for the Democratic nomination, Warren catches Biden,"" Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said. ""We now have a race with two candidates at the top of the field, and they’re leaving the rest of the pack behind.""

Going beyond the poll’s topline numbers, Malloy noted that if you “dig a little deeper…the reasons behind Warren's rise become more clear. She generates a lot of excitement as a potential nominee. On top of that, half of Democrats want a presidential candidate that supports big changes - even if it means things are harder along the way.""

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg stands at 7 percent in the new Quinnipiac poll, with Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 3 percent. Everyone else in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential contenders registered at 2 percent or less.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Many political analysts downplay the results of national polls, pointing to the fact the race for the presidential nomination is a battle for the states and their delegates to the parties' nominating conventions. But the Quinnipiac results follow similar findings in polls released the past couple of days in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, the first three states to vote in the presidential primary and caucus nominating calendar.

Warren stands at 27 percent among likely Democratic presidential primary voters in New Hampshire in a Monmouth University survey released Tuesday, with Biden at 25 percent. Warren’s 2-point edge is well within that survey’s sampling error. Sanders is in third in the poll, at 12 percent.

A couple of hours after the release of the Monmouth poll in New Hampshire, a new survey in Nevada, which holds its caucus following the New Hampshire primary, also indicates a close contest between Biden and Warren.

A USA Today/Suffolk University survey put Biden at 23 percent, Warren at 19 percent and Sanders at 14 percent.

And in Iowa, a Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll released this past weekend indicated Warren at 22 percent, Biden at 20 percent and Sanders a distant third at 11 percent. The Des Moines Register surveys have long been considered the gold standard in Iowa polling.

The release of the surveys come as Warren’s campaign on Tuesday announced they’re spending a whopping $10-million to run digital and TV ads over the next few months in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, which votes fourth in the nominating calendar and holds the first southern primary.

WARREN DISHING OUT $10 MILLION TO RUN DIGITAL AND TV ADS IN ALL FOUR EARLY VOTING STATES

The release of these new live telephone operator polls comes with just over four months to go until the first votes in Iowa. But that can be an eternity in campaign politics.

Warren continues to downplay her surge in the surveys, telling reporters a few days ago that, “I don’t do polls. We are still months away from the Iowa caucuses and the first primary elections.”

The pollsters agree. Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray noted that “it is important to keep in mind that the race is still very much in flux.”

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted September 19-23, with 1,337 registered voters nationwide – including 561 self-described Democratic voters independents who lean towards the Democrats – questioned by telephone. The sampling error for the survey Democratic nomination questions is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points."

Dianna Muller, who served in the Tulsa Police Department for 22 years and is the founder of gun advocacy group The DC Project, was among the witnesses at the House Judiciary Committee hearing. The session on an otherwise contentious issue flew largely under the radar amid the Trump-Ukraine controversy and Democrats' impeachment push. But reflecting the gun control divide in the country -- amid a spate of deadly mass shootings that prompted renewed calls for strict laws -- Muller said that such a ban would force lawful gun owners to either give up their arms or become criminals.

KAMALA HARRIS SAYS SHE SUPPORTS A MANDATORY BUYBACK ON 'ASSAULT WEAPONS'

""Please don't legislate the 150 million people just like me into being criminals. It has happened. You've already done it,"" Muller said, referring to the Trump administration's ban on bump stocks, the devices that use a semi-automatic weapon's recoil to make it rapidly fire like an automatic. ""I was a bump stock owner, and I had to make a decision: do I become a felon, or do I comply?""

Should the government pass an assault-weapons ban, Muller declared, ""I will not comply.""

Muller and others at the hearing focused on the practicality of a ban, pointing out what they claimed were mainly ""cosmetic"" differences between weapons such as the AR-15 and standard semi-automatic hunting rifles. This issue was also raised by Heritage Foundation senior legal policy analyst Amy Swearer when Rep.Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., went down the line of witnesses asking if they believed hunting rifles should be banned if they are semi-automatic.

Swearer said no, stating that there was no difference in the mechanics or function of an ""assault weapon"" or a semi-automatic hunting rifle. Dayton, Ohio Mayor Nan Whaley, who recalled the recent mass shooting in her city, did not give a definitive answer to Sensenbrenner's question, nor did Dr. Alejandro Rios Tovar, a trauma surgeon who treated victims of the attack in El Paso, Texas. Charlottesville, Va., Chief of Police RaShall Brackney indicated she was in favor of a ban on ""any weapon that could be used to hunt individuals.""

Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., countered the idea of a hunting rifle ban by referring to his assault-weapon ban bill. Cicilline said that more than 200 weapons are exempt from the bill, so there is really no issue of eliminating hunting rifles.

Swearer also testified against the idea that law-abiding citizens have no need for weapons like AR-15s, recalling how her mother, a gun novice, had difficulty accurately firing a handgun at a shooting range, but was much more effective when she used an AR-15.

""As I read the Second Amendment, it doesn't say the right to bear arms shall not be infringed unless the gun has scary features,"" Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said.

2020 DEMS EMBRACE FEDERAL GUN BUYBACK PROGRAM IN WAKE OF MASS SHOOTINGS

Swearer also noted that some features like barrel shrouds enhance the safety of a weapon for its user. But David Chipman, senior policy adviser at the Giffords Law Center, raised a counterpoint noting that a barrel shroud could allow a shooter to get a better grip on a weapon ""in a way that would increase your ability to spray fire and kill more people"" without burning their hand.

One feature that was a concern for House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., is the ability for some weapons to be used with high-capacity magazines that allow users to fire dozens of rounds without reloading.

Kristen Rand, legislative director of the Violence Policy Center, testified in agreement with Nadler that a ban on such magazines, along with a clear definition of ""assault weapon"" that would eliminate loopholes under the 1994 crime law, would be effective.

Congress and the Trump administration have been in talks for weeks regarding possible gun legislation, but discussion of taking away guns that are currently legal has led to criticism from both parties. After 2020 Democratic hopeful Beto O'Rourke declared during a debate, ""Hell yes, we are going to take your AR-15, AK-47,"" Cicilline said, ""That message doesn't help."" President Trump said that O'Rourke was making it ""much harder"" to reach a deal on gun legislation with that sort of rhetoric.

Trump's focus when it comes to gun control has mainly been on background checks. The White House was also circulating a one-page document on Capitol Hill detailing a possible gun background-check proposal that would require private sellers – not just licensed vendors – to conduct background checks for all advertised sales, though Attorney General Bill Barr said Trump has not yet made a “firm decision” on what he ultimately will support.

An August USA Today poll showed that most American voters support increased background checks, with 85 percent of Republican voters supporting background checks for all gun sales. Presently, only federally licensed vendors are required to conduct background checks, allowing private individuals to sell without them under what has been referred to as the ""gun show loophole.""

White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News last week that he expected an announcement on new gun legislation “very soon.” Gidley said Trump wanted to make sure that any new laws would address actual problems and not just be “feel-good legislation.”

But the Democrats' impeachment push could complicate matters. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who had resisted impeachment, announced Tuesday that an impeachment inquiry would be launched. Reflecting how policy debates could take a back seat, Pelosi said in private meetings with lawmakers that Trump called her to discuss gun legislation, but she soon changed the subject to his phone call with the Ukrainian president in which they discussed investigating Joe Biden, which stoked the latest calls for impeachment."

Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., announced last week that the chamber would vote on the Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act – known as the SAFE Banking Act – which is the less ambitious of two marijuana-related bills congressional leadership had been considering for months. It passed 321-103, with 91 Republicans voting for it and Alabama Rep. Terri Sewell the only Democrat voting against it.

The legislation faces an uncertain fate in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been reluctant to bring up marijuana-related bills.

""Thousands of employees, businesses and communities across this country have been forced to deal in piles of cash because of the conflict between state and federal law,"" Rep. Ed Perlmutter, D-Colo., a bill sponsor, said after the measure passed Wednesday. ""After six years of working on this bill, the SAFE Banking Act will go a long way in getting cash off our streets and providing certainty so financial institutions can work with cannabis businesses and employees.""

The SAFE Banking Act would allow cannabis businesses to access financial services that have long been difficult to find due to their gray-area status — often legal in their individual state but illegal federally. Even cannabis businesses like hemp growers and CBD manufacturers that don't work directly with THC, the intoxicating chemical in marijuana, have struggled to access banking services due to trepidation that still hangs over the industry. Under the bill, marijuana businesses would be able to open accounts, take on loans, accept credit cards and deposit money into banks that now seldom associate with them for fear of repercussions from the federal government.

Those services will be important for a sector that added 64,389 jobs in 2018, according to a report by Leafly and Whitney Economics, and could grow even more as pot laws continue to loosen across the United States.

Scott Van Rixel, CEO of Bhang, a company that manufactures CBD candies and licenses THC products to state and provincial license holders, said giving cannabis companies access to general financial services would give the industry an air of stability and help it grow.

“Investors are going to have greater faith in the industry with access to traditional banking and the traditional credit card process,” he said. “Vendors and business to business are [also] going to be more comfortable if you know they can use standardized wires, standardized banking, write a check, get a wire without fear of reprisal or their bank account getting shut down.”

Safety is an issue, too. Many cannabis companies – like TILT Holdings, which raked in $39 million in earnings last quarter – are forced to do their business largely in cash, putting employees at risk of being robbed.

“It is imperative that we do everything possible to protect people working within the industry,” TILT Holdings Chief Operating Officer Tim Conder said.

But Kevin Sabet, who advised the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations on drug policy, warns that SAFE Banking Act is a corporate giveaway in sheep’s clothing.

“It’s going to create another big tobacco and big pharma industry and it never ends well for public health,” he told Fox News. “Today’s marijuana is much more harmful than it used to be. It’s not Woodstock weed anymore.”

Sabet noted that Altria and Phillip Morris, two of the largest tobacco companies in the world, are invested in marijuana. So are many big alcohol companies.

“This isn’t about social justice at all, this is about enriching for-profit companies,” he said.

Some progressive Democrats say simply letting marijuana businesses work with banks isn’t enough.

AMERICAN AIRLINES FLIGHT DIVERTED TO DENVER AFTER UNRULY PASSENGER REPORTEDLY SMOKES WEED ON BOARD

The most comprehensive cannabis bill in Congress right now is the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act, known as the MORE Act, which has support from Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Rep. Jerrold Nadler, R-N.Y., among others. The bill, which would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act and implement social justice programs for those affected by the ‘War on Drugs,’ would likely have a more difficult time clearing the Senate and getting President Donald Trump’s signature than the SAFE Banking Act.

Legal-pot activists and progressives had beseeched House members to take up the MORE Act first, worrying Congress would stop with the SAFE Banking Act. In a move to potentially assuage those fears and round up votes for Wednesday, Nadler committed to a markup of the MORE Act Tuesday night.

Attorneys for Ronald Lee Haskell argued that he had heard voices in his head telling him to kill members of the Stay family in 2014. Prosecutors said Haskell, 39, had planned to kill anyone who helped his ex-wife Melannie Lyon after she left him.

Authorities say Haskell traveled from California and stalked Lyon's family for two days before committing the murders.

Those killed include Stephen Stay, 39, and his 34-year-old wife Katie, along with their children, Zach, 4, Rebecca, 7, Emily, 9, and 13-year-old Bryan. Katie Stay was Melanie Lyon's sister.

Cassidy Stay, who was 15 at the time of the shootings, survived by playing dead after she was shot in the head. She testified that Haskell forced everyone in the Houston home to lie face down in the living room before shooting them. He subsequently tried going to the home of his ex-wife's parents and brother but was arrested by police.

A forensic psychiatrist who testified for the defense said Haskell suffered from severe mental illness that prevented him from knowing right from wrong. The psychiatrist testified Haskell was suffering from a form of bipolar disorder, a brain condition that causes unusual shifts in mood, and from schizoaffective disorder, a condition characterized by hallucinations or delusions.

In Texas, an insanity defense is rarely used and seldom successful.

Lyon testified that Haskell physically abused her and their children. She eventually took them and moved to Texas from Utah to be with her family after the couple divorced.

Prosecutors claimed Haskell faked symptoms of mental illness and had carefully planned the killings, disguising himself as a FedEx delivery driver to gain entry into the Stay family's home.

“We are grateful for the jurors’ rapt attention over the last many weeks to every piece of evidence in the case,” Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg said in a statement. “There was never a reasonable doubt that Haskell meticulously planned and carried out the slaughter of the Stay family.”

Jurors deliberated for eight hours over two days before coming to a verdict. The trial's penalty phase is scheduled to begin Monday. Prosecutors are asking for the death penalty.

Pelosi made the announcement following a meeting of the House Democratic Caucus at the Capitol, saying that ""the president must be held accountable"" for what she called the ""betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections.""

The only Democratic hopeful to explicitly come out against impeachment was Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii. Speaking on Fox Business' “Kennedy” on Tuesday night Gabbard said she thinks impeachment would be very ""divisive"" for a country that is already divided.

PELOSI ANNOUNCES FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP

“Donald Trump has abused his power, obstructed justice, and violated his oath of office. He puts his political interests over our national interest,” tweeted Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. “I agree with @SpeakerPelosi— no one is above the law. He must be impeached.”

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who first called for impeachment proceedings to begin in May after Special Counsel Robert Mueller spoke publicly about the findings of his Russia investigation, tweeted on Tuesday evening, “In 2016, Trump welcomed foreign adversaries to meddle in our democracy for his own gain. Now he appears to be using the same playbook to remain in power.""

Mueller’s probe was intended to examine Russian election interference and whether President Trump's campaign colluded with Russian officials during the 2016 election. In the report, Mueller said he could not exonerate the president on obstruction of justice but that investigators did not find sufficient evidence to establish charges of criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign.

Booker added, ""I applaud Speaker Pelosi's announcement of an impeachment inquiry—it’s our one remaining path to ensuring justice is served.”

Pelosi specifically charged that the Trump administration had violated the law by not turning over an intelligence community whistleblower's complaint concerning a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Citing testimony that the director of national intelligence is blocking the release of that complaint, she said: ""This is a violation of law. The law is unequivocal.""

Trump allegedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The president vowed earlier Tuesday to release a ""complete"" transcript of his call with Zelensky on Wednesday, though it's unlikely to settle the issue in Congress.

Joe Biden has acknowledged that, when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, while Shokin was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings — where Hunter Biden was on the board.

""This week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,"" Pelosi said Tuesday. ""Therefore, today, I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella.”

Following Pelosi’s announcement, Biden tweeted, “Pressuring the leader of another nation to investigate a political opponent — to help win an election — is not the conduct of an American President.”

Earlier Tuesday, Biden called Trump’s alleged actions “an abuse of power.”

“They undermine our national security,” Biden tweeted. “They violate the oath of office. If we allow a President to get away with shredding the United States Constitution — that will last forever.”

In remarks to reporters at the United Nations on Monday, Trump denied linking the Ukraine aid money to an investigation of the Bidens.

“No, I didn’t — I didn’t do it,” Trump said. But, he also repeatedly called the Bidens' actions in Ukraine a “disgrace,” acknowledged that Biden had come up during the call and added: ""It's very important to talk about corruption. ... Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?""

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., did not immediately release a statement, but sent out a somewhat-cryptic tweet Tuesday night, writing only: ""Billionaires should not be able to control our political system.""

During a press conference earlier on Tuesday Sanders said, “If you're going to go forward with impeachment. You're going to have grounds to do it. I happen to believe they're authorized to do it, but you got to lay it out.”

In a statement, former Texas rep. Beto O’Rourke said he is “grateful to Speaker Pelosi for opening an impeachment inquiry into President Trump” and called her announcement “a defining moment for our country.”

“For more than two years, even as I was running for Senate in Texas, I have been clear that I support impeachment,” O’Rourke said. “We all must come to terms with what we face: a lawless president who has obstructed justice and undermined our democracy by inviting a foreign power to intervene in 2016, and who is doing it again in 2020.”

Entrepreneur Andrew Yang tweeted on Tuesday, “Given the President’s latest actions I think impeachment is the right path forward.”

Yang added: “Asking foreign leaders for political help in return for aid and then suppressing your own agency’s inquiry is egregious. There have to be limits and Congress is right to act.”

In a follow-up tweet, Yang wrote, “A reminder that successful impeachment requires a majority vote in the House and then two-thirds in the Senate. Given that there are 53 Republican Senators one would need 20 of them to support impeachment to be successful. That is highly unlikely unless there is some huge shift.”

He added that he still agrees that moving forward “is for the best,” saying it will allow for a more thorough investigation “that may unearth new details.”

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., tweeted simply, “The House did the right thing.”

Former Maryland Congressman John Delaney released a statement following the announcement saying he agreed with Pelosi’s decision to move forward with an official impeachment inquiry, adding that “she deserves our support.”

""The President’s behavior, combined with the administration’s refusal to cooperate, leaves her no other choice,"" Delaney added. ""Our nation can only be as strong as the rules that govern it.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called Pelosi's announcement ""an overdue but important step.”

""Now the impeachment inquiry must move forward with the efficiency and seriousness this crisis demands,"" she said. ""The House needs to vote on articles of impeachment—and when it comes to the Senate, I will do what the Constitution requires.”

Billionaire hedge fund manager Tom Steyer said he applauded Pelosi and Democrats in Congress who are calling for an investigation into Trump’s alleged criminal behavior.

“Removing Trump from office has always been about doing what’s right, not what’s politically convenient,” Steyer said. “We built a nationwide movement to impeach a lawless president and defend our democracy. This is just the beginning.”

Earlier this month, Steyer told Fox News' Bret Baier during an interview on “Special Report” that he thinks President Trump is “the most corrupt president in American history” and that he has “more than met the criteria for impeachment.”

Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., did not react on social media, but in an interview on CNN on Tuesday night said the announcement is “a moment of truth for the country,” adding that “sooner or later it had to come.”

He went on to say that the announcement is also “a moment of truth for the Republican Party.""

A total of 172 House Democrats have now signaled support for an impeachment inquiry. A simple majority of House members present and voting would be required to impeach the president. A highly unlikely two-thirds vote in the GOP-controlled Senate would be needed to convict and remove Trump from office.

Vice President Mike Pence would then take office in that scenario and become the 46th President of the United States.

Reacting on ""Outnumbered Overtime"" to the release of the transcript of the call, which is based on ""notes and recollections"" of those who heard the conversation, Swalwell, D-Calif., said it was ""unacceptable"" for Trump to mention former Vice President Joe Biden's name even one time in the conversation.

""He has no business involving himself in a criminal case against his rival. We just don't do that in America. It's so gross to read that transcript. When I read that, one of my first thoughts was 'geez, what the hell does the Putin transcripts read like?' ... We know what he thinks of Putin, what has he given away to the Russians?"" he asked.

When pressed by anchor Harris Faulkner on the allegations surrounding Biden and his son's business dealings in Ukraine, Swalwell said there is ""no evidence"" of impropriety.

HOUSE DEMOCRAT WHO ENDORSED BIDEN SAYS IT'S TIME FOR HIM TO 'CLEAR UP' QUESTIONS ON SON'S UKRAINE DEALINGS

""If you want to show me evidence, I'm open-minded,"" said the former presidential candidate.

Swalwell, who was vocal in recent years alleging Trump's campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election, said if Trump asked Ukraine for help with his presidential campaign, he could have potentially owed them a favor in return.

""It's so corrupt,"" he said.

The White House on Wednesday released a transcript of Trump’s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky showing he sought a review of Biden family dealings in the country — but the document does not show Trump explicitly leveraging military aid as part of a quid pro quo, as Democrats have suggested in pressing forward with impeachment.

The document, declassified by Trump a day earlier, indicates that the call – which Trump made from the White House residence -- took place July 25 from 9:03 a.m. to 9:33 a.m. A notation on the memo says it does not represent a ""verbatim transcript"" but is based on ""notes and recollections"" of those listening and memorializing the call. It is still presented in transcript form.

The memo begins with the president congratulating Zelensky on his election victory, before Trump eventually broaches the subject of Biden and his son Hunter.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,” Trump said in the phone call.

“Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”

BIDEN HITS THE SKIDS IN NEW Q POLL

Politico: “A new national survey shows Elizabeth Warren now sitting atop the 2020 Democratic field… Twenty-seven percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents polled by Quinnipiac University said they favor Warren, according to a poll released Wednesday morning. Twenty-five percent said they prefer former Vice President Joe Biden. Although Warren’s edge falls within the survey’s margin of error, Biden’s formidable lead over the rest of the field has crumbled since the last Quinnipiac national poll in August, which showed him with 32 percent support and Warren with 19 percent support. The latest survey reinforces other public polling showing Warren and Biden separating from their fellow contenders in the Democratic presidential race. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders ranked third in Tuesday’s poll, achieving 16 percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., with 7 percent, and California Sen. Kamala Harris at 3 percent.”



Trump attacks raise doubts about Biden for Dem voters - NYT: “In public, for the last five days, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his campaign have been on a ferocious offensive, ripping into President Trump for allegedly abusing his powers in asking Ukraine’s leader to help hurt Mr. Biden politically, and castigating the news media for questioning his son Hunter Biden’s financial dealings there. … In private, though, this has been an enraging and uncertain time for the Biden campaign, and for Mr. Biden himself… He and his advisers have long feared that Hunter Biden would become a target for political opponent…And as Mr. Trump’s onslaught has pushed the House of Representatives to start an impeachment inquiry, Mr. Biden now faces a crucial political test where his standing may hinge on how he handles a wildly unpredictable confrontation with Mr. Trump.”



Warren ready for air war with $10 million buy - Politico: “Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign on Tuesday announced an early-state ad campaign of at least $10 million, suggesting that the Massachusetts senator is continuing to raise big money from grass-roots donors after an anemic start. The campaign told POLITICO that a digital ad campaign would begin immediately and that they are currently reserving television time, with the entire buy ramping up over the next few months. The campaign declined to say when its spending on digital and TV ads would reach eight figures. ‘Right now, our biggest expense as a campaign is our staff, but as the campaign heats up, it will be on media to reach potential voters,’ campaign manager Roger Lau wrote in a memo emailed to supporters Tuesday morning. The campaign ‘will be more digital than old-school broadcast television.’ The campaign also released three ads Tuesday — 15-second, 30-second, and 1-minute spots — which highlight Warren’s policy plans and her intention to crack down on corruption in government.”



Buttigieg hitches a ride on McCain’s media strategy - CBS News: “The South Bend, Indiana mayor rolled across Iowa on a four-day bus tour and allowed everything uttered on the bus to be on the record, drawing ready comparisons to the late Senator John McCain's ‘Straight Talk Express,’ the bus he toured the country in when he ran for president in 2000. The coach, which has also been around the country in the service of former President Barack Obama, Justin Timberlake and Tom Hanks, is now styled with Buttigieg signs, marble floors and plays news channels or football in the background. … He and his campaign have ramped up spending in Iowa in the past month, releasing a new TV ad on Monday, hiring more staff on the ground and opening offices. He added that the strategy is not to ‘go around Iowa.’”



Sanders touts dozen of union member endorsements - The Hill: “White House hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) unveiled the endorsements of 85 union members in Iowa as he works to shore up support for his progressive bona fides against a surging Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). The endorsements were announced on the ‘Bernie beats Trump’ tour in Iowa during which Sanders is visiting counties that voted for former President Obama in 2008 and 2012 and for President Trump in 2016 to help ensure skeptical voters that he can beat Trump in a general election. … The endorsements come from members of several unions, including the autoworkers of America and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.”

TIME OUT: WELL PACKAGED PEANUTS

New Yorker: “Timing is the life force of comics. Without a sensitivity to the rhythms and the music—a.k.a. the reality—of life, a comic strip will arrive D.O.A., nothing more than a bunch of dumb pictures. … The reader doesn’t just look at Charlie Brown, Linus, Lucy, and Snoopy but reads them as musical notes in a silently heard composition of hilarity, cruelty, and occasional melancholy. In 1950, the comics page was a more or less settled territory into which very few new features could be shoehorned, and, from the get-go, ‘Peanuts’ was marketed as a space-saver. The strip was created out of four equally sized panels, which allowed it to run horizontally, vertically, or stacked two by two. … Who would’ve thought that such a hard-nosed commercial decision would catalyze one of the greatest works of popular art of the twentieth century?”

TRUMP LEANED ON UKRAINIAN LEADER FOR BIDEN DIRT

WSJ: “President Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, to ‘look into’ former Vice President Joe Biden’s son and said he would direct his personal lawyer and attorney general to reach out to Mr. Zelensky to ‘get to the bottom of it,’ according to a document released by the White House designed to memorialize a July phone call between the leaders. The document also revealed that Mr. Trump, before asking Ukraine to examine actions by Mr. Biden’s son, reminded Mr. Zelensky that the U.S. sends security aid to Ukraine. ‘I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine,’ he said. ‘We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time.’ He contrasted the U.S. aid with what European countries do to help Ukraine. According to the document released by the White House on Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump didn’t make an explicit link on the call between the U.S. aid—which he had ordered a hold on a week earlier—and an investigation into Mr. Biden’s son.”



Trump lawyer: State Department directed involvement - WashEx: “President Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani said he began dealing with Ukrainian officials at the behest of the State Department. During an interview Tuesday evening on Fox News, Giuliani was prompted to respond to a Washington Post report in which White House insiders complained about how he was improperly ‘injecting himself’ into U.S.-Ukraine relations. ‘Man, I really did,’ Giuliani said sarcastically. ‘And you know who I did at the request of? The State Department. I never talked to a Ukrainian official until the State Department called me and asked me to do it.’ Holding up his mobile phone, Giuliani said he reported every conversation he had to the Trump administration and that evidence of this communications with the State Department were all on the device.”



Pelosi heats up impeachment rhetoric, but not her go-slow approach - Roll Call: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s announcement Tuesday that the House is in an ‘official impeachment inquiry’ gave no hints of how or whether it would accelerate any Democratic effort to remove President Donald Trump from office. Pelosi said she directed the six House committees conducting oversight of the Trump administration to move forward ‘under that umbrella’ of an impeachment inquiry — but gave no details about how the day-to-day approach would differ. In that way, Pelosi appeared to stay on a measured Democratic approach that for months has fallen short of raising public support for impeachment — particularly with the Trump administration’s unyielding rejection of congressional subpoena power — and put off potentially stronger moves toward impeachment.”



Poll shows reason for her caution - WaPo: “Amid a groundswell of support for impeachment proceedings among House Democrats, a new poll finds a majority of Americans do not favor ousting President Trump from office. Thirty-seven percent of voters say that Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 57 percent say he should not be impeached, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday morning. … The poll shows a stark partisan divide on the question of impeachment. Among Democrats, 73 percent support impeachment, while 21 percent are opposed. Among Republicans, only 4 percent support impeachment, while 95 percent are opposed. Trump’s overall job approval rating remains in the range it has for nearly his entire presidency, with 40 percent of voters approving of how he is handling his job, and 55 percent saying they disapprove.”



Silver: Will Dems learn lessons of Russia probe? - FiveThirtyEight: “Despite Trump being quite unpopular, and despite the public largely buying Democrats’ interpretation of the fact pattern on Russia — most polls find that a majority of the public thinks that Trump sought to obstruct the investigation into Russia, for instance — impeachment was a soundly unpopular proposition. … The politics of impeachment on Ukraine may be different than on Russia. But Democrats should take public opinion seriously. That doesn’t mean you always have to do the poll-driven thing. But don’t wish the numbers away because you don’t like them, or presume that they’ll change in your favor, or assume there won’t be consequences for taking an unpopular action. More specifically for Democrats, their failure to persuade the public that Russia warranted impeachment offers several potential lessons if they are to proceed on Ukraine.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I just have a political science question regarding the 2020 Senate race in Kansas. Kris Kobach lost the governor’s race in 2018 and is now running for the GOP nomination for Senate (yinz know this already). I was wondering do voters’ think differently when selecting a governor rather than a Senator? Kobach was too right-wing for the Topeka state House as an executive, but as a legislator in Washington? Does it make a difference that electing a Democratic Governor is vastly different than a Democratic Senator with vastly different consequences politically? Hopefully my question makes sense.” – James Belany, Pittsburgh



[Ed. note: The first thing to remember, Mr. Belany, is that there’s precious little science in politics. Like many of the humanities, political theory and the study of campaigns and elections, got squeezed into a faux “science” during the middle of the last century. To that I say: Phooey! The science at play in your question could be social psychology, though. Would the voters of Kansas feel differently about a radical senator than they would a radical governor? Maybe there’s something to that. But maybe there’s another discipline to consider: Mathematics. There were three candidates for governor in 2018, but maybe only two for Senate in 2020. Could Kobach slide by in a binary election especially when Republican voters are storming the polls in a presidential year? Maybe. But that doesn’t change the fact that the GOP would much rather not have to deal with Kobach. Not only does he increase the degree of difficulty in Kansas, but Democrats running in other states can use his comments and record against his fellow Republicans.]



“Just wanted you to know that I came down with a debilitating case of the bird flu this past weekend ... as the hated Cardinals swept my Cubbies at Wrigley Field, and ensured the Cardinals will be Central Division champions this year. The illness hasn't gotten better as Kris Bryant appears out for the season, and my Cubbies appear doomed to sit out the postseason. Chortle if you will at my Cubbies misfortune -- but just wait until next year!” – Stephen J. Tock, Dwight, Ill.



[Ed. note: I can’t go so far as to say that I felt “bad” for the Cubs, but I can say that I admire your determination, Mr. Tock. And we can all be proud to say that the National League Central continues to be the best, most competitive division in baseball. And with three games left against the Cards, I’m sure your squad will try hard to avenge the Wrigley sweep!]

HAPPY HUMP DAY

AP: “A veterinarian has prescribed antibiotics to a camel owned by a Louisiana truck stop petting zoo after a woman bit the 600-pound (272-kilogram) animal to free herself from under its weight. Iberville Parish Sheriff's Office documents obtained by The Advocate on Monday accuse Florida couple Gloria and Edmond Lancaster of throwing treats for their unleashed dog into Caspar the camel's enclosure at Tiger Truck Stop. The couple told deputies the camel attacked the dog, but the sheriff's office said the couple had provoked the animal before it sat on Gloria Lancaster. She'd crawled under barbed wire to retrieve her pet. Gloria Lancaster told officers she had to bite the camel to free herself. Truck stop manager Pamela Bossier said a veterinarian prescribed Caspar antibiotics as a precaution.”

‘DESERVE’S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT’

Let’s start with the precondition that we don’t care whether you think the investigation into President Trump’s efforts to get the Ukrainian government to prosecute his political rivals is “THE GREATEST SCAM IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS!” grounds for immediate impeachment or something in between.



We care in the sense that we’re sure that you are sincere in your beliefs and we acknowledge your God-given right to feel and think the way you do. What we mean is that in order to discern what might happen next, such feelings are hindrances. It’s hard to clearly consider such outcomes when you think in terms of your own beliefs.



This note, for example, would be a poor source for Major League Baseball forecasting since it is our position that the St. Louis Cardinals not only will win it all but deserve to win it all.



As William Munny told Little Bill Daggett right before he blew his head off with a Spencer repeating rifle on a saloon floor: “Deserve’s got nothing to do with it.”



There are plenty of people who think that Bill Clinton unfairly beat the rap, and even some who still think Richard Nixon got a raw deal. If you flipped through the back pages of enough bibliographies, you might even find some historians with strong feelings about what happened to old Andy Johnson.



Woodrow Wilson was incapacitated by a stroke in his second term, with his wife acting as a kind of regent for his last 17 months in office but Congress took no action. Warren Harding’s administration – in particular his Interior and Justice departments – was a quagmire of corruption, but he was dead and buried before any of it came to light. Lyndon Johnson grievously abused the powers of office for political advantage but he never faced any repercussions.



The rightness or wrongness of a president’s actions are all but immaterial in these matters. Whether the supporters or detractors of the aforementioned men were correct or not was of no consequence.

Now, that’s not to say that the passionate partisan bawling that we’re all now being subjected to won’t have an effect on what eventually does happen.



Studies suggest that home field advantage in sports is not only real but quite possibly the result of referees showing favoritism because of “the social atmosphere in the stadium.” The same is true with allegations of presidential misconduct.



We’ve said it many times before, but it bears repeating: Impeachment is a political proposition, not a legal one. And the referees here are the undecided or persuadable voters not yet sure what to make of what’s happening.



But even if you want to be part of working the refs – screaming into the orc-filled chasms of Twitter or annoying friends and loved ones with forwarded emails and Facebook posts – you probably still want to be able to think clearly about where it goes from here.



And that’s what we intend to help you do in the days ahead. You have plenty of other options for getting the latest details on what this unnamed source said or what that hearing may or may not have revealed. We’re going to stay focused on the political repercussions because that’s our job.



For the sake of everybody who is going to be out there fighting passionately for their side, whatever it is, we’ll do our best to not pick one.

TIME OUT: ONCE UPON A TIME…

NatGeo: “The brothers Grimm published what would become one of the most influential and famous collections of folklore in the world. Children’s and Household Tales (Kinder und Hausmärchen), later titled Grimm’s Fairy Tales, are childhood-defining stories. The Grimms, however, had curated the collection as an academic anthology for scholars of German culture, not as a collection of bedtime stories for young readers. Amid the political and social turbulence of the Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815), as France conquered Germanic lands, Jacob and Wilhelm were driven by nationalism to highlight their homeland and heritage. They were inspired by German Romantic authors and philosophers who believed that the purest forms of culture, those that bonded a community, could be found in stories shared from generation to generation. Storytelling expressed the essence of German culture and recalled the spirit and basic values of its people. By excavating Germany’s oral traditions, the brothers urgently sought to ‘preserve them from vanishing . . . to be forever silent in the tumult of our times.’”

WARREN SLIPS AND SWIPES BIDEN ON ETHICS

Fox News: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren spotlighted her longstanding calls for the impeachment of President Trump at a campaign event on Wednesday, emphasizing, ‘I hope we do this and I hope we do this quickly.’ But, she also appeared to unintentionally swipe at a rival Democrat vying for the White House – former Vice President Joe Biden – over his family’s role in the Ukraine controversy that led the House of Representatives to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump. Taking questions from reporters following a town hall event in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire, the Massachusetts Democrat was asked if she would allow her vice president’s child to serve on the board of a foreign company if she were president.

More family woes for Biden - Politico: “Joe Biden’s brother told executives at a healthcare firm that the former vice president’s cancer initiative would promote their business, according to a participant in the conversation, who said the promise came as part of a pitch on behalf of potential investors in the firm. The allegation is the latest of many times Biden’s relatives have invoked the former vice president and his political clout to further their private business dealings. It is the first that involves the Biden Cancer Initiative, a project Joe Biden made the centerpiece of his post-White House life following the death of his son Beau. Biden’s brother, James, made the promise to executives at Florida-based Integrate Oral Care during a phone call on or around November 8, 2018, according to Michael Frey, CEO of Diverse Medical Management, a health-care firm that is suing James Biden. At the time, James Biden’s business partners were pursuing a potential investment in Integrate, according to Frey and court records.”



Sanders gives supporters the stage in Iowa - Des Moines Register: “As a Democratic candidate for president, [Bernie] Sanders frequently pushes his policies pugnaciously, framing them as moral imperatives as much as practical matters. But in his recent four-day swing through Iowa, he balanced his high-volume sermons with stories from his supporters. … Respondents who watched the September televised debate, where Sanders — who approached the debate stage with his typical fervor, but with a hoarse rasp — were more likely to have an unfavorable view of him. The debate-stage Sanders, whose style is described by some, including one of his 2020 rivals, as ""yelling"", was less present in his late September Iowa swing, Instead, Sanders often gave up the microphone to let others speak. … At his Iowa events, some of the personal stories are arranged in advance. But others are organic — hearing the stories of others inspires Sanders supporters to tell their own.”



Biden leads the pack in Maryland - Goucher College: “The Goucher College Poll asked Maryland Democratic likely voters who they are currently planning to vote for in the Maryland Democratic presidential primary… Thirty-three percent of Maryland Democratic likely voters say they will vote for Joe Biden and 21 percent for Elizabeth Warren. Ten percent would vote for Bernie Sanders, 6 percent for Kamala Harris, and 5 percent for Pete Buttigieg. All other candidates earn support from 1 percent or fewer of voters. Fifteen percent have no preference or are undecided. …Mileah Kromer, director of the Sarah T. Hughes Field Politics Center at Goucher College [said,] ‘Democrats in Maryland are divided over whether they want a more moderate or progressive nominee and whether nominating a candidate who can defeat Trump or match their policy preferences is their top priority.’”



ISSA TO CHALLENGE DUNCAN HUNTER

NYT: “Darrell Issa, the former nine-term congressman from California, will try to return to Congress by challenging Representative Duncan Hunter, who was indicted last year, setting up a clash among two Trump allies for one of Republicans’ most endangered seats. Mr. Issa is expected to announce his challenge at a news conference on Thursday morning in the San Diego County district, according to two sources familiar with his decision. He had been publicly mulling for months whether to make a bid to return to Congress, and started an exploratory committee in August. ‘I have received such a tremendous outpouring of encouragement from supporters inside the district, and around the state and across the nation,’ Mr. Issa said in August in a statement posted to the committee’s website. Mr. Issa will likely bill himself to Republicans as a safer alternative than the incumbent.”

*AHEM* THEY GOT TRASHED

News24: “A South Korean mayor who dumped a ton of trash on a clean beach to give environmental campaigners something to pick up has said sorry for his deception. Officials trucked in litter and waste that had already been collected from rubbish-strewn coasts, and scattered it all over the pristine sand of southwest Jindo. The following day hundreds of volunteers scoured the shores and bagged up the garbage as part of an event to mark International Coastal Cleanup Day, a global event aimed at countering the scourge of sea-borne waste. ‘We brought in waste styrofoam and other coastal trash gathered from nearby areas so the 600 participants could carry out clean-up activities,’ said Lee Dong-jin, Jindo county mayor, in a statement. His office apologised for causing trouble and said the event was meant to ‘raise awareness about the seriousness of coastal waste.’”

The Bedari Foundation, which was established by philanthropists Jennifer and Matthew C. Harris, gave $20 million to establish the UCLA Bedari Kindness Institute, which will support research on kindness, produce opportunities to translate the research into practices and have a chief goal of empowering citizens and leaders to build more humane societies.

“Universities should always be places where we teach students to reach across lines of difference and treat one another with empathy and respect — even when we deeply disagree,” UCLA Chancellor Gene Block said in a statement. “The UCLA Bedari Kindness Institute will bring the best thinking to this vital issue and, I think, will allow us to have a real social impact on future generations.”

The new institute will take an ""interdisciplinary approach"" to the top of kindness by examining it through evolutionary, biological, psychological, economic, cultural and sociological perspectives.

“Our vision is that we will all live in a world where humanity discovers and practices the kindness that exists in all of us,” said Matthew Harris, the foundation’s co-founder and a 1984 UCLA graduate, in a press statement. “Much research is needed to understand why kindness can be so scarce in the modern world. As we seek at Bedari to bridge the divide between science and spirituality, through the establishment of the UCLA Bedari Kindness Institute we hope to educate and empower more and more people in the practice of kindness.”

Darnell Hunt, dean of the UCLA division of social sciences, praised the foundation in a statement.

“In the midst of current world politics, violence and strife, the UCLA Bedari Kindness Institute seeks to be an antidote,” Hunt said. “Rooted in serious academic work, the institute will partner and share its research on kindness broadly in accessible formats. The Bedari Foundation’s extraordinary gift is truly visionary and we are grateful for its support and leadership.”

The Bedari Foundation is a private family foundation focused primarily on helping in the areas of health, wellness, environmental conservation and community displacement. The gift is part of the Centennial Campaign for UCLA.

""We know that yards can equate to points; that's a fact,"" Saints coach Sean Payton asserted this week while discussing how special teams affect field position. ""If you believe 100 yards equals seven points — in and around that number — then that can directly impact winning and losing.""

The first full game New Orleans had to play this season without star quarterback Drew Brees — a 33-27 triumph in Seattle last Sunday — served as a reminder of how much can depend on the unit that plays by far the fewest snaps.

Morstead was named NFC special teams player of the week after a game in which he averaged a 52-yard net on six punts and had two punts downed inside the 5-yard line. If Morstead hadn't won that honor, it might well have gone to Harris for his 53-yard punt return touchdown.

""You just kind of go into every game feeling like you are going to be the difference in a positive way, but you just don't know how it's going to play out,"" Morstead said. ""It does feel nice at the end of a game, like that to feel like special teams as a whole made a difference in the game.""

Whether those phases of the game could again be a significant factor on Sunday night against Dallas remains to be seen, but Cowboys coach Jason Garrett has taken notice of the Saints' special teams' success.

""What you're trying to do on special teams is do something that can change the game,"" Garrett said. ""Hopefully, you can tip the field, tip the balance of the game and they've been able to do that up to this point and those are the kind of plays that make a huge difference.""

When the Saints' offense has been at its most prolific, it might have been easy to overlook the kicking game's role, particularly in numerous lopsided victories in which New Orleans punted few times.

But if a game is close, or if the offense is sputtering, then good punting — and good punt returns — are at a premium. And it's not clear if the Saints can replicate the offensive production they've historically enjoyed with Brees while another quarterback is under center.

The Saints used two quarterbacks last week in Seattle. Teddy Bridgewater was the starter and played the vast majority of the offensive snaps. Taysom Hill subbed in as a read-option run threat; he either handed off or ran himself. The Saints gained 265 yards on offense, barely more than half of the Seahawks' 514 yards. New Orleans still won in large part because of special teams play, along with a defensive touchdown on a fumble return.

Hill, who also serves as an up-back on punts, said being able to play on special teams with the Saints has helped him appreciate how much that unit can influence games, be it with blocked punts, fake punts, returns or simply good punts.

""It's all about, in the NFL, winning the field position battle. We talk about it week in and week out,"" Hill said. ""The punt is the biggest contributor to that, and the punt return. And we saw how that affected the game last week.""

Now in his 11th season out of SMU, Morstead has established himself as one of the elite punters in the NFL. He can send booming spirals far down field with accuracy toward one sideline or the other. He can also chip end-over-end, Australian Rules Football-style punts that seem to stick inside the 10-yard line without going into the end zone for a touchback.

""Thomas makes our job really easy,"" Hill said. ""When you pin a team or returner, right or left, outside the numbers, it's really difficult for those guys to get a return.""

Morstead, meanwhile, has enjoyed seeing how Harris, a rookie out of Division II Assumption College, has burst onto the scene as a potent return man.

""He's obviously very talented. Everybody can see that,"" Morstead said. ""He doesn't lack any confidence.""

Harris did, however, commit his first major mistake in Seattle when he muffed a punt. The Seahawks recovered, but failed to capitalize when Saints made a fourth-down stop.

Morstead said he told Harris: ""Don't lose your stinger. Keep being aggressive how you've been. You just can't get ahead of yourself.""

After all, the Saints might need a few more good returns while their offense adjusts to life without Brees."

The debate is being hosted by CNN and The New York Times.

The first two rounds of debates in June and July – which had lower criteria to qualify – were held over two consecutive nights with 10 candidates on the stage each evening. Ten candidates faced off on one night in this month’s third round debate, for which the thresholds were raised."

“If you are a gun owner and you feel like you’re under attack, you need to call your congressmen and, you know, it sounds cliche, but it's more important now than ever,” Muller said, adding she has drawn a ""line in the sand.""

Muller made a bold proclamation during the congressional hearing regarding a proposed assault weapons ban, vowing that she would not comply.

KAMALA HARRIS SAYS SHE SUPPORTS A MANDATORY BUYBACK ON 'ASSAULT WEAPONS'

The session on an otherwise contentious issue flew largely under the radar amid the Trump-Ukraine controversy and the Democrats' impeachment push.

Amid a spate of deadly mass shootings that prompted renewed calls for strict laws on assault weapons, Muller said, such a ban would force lawful gun owners to either give up their arms or become criminals.

Muller said that there are many law enforcement officers who agree with her, and that opponents are using terms such as “weapons of war” to incite emotion.

“More people are killed with hammers and blunt objects than all rifles combined according to FBI statistics so it doesn’t make sense to me that this is going to solve the problem,” Muller said.

The gun control push from Democrats was evident at a recent presidential debate, where candidate Beto O'Rourke, a former congressman from Texas, generated a huge round of applause by vowing to use a mandatory gun buyback program to take assault weapons from Americans. Meantime, the White House has been in negotiations with lawmakers on measures like increased background checks.

Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News last week that he expected an announcement on new gun legislation “very soon.” Gidley said President Trump wanted to make sure that any new laws would address actual problems and not just be “feel-good legislation.”

Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, the two populist standard-bearers in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.

The National Union of Healthcare Workers – which backed the independent senator from Vermont in his 2016 Democratic presidential primary bid – announced on Thursday that they’ll provide resources and grassroots support to both Sanders and Warren.

SANDERS CAMPAIGN SWIPES AT WARREN, TESTING TRUCE BETWEEN THE PROGRESSIVE 2020 CHAMPIONS

The union explained that the gap between Warren and Sanders in a vote by union members was close enough that the union’s executive board decided on Wednesday to endorse both candidates.

“This is not your typical union endorsement. We didn’t tell our members how to vote, they told us,” union president Sal Rosselli said. “We trust our members and their judgments and the outcome of this vote reflects the collective will of members from San Diego to the Oregon border. Our members clearly like both Senators Warren and Sanders.”

“After reviewing the vote totals, our executive board felt that an endorsement of both candidates was most fair due to the closeness of the vote,” he explained.

Union members voted from Sunday through Wednesday, with members able to cast a ballot for up to three candidates. Warren received the most votes, appearing on 61 percent of ballots, with Sanders showing up on 50 percent of ballots.

Home-state Sen. Kamala Harris appeared on 34 percent of ballots. She was endorsed by the union in her races for California attorney general and her 2016 election to the U.S. Senate. Former Vice President Joe Biden was fourth in the voting, showing up on 32 percent of ballots.

WARREN SURGES TO TIE BIDEN IN LATEST POLLS, SANDERS SLIPS TO THIRD

The splitting of the endorsement comes as some in the Sanders campaign are starting to take aim at Warren. Both Sanders and Warren have – to date – refrained for criticizing each other.

But new national and early voting state polls released over the past week indicate Warren soaring into a tie with long-time front-runner Biden for the top spot in the 2020 Democratic battle, with Sanders dipping to third.

Earlier this month Warren landed the endorsement of the New York-based progressive group the Working Families Party, which backed Sanders four years ago in his first White House bid."

In an article published this week, Esquire's literary editor, Amy Grace Lloyd, suggested the Trump administration has purged people like the totalitarian regime in ""The Handmaid's Tale.""

""Different. For the moment you and I are not in danger of getting arrested by the NKVD,"" said Atwood, referring to the Soviet police force that carried out mass arrests and executions under dictator Josef Stalin.

""You think Gilead is bad or that the TV series is too violent? Look up the NKVD,"" Atwood added. ""It’s important to have that perspective. People are saying Trump is re-creating Gilead. That’s not true. If it were, we’d not be having this conversation. He’s not even a particularly Gileadean figure, more like a [Babylonian king] Nebuchadnezzar of the right. That guy went mad.""

ELISABETH MOSS SAYS IT'S 'APT' TO COMPARE ANTI-ABORTION LAWS TO 'HANDMAID'S TALE'S' DYSTOPIAN SOCIETY

When Lloyd responded by complaining about ""divisiveness being promoted"" in the U.S., Atwood told her to ""suck it up!""

""Why are you so afraid?"" Atwood asked. ""No one is going to kill you right now. Anybody banging down your door? What you should be doing is figuring out who to vote for in the next election. Which candidate is going to take you the farthest he or she can from Gilead? Panic isn’t helpful.""

Since the Hulu show based on Atwood's novel premiered in April 2017, liberals have repeatedly compared Republicans and their policies to those of the villains in the story. At the 2018 White House Correspondents' Dinner, for example, comedienne Michelle Wolf compared then-White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to Aunt Lydia, the brutal overseer of Gilead's female captives. A CNN documentary similarly drew comparisons to Atwood's story -- as did Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., when she spoke out against Alabama's restrictive abortion law.

The institute, housed in the division of social sciences, will support research on understanding kindness through evolutionary, biological, psychological, economic, cultural and sociological perspectives.

John Hyten confirmed as nation's No. 2 military officer despite aide’s sexual misconduct allegations,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/air-force-gen-john-hyten-confirmed-as-nations-no-2-military-officer-dismissing-aides-sexual-misconduct-allegations,"The Senate Thursday confirmed the nomination of Air Force General John Hyten to become the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the second-highest-ranking military officer in the U.S., after months of delays for an investigation into sexual misconduct claims.

Hyten's former aide, Army Col. Kathryn Spletstoser, accused the general of assaulting her in a California hotel room in 2017. She said Hyten kissed, hugged and rubbed up against her while she pushed him away and told him to stop, and that he tried to derail her military career after she rebuffed him.

The Senate confirmed Hyten by a 75-22 vote, indicating a bit more opposition than most military nominations, which often get near-unanimous Senate support. The only Republican to vote ""no"" was Joni Ernst of Iowa, a survivor of sexual assault while in college and former reserve officer.

""It has been a painful time for me and my family, but I want to state to you and the American people in the strongest possible terms that these allegations are false,"" Hyten said during a committee hearing in July. ""Nothing happened, ever.""

A separate Air Force investigation found no evidence to support the accusations. Officials told Fox News Spletstoser had leveled various accusations against at least a dozen other military officers in recent years, none of which were substantiated. Spletstoser has said she never made any sexual assault allegations against anyone else.

Spletstoser said she believes Hyten's confirmation proves the military is still unequipped to handle sexual assault cases. ""The process for seeking justice has been a sham; I have not had the opportunity to tell my story publicly and have been subject to a rushed and incomplete inquiry overseen by an officer junior in rank to General Hyten. I received a military protective order - the equivalent of a civilian restraining order - against General Hyten in May after he exhibited threatening behavior, including stalking,"" she said in a statement.

Officials said Spletstoser had been fired from her job under Hyten’s command running the U.S. military’s nuclear arsenal a few months after the alleged incident occurred for creating a “toxic” work environment and “bullying” subordinates while displaying a “volcanic temper.”

POMPEO ACCUSES SYRIA OF USING CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN MAY ATTACK

It was Spletstoser’s behavior under Hyten that led Ernst to question Hyten’s nomination during the hearings.

“There are professional responsibilities associated with being such a high ranking leader and that is to make sure that those within your command are following your directive and not engaging in toxic leadership,"" she said. ""So this leaves me with concerns about your judgment and ability to lead in one of the highest positions in the U.S. military.""

However, another Colonel who served under Spletstoser's command in Korea from 2011-2013 spoke highly of her moral character. ""Kathy was an awesome commander and an officer that you could depend on in good or bad times,"" said Col. Loi M. Nguyen. ""If she were to lead us into combat in the future, I would be happy to serve with her because of her competency, candidness, and high moral character,"" he added.

Others voting ""no"" Thursday included two Democratic presidential candidates Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who has made military sexual misconduct one of her top issues in the Senate; and Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, an Iraq War veteran who lost her legs when her helicopter was shot down.

But Hyten received support from Sen. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., a former fighter pilot who has publicly described her own sexual assault that she says occurred while she was in the military.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES CUTTING REFUGEE LIMIT TO LOWEST LEVEL IN PROGRAM'S HISTORY

""To be clear, this wasn’t just a jump ball. Not a he-said, she-said,"" McSally told the Senate Armed Services Committee in July. ""Not a situation where we just couldn’t prove what allegedly happened. I believe the truth still matters in our country. And the full truth was revealed in this process.

The truth is that General Hyten is innocent of these charges,"" McSally went on. ""Sexual assault happens in the military. It just didn’t happen in this case.

""Today's Senate confirmation of Gen John Hyten to be the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is good news for our military and good news for our nation,"" said Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David F. Goldfein. ""John Hyten is the leader, strategist, and above all an individual with the character and values to lead our men and women in uniform well.""

Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, congratulated Hyten, calling him a “visionary leader with an unparalleled strategic perspective.” Dunford is retiring next Monday after four years on the job, so Hyten will be serving under Army Gen. Mark Milley.

Hyten has served in the Air Force for nearly four decades and most recently headed U.S. Strategic Command, which controls America's nuclear force. He also led Air Force Space Command and served as mission director at Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado, the military's iconic defense bunker during the Cold War.

Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., announced last week that the chamber would vote on the Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act – known as the SAFE Banking Act – which is the less ambitious of two marijuana-related bills congressional leadership had been considering for months. It passed 321-103, with 91 Republicans voting for it and Alabama Rep. Terri Sewell the only Democrat voting against it.

The legislation faces an uncertain fate in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been reluctant to bring up marijuana-related bills.

""Thousands of employees, businesses and communities across this country have been forced to deal in piles of cash because of the conflict between state and federal law,"" Rep. Ed Perlmutter, D-Colo., a bill sponsor, said after the measure passed Wednesday.

TEENS, PREGNANT WOMEN URGED NOT TO SMOKE POT BY SURGEON GENERAL: 'THIS AIN'T YOUR MOTHER'S MARIJUANA'

The SAFE Banking Act would allow cannabis businesses to access financial services that have long been difficult to find due to their gray-area status — often legal in their individual state but illegal federally. Even cannabis businesses like hemp growers and CBD manufacturers that don't work directly with THC, the intoxicating chemical in marijuana, have struggled to access banking services due to trepidation that still hangs over the industry. Under the bill, marijuana businesses would be able to open accounts, take on loans, accept credit cards and deposit money into banks that now seldom associate with them for fear of repercussions from the federal government.

Those services will be important for a sector that added 64,389 jobs in 2018, according to a report by Leafly and Whitney Economics, and could grow even more as pot laws continue to loosen across the United States.

Scott Van Rixel, CEO of Bhang, a company that manufactures CBD candies and licenses THC products to state and provincial license holders, said giving cannabis companies access to general financial services would give the industry an air of stability and help it grow.

“Investors are going to have greater faith in the industry with access to traditional banking and the traditional credit card process,” he said. “Vendors and business to business are [also] going to be more comfortable if you know they can use standardized wires, standardized banking, write a check, get a wire without fear of reprisal or their bank account getting shut down.”

Safety is an issue, too. Many cannabis companies – like TILT Holdings, which raked in $39 million in earnings last quarter – are forced to do their business largely in cash, putting employees at risk of being robbed.

“It is imperative that we do everything possible to protect people working within the industry,” TILT Holdings Chief Operating Officer Tim Conder said.

But Kevin Sabet, who advised the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations on drug policy, warns that SAFE Banking Act is a corporate giveaway in sheep’s clothing.

“It’s going to create another big tobacco and big pharma industry and it never ends well for public health,” he told Fox News. “Today’s marijuana is much more harmful than it used to be. It’s not Woodstock weed anymore.”

Sabet noted that Altria and Phillip Morris, two of the largest tobacco companies in the world, are invested in marijuana. So are many big alcohol companies.

“This isn’t about social justice at all, this is about enriching for-profit companies,” he said.

Some progressive Democrats say simply letting marijuana businesses work with banks isn’t enough.

AMERICAN AIRLINES FLIGHT DIVERTED TO DENVER AFTER UNRULY PASSENGER REPORTEDLY SMOKES WEED ON BOARD

The most comprehensive cannabis bill in Congress right now is the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act, known as the MORE Act, which has support from Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Rep. Jerrold Nadler, R-N.Y., among others. The bill, which would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act and implement social justice programs for those affected by the ‘War on Drugs,’ would likely have a more difficult time clearing the Senate and getting President Donald Trump’s signature than the SAFE Banking Act.

Legal-pot activists and progressives had beseeched House members to take up the MORE Act first, worrying Congress would stop with the SAFE Banking Act. In a move to potentially assuage those fears and round up votes for Wednesday, Nadler committed to a markup of the MORE Act Tuesday night.

Attorneys for Ronald Lee Haskell argued that he had heard voices in his head telling him to kill members of the Stay family in 2014. Prosecutors said Haskell, 39, had planned to kill anyone who helped his ex-wife Melannie Lyon after she left him.

Authorities say Haskell traveled from California and stalked Lyon's family for two days before committing the murders.

Those killed include Stephen Stay, 39, and his 34-year-old wife Katie, along with their children, Zach, 4, Rebecca, 7, Emily, 9, and 13-year-old Bryan. Katie Stay was Melanie Lyon's sister.

Cassidy Stay, who was 15 at the time of the shootings, survived by playing dead after she was shot in the head. She testified that Haskell forced everyone in the Houston home to lie face down in the living room before shooting them. He subsequently tried going to the home of his ex-wife's parents and brother but was arrested by police.

A forensic psychiatrist who testified for the defense said Haskell suffered from severe mental illness that prevented him from knowing right from wrong. The psychiatrist testified Haskell was suffering from a form of bipolar disorder, a brain condition that causes unusual shifts in mood, and from schizoaffective disorder, a condition characterized by hallucinations or delusions.

In Texas, an insanity defense is rarely used and seldom successful.

Lyon testified that Haskell physically abused her and their children. She eventually took them and moved to Texas from Utah to be with her family after the couple divorced.

Prosecutors claimed Haskell faked symptoms of mental illness and had carefully planned the killings, disguising himself as a FedEx delivery driver to gain entry into the Stay family's home.

“We are grateful for the jurors’ rapt attention over the last many weeks to every piece of evidence in the case,” Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg said in a statement. “There was never a reasonable doubt that Haskell meticulously planned and carried out the slaughter of the Stay family.”

Jurors deliberated for eight hours over two days before coming to a verdict. The trial's penalty phase is scheduled to begin Monday. Prosecutors are asking for the death penalty.

Let’s start with the precondition that we don’t care whether you think the investigation into President Trump’s efforts to get the Ukrainian government to prosecute his political rivals is “THE GREATEST SCAM IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS!” grounds for immediate impeachment or something in between.



We care in the sense that we’re sure that you are sincere in your beliefs and we acknowledge your God-given right to feel and think the way you do. What we mean is that in order to discern what might happen next, such feelings are hindrances. It’s hard to clearly consider such outcomes when you think in terms of your own beliefs.

The rightness or wrongness of a president’s actions are all but immaterial in these matters. Whether the supporters or detractors of the aforementioned men were correct or not was of no consequence.

Now, that’s not to say that the passionate partisan bawling that we’re all now being subjected to won’t have an effect on what eventually does happen.



Studies suggest that home field advantage in sports is not only real but quite possibly the result of referees showing favoritism because of “the social atmosphere in the stadium.” The same is true with allegations of presidential misconduct.



We’ve said it many times before, but it bears repeating: Impeachment is a political proposition, not a legal one. And the referees here are the undecided or persuadable voters not yet sure what to make of what’s happening.



But even if you want to be part of working the refs – screaming into the orc-filled chasms of Twitter or annoying friends and loved ones with forwarded emails and Facebook posts – you probably still want to be able to think clearly about where it goes from here.



And that’s what we intend to help you do in the days ahead. You have plenty of other options for getting the latest details on what this unnamed source said or what that hearing may or may not have revealed. We’re going to stay focused on the political repercussions because that’s our job.



For the sake of everybody who is going to be out there fighting passionately for their side, whatever it is, we’ll do our best to not pick one.

TIME OUT: ONCE UPON A TIME…

NatGeo: “The brothers Grimm published what would become one of the most influential and famous collections of folklore in the world. Children’s and Household Tales (Kinder und Hausmärchen), later titled Grimm’s Fairy Tales, are childhood-defining stories. The Grimms, however, had curated the collection as an academic anthology for scholars of German culture, not as a collection of bedtime stories for young readers. Amid the political and social turbulence of the Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815), as France conquered Germanic lands, Jacob and Wilhelm were driven by nationalism to highlight their homeland and heritage. They were inspired by German Romantic authors and philosophers who believed that the purest forms of culture, those that bonded a community, could be found in stories shared from generation to generation. Storytelling expressed the essence of German culture and recalled the spirit and basic values of its people. By excavating Germany’s oral traditions, the brothers urgently sought to ‘preserve them from vanishing . . . to be forever silent in the tumult of our times.’”

I’LL TELL YOU WHAT: NOT SO IMPREACHYKEENMENT

This week Dana Perino and Chris Stirewalt discuss President Trump’s phone call with the Ukrainian president, how impeachment proceedings could affect the 2020 presidential race and Dana starts the countdown until Christmas. Plus, Chris answers trivia. LISTEN AND SUBSCRIBE HERE



WARREN SLIPS AND SWIPES BIDEN ON ETHICS

Fox News: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren spotlighted her longstanding calls for the impeachment of President Trump at a campaign event on Wednesday, emphasizing, ‘I hope we do this and I hope we do this quickly.’ But, she also appeared to unintentionally swipe at a rival Democrat vying for the White House – former Vice President Joe Biden – over his family’s role in the Ukraine controversy that led the House of Representatives to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump. Taking questions from reporters following a town hall event in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire, the Massachusetts Democrat was asked if she would allow her vice president’s child to serve on the board of a foreign company if she were president. Warren quickly answered, ‘no.’ When asked why, she said, in a rare moment where she appeared flustered: ‘I don’t know. I have to go back and look at the details.’”



More family woes for Biden - Politico: “Joe Biden’s brother told executives at a healthcare firm that the former vice president’s cancer initiative would promote their business, according to a participant in the conversation, who said the promise came as part of a pitch on behalf of potential investors in the firm. The allegation is the latest of many times Biden’s relatives have invoked the former vice president and his political clout to further their private business dealings. It is the first that involves the Biden Cancer Initiative, a project Joe Biden made the centerpiece of his post-White House life following the death of his son Beau. Biden’s brother, James, made the promise to executives at Florida-based Integrate Oral Care during a phone call on or around November 8, 2018, according to Michael Frey, CEO of Diverse Medical Management, a health-care firm that is suing James Biden. At the time, James Biden’s business partners were pursuing a potential investment in Integrate, according to Frey and court records.”



Sanders gives supporters the stage in Iowa - Des Moines Register: “As a Democratic candidate for president, [Bernie] Sanders frequently pushes his policies pugnaciously, framing them as moral imperatives as much as practical matters. But in his recent four-day swing through Iowa, he balanced his high-volume sermons with stories from his supporters. … Respondents who watched the September televised debate, where Sanders — who approached the debate stage with his typical fervor, but with a hoarse rasp — were more likely to have an unfavorable view of him. The debate-stage Sanders, whose style is described by some, including one of his 2020 rivals, as ""yelling"", was less present in his late September Iowa swing, Instead, Sanders often gave up the microphone to let others speak. … At his Iowa events, some of the personal stories are arranged in advance. But others are organic — hearing the stories of others inspires Sanders supporters to tell their own.”



Biden leads the pack in Maryland - Goucher College: “The Goucher College Poll asked Maryland Democratic likely voters who they are currently planning to vote for in the Maryland Democratic presidential primary… Thirty-three percent of Maryland Democratic likely voters say they will vote for Joe Biden and 21 percent for Elizabeth Warren. Ten percent would vote for Bernie Sanders, 6 percent for Kamala Harris, and 5 percent for Pete Buttigieg. All other candidates earn support from 1 percent or fewer of voters. Fifteen percent have no preference or are undecided. …Mileah Kromer, director of the Sarah T. Hughes Field Politics Center at Goucher College [said,] ‘Democrats in Maryland are divided over whether they want a more moderate or progressive nominee and whether nominating a candidate who can defeat Trump or match their policy preferences is their top priority.’”



ISSA TO CHALLENGE DUNCAN HUNTER

NYT: “Darrell Issa, the former nine-term congressman from California, will try to return to Congress by challenging Representative Duncan Hunter, who was indicted last year, setting up a clash among two Trump allies for one of Republicans’ most endangered seats. Mr. Issa is expected to announce his challenge at a news conference on Thursday morning in the San Diego County district, according to two sources familiar with his decision. He had been publicly mulling for months whether to make a bid to return to Congress, and started an exploratory committee in August. ‘I have received such a tremendous outpouring of encouragement from supporters inside the district, and around the state and across the nation,’ Mr. Issa said in August in a statement posted to the committee’s website. Mr. Issa will likely bill himself to Republicans as a safer alternative than the incumbent.”



Michigan announces new automatic voter registration - MLive: “Michigan took a leap forward into the modern era by announcing new voter registration policies on National Voter Registration Day. Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson announced [Tuesday] that automatic voter registration has officially launched in Michigan and online voter registration will be available following the November 2019 election. “Making voter registration automatic for eligible citizens means more Michigan residents will have access to participating in our democracy,” Benson said in a release. … Michigan joins 17 other states and the District of Columbia in enacting automatic voter registration.”

*AHEM* THEY GOT TRASHED

News24: “A South Korean mayor who dumped a ton of trash on a clean beach to give environmental campaigners something to pick up has said sorry for his deception. Officials trucked in litter and waste that had already been collected from rubbish-strewn coasts, and scattered it all over the pristine sand of southwest Jindo. The following day hundreds of volunteers scoured the shores and bagged up the garbage as part of an event to mark International Coastal Cleanup Day, a global event aimed at countering the scourge of sea-borne waste. ‘We brought in waste styrofoam and other coastal trash gathered from nearby areas so the 600 participants could carry out clean-up activities,’ said Lee Dong-jin, Jindo county mayor, in a statement. His office apologised for causing trouble and said the event was meant to ‘raise awareness about the seriousness of coastal waste.’”

On the roster: Dems look to streamline impeachment probe - Team Trump leans on Mueller moves - Joe = Jeb? Biden benefactors ready to mobilize mega PAC - A little on the nose, don’t you think?



DEMS LOOK TO STREAMLINE IMPEACHMENT PROBE

WaPo: “House Democratic leaders are eyeing a fast-paced investigation into the possible impeachment of President Trump, instructing the committees handling the probe to wrap up their findings within weeks in hopes of concluding before the holiday season. Multiple Democratic lawmakers and congressional aides said there is no formal timeline for the inquiry, but the ‘need for speed,’ as one aide put it, comes as Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is under pressure from vulnerable freshmen to keep the investigation narrowly focused and disciplined. The emerging strategy of a rapid investigation focused mainly on the accusation that Trump urged Ukraine’s president to dig up dirt about a political rival comes as lawmakers prepare to leave Washington for a two-week recess. … Pelosi and other leaders huddled in a basement conference room Thursday evening with more than a dozen ‘front-liner’ members representing the toughest districts for incumbent Democrats to discuss the fledgling probe and, in the words of multiple attendees, ‘get on the same page.’”



Tim Alberta: Will impeachment shatter a badly broken Congress? - Politico: “On Monday, [Rep. Abigail Spanberger] joined with six like-minded freshman colleagues in penning a Washington Post op-ed calling for an impeachment inquiry—stunning the Democratic caucus and effectively forcing Pelosi’s hand. It would be the unlikeliest bunch of members, legislative pacifists who had labored not to be defined by opposition to Trump, leading Congress into an era-defining clash. How the impeachment proceedings affect an increasingly polarized nation is anyone’s guess. But it’s hard to imagine the coming showdown doing any more damage to an institution that, lawmakers in both parties will agree, was broken long before Donald Trump came to town.”



Snap poll shows impeachment supporters outnumber opponents - PBS: “Americans are split over whether they support an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, according to the latest poll from the PBS NewsHour, NPR and Marist. Forty-nine percent of U.S. adults said they supported the House of Representatives launching an impeachment inquiry into the president, while 46 percent of Americans said they disapproved, and 5 percent remained unsure, according to the poll. … Eighty-eight percent of Democrats agreed with the inquiry, along with 44 percent of independent voters, but among Republicans, support was drastically lower, at 6 percent. … This latest poll was conducted the day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for the House of Representatives to begin an impeachment inquiry…”



Kraushaar: Politics of impeachment now favor Democrats - National Journal: “The politics of impeachment is changing, rapidly. No one knows how this will end, but all signs are pointing to growing trouble for Republicans. The whistleblower’s well-documented allegation that Trump extorted Ukraine, an ally, for political gain is damning and direct. House Democrats are narrowly focused on digging deeper into the explosive evidence as the basis for impeachment. Administration officials connected to the alleged cover-up will be subpoenaed under oath before Congress as part of the impeachment hearings. If the White House thinks things will get better for them, they’re fooling themselves. … The larger reality is that public opinion is more fluid than anyone expected last week. Many anti-Trump pundits, expecting a repeat of our predictable tribal political realities, assumed that nothing has changed. But our politics has become so partisan that even rapid short-term movement suggests something is happening.”



Andrew Cuomo mocks ‘leftist,’ ‘unproductive’ impeachment effort - New York Daily News: “Gov. Andrew Cuomo criticized ‘leftist’ Democrats for pushing Congress into launching an impeachment inquiry of President Trump and predicted the probe would lead to government gridlock. The governor derided the ‘quote unquote inquiry’ as the work of angry radicals who forced the hand of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to mount what he suggested would ultimately be an exercise in futility. ‘There is a heightened leftist component of the Democratic Party that she was feeling pressure from,’ Cuomo said. The governor ticked off a list of legislative priorities that would likely languish until after the 2020 elections now that he said Democrats will be focused on removing Trump from power. ‘It’s a long and unproductive road,’ Cuomo said. ‘Where does it go ultimately? Nowhere.’”



TEAM TRUMP LEANS ON MUELLER MOVES

AP: “The White House is dusting off its playbook from the special counsel’s Russia investigation. Caught off guard by the speed at which a whistleblower’s claims have morphed into an impeachment inquiry, President Donald Trump and his team are scrambling to respond. They’re turning, at least for now, to some of the same strategies they used to counter special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. The basic tactics deployed by the short-staffed White House: Attempt to discredit government officials at the heart of the story. Dispatch Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and other allies to muddy the picture. Lean on Republicans in Congress to provide cover.”



Amy Walter: Impeachment won’t change the game - Cook Political Report: “We are a deeply divided, deeply polarized country. Almost everything we do — from choosing where to eat lunch (Chick-fil-A vs. Whole Foods), to picking where to live (urban/suburban vs. rural/small town) is filtered through the lens of how we identify politically. As such, we shouldn't expect views of impeachment to be any different. Opinions won't swing wildly from day to day or week to week. We also shouldn't expect to see Americans overwhelming support or overwhelmingly oppose impeachment. Like everything in this era, the final verdict on impeachment is likely to be decided on the margins by voters who are holding conflicting views on the president and the process of impeachment. It will be decided by those who may dislike Trump, but are also frustrated by the paralysis in Washington, or those who may like the agenda of the president, but are troubled by his behavior.”



Romney’s narrow road - NYT: “Mr. [Mitt] Romney’s public statements reflect what many in his party believe privately but are almost uniformly unwilling to say: that they are faced with damning revelations about the president that are difficult to explain away, and are unsure of whether there is more damaging material to come. What’s more, they are contending with a leader whose appetite for political payback for real or imagined slights is insatiable, and who is responding to the crisis with angry new threats and accusations that will only increase the pressure on them to choose a side. It amounts to an unenviable dilemma for Republicans at a consequential moment for the party. Any internal fractures over the next year could undermine both Mr. Trump’s re-election and Republican hopes for retaining their Senate majority and retaking the House.”



First GOP governors come out in support of impeachment inquiry - WaPo: “For the first time, two Republican governors have publicly supported the impeachment inquiry of President Trump, a new development in an intensifying political fracas that has so far been largely partisan. Vermont Gov. Phil Scott and Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, both outspoken critics of Trump from the Northeast, said Thursday they favored the investigation, but Scott added that he would wait for more information before calling for further action against the president.”

TIME OUT: MAN, HOLES

USA Today: “NASA has given us another historic glimpse into the wonders of space after releasing a video that shows a star-shredding black hole in a galaxy millions of light-years away. The amazing footage of the ‘cataclysmic phenomenon’ was taken by NASA’s planet-hunting Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS. Astronomers think the supermassive black hole weighs around 6 million times the sun’s mass and is located about 375 million light-years away in a galaxy of similar size to the Milky Way, NASA said. The incredible event, called a tidal disruption, is very rare and occurs once every 10,000 to 100,000 years in galaxies like the Milky Way. When a star gets too close, the intense tides of a black hole break apart the star into a stream of gas, according to NASA. As shown in the video, the tail of that stream breaks away from the black hole while other parts of it swing back around and create a halo of debris.”

JOE = JEB? BIDEN BENEFACTORS READY TO MOBILIZE MEGA PAC

NYT: “Allies of Joseph R. Biden Jr., concerned about his slipping poll numbers in the Democratic presidential primary and an onslaught of attacks from President Trump, are weighing whether to mobilize a super PAC supporting Mr. Biden and have held conversations with wealthy donors to gauge their interest in contributing money. Mr. Biden and his campaign aides have said since the start of the race that they would not welcome an outside spending effort on his behalf, and every other major Democratic candidate has sworn off super PACs for the duration of the primary. A spokesman for Mr. Biden on Thursday reiterated that he opposed super PACs and would reject any such group that attempted to support him. Yet several former staffers of Mr. Biden and political donors backing his candidacy have held conversations in recent weeks about moving ahead with a super PAC, and said Mr. Trump’s furious, and often unsubstantiated, allegations about the former vice president had convinced them it was imperative they act.”



Under fire, Biden looks to scamper left - WaPo: “Advisers to presidential candidate Joe Biden are weighing the introduction of a new tax on Wall Street, according to people familiar with the discussions, as the former vice president now stands alone among the Democratic presidential front-runners in not backing a multitrillion-dollar ‘wealth tax’ on the richest Americans. The plan under consideration from Biden’s advisers could tax financial transactions such as the sale of stocks and bonds, one of the people said. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Biden, under pressure throughout the presidential campaign to move left on a range of policy issues, has embraced several ideas to increase taxes on the rich and on corporations but so far has not gone as far as his two main rivals. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have each unveiled their own plans to impose a ‘wealth tax’ on multimillionaires and billionaires, with both also calling for significant new taxes on corporations and wealthy estates. Sanders unveiled his wealth tax earlier this week.”



Wall Street Democratic donors lay down the law on Warren - CNBC: “Democratic donors on Wall Street and in big business are preparing to sit out the presidential campaign fundraising cycle — or even back President Donald Trump — if Sen. Elizabeth Warren wins the party’s nomination. In recent weeks, CNBC spoke to several high-dollar Democratic donors and fundraisers in the business community and found that this opinion was becoming widely shared as Warren, an outspoken critic of big banks and corporations, gains momentum against Joe Biden in the 2020 race. ‘You’re in a box because you’re a Democrat and you’re thinking, ‘I want to help the party, but she’s going to hurt me, so I’m going to help President Trump,’’ said a senior private equity executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity in fear of retribution by party leaders.”



A dozen candidates, one night for next Dem debate - Politico: “The Democratic National Committee intends to hold its fourth presidential primary debate on one night in October, packing the stage with as many as 12 qualified candidates. ‘To address several inquiries we have received we are writing to let you know that, pending a final decision after the certification deadline, it is the intention of the DNC and our media partners to hold the October debate over one night on Tuesday October 15th,’ the DNC wrote in an email to campaigns on Friday.”

A LITTLE ON THE NOSE, DON’T YOU THINK?

WABC: “Officials in New Jersey are looking into multiple complaints of a mystery odor that smells like rotten fish. The Hudson Regional Health Commission said they received two complaints in Jersey City and several complaints in Bayonne on Tuesday night. The HRHC confirmed a presence of an odor, but said the source could not be traced. Inspectors went into Newark - specifically to Raymound Boulevard and Doremus Avenue, because winds were coming from that direction. They were not successful in locating the origin. ‘It's not anything were used to around here. Being a peninsula, we have water on three sides and sometimes at low tide that you can smell the bay. It was really nothing like that. It was a very nasty, almost like a foul meat type of smell,’ OEM Coordinator Edoardo Ferrante said. The New Jersey DEP has been investigating the same odor since the beginning of summer.”

“But there is one area in which as a father I do feel a great weight of responsibility, a need to measure every word. It is not in the realm of character building, but in the realm of truth imparting.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on Feb. 23, 1990.

The Bedari Foundation, which was established by philanthropists Jennifer and Matthew C. Harris, gave $20 million to establish the UCLA Bedari Kindness Institute, which will support research on kindness, produce opportunities to translate the research into practices and have a chief goal of empowering citizens and leaders to build more humane societies.

“Universities should always be places where we teach students to reach across lines of difference and treat one another with empathy and respect — even when we deeply disagree,” UCLA Chancellor Gene Block said in a statement. “The UCLA Bedari Kindness Institute will bring the best thinking to this vital issue and, I think, will allow us to have a real social impact on future generations.”

The new institute will take an ""interdisciplinary approach"" to the top of kindness by examining it through evolutionary, biological, psychological, economic, cultural and sociological perspectives.

“Our vision is that we will all live in a world where humanity discovers and practices the kindness that exists in all of us,” said Matthew Harris, the foundation’s co-founder and a 1984 UCLA graduate, in a press statement. “Much research is needed to understand why kindness can be so scarce in the modern world. As we seek at Bedari to bridge the divide between science and spirituality, through the establishment of the UCLA Bedari Kindness Institute we hope to educate and empower more and more people in the practice of kindness.”

Darnell Hunt, dean of the UCLA division of social sciences, praised the foundation in a statement.

“In the midst of current world politics, violence and strife, the UCLA Bedari Kindness Institute seeks to be an antidote,” Hunt said. “Rooted in serious academic work, the institute will partner and share its research on kindness broadly in accessible formats. The Bedari Foundation’s extraordinary gift is truly visionary and we are grateful for its support and leadership.”

The Bedari Foundation is a private family foundation focused primarily on helping in the areas of health, wellness, environmental conservation and community displacement. The gift is part of the Centennial Campaign for UCLA.

Harris told MSNBC Thursday that “the New York bar association needs to investigate Giuliani and probably disbar him” over his communications with the Ukranian government on behalf of the Trump administration.

“We need to know if the personal lawyer of the president, Giuliani, was using government resources for political gain,” she said earlier in the day.

Giuliani laughed off Harris’ comments, telling Laura Ingraham while in Ukraine, he was “uncovering” an “enormous pay for play scheme” in the Obama administration.

“If Kamala Harris weren’t a phony, she’d be saying, ‘I’m shocked that a vice president of the United States sold out his office for $8 million,’” he said.

""What they're really trying to do is to intimidate me and to discredit me because I'm doing such an effective job of showing what phonies they are,"" he said of Democrats.

""We know that yards can equate to points; that's a fact,"" Saints coach Sean Payton asserted this week while discussing how special teams affect field position. ""If you believe 100 yards equals seven points — in and around that number — then that can directly impact winning and losing.""

The first full game New Orleans had to play this season without star quarterback Drew Brees — a 33-27 triumph in Seattle last Sunday — served as a reminder of how much can depend on the unit that plays by far the fewest snaps.

Morstead was named NFC special teams player of the week after a game in which he averaged a 52-yard net on six punts and had two punts downed inside the 5-yard line. If Morstead hadn't won that honor, it might well have gone to Harris for his 53-yard punt return touchdown.

""You just kind of go into every game feeling like you are going to be the difference in a positive way, but you just don't know how it's going to play out,"" Morstead said. ""It does feel nice at the end of a game, like that to feel like special teams as a whole made a difference in the game.""

Whether those phases of the game could again be a significant factor on Sunday night against Dallas remains to be seen, but Cowboys coach Jason Garrett has taken notice of the Saints' special teams' success.

""What you're trying to do on special teams is do something that can change the game,"" Garrett said. ""Hopefully, you can tip the field, tip the balance of the game and they've been able to do that up to this point and those are the kind of plays that make a huge difference.""

When the Saints' offense has been at its most prolific, it might have been easy to overlook the kicking game's role, particularly in numerous lopsided victories in which New Orleans punted few times.

But if a game is close, or if the offense is sputtering, then good punting — and good punt returns — are at a premium. And it's not clear if the Saints can replicate the offensive production they've historically enjoyed with Brees while another quarterback is under center.

The Saints used two quarterbacks last week in Seattle. Teddy Bridgewater was the starter and played the vast majority of the offensive snaps. Taysom Hill subbed in as a read-option run threat; he either handed off or ran himself. The Saints gained 265 yards on offense, barely more than half of the Seahawks' 514 yards. New Orleans still won in large part because of special teams play, along with a defensive touchdown on a fumble return.

Hill, who also serves as an up-back on punts, said being able to play on special teams with the Saints has helped him appreciate how much that unit can influence games, be it with blocked punts, fake punts, returns or simply good punts.

""It's all about, in the NFL, winning the field position battle. We talk about it week in and week out,"" Hill said. ""The punt is the biggest contributor to that, and the punt return. And we saw how that affected the game last week.""

Now in his 11th season out of SMU, Morstead has established himself as one of the elite punters in the NFL. He can send booming spirals far down field with accuracy toward one sideline or the other. He can also chip end-over-end, Australian Rules Football-style punts that seem to stick inside the 10-yard line without going into the end zone for a touchback.

""Thomas makes our job really easy,"" Hill said. ""When you pin a team or returner, right or left, outside the numbers, it's really difficult for those guys to get a return.""

Morstead, meanwhile, has enjoyed seeing how Harris, a rookie out of Division II Assumption College, has burst onto the scene as a potent return man.

""He's obviously very talented. Everybody can see that,"" Morstead said. ""He doesn't lack any confidence.""

Harris did, however, commit his first major mistake in Seattle when he muffed a punt. The Seahawks recovered, but failed to capitalize when Saints made a fourth-down stop.

Morstead said he told Harris: ""Don't lose your stinger. Keep being aggressive how you've been. You just can't get ahead of yourself.""

After all, the Saints might need a few more good returns while their offense adjusts to life without Brees."

The debate is being hosted by CNN and The New York Times.

In an article published this week, Esquire's literary editor, Amy Grace Lloyd, suggested the Trump administration has purged people like the totalitarian regime in ""The Handmaid's Tale.""

""Different. For the moment you and I are not in danger of getting arrested by the NKVD,"" said Atwood, referring to the Soviet police force that carried out mass arrests and executions under dictator Josef Stalin.

""You think Gilead is bad or that the TV series is too violent? Look up the NKVD,"" Atwood added. ""It’s important to have that perspective. People are saying Trump is re-creating Gilead. That’s not true. If it were, we’d not be having this conversation. He’s not even a particularly Gileadean figure, more like a [Babylonian king] Nebuchadnezzar of the right. That guy went mad.""

ELISABETH MOSS SAYS IT'S 'APT' TO COMPARE ANTI-ABORTION LAWS TO 'HANDMAID'S TALE'S' DYSTOPIAN SOCIETY

When Lloyd responded by complaining about ""divisiveness being promoted"" in the U.S., Atwood told her to ""suck it up!""

""Why are you so afraid?"" Atwood asked. ""No one is going to kill you right now. Anybody banging down your door? What you should be doing is figuring out who to vote for in the next election. Which candidate is going to take you the farthest he or she can from Gilead? Panic isn’t helpful.""

Since the Hulu show based on Atwood's novel premiered in April 2017, liberals have repeatedly compared Republicans and their policies to those of the villains in the story. At the 2018 White House Correspondents' Dinner, for example, comedienne Michelle Wolf compared then-White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to Aunt Lydia, the brutal overseer of Gilead's female captives. A CNN documentary similarly drew comparisons to Atwood's story -- as did Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., when she spoke out against Alabama's restrictive abortion law.

Hyten's former aide, Army Col. Kathryn Spletstoser, accused the general of assaulting her in a California hotel room in 2017. She said Hyten kissed, hugged and rubbed up against her while she pushed him away and told him to stop, and that he tried to derail her military career after she rebuffed him.

The Senate confirmed Hyten by a 75-22 vote, indicating a bit more opposition than most military nominations, which often get near-unanimous Senate support. The only Republican to vote ""no"" was Joni Ernst of Iowa, a survivor of sexual assault while in college and former reserve officer.

""It has been a painful time for me and my family, but I want to state to you and the American people in the strongest possible terms that these allegations are false,"" Hyten said during a committee hearing in July. ""Nothing happened, ever.""

A separate Air Force investigation found no evidence to support the accusations. Officials told Fox News Spletstoser had leveled various accusations against at least a dozen other military officers in recent years, none of which were substantiated. Spletstoser has said she never made any sexual assault allegations against anyone else.

Spletstoser said she believes Hyten's confirmation proves the military is still unequipped to handle sexual assault cases. ""The process for seeking justice has been a sham; I have not had the opportunity to tell my story publicly and have been subject to a rushed and incomplete inquiry overseen by an officer junior in rank to General Hyten. I received a military protective order - the equivalent of a civilian restraining order - against General Hyten in May after he exhibited threatening behavior, including stalking,"" she said in a statement.

Officials said Spletstoser had been fired from her job under Hyten’s command running the U.S. military’s nuclear arsenal a few months after the alleged incident occurred for creating a “toxic” work environment and “bullying” subordinates while displaying a “volcanic temper.”

POMPEO ACCUSES SYRIA OF USING CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN MAY ATTACK

It was Spletstoser’s behavior under Hyten that led Ernst to question Hyten’s nomination during the hearings.

“There are professional responsibilities associated with being such a high ranking leader and that is to make sure that those within your command are following your directive and not engaging in toxic leadership,"" she said. ""So this leaves me with concerns about your judgment and ability to lead in one of the highest positions in the U.S. military.""

However, another Colonel who served under Spletstoser's command in Korea from 2011-2013 spoke highly of her moral character. ""Kathy was an awesome commander and an officer that you could depend on in good or bad times,"" said Col. Loi M. Nguyen. ""If she were to lead us into combat in the future, I would be happy to serve with her because of her competency, candidness, and high moral character,"" he added.

Others voting ""no"" Thursday included two Democratic presidential candidates Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who has made military sexual misconduct one of her top issues in the Senate; and Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, an Iraq War veteran who lost her legs when her helicopter was shot down.

But Hyten received support from Sen. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., a former fighter pilot who has publicly described her own sexual assault that she says occurred while she was in the military.

""To be clear, this wasn’t just a jump ball. Not a he-said, she-said,"" McSally told the Senate Armed Services Committee in July. ""Not a situation where we just couldn’t prove what allegedly happened. I believe the truth still matters in our country. And the full truth was revealed in this process.

The truth is that General Hyten is innocent of these charges,"" McSally went on. ""Sexual assault happens in the military. It just didn’t happen in this case.

""Today's Senate confirmation of Gen John Hyten to be the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is good news for our military and good news for our nation,"" said Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David F. Goldfein. ""John Hyten is the leader, strategist, and above all an individual with the character and values to lead our men and women in uniform well.""

Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, congratulated Hyten, calling him a “visionary leader with an unparalleled strategic perspective.” Dunford is retiring next Monday after four years on the job, so Hyten will be serving under Army Gen. Mark Milley.

Hyten has served in the Air Force for nearly four decades and most recently headed U.S. Strategic Command, which controls America's nuclear force. He also led Air Force Space Command and served as mission director at Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado, the military's iconic defense bunker during the Cold War.

WaPo: “House Democratic leaders are eyeing a fast-paced investigation into the possible impeachment of President Trump, instructing the committees handling the probe to wrap up their findings within weeks in hopes of concluding before the holiday season. Multiple Democratic lawmakers and congressional aides said there is no formal timeline for the inquiry, but the ‘need for speed,’ as one aide put it, comes as Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is under pressure from vulnerable freshmen to keep the investigation narrowly focused and disciplined. The emerging strategy of a rapid investigation focused mainly on the accusation that Trump urged Ukraine’s president to dig up dirt about a political rival comes as lawmakers prepare to leave Washington for a two-week recess. … Pelosi and other leaders huddled in a basement conference room Thursday evening with more than a dozen ‘front-liner’ members representing the toughest districts for incumbent Democrats to discuss the fledgling probe and, in the words of multiple attendees, ‘get on the same page.’”



Tim Alberta: Will impeachment shatter a badly broken Congress? - Politico: “On Monday, [Rep. Abigail Spanberger] joined with six like-minded freshman colleagues in penning a Washington Post op-ed calling for an impeachment inquiry—stunning the Democratic caucus and effectively forcing Pelosi’s hand. It would be the unlikeliest bunch of members, legislative pacifists who had labored not to be defined by opposition to Trump, leading Congress into an era-defining clash. How the impeachment proceedings affect an increasingly polarized nation is anyone’s guess. But it’s hard to imagine the coming showdown doing any more damage to an institution that, lawmakers in both parties will agree, was broken long before Donald Trump came to town.”



Snap poll shows impeachment supporters outnumber opponents - PBS: “Americans are split over whether they support an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, according to the latest poll from the PBS NewsHour, NPR and Marist. Forty-nine percent of U.S. adults said they supported the House of Representatives launching an impeachment inquiry into the president, while 46 percent of Americans said they disapproved, and 5 percent remained unsure, according to the poll. … Eighty-eight percent of Democrats agreed with the inquiry, along with 44 percent of independent voters, but among Republicans, support was drastically lower, at 6 percent. … This latest poll was conducted the day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for the House of Representatives to begin an impeachment inquiry…”



Kraushaar: Politics of impeachment now favor Democrats - National Journal: “The politics of impeachment is changing, rapidly. No one knows how this will end, but all signs are pointing to growing trouble for Republicans. The whistleblower’s well-documented allegation that Trump extorted Ukraine, an ally, for political gain is damning and direct. House Democrats are narrowly focused on digging deeper into the explosive evidence as the basis for impeachment. Administration officials connected to the alleged cover-up will be subpoenaed under oath before Congress as part of the impeachment hearings. If the White House thinks things will get better for them, they’re fooling themselves. … The larger reality is that public opinion is more fluid than anyone expected last week. Many anti-Trump pundits, expecting a repeat of our predictable tribal political realities, assumed that nothing has changed. But our politics has become so partisan that even rapid short-term movement suggests something is happening.”



Andrew Cuomo mocks ‘leftist,’ ‘unproductive’ impeachment effort - New York Daily News: “Gov. Andrew Cuomo criticized ‘leftist’ Democrats for pushing Congress into launching an impeachment inquiry of President Trump and predicted the probe would lead to government gridlock. The governor derided the ‘quote unquote inquiry’ as the work of angry radicals who forced the hand of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to mount what he suggested would ultimately be an exercise in futility. ‘There is a heightened leftist component of the Democratic Party that she was feeling pressure from,’ Cuomo said. The governor ticked off a list of legislative priorities that would likely languish until after the 2020 elections now that he said Democrats will be focused on removing Trump from power. ‘It’s a long and unproductive road,’ Cuomo said. ‘Where does it go ultimately? Nowhere.’”



TEAM TRUMP LEANS ON MUELLER MOVES

AP: “The White House is dusting off its playbook from the special counsel’s Russia investigation. Caught off guard by the speed at which a whistleblower’s claims have morphed into an impeachment inquiry, President Donald Trump and his team are scrambling to respond. They’re turning, at least for now, to some of the same strategies they used to counter special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. The basic tactics deployed by the short-staffed White House: Attempt to discredit government officials at the heart of the story. Dispatch Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and other allies to muddy the picture. Lean on Republicans in Congress to provide cover.”



Amy Walter: Impeachment won’t change the game - Cook Political Report: “We are a deeply divided, deeply polarized country. Almost everything we do — from choosing where to eat lunch (Chick-fil-A vs. Whole Foods), to picking where to live (urban/suburban vs. rural/small town) is filtered through the lens of how we identify politically. As such, we shouldn't expect views of impeachment to be any different. Opinions won't swing wildly from day to day or week to week. We also shouldn't expect to see Americans overwhelming support or overwhelmingly oppose impeachment. Like everything in this era, the final verdict on impeachment is likely to be decided on the margins by voters who are holding conflicting views on the president and the process of impeachment. It will be decided by those who may dislike Trump, but are also frustrated by the paralysis in Washington, or those who may like the agenda of the president, but are troubled by his behavior.”



Romney’s narrow road - NYT: “Mr. [Mitt] Romney’s public statements reflect what many in his party believe privately but are almost uniformly unwilling to say: that they are faced with damning revelations about the president that are difficult to explain away, and are unsure of whether there is more damaging material to come. What’s more, they are contending with a leader whose appetite for political payback for real or imagined slights is insatiable, and who is responding to the crisis with angry new threats and accusations that will only increase the pressure on them to choose a side. It amounts to an unenviable dilemma for Republicans at a consequential moment for the party. Any internal fractures over the next year could undermine both Mr. Trump’s re-election and Republican hopes for retaining their Senate majority and retaking the House.”



First GOP governors come out in support of impeachment inquiry - WaPo: “For the first time, two Republican governors have publicly supported the impeachment inquiry of President Trump, a new development in an intensifying political fracas that has so far been largely partisan. Vermont Gov. Phil Scott and Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, both outspoken critics of Trump from the Northeast, said Thursday they favored the investigation, but Scott added that he would wait for more information before calling for further action against the president.”

TIME OUT: MAN, HOLES

USA Today: “NASA has given us another historic glimpse into the wonders of space after releasing a video that shows a star-shredding black hole in a galaxy millions of light-years away. The amazing footage of the ‘cataclysmic phenomenon’ was taken by NASA’s planet-hunting Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS. Astronomers think the supermassive black hole weighs around 6 million times the sun’s mass and is located about 375 million light-years away in a galaxy of similar size to the Milky Way, NASA said. The incredible event, called a tidal disruption, is very rare and occurs once every 10,000 to 100,000 years in galaxies like the Milky Way. When a star gets too close, the intense tides of a black hole break apart the star into a stream of gas, according to NASA. As shown in the video, the tail of that stream breaks away from the black hole while other parts of it swing back around and create a halo of debris.”

JOE = JEB? BIDEN BENEFACTORS READY TO MOBILIZE MEGA PAC

NYT: “Allies of Joseph R. Biden Jr., concerned about his slipping poll numbers in the Democratic presidential primary and an onslaught of attacks from President Trump, are weighing whether to mobilize a super PAC supporting Mr. Biden and have held conversations with wealthy donors to gauge their interest in contributing money. Mr. Biden and his campaign aides have said since the start of the race that they would not welcome an outside spending effort on his behalf, and every other major Democratic candidate has sworn off super PACs for the duration of the primary. A spokesman for Mr. Biden on Thursday reiterated that he opposed super PACs and would reject any such group that attempted to support him. Yet several former staffers of Mr. Biden and political donors backing his candidacy have held conversations in recent weeks about moving ahead with a super PAC, and said Mr. Trump’s furious, and often unsubstantiated, allegations about the former vice president had convinced them it was imperative they act.”



Under fire, Biden looks to scamper left - WaPo: “Advisers to presidential candidate Joe Biden are weighing the introduction of a new tax on Wall Street, according to people familiar with the discussions, as the former vice president now stands alone among the Democratic presidential front-runners in not backing a multitrillion-dollar ‘wealth tax’ on the richest Americans. The plan under consideration from Biden’s advisers could tax financial transactions such as the sale of stocks and bonds, one of the people said. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Biden, under pressure throughout the presidential campaign to move left on a range of policy issues, has embraced several ideas to increase taxes on the rich and on corporations but so far has not gone as far as his two main rivals. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have each unveiled their own plans to impose a ‘wealth tax’ on multimillionaires and billionaires, with both also calling for significant new taxes on corporations and wealthy estates. Sanders unveiled his wealth tax earlier this week.”



Wall Street Democratic donors lay down the law on Warren - CNBC: “Democratic donors on Wall Street and in big business are preparing to sit out the presidential campaign fundraising cycle — or even back President Donald Trump — if Sen. Elizabeth Warren wins the party’s nomination. In recent weeks, CNBC spoke to several high-dollar Democratic donors and fundraisers in the business community and found that this opinion was becoming widely shared as Warren, an outspoken critic of big banks and corporations, gains momentum against Joe Biden in the 2020 race. ‘You’re in a box because you’re a Democrat and you’re thinking, ‘I want to help the party, but she’s going to hurt me, so I’m going to help President Trump,’’ said a senior private equity executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity in fear of retribution by party leaders.”



A dozen candidates, one night for next Dem debate - Politico: “The Democratic National Committee intends to hold its fourth presidential primary debate on one night in October, packing the stage with as many as 12 qualified candidates. ‘To address several inquiries we have received we are writing to let you know that, pending a final decision after the certification deadline, it is the intention of the DNC and our media partners to hold the October debate over one night on Tuesday October 15th,’ the DNC wrote in an email to campaigns on Friday.”

A LITTLE ON THE NOSE, DON’T YOU THINK?

WABC: “Officials in New Jersey are looking into multiple complaints of a mystery odor that smells like rotten fish. The Hudson Regional Health Commission said they received two complaints in Jersey City and several complaints in Bayonne on Tuesday night. The HRHC confirmed a presence of an odor, but said the source could not be traced. Inspectors went into Newark - specifically to Raymound Boulevard and Doremus Avenue, because winds were coming from that direction. They were not successful in locating the origin. ‘It's not anything were used to around here. Being a peninsula, we have water on three sides and sometimes at low tide that you can smell the bay. It was really nothing like that. It was a very nasty, almost like a foul meat type of smell,’ OEM Coordinator Edoardo Ferrante said. The New Jersey DEP has been investigating the same odor since the beginning of summer.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“But there is one area in which as a father I do feel a great weight of responsibility, a need to measure every word. It is not in the realm of character building, but in the realm of truth imparting.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on Feb. 23, 1990.

NYPD USES TECH TO GAUGE CITIZENS' SENSE OF SAFETY: IT'S A 'SHARED RESPONSIBILITY'

After a shootout and standoff in Philadelphia, several people near the scene in the Nicetown neighborhood taunted and laughed at the officers whose fellow officers had just been wounded.

NYPD officers have been doused with water, soaked with milk, pelted with Chinese takeout, cursed at and assaulted in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Harlem. NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill vowed recently that “These incidents of disrespect, we cannot tolerate them. There has to be consequences for them, and it has to stop.”

While hundreds of thousands protested climate change around the world and in Portland, Oregon, a faction of masked Antifa militants dressed in black harassed police officers.

As U.S. Attorney William McSwain of Pennsylvania’s Eastern District pointed out in a recent statement, we have a “new culture of disrespect for law enforcement.”

This breaks my heart. When a police officer or sheriff’s deputy approaches a car at night or knocks on a door for a welfare check or to serve a warrant, that officer or deputy hopes for the best and fears the worst. Their family is often left holding their breath until they return home after their shift is over.

And yet, it’s disturbing that three of the Democratic Party’s presidential candidates (Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Tom Steyer) still say that Ferguson, Missouri police officer Darren Wilson committed murder in shooting criminal suspect Michael Brown. Their position is completely at odds with the findings of the Department of Justice’s investigation of that incident.

Obama’s Justice Department, led by then-Attorney General Eric Holder, issued its own report, ruling it self-defense. This was despite that department’s repeated friction with local and state law enforcement throughout Obama’s presidency.

On the other side is President Trump, who has been an unwavering supporter of law enforcement. The motto of the Fraternal Order of Police is ""Jus, fidus, libertatum."" Translated, it means, ""Law is the safeguard of freedom."" President Trump has been steadfast in backing the blue and the Department of Justice under his leadership continues to fulfill his commitment to law enforcement.

Emtech, a 3-year-old colt, fell to the ground during the 8th race on the second day of Santa Anita’s fall meet.

“As is protocol at Santa Anita, we will open an immediate review into what factors could have contributed to Emtech’s injury,” said Dr. Dionne Benson, chief veterinarian for the Stronach Group. “Santa Anita will work closely with the California Horse Racing Board and will continue to brief our stakeholders and all of our constituents.""

Benson said the horse will undergo a necropsy, mandatory for on-track deaths.

Emtech was euthanized on the track behind a green screen.

The racing death was the first in Southern California since Truffalino died on June 9 at Santa Anita. There were also six training deaths over the summer, four at Del Mar and two at Santa Anita.

The latest Santa Anita training death was on Sept. 16.

The unusually high number of deaths has put the racetrack (and horse racing in general) under scrutiny and has prompted some to call for the track’s closure.

Emtech's jockey, two-time Kentucky Derby winner Mario Gutierrez, was thrown in the incident but uninjured.

I guess sometimes you gotta dig extra EXTRA deep for peace to continue to have faith. And I will because Michael ALWAYS had faith.”

Linda Vester, a former NBC correspondent and former Fox News anchor, alleged in 2018 that Brokaw made unwanted advances toward her twice in the 1990s, including a move to forcibly kiss Vester, who was in her 20s at the time.

She has since emerged as a champion of the #MeToo movement and repeatedly has questioned the way NBC and parent company Comcast handled the situation.

ROBERT DE NIRO’S FOUL-MOUTHED CNN APPEARANCE RAISES EYEBROWS: ‘WHAT DID OUR VIEWERS GAIN?’

Brokaw denied the allegations and had scores of female colleagues vouch for his character. NBC News Chairman Andrew Lack has addressed the allegations only briefly, and Brokaw remains at the scandal-plagued network.

Vester spoke to New York Media’s The Cut about whether or not coming forward was worth it -- and blasted Maddow in the process -- in a feature published Monday.

COMCAST RESPONDS TO LINDA VESTER'S CLAIM NBC NEWS HASN’T CHANGED SINCE LAUER'S FIRING; VESTER FIRES BACK

“I thought coming forward would be empowering and would help other women,” Vester told The Cut. “A short dredging up of old memories and then it would be over. I was wrong about all of that.”

Vester said Brokaw’s female colleagues rushing to his defense was “shocking” and essentially signaled, “if you come forward, other women will shame you.” More than 60 women, including some of NBC News’ biggest stars, signed a letter supporting Brokaw only two days after Vester first went public with her claims.

“Some people who I had worked with -- one of whom had called herself my mentor -- had signed that letter. I was also very disappointed in Rachel Maddow. I think NBC did a great disservice to its female employees by conducting what I consider a sham internal inquiry.” — Linda Vester

“Some people who I had worked with -- one of whom had called herself my mentor -- had signed that letter. I was also very disappointed in Rachel Maddow,” Vester said. “I think NBC did a great disservice to its female employees by conducting what I consider a sham internal inquiry.”

Vester then said she thought women in power at NBC News “like Savannah Guthrie and Mika Brzezinski and Rachel Maddow” should call for a proper investigation.

“It’s one thing for them to be marketed as female power and all for the sisterhood. But they’re not using their megaphone to make women truly safe,” Vester said.

NBC News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

NBC WON'T LAUNCH FULL INVESTIGATION INTO TOM BROKAW ALLEGATIONS

“It’s one thing for them to be marketed as female power and all for the sisterhood. But they’re not using their megaphone to make women truly safe."" — Linda Vester

When reached for additional comment, Vester told Fox News, through her attorney, that she tried to arrange an appearance on “The Rachel Maddow Show” shortly after the MSNBC host signed the letter but never received a response.

MSNBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Back in April 2018, The New York Post reported that NBC declined to launch a full internal investigation into the claims made against Brokaw.

“She’s given her side, and he’s responded. They don’t feel there’s anything left to investigate in the case,’’ an NBC source told the Post. “We may make further inquiries if more information emerges.”

Lack sent a memo to staffers noting that NBC took similar allegations “very seriously,” pointing to the ousting of former “Today’’ host Matt Lauer as proof, the Post reported.

However, NBC News kept its review of Lauer’s misconduct in-house, as opposed to enlisting a white-shoe law firm -- which is typically standard when dealing with sex harassment. Despite calls for an independent investigator, the Lauer review was headed by NBCUniversal General Counsel Kim Harris. It eventually found that NBC News management was oblivious to Lauer’s behavior.

Lack also oversaw NBC News when it famously refused to air Farrow’s reporting on sexual harassment from now-disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein. Farrow took his work to the prestigious New Yorker, where it won a Pulitzer Prize and helped launch the #MeToo movement.

Farrow is expected to tell his side of the story in an upcoming book, “Catch and Kill.”

On the roster: Dems try to stay on offense - Thornberry out as Texodus continues - Booker beats his benchmark - Don’t get sideways with this bear



DEMS TRY TO STAY ON OFFENSE

Politico: “House Democrats are plotting an all-out offensive against President Donald Trump as they pursue an impeachment inquiry, announcing plans on Sunday to streamline their messaging operation and aid vulnerable lawmakers as they face potential blowback in their districts. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her top deputies laid out the strategy during a private conference call Sunday afternoon. The plan reflects a deepening sentiment among Democrats that Trump’s latest scandal involving Ukraine could persuade the public to support impeachment. But it also underscores longstanding concerns that an impeachment push could jeopardize some of the toss-up seats in 2020 that helped the party win the majority last year. … Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos, who leads House Democrats’ campaign arm, advised the caucus’ most vulnerable members to gauge support and test their message through polling in their respective districts…”



No recess from impeachment pressure for House Dems - NYT: “Orange County was the epicenter of the 2018 House Democratic takeover, where Republicans lost four seats in what was once the heart of Ronald Reagan conservatism in California. On Saturday night, as three of the victorious Democrats were honored at an annual political dinner, a new battle was on everyone’s minds: How to protect those gains in 2020 by selling voters on the impeachment inquiry of President Trump. At the dinner, Representative Harley Rouda warned Democrats not to ‘sit on our laurels.’ Representative Mike Levin solemnly said ‘the times have found us.’ And Representative Gil Cisneros, who came out for the inquiry only last week, plugged his campaign website twice to ask for donations and noted, ‘The Republicans are coming after me now.’ A tricky balancing act is now underway for House Democrats as they return to their districts for a two-week recess that will double as a crucial time to frame a coast-to-coast debate over impeachment and the nation’s priorities.”



Pergram: Meanwhile, back at the House - Fox News: “The House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees will continue to toil behind the scenes investigating and, eventually, crafting actual articles of impeachment. More on that in a moment. … The subpoenas are part of a two-pronged strategy by Democrats. Get the information to help tailor the articles of impeachment, or convert a refusal to comply into an impeachment article itself. House Democrats say the recess period is important to educate the public about the impeachment process and to gin up support for it.”



McConnell says ‘no choice’ but for Senate to take up impeachment - USA Today: “Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday the Senate would have ‘no choice’ but to hold a trial on whether to remove President Donald Trump from office if the House votes to put forward articles of impeachment. The Kentucky Republican told CNBC that the obligation to hold a trial is part of Senate rules and it would take a two-thirds vote of the chamber to change that. ‘I would have no choice but to take it up a based on a Senate rule on impeachment,’ McConnell said. … While the Constitution puts the responsibility of holding an impeachment trial in the hands of the Senate, there has been some speculation that McConnell might refuse to hold a trial.”



Biden wants a Giuliani ban - NYT: “Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s presidential campaign contacted top television anchors and networks on Sunday to ‘demand’ that Rudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, be kept off the air because of what they called his misleading comments about the Biden family and Ukraine. ‘We are writing today with grave concern that you continue to book Rudy Giuliani on your air to spread false, debunked conspiracy theories on behalf of Donald Trump,’ a pair of top Biden campaign advisers, Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield, wrote in the letter. ‘Giving Rudy Giuliani valuable time on your air to push these lies in the first place is a disservice to your audience and a disservice to journalism,’ the advisers wrote. The note, which was obtained by The New York Times, was sent to executives and top political anchors at ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox News and NBC, including star interviewers like Jake Tapper, Chuck Todd and Chris Wallace.”



Trump’s scorched earth attacks turn off some on his side - WaPo: “Sunday started with President Trump’s former homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, saying he was ‘deeply disturbed’ by the implications of his call to the Ukrainian president and ended with a GOP congressman, Adam Kinzinger, calling one of Trump’s tweets ‘beyond repugnant.’ While key Republicans have rallied to the president’s defense since House Democrats opened an impeachment inquiry last week, the bookends to the day underscore the riskiness of a scorched-earth defense strategy that is predicated on an insistence that Trump did absolutely nothing wrong. The president is running the smashmouth playbook he learned from Roy Cohn, his mentor and Joe McCarthy’s hatchet man. It’s worked repeatedly for Trump, from fighting the Justice Department’s investigation of racial discrimination at his family’s rental properties in the 1970s to overcoming Bob Mueller’s investigation the past two years.”



It's 1998 redux, but will the economy play along? - Politico: “The U.S. economy has sailed through a presidential impeachment before. In 1998, as the GOP-controlled House moved to impeach President Bill Clinton, the stock market soared and the economy grew nearly 5 percent. But economists and Wall Street analysts note that conditions are very different now as Democrats push toward a possible impeachment of President Donald Trump. During the Clinton impeachment, the dot com boom was making Americans exuberant about the economy. Today, the economy is slowing, consumer confidence is dipping and corporate America faces a gauntlet of worries including the trade war with China, the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement and slowing growth around the world. And now investors, consumers and corporate executives face the prospect of a Washington consumed for months by impeachment drama and the uncertain reactions of a volatile president with a penchant for lashing out under stress.”

TIME OUT: ‘JANUARY BELONGS TO KALE’

Atlantic: “January belongs to kale. This annual vegetable cycle shows up in the past decade of Google Trends data, which compiles how frequently Americans trawl the internet for information about certain terms. Since about 2011, when Gwyneth Paltrow taught the world how to make kale chips on the Ellen show, kale has entered into the cultural lexicon as a status symbol for a generation of young adults drawn to conspicuous health-consciousness. … But kale’s cultural ubiquity might not be exactly what it seems. After kale briefly overtook spinach as America’s favorite cooked green in mid-2014, Google’s measure of interest in kale has steadily declined. The green’s digital fortunes are currently back at about where they were in 2011… Search data aren’t the end-all-be-all measurement of popularity, but the more leads you follow, the more you begin to question the narrative of kale’s dominance. In fact, America might never have been that into kale in the first place.”

THORNBERRY OUT AS TEXODUS CONTINUES

Texas Tribune: “U.S. Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Clarendon, announced Monday that he will not seek reelection in 2020, making him the sixth GOP congressman from Texas to say he's retiring in recent weeks. ‘It has been a great honor for me to represent the people of the 13th District of Texas for the last 25 years,’ he said in a statement. ‘We are reminded, however, that ‘for everything there is a season,’ and I believe that the time has come for a change. Therefore, I will not be a candidate for reelection in the 2020 election.’ Thornberry joins five other Texas Republicans in Congress who are not running for reelection — U.S. Reps. Kenny Marchant, Pete Olson, Mike Conaway, Will Hurd and Bill Flores. But Thornberry's exit is somewhat different from other Republicans' shocking retirements over the summer. The last remaining Texan from the class of 1994 and the dean of the GOP delegation, Thornberry was expected by many to retire soon. He will turn over his post leading the Republican side of the House Armed Services Committee in January 2021, thanks to Republican term limits for committee chairmanships.”



BOOKER BEATS HIS BENCHMARK

Fox News: “Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker says he has reached his self-imposed fundraising goal to continue his White House bid. ‘I have some incredible news, friend. Last night at 8:16 p.m., we reached our goal of $1.7 million -- a full day ahead of the deadline we set for ourselves,’ the Democrat from New Jersey wrote in an email to supporters on Monday morning. ‘Thanks to this outpouring of support, we see a viable path forward to continue growing a winning campaign. I’m staying in this race -- and I’m in it to win,’ Booker said. … Top Booker advisers have warned that while the campaign can continue at its current size and strength, it needs more funding if it wants to expand and compete with the top-tier Democratic nomination rivals.”



The Bern has lost its glow - Politico: “With just four months until the first-in-the-nation caucuses, [Bernie] Sanders is in trouble. As he delivered his populist gospel to large crowds of camouflage-clad high schoolers, liberal arts college students, and trade union members across Iowa last week, a problematic narrative was hardening around him: His campaign is in disarray and Elizabeth Warren has eclipsed him as the progressive standard-bearer of the primary. He’s sunk to third place nationally, behind Warren and Joe Biden, and some polls of early nomination states show him barely clinging to double digits. He’s shaken up his staffs in Iowa and New Hampshire. He’s lost the endorsement of the Working Families Party, a left-wing group that backed him in 2016, to Warren. … Sanders is still a top-tier candidate, and many voters haven’t made up their minds yet. But time is starting to run short.”



Biden dials back digital ads - NYT: “Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s presidential campaign has sharply scaled back his online advertising, cutting spending so severely since August that he is now investing only a fraction of what his top rivals are on Facebook and Google, the two dominant internet platforms. In a race where many voters are following politics on their smartphones, Mr. Biden’s pullback is an unusual and potentially worrisome sign about his appeal among the Democratic activists, young people and donors who are especially engaged on social media. Candidates rarely withdraw so much money from their online campaigns unless they are seeing weak results in online fund-raising, according to interviews with digital strategists.”



Biden looks for Hispanic Caucus to break his way - Politico: “The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has largely stayed out of the presidential primary so far — partly out of respect for Julián Castro, the only Latino in the race and the brother of CHC Chairman Joaquin Castro. But with Julián languishing at the bottom of polls with around 1 percent support, at least a handful of the group’s 38 members are on the verge of announcing their support for Joe Biden, according to sources familiar with the effort. Their impact could provide an adrenaline boost in a Democratic contest where most campaigns are struggling to win over Hispanic voters — a bloc that will play a key role in early-state Nevada and on Super Tuesday. … Biden and California Sen. Kamala Harris currently lead the Democratic primary field in CHC endorsements with three apiece.”



Dems head to K Street to fund convention - Politico: “Two top operatives planning the Democratic Party’s 2020 convention in Milwaukee went to K Street last week to pitch lobbyists on their plans for the $70 million event. Against the backdrop of the Democratic primary, it was an awkward pairing — representatives for special interests meeting with top Democrats while the party’s leading presidential candidates reject corporate PAC and lobbyist cash. But Democratic National Committee officials explained during the meeting how corporations can help foot the bill for the convention, regardless of who the nominee is, addressing some lobbyists’ worries that a crusading left-wing nominee like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren could try to reject corporate money, embarrassing convention sponsors. The DNC doesn’t plan to return any corporate money that is donated to the convention regardless of the nominee, convention CEO Joe Solmonese told POLITICO.”

DON’T GET SIDEWAYS WITH THIS BEAR

NY Post: “A black bear with a discerning palate was caught on camera munching on grapes in a California vineyard – but only picking out those used for Pinot Noir, according to a report. Video shows the refined mammal stomping around Navarro Vineyards in Philo, Calif., and stopping to pick at the Pinot Noir vines – ignoring the eight other grape varieties grown at the winery. ‘He will go for the premium fruit,’ Aaron Bennett, co-owner of the family business told the Los Angeles Times. The booze-loving beast has been using the vineyard as his personal snack bar for years, but the business only recently caught the fiend in the act on security footage. ‘Navarro’s taste-tester is back to ‘get it when the gettin’ is good,’’ the business posted on Facebook last week, along with security footage of the bear. … The bear may be drawn to the specific grapes because they are grown in a remote part of the vineyard. Or maybe he just has good taste, Bennett said.”

Emtech, a 3-year-old colt, fell to the ground during the 8th race on the second day of Santa Anita’s fall meet.

“As is protocol at Santa Anita, we will open an immediate review into what factors could have contributed to Emtech’s injury,” said Dr. Dionne Benson, chief veterinarian for the Stronach Group. “Santa Anita will work closely with the California Horse Racing Board and will continue to brief our stakeholders and all of our constituents.""

JUSTIFY FAILED DRUG TEST WEEKS BEFORE WINNING KENTUCKY DERBY, TRIPLE CROWN: REPORT

Benson said the horse will undergo a necropsy, mandatory for on-track deaths.

Emtech was euthanized on the track behind a green screen.

The racing death was the first in Southern California since Truffalino died on June 9 at Santa Anita. There were also six training deaths over the summer, four at Del Mar and two at Santa Anita.

The latest Santa Anita training death was on Sept. 16.

The unusually high number of deaths has put the racetrack (and horse racing in general) under scrutiny and has prompted some to call for the track’s closure.

Emtech's jockey, two-time Kentucky Derby winner Mario Gutierrez, was thrown in the incident but uninjured.

* In South Carolina’s Democratic presidential primary, the latest CNN poll shows Joe Biden maintaining his lead with 37% support, followed by Elizabeth Warren at 16% and Bernie Sanders at 11%. No other candidate topped 5%.

* In Nevada, meanwhile, CNN’s poll found Biden and Sanders tied at 22% each, while Warren was third at 18%. Kamala Harris was fourth with 5%.

* Cory Booker’s team suggested the New Jersey senator would end his Democratic presidential campaign if it fell short of its quarterly fundraising goals, but Booker announced via Twitter that his operation reached its target.

* Though competitive presidential candidates from both parties have steered clear of accepting public financing in recent years, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock will apparently become the first Democratic contender to participate in the system.

* In South Carolina, CNN’s poll found 62% percent of Republican voters approve of their state party’s decision to cancel the GOP presidential primary. That’s an unflattering rebuke of Mark Sanford, the former governor and congressman from South Carolina, who’s challenging Donald Trump for the Republican nomination.

* For reasons I cannot explain, the National Republican Congressional Committee thought it’d be a good idea to publicly mock freshman Rep. Joe Cunningham (D-S.C.) for having been to marriage counseling with his wife.

* And following up on an item from last week, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) was the only Democratic presidential campaign to balk at an impeachment inquiry targeting Trump, but she’s since changed her mind."

* There was a lively Democratic presidential primary debate in Westerville, Ohio, last night. The next gathering will be in Georgia on Nov. 20.

* Bernie Sanders hasn’t picked up many congressional endorsements for his presidential campaign, but he’s now picking up two fairly high-profile backers: first-year Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).

* Joe Biden’s campaign appears to have a rather serious financial problem: as the 2020 race enters the next stage, the former vice president only had about $9 million cash on hand as of two weeks ago. In contrast, Bernie Sanders had $33.7 million in the bank, Elizabeth Warren had $25.7 million, Pete Buttigieg had $23.3 million, and Kamala Harris had $10.5 million.

* With only three weeks remaining in Kentucky’s gubernatorial race, the latest Mason-Dixon poll shows incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin (R) tied with state Attorney General Andy Beshear (D), with each garnering 46% support.

* On a related note, Bevin’s fate is reportedly of keen interest to the White House, and Team Trump is reportedly “planning an 11th-hour push to stave off an embarrassing defeat” for the far-right governor.

* And speaking of the Bluegrass State, a judge yesterday sided with the Kentucky Democratic Party and ordered State Board of Elections to keep 175,000 purged voters on the state’s voter rolls.

* In Maine., the latest survey from Public Policy Polling found Sen. Susan Collins (R) trailing a generic Democrat in next year’s U.S. Senate race, 41% to 44%. The incumbent Republican hasn’t yet officially declared whether she’ll run for another term.

* In a newly released audio recording, Texas state House Speaker Dennis Bonnen (R) is heard telling a far-right activist that Donald Trump is “killing” the party “in the urban-suburban districts.”

* And though the president’s GOP primary rivals stand no realistic chance of success, it seemed notable that a Franklin Pierce University-Boston Herald poll found former Gov. Bill Weld with 14% support in New Hampshire, up from 3% in the same poll last month."

* After a couple of difficult months, Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) presidential campaign needed some good news, and a $25.3 million fundraising haul in the third quarter definitely counts as good news for the senator. The total is up from the Vermonter’s $18 million tally from the second quarter.

* Pete Buttigieg also announced third-quarter fundraising totals, and it looks like the mayor raised more than $19.1 million between June and August. That’s down from $24.8 million in the second quarter, but it nevertheless leaves Buttigieg in a strong financial position for the next phase in the race.

* Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) also announced his third-quarter tally: more than $6 million. That’s his best quarter to date, and it’s enough to keep him in the race.

* Sen. Kamala Harris’ (D-Calif.) presidential campaign isn’t where she wants it to be, so the senator is “shaking up the top ranks” of her operation. The change includes moving two top aides from Harris’ Senate staff to her campaign staff.

* The latest Republican National Committee solicitation looks an awful lot like official census materials, which is the sort of misleading scheme partisans are supposed to avoid.

* To the disappointment of Democrats who expected him to lose badly, Corey Lewandowski, Donald Trump’s controversial former campaign manager, conceded this morning that it’s “fair to say” he’s reconsidering plans to run for the U.S. Senate in New Hampshire next year.

* The Atlanta Journal Constitution reports today that new voters in Georgia “have registered in droves” since last year’s elections, and “many of the new voters are racial minorities or under age 30, both groups that are more likely to support Democrats than Republicans.”

* And former Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) wrote a new op-ed, published yesterday, arguing that Trump’s actions “warrant impeachment,” and urging his Republican brethren to end their support for the scandal-plagued president’s re-election."

* The latest national Quinnipiac poll found Elizabeth Warren leading Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, 30% to 27%. Bernie Sanders is third with 11% – down six points since the last Quinnipiac survey – while Pete Buttigieg was fourth with 8%. Kamala Harris, who had 4% support in the poll, was the only other candidate above 2%.

* Brad Parscale, Donald Trump’s campaign manager, yesterday described the U.S. House’s impeachment inquiry as being “a seditious conspiracy to overthrow the people’s president.” He added that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is “attempting to overthrow our great Republic.” Parscale did not appear to be kidding.

* The New York Times published quite a report on the planned voter purge in Ohio’s Republican-led state government: “When Ohio released a list of people it planned to strike from its voting rolls, around 40,000 people shouldn’t have been on it. The state only found out because of volunteer sleuthing.” In all, Ohio intended to purge 235,000 Americans from the state voter rolls, and roughly one-in-five voters on the purge list weren’t supposed to be there.

* Presidential hopeful Beto O’Rourke has now “clarified” his position on stripping the tax-exempt status of houses of worship that oppose marriage equality: “O’Rourke and his staff have since said that was not his intended position.”

* Oregon Gov. Kate Brown’s (D) detractors tried to launch a recall campaign against her, but as of yesterday, they failed to collect the necessary number of signatures.

* In Louisiana over the weekend, voters handed Republicans significant state legislative gains, which will likely cause headaches for Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) if he wins a gubernatorial runoff next month.

* And in southern California, things got a little worse for Rep. Duncan Hunter Jr. (R) yesterday when the indicted congressman failed to receive an endorsement from the San Diego Republican Party."

In the expected runoff, scheduled November 16, the poll shows Edwards leading Abraham, 53% to 38%.

* With Donald Trump slated to hold a rally in Minneapolis this week, there’s apparently a brewing dispute between the president’s campaign team and local officials over security costs associated with the event. It’s why Trump has spent much of the morning lashing out at Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey via Twitter.

* Speaking of Minnesota, Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s Democratic presidential campaign reported a third-quarter fundraising haul of $4.8 million, which isn’t great, but which is more than enough to meet the threshold for the party’s November primary debate. Klobuchar has not, however, yet met the polling threshold to participate in the event.

* The New York Times had an interesting item the other day on prominent members of the Republican Party’s “Never Trump” contingent who’ve since changed their minds. The article noted Erick Erickson, among others, who vowed, “I will not vote for Donald Trump. Ever,” only to recently change direction.

* With Sen. Johnny Isakson (R) stepping down in a couple of months for health reasons, Republicans are lining up to ask Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) to appoint them to the seat. Among the latest is former Rep. Jack Kingston (R), who lost in his Senate bid in 2014, and who last week reminded the governor’s office that he’s “aggressively defended President Trump at every turn” and “spent 30 years taking on the Democrats’ misguided agenda.”

* With only four weeks remaining in Kentucky’s gubernatorial race, the Democratic Governors Association is running this ad targeting Gov. Matt Bevin (R) for trying to derail the state’s Medicaid-expansion program, which is a story we discussed in some detail a few years ago.

* A national Quinnipiac poll released yesterday found Elizabeth Warren holding onto her narrow lead over Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic nomination, 29% to 26%. Bernie Sanders was third with 16%, and no other candidate topped 5%.

* The same poll found Biden leading Donald Trump in a hypothetical general election match-up by 11 points (51% to 40%), Warren leading Trump by eight points (49% to 41%), and Sanders leading him by seven points (49% to 42%).

* Presidential hopeful Andrew Yang was at 3% in the Quinnipiac poll, which means he’s now the eighth candidate to qualify for the Democrats’ presidential primary debate in November.

* On a related note, we learned yesterday that MSNBC and the Washington Post will co-host the fifth Democratic presidential primary debate on Nov. 20 in Georgia. As NBC News’ report on this added, “The specific location, venue, format and moderators will be announced at a later date.”

* With just a few days remaining ahead of Louisiana’s first round of balloting in the state’s gubernatorial race, the latest Emerson poll found Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) leading the field with 48% – which is awfully close to the 50% threshold he’d need to avoid a runoff and serve a second term. Eddie Rispone (R) was second in the poll with 25%, followed by Ralph Abraham (R) at 19%.

* At home in Vermont yesterday, Bernie Sanders told reporters that in the wake of his heart attack that he’ll have to “change the nature of the campaign a bit.” The independent senator suggested the shift will mean holding fewer campaign events.

* Because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is nothing if not shameless, his re-election campaign yesterday began promoting a Politico article pointing to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao’s alleged favoritism for Kentucky. Chao, of course, is McConnell’s wife. “Mitch McConnell is a Kentucky Asset,” the senator’s team wrote in a tweet highlighting the report.

* Probate judge Steven Reed (D) made history yesterday, becoming the first African-American mayor of Montgomery, Alabama.

* And Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D) has thrown her endorsement to Joe Biden, looking past her fellow California senator, Kamala Harris. Feinstein had previously indicated support for Biden in January, but that was before most of the Democratic candidates had formally launched their campaigns.

* Buoyed by African-American support, Joe Biden leads the Democratic presidential field in South Carolina according to the latest Winthrop University poll. The former vice president has 37% support, followed by Elizabeth Warren at 17%. Bernie Sanders is third with 8%, followed by Kamala Harris at 7%.

* Speaking of the Palmetto State, some South Carolina Republicans, including former Rep. Bob Inglis, sued the state Republican Party this week “over its decision to cancel its GOP presidential primary next year.”

* As difficult as this may seem to believe, Andrew Yang, a Democratic presidential candidate running for elected office for the first time, raised $10 million in the third quarter. That’s “more than triple the $2.8 million Yang raised in the second quarter.”

* Kamala Harris, meanwhile, raised $11.6 million between July and September, which is awfully close to the $11.8 million she raised in the second quarter.

* Former Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.), whose 2020 presidential campaign has struggled to gain traction, has reportedly lost four key aides, including his state directors in Iowa and New Hampshire.

* Joe Biden’s campaign released a new plan on gun policy today, which includes an assault-weapons ban. Under the blueprint, those Americans who already own assault weapons would be required to either register the weapons or sell them to the government.

* Speaking of new 2020 plans, Elizabeth Warren’s campaign unveiled a new proposal this morning that would tax lobbying: “Under her proposal, companies that spend between $500,000 and $1 million a year on lobbying would pay a 35% tax on their expenditures. The rate would increase to 60% for spending of more than $1 million, and to 75% above $5 million.”

* And finally, Donald Trump last week told a rather detailed story about CNN building a multi-million-dollar studio in North Carolina’s 9th congressional district, which he said the network intended to keep up “for weeks” if the Democratic candidate won in a recent special election. Like so many of the president’s bizarre anecdotes, the story was completely made up and had no basis in reality."

Really, she's not going to help herself by ""de-tweeting"" Trump. If anything, that might help him. He'd just launch his own message board, and the media would cover that even more breathlessly.

Without Trump’s asides, the media would have to start covering real news, which actually takes work. Besides, we'd all resent Harris for taking away one of the most striking phenomena in political history: a leader who communicates directly with the people, cutting out the middleman known as ""us,"" the media.

Obnoxious or not, it’s the most transparent advancement in politics. It’s the opposite of choreographed interviews between politicians and hacks that allowed both phonies to prosper.

No wonder Harris hates it. She's terrible at being authentic. She's as real as spandex. As credible as a gas station chili dog. I've never seen a candidate so uncomfortable in her own pantsuit. Well, maybe …

There's a weird reflex among liberals these days not to engage in dialogue, but to simply suppress it. Instead of debating each other, dump the interesting voices. Instead of listening to the other side, call them ""despicable"" or ""deplorable.""

Instead of accepting an election, resist it and call it illegitimate. What do all these tactics have in common? They only work if you know you're a loser.

WARREN LAUGHS OFF HARRIS SUGGESTION TO BOOT TRUMP FROM TWITTER

And Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts offered a simple ""no"" when asked by reporters if she thought the Republican president should be booted from Twitter. The Massachusetts Democrat chuckled as she gave her one-word answer on Wednesday.

Harris called this week for the president’s Twitter account to be shut down. This followed a storm of tweets by Trump critical of the whistleblower who filed a complaint against him over the Ukraine controversy. That controversy has spurred a House impeachment inquiry.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Trump, in a tweet, also questioned whether House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff should be arrested for “treason.” And on Wednesday he called the House Democrats' investigation “BULLS---"" in one tweet and a ""COUP"" in another.

“The words of a president matter. Trump has again shown he is irresponsible and endangering others with his tweets. He should lose the privilege to be on Twitter,” Harris wrote on Twitter on Monday.

She urged Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to take action.

Gabbard's comments weren't the first time she's disagreed with Harris.

The two candidates clashed in a viral moment at July’s Democratic primary debate, when Gabbard took aim at the former California attorney general over her record as a prosecutor.

Asked if her pushback against Harris’ suggestion to suspend Trump from Twitter was personal, Gabbard quickly answered, “No. I don’t know why anyone would think that.”"

The California Democrat initially called for Trump to be suspended on Monday in reaction to his attacks on the whistleblower who shed a light on his communications with Ukraine.

""The president's tweets and his behaviors about this are just further evidence of the fact that he uses his power in a way that is designed to beat people down instead of lift people up,"" Harris said on CNN.

Harris apparently saw that and referenced her answer during Tuesday's Democratic debate. ""I would urge you to join me,"" she said before claiming that Trump used Twitter to ""obstruct justice.""

Harris also pointed to August's mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, claiming the perpetrator was ""informed"" by how Trump used the platform.

WARREN LAUGHS OFF SUGGESTION THAT TWITTER BAN AFTER TRUMP AFTER HARRIS' CALL FOR SUSPENSION

""This is a matter of corporate responsibility. Twitter should be held accountable and shut down that site,"" she said. ""It is a matter of safety.""

Warren seemed to agree Trump should leave Twitter but didn't explicitly endorse his suspension. ""So look, I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter, I want to push him out of the White House. That's our job,"" she said.

When Harris pressed Warren on joining her call to suspend Trump, Warren shook her head and said ""no."" Harris, apparently surprised, smiled and said ""wow.""

Harris ignited a Twitter controversy in October after she alerted Dorsey to one of Trump's tweets. At that point, she had already sent her letter in which she told the company: ""I believe the president's recent tweets rise to the level that Twitter should consider suspending his account. When this kind of abuse is being spewed from the most powerful office in the United States, the stakes are too high to do nothing.""

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., on Sunday said the impeachment of President Trump ""shouldn't take very long"" because she claimed he's already confessed that he pressured Ukrainian leaders to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 presidential rival.

While taking questions at a United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) candidate forum in Altoona, Iowa, the White House contender was asked by UFCW President Marc Perrone if she would prosecute Trump for impeachment.

""I've been calling for the impeachment of this president for a long time,"" replied Harris, a former prosecutor in San Francisco. ""And, based on everything I know, yes.""

She claimed Trump already has confessed to trying to using the power of his office to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, who previously was on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings.

""We have a confession. We have a coverup,"" Harris said, referring to reports alleging that White House lawyers moved the transcript of Trump's phone call with Zelensky from the computer system where they're normally kept to a more secure system.

Trump, on the contrary, repeatedly has denied doing anything wrong. He called his phone call with Zelensky ""perfect.""

Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., announced Tuesday she is endorsing former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary -- choosing her former longtime Senate colleague over Kamala Harris, her fellow California Democratic senator.

Feinstein’s endorsement, the first major Democratic endorsement by a top legislator this campaign season, comes as Biden has been losing ground in the polls in the wake of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump and a series of high-profile gaffes while on the stump. But the longtime California senator praised the former vice president for his long tenure in Washington and his work on gun control.

“I’ve worked closely with Vice President Biden and I’ve seen firsthand his legislative ability, his statesmanship, and most importantly his moral fortitude,” Feinstein said in a statement. “During his time in Congress and in the White House, Joe Biden has been a tireless fighter for hard-working American families.”

STAGE IS SET FOR RECORD-BREAKING DEMOCRATIC 2020 DEBATE

She added: “By making gun reform one of the pillars of his campaign and policy platform, Joe Biden demonstrates that he clearly recognizes what is needed to keep Americans safe. And I know, as president, he will continue the fight to restore the soul of the nation from the Oval Office.”

Feinstein’s endorsement of Biden may seem like a snub to Harris – a first-term senator and former California attorney general – but it hardly comes out of left field, as just last week she held a fundraiser for the former vice president in her home in San Francisco. Also back in January – following Biden’s campaign launch – Feinstein said that “he brings a level of experience and seniority which I think is really important,"" according to the San Francisco Chronicle.

The endorsement from Feinstein – a longtime liberal lawmaker who was first elected in 1992 – comes as Biden is struggling to hold on to his role as Democratic frontrunner. An average of recent polls compiled by Real Clear Politics has Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren virtually tied at the top of the Democratic race.

Warren, however, has surged in recent months in the polls, while Biden has dropped, and far surpassed him during the most recent quarter of fundraising.

The Democratic senator from California slammed the president on Twitter Thursday, while also defending Biden's honor.

""Mr. President, telling lies about Joe Biden won't protect you from the truth. Joe has more patriotism in his pinky finger than you'll ever have,"" Harris wrote. ""You violate your oath and undermine American values when you urge foreign nations to do your dirty work. We will hold you accountable.""

Cuomo, 49, began the Los Angeles event -- before an audience composed of members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer communities and their allies -- by welcoming Harris, D-Calif., to the stage.

Harris, following an LGBTQ custom, said her preferred pronouns were “she, her, and hers.""

“Mine too,” Cuomo quipped. But the comment drew negative reaction on social media.

“I am an ally of the LGBTQ community, and I am sorry because I am committed to helping us achieve equality. Thank you for watching our townhall,” he wrote.

But even Cuomo's apology drew backlash.

""Fredo Cuomo grovels to the intolerant left like a good puppy,"" one commenter wrote.

Aside from Harris, eight other Democratic 2020 contenders took part in the CNN event.

Former Vice President Joe Biden began a sentence saying, “When I came out … ,” using a phrase commonly employed by those publicly identifying as LGBTQ for the first time.

“That would be news,” CNN's Anderson Cooper interjected, prompting Biden to walk across the stage to embrace him.



“I got something to tell you ... ,” Biden started to joke to Cooper, who is gay.

“I kind of figured it out a while ago,” Cooper replied.

Biden also responded to a question from Shannon Scott, a 10-year U.S. Air Force veteran, who claimed she had to choose between serving in the military and her identity as a transgender woman because of the Trump administration's policy on those diagnosed with gender dysphoria serving in the military.

Biden said he would change the Trump policy if elected president.

""If I were president, you would not have to choose,"" he said. ""Not a joke. You would not have to choose. The fact of the matter is that we're in a position where transgender men and women are in a position where they should be able to do anything anybody else in the world can do. There should be no difference.""

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., addressed a comment she made in 2012, in which she said she did not support the use of taxpayer money to fund transgender reassignment surgery for prison inmates.

""It was a bad answer,” Warren told the audience. “And I believe that everyone is entitled to medical care and medical care they need. And that includes people who are transgender who, it is the time for them to have gender affirming surgery. I just think that’s important.""

The Yang campaign revealed this week that it had raised $10 million in the third quarter, which a significant jump from $1.7 million from the first quarter and the $2.8 million from the second quarter.

However, members of the #YangGang on social media took notice that Yang's fundraising efforts were left out by CNN and MSNBC.

In CNN's graphic that went viral, it showed Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., leading the pack in the third quarter with $25.3 million, followed by South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg with $19.1 million, then former Vice President Joe Biden with $15.2 million, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif, with $11.6 million, and lastly, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who raised only $6 million, an amount many critics pointed out was lower than Yang's.

“I was in an audition and he put his hand up my skirt. What was so shocking about it was the casting director was there and the director, and of course no one said anything at all because he was – he is – such a huge star,” she revealed.

Harris, 43, said that the incident took place while she was in her mid-20s, but didn’t elaborate as to what the audition was for or who the actor was.

She went on to note that she believes her Cambridge education shielded her from a lot of other sexual advances in show business saying, ""I think there is an immediate assumption that you have a brain.""

She had been asked about Syria, where President Trump recently ordered the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country's north.

She added: ""Just two days ago, The New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia -- completely despicable.""

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has responded to calls for social media companies to curtail President Trump's activities on platforms such as Twitter.

""My belief is that in a democracy, I don’t think that we want private companies censoring politicians in the news,"" Zuckerberg told Dana Perino in an exclusive interview airing Friday on ""The Daily Briefing.""

KAMALA HARRIS CALLS FOR SUSPENSION OF TRUMP'S TWITTER ACCOUNT AMID WHISTLEBLOWER TWEETS

During the interview, Perino asked Zuckerberg about Sen. Kamala Harris' demand that Twitter shut down Trump's account, which the president uses regularly to share his views on a multitude of issues.

Zuckerberg said Silicon Valley shouldn't be taking such actions.

""I generally believe that as a principle, people should decide what is credible and what they want to believe, who they want to vote for,"" he said. ""And I don’t think that should be something that we want tech companies or any kind of company doing.""

Earlier this month, Harris, D-Calif., claimed Trump was using Twitter to inappropriately criticize an intelligence community whistleblower who filed a complaint regarding the president's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky.

""The President's tweets and his behaviors about this are just further evidence of the fact that he uses his power in a way that is designed to beat people down instead of lift people up,"" the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate told CNN.

FACEBOOK CEO SAYS HE WON'T FURTHER ANTAGONIZE ELIZABETH WARREN AFTER THREATENING LAWSUIT

""Frankly, when you look at what he's been tweeting ... directed at the whistleblower, directed at so many people, you know, I, frankly, think that based on this and all we've seen him do before, including attacking members of Congress, that he, frankly, should be -- his Twitter account should be suspended.”

In the interview with Perino, Zuckerberg also responded to another 2020 Democratic presidential candidate's criticism of Facebook.

Last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren's campaign account tweeted it had created a ""Facebook ad with false claims"" and submitted it to the social media site's platform, which approved it.

In that same series of tweets, Warren's team claimed Facebook had ""changed their ads policy to allow politicians to run ads with known lies — explicitly turning the platform into a disinformation-for-profit machine.""

In a recent live-streamed company meeting, Zuckerberg said that he would ""try not to antagonize her [Warren] further.""

""Even when people disagree with what I think would be good to happen in the world, I still want to give them a voice — that's what we're here to do,"" Zuckerberg told his employees.

The 35-year-old billionaire told Perino it is important for Americans to ""think for themselves"" about what politicians say.

""Political speech is one of the most scrutinized [forms of] speech that is out there, so that’s already happening,"" he added. ""Our position on this is not an outlier.""

The network landed an average of 8.3 million views during the three-hour telecast. That marked quite a dip from its previous two-part debates in July, where viewership peaked at 10.7 million. CNN's debate also saw an almost 50-percent drop from the first debate hosted by NBC News back in June, which received 15.3 million viewers.

In addition, 449,000 viewers watched live streams on various platforms from CNN and The New York Times, who co-hosted the debate.

The fourth debate featured 12 candidates on one stage. They were: former Vice President Joe Biden,; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Sen. Kamala Harris of California; tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas; Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; and billionaire donor Tom Steyer.

CNN DEBATE SLAMMED BY CRITICS, CANDIDATES: 'DAMAGED THE NETWORK'S CREDIBILITY EVEN FURTHER'

CNN and The Times faced an avalanche of criticism during and after the debate. The hosting news outlets received backlash for not asking the 12 candidates about topics including China, which has made big headlines in recent weeks amid the ongoing trade war with the U.S.; the mounting tensions in Hong Kong; and the growing controversy with the NBA.

Even the candidates slammed the debate hosts. Castro blasted the debate for not asking any questions about climate change but making time for a question about Ellen DeGeneres' friendship with former President George W. Bush. Harris similarly called out the news organizations for overlooking climate change, immigration and LGBT issues.

Gabbard, however, may have had the fiercest attack, which she made on the debate stage.

A few months back, the Menlo Park, Calif. firm conducted a yearlong audit in consultation with 133 conservative organizations or politicians. The audit, led by former Republican Sen. Jon Kyl, found that interviewees had concerns about Facebook's content distribution and algorithms, content policies and enforcement, ad policies and ad enforcement, and workplace viewpoint diversity.

It concluded the company needs to do ""significant work"" to satisfy the concerns of conservatives over alleged bias, though it prompted a backlash from conservatives and liberals alike.

""Merely asking somebody to listen to conservatives' concerns isn't an 'audit,' it's a smokescreen disguised as a solution,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., in August, calling on Facebook to conduct a third-party audit.

Hawley said last month Zuckerberg was ""stunned"" when he demanded in a face-to-face meeting on Capitol Hill that Facebook ""open up"" their books and make employees available for interviews.

After the three-hour televised event, viewers and some Democratic hopefuls slammed debate moderator Anderson Cooper’s final question of the evening, which did not focus on what many thought could have been more important issues, like climate change.

“Last week, Ellen DeGeneres was criticized after she and former President George W. Bush were seen laughing together at a football game. Ellen defended their friendship, saying, ‘We’re all different and I think that we’ve forgotten that that’s OK, that we’re all different,’” Cooper said to the 12 candidates onstage.

Many quickly took to social media to call out and even outright mock the debate question.

Buttigieg -- who served in the U.S. Naval Reserve in the Afghanistan War and would be the nation’s first openly gay president if elected -- was up seven percentage points since the previous Suffolk University/USA Today poll in Iowa, in June.

The new poll was conducted Wednesday through Friday, entirely after last Tuesday’s fourth round Democratic presidential nomination debate. Political pundits gave a more aggressive Buttigieg high marks for taking on Warren over how she’d pay for her Medicare-for-all health care plan, targeting Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii over her anti-interventionist stance, and clashing with former Rep. Beto O’Rourke over his mandatory gun buy back proposal.

Buttigieg was followed in the poll by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who stood at 9 percent.

""Iowa is unquestionably up for grabs,"" Suffolk Political Research Center director David Paleologos said.

Paleologos added that Buttigieg ""has found a lane and is accelerating toward the front of the pack, surpassing Bernie Sanders. All of this is happening while the number of undecided voters continues to grow as Democratic caucusgoers pause to reevaluate the changing field.""

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joe Biden locked in a close race for their party’s nomination.

Warren stood at 30 percent support in a Quinnipiac University survey Monday of Democratic voters and independents who leaned toward the party. Biden, the unrivaled front-runner until Warren’s surge in the polls the past couple of months, was at 27 percent.

Warren’s three percentage point advantage was within the survey’s margin of error.

GABBARD BACKS DOWN AFTER DEBATE BOYCOTT THREAT

The poll was the third conducted by Quinnipiac since late last month showing Warren with a slight edge over Biden.

“For Senator Warren, the third straight time essentially tied at the top is the charm,” Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy emphasized. “Her candidacy clearly has staying power going into the debate.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont stood at 11 percent, with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent and Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 4 percent.

Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang and billionaire environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer each registered at 2 percent in the poll. The other candidates in the shrinking – but still large – field of contenders stood at 1 percent or less.

Quinnipiac’s survey differed from a Fox News poll released last week that indicated Biden at 32 percent, with Warren ten points back at 22 percent and Sanders at 17 percent. No other candidate cracked double digits in the Fox News survey.

THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL IN THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

Twelve candidates qualified for Tuesday’s debate, which is set to be held at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. They are – in alphabetical order – Biden, Booker, Buttigieg, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Harris, Klobuchar, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, Sanders, Steyer, Warren and Yang.

While national primary horserace polls have grabbed plenty of attention, the battle for the nomination is a fight for the states and their delegates. And, a new poll in New Hampshire, the state holding the first presidential primary, indicated a three-way tie at the top.

Warren stood at 25 percent support among likely Democratic primary voters in the Granite State in a Boston Herald-Franklin Pierce University survey, with Biden at 24 percent and Sanders at 22 percent. Buttigieg stood at 9 percent and Harris at 5 percent, with no one else in the field topping 2 percent.

In New Hampshire’s Republican presidential contest, President Trump remained the overwhelming favorite against three extreme long-shot primary challengers, but his support has deteriorated from 88 percent a month ago to 71 percent in the survey. One of the primary challengers, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, saw his support jump from 3 percent in early September to 14 percent in the new survey.

The Boston Herald-Franklin Pierce University poll was conducted Oct. 9-13, with 422 likely Democratic primary voters and 405 likely Republican primary voters in New Hampshire questioned by live telephone operators.

Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has secured nearly $20 million to fund measures that help California prevent millions of gallons of Tijuana’s raw sewage from flowing into San Diego, according to a Wednesday report.

The preventive measures were laid out in three Senate funding bills which appropriate $19.5 million for the EPA to address the sewage flows, direct the secretary of state to create a plan that addresses their impact, and directs U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to submit a report on its efforts to protect its agents from the flows, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported.

San Diego County has been dealing with raw sewage flows from Tijuana for decades. Last year, a pipe across the border in Mexico broke, causing millions of gallons of sewage to flow into the Tijuana River and, eventually, the Pacific Ocean, impacting California coastal areas.

“It’s absolutely outrageous and unacceptable,” Imperial Beach Mayor Serge Dedina told reporters last December. “The biggest issues that we’re concerned about is this happens again and again and then the Mexican government doesn’t notify anybody. They sort of cover it up and they notify us at the last minute and then our kids are at risk of swimming in sewage.”

DIANNE FEINSTEIN ENDORSES JOE BIDEN’S PRESIDENTIAL BID IN SNUB TO KAMALA HARRIS

Imperial Beach, located just across the border from Mexico, sued the federal government last year, claiming its failure to stop the flows was a violation of the Clean Water Act.

“More concrete action must be taken to stop this decades-long problem,” Feinstein said in a statement. “Raw sewage overflows and other pollution from Mexico along the Tijuana River that jeopardize human health are unacceptable.”

Democrats recently announced a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump over a whistleblower's claim that the president, who'd put a freeze on millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, improperly pushed that country's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, during a July phone call to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

Hunter Biden served on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma as his father was leading the Obama administration’s diplomatic dealings with Kiev. Trump has claimed that Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to shut down a corruption investigation of Burisma. The former vice president has denied doing anything wrong.

Clint Walker, 27, is accused of fatally shooting a man during a November 2016 robbery gone awry. Several months ago, Walker was released on a $100,000 surety bond and ordered to wear the GPS monitor, provided by a company called Guarding Public Safety.

But Walker, according to KHOU, ""failed to pay the company his monthly monitoring fee"" that was reportedly a condition of his bond, and therefore the company removed the device — leaving authorities unable to track the murder suspect.

Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg said the company sent ""a representative to physically remove his ankle monitor"" on Sept. 19, and Walker wasn't re-arrested until Oct. 2, according to jail records, which meant he was not monitored for a nearly two-week period.

Ogg described the situation as a ""troubling loophole,"" and the Harris County Community Supervision & Corrections Department, which didn't respond to Fox News' request for comment, said the bizarre technicality had not led to any widespread issues — and placed blame in the Walker case on Guarding Public Safety.

On the roster: Trump offers no off-ramps for Republicans - Time Out: Bon appétit, y’all - Warren, Sanders lap Biden in third quarter fundraising - The real reason the chicken crossed the road



TRUMP OFFERS NO OFF-RAMPS FOR REPUBLICANS

The news these days is pretty grim for the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress.



The central claim of the whistleblower who came forward to authorities was that President Trump was pressuring America’s Ukrainian allies for dirt on Trump’s chief political rival, Joe Biden.



It has not only been proven true, the president is now doing it right out in the open. He’s even added China to the list of foreign powers he wants to provide opposition research on the Democratic front runner.



Worse, newly revealed texts between American diplomats show that senior State Department officials believed that Trump was conditioning U.S. aid to the long-beleaguered former Soviet republic on the provision of anti-Biden goodies.



But in potentially the worst development so far, it is now alleged that Trump’s personal defense attorney was dangling the promise of an official diplomatic visit to the White House for the Ukrainian president in exchange for a public statement from the Ukrainian leader to investigate Biden and his family’s business dealings in Kyiv.



Team Trump is having some success in deflecting attention, discrediting the California Democrat in charge of the House Intelligence Committee (who’s doing a pretty good job of discrediting himself) and bringing increased attention to the younger Biden’s super-swampy business model.



But the damage is already done. Trump has admitted that the central allegations are true. He has been and is using his office for his own political advantage. All presidents do in more innocuous ways — Air Force One as campaign prop, “official” events as rallies, the White House as an extension of the campaign — but dragging diplomats and involving one of the most potentially dangerous parts of the globe is new.



For Trump loyalists who are in the shoot-‘em-on-Fifth-Avenue club, this is not a problem. They agree with the president that his conduct was “perfect.” They are also convinced that Trump’s predecessor did as bad or worse but was protected by the media. But for those who are not acolytes of Trumpism, including the persuadable voters he desperately needs to win back for re-election, this is turning toxic.



Add in news of an increasingly slouchy economy and you have perhaps the worst political run for this administration yet.



That’s not to say that it’s likely that Trump would ever be removed by the Republican-held Senate. The idea that 20 Republican senators would join Democrats in ousting Trump still sounds laughable.



But the president is certainly not helping his cause with a scorched earth strategy that provides no shelter for his less-fanatically-devoted allies.



Trump’s stance is that he did nothing wrong — again “perfect” — and that anyone who says so is part of the cabal trying to drive him from office.



That’s not going to cut it for lawmakers, especially for vulnerable Senate Republicans, as the 2020 election approaches. They need a space in between: Denunciation of dragging other countries into American politics while still saying Trump’s behavior doesn’t merit removal from office.



Bill Clinton’s team in 1998 knew they had to give Democrats a chance to denounce the president’s scuzzy behavior. Those denunciations actually strengthened Clinton’s standing in the Senate and with voters. He was being punished, formally and informally, and so wasn’t getting away with it. It helped turn him into a sympathetic figure.



Trump and his party are right now a long way from anything like that.



THE RULEBOOK: SERIOUS STUFF

“There is hardly any part of the system which could have been attended with greater difficulty in the arrangement of it than [the executive department]; and there is, perhaps, none which has been inveighed against with less candor or criticised with less judgment.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 67

Raised in a North Texas cattle-ranching family, Taylor Hall experienced firsthand the destruction—and one potential solution. ‘Some of the cowboys I worked with would kill them for pig roasts, gumbo, and so forth,’ he says. … Hall kicked around California kitchens before returning home to open his own restaurant, Apis, in the hills outside Austin. A must for his menu: wild pig. … Hall compares the meat with beef. ‘It’s a lot darker because it’s an animal that moves around a lot, so there’s more blood in its muscles. And with that, you’re going to get more of that iron-y, metallic flavor.’ At Apis, Hall cures the meat for charcuterie and grinds it to make a traditional, slow-cooked Italian ragù, a.k.a.

WARREN, SANDERS LAP BIDEN IN THIRD QUARTER FUNDRAISING

Politico: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign said Friday that it raised $24.6 million in the third quarter and has $25.7 million cash on hand, further solidifying her rise to the top tier in the Democratic primary. The haul bests the $19 million Warren raised last quarter but trails progressive rival Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose third-quarter total of $25.3 million is the biggest one so far from the Democratic presidential hopefuls. Despite neither candidate holding traditional high-dollar fundraisers, Warren and Sanders both significantly outraised former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg ($19.1 million), former Vice President Joe Biden ($15.2 million) and Sen. Kamala Harris ($11.6 million). Warren’s team was alone among those campaigns to disclose its exact cash on hand. … [Campaign manager Roger] Lau wrote that Warren added over 300,000 new donors in the third quarter, bringing her total to about 750,000 donors over the course of the campaign. Sanders' campaign said in September that it had accrued more than 1 million donors.”



Dem front-runners’ ages show larger issue for party - Politico: “Bernie Sanders’ hospitalization with a blocked artery this week finally forced the Democratic Party to confront a lingering fact: All three of its presidential front-runners are septuagenarians, and two are older than Donald Trump… For Sanders, the immediate effect of the incident — a blockage requiring two stents — was to sideline the 78-year-old senator until further notice… But the broader implications were also thrust into plain view: In a Democratic primary that was once expected to break along generational lines, a whole crop of younger contenders has fallen so far back that — even with an aging, top-tier contender laid up — it would take an upset for the party to mount a generational argument against Trump next year. Biden, Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren — the youngest of the three at 70 — are pulling nearly three-quarters of the primary electorate’s support in national polling. And even if Sanders stumbles, no younger alternative is likely to benefit. Instead, it is Sanders’ friend and fellow progressive, Warren, who might be poised to gain.”



Harris struggles to gain ground in home state - LAT: “When Kamala Harris launched her presidential bid, she counted California as a major asset. … But rather than serving as a foundation, California is exposing the cracks in her troubled campaign. Recent polling shows Harris mired in a distant fourth place, with support from fewer than 1 in 10 of those surveyed. … In part, the poor standing reflects problems that have plagued Harris nationwide: uneven debate performances, a shifting stance on issues and, perhaps above all, the lack of a clear and compelling message. But part of the explanation is California itself. The state is physically immense… It’s also astronomically expensive to advertise, and that makes it exceedingly difficult for a politician — even one elected three times to statewide office like Harris — to become well known, much less revered. In short, as other presidential hopefuls have painfully learned, there is no such thing in California as a home-state advantage.”



Walter Shapiro: Pete Buttigieg’s undeniable allure - New Republic: “Four months before the Iowa caucuses, it is time to reckon with the reality that Buttigieg probably has a better chance to be the Democratic nominee than anyone aside from Biden and the surging Warren. With Sanders ailing and Kamala Harris sputtering, Buttigieg has enough money to go the distance (he has raised $44 million in the last six months) and enough polling support to guarantee his place on every debate stage. Whatever happens next, this youthful candidate with a long resume (Harvard, Rhodes Scholar, McKinsey analyst, failed statewide candidate, mayor, and intelligence officer in Afghanistan) has already emerged as the political surprise of 2019. And that raises a new question: Is Buttigieg, who would be four years younger than JFK if he were inaugurated in 2021, ready for the White House?”

THE REAL REASON THE CHICKEN CROSSED THE ROAD

Bangor [Maine] Daily News: “It all started around two weeks ago when [Kate] McCormick returned home from a day at Common Ground Fair… ‘I was really tired and I just wanted to go to bed,’ she said. ‘I lifted up the throw pillows [on my bed], and there was an egg under them.’ McCormick said all she could do at the time was laugh, and look for the nearest suspect. In this case, her 7-year-old German Shepherd-Labrador Retriever mix Jake. … Further investigation, however, revealed the culprit. ‘I started walking around my house and found little piles of chicken poo,’ McCormick said. … The next morning … McCormick was able to witness the hen’s antics first hand. ‘I was awake and the back door was open and before I knew it, I could hear a chicken walking up the stairs in my house,’ she said. … The entire process took around 15 minutes, McCormick said, since the chicken took the time to arrange the blankets and pillows into a sort of nest into which she laid the egg.”

NANCY PELOSI SAYS TRUMP'S RALLY COMMENTS ABOUT BIDEN 'BEYOND THE PALE,' RIPS SENATE REPUBLICANS' 'COWARDICE' ON IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

The question of recusal was raised by Rep. Thomas Masie, R-Ky., who asked if senators running for president “have a conflict of interest regarding possible impeachment of an opponent.”

House Democrats last month launched an impeachment inquiry into the circumstances surrounding President Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Democrats allege that Trump was using U.S. military aid to push Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s conduct in the country. Trump has said there was no quid pro quo and that he wanted only to root out corruption.

But as the inquiry consumes Washington and the 2020 campaign trail, it is possible the Democrat-controlled House votes to impeach the president in the coming months.

That would then set up an impeachment trial in the Senate, where a host of 2020 candidates -- including Sens. Klobuchar; Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; Kamala Harris, D-Calif.; Cory Booker, D-N.J.; and Michael Bennet, D-Colo.

It raises the question of whether they would benefit if their potential 2020 general election rival were removed from office -- and if so, if they should therefore recuse themselves from any trial.

“Shouldn’t they recuse themselves if it came to the Senate?” Massie asked. “Wouldn’t anyone so positioned against a defendant be barred from serving as a judge or jury in a court of law?”

Booker was asked on Friday if he would ever recuse himself, and he gave a short, simple answer: “No.”

In her answer, Klobuchar went into greater detail.

“I was elected as a U.S. senator for the state of Minnesota and my job will be to be a juror in the case and...I very strongly believe that this impeachment proceeding must go forward,” she said. “I don't know what counts that the House will come up with and what they will bring over to us but my job will be to look at the evidence and make a decision.”

Other senators have not addressed the question directly, but have no given any sign that they would recuse themselves. On Wednesday, Harris sent a letter with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., to every Trump cabinet official demanding they cooperate with ongoing investigations and preserve relevent evidence."

One day after reports emerged that the group of far-left House Democrats planned to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders in the 2020 presidential race, it seemed only one of them – Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. – was officially aboard the Bernie Bus:

As for the others:

-- Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had made no official endorsement but was still rumored to be attending a Sanders rally scheduled for this weekend in Queens, N.Y. – one of two New York city boroughs that include a portion of Ocasio-Cortez’s home district.

BIDEN DISMISSIVE OF OCASIO-CORTEZ'S EXPECTED ENDORSEMENT OF BERNIE SANDERS

-- Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., clarified Wednesday that she had not yet endorsed a 2020 presidential candidate – even though CNN and Omar claimed Tlaib had backed Sanders.

-- Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., also hadn’t made an endorsement.

Pressley’s camp stressed that while the Squad members support one another in Congress, they don’t necessarily speak with one voice on all issues.

“Ayanna has tremendous respect for her sisters-in-service,” a Pressley spokesperson told Vox. “Ultimately, these political decisions are made as individuals.”

“Ayanna has tremendous respect for her sisters-in-service. Ultimately, these political decisions are made as individuals.” — Spokeswoman for U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.

One factor possibly stalling a Pressley endorsement of Sanders: She hails from the same state as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, so she might not be as eager to oppose a presidential candidate from her home area – the way that Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., for example, backed former Vice President Joe Biden instead of her fellow Californian, Sen. Kamala Harris.

According to Boston.com, Pressley’s ties to the Sanders campaign aren’t as strong as those of Ocasio-Cortez and Omar, with Pressley having backed Hillary Clinton over Sanders in 2016. In addition, Pressley has worked with Warren on legislation in Congress and also has close relationships with Harris and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who have been seeking her endorsement, the report said.

Tlaib, meanwhile, hasn’t ruled out a Sanders endorsement down the road, telling the Detroit Free Press she will host the U.S. senator from Vermont in her district later this month – just as she recently did recently with Warren. (Warren posted video from that visit online Wednesday -- and Tlaib retweeted it.)

""I am looking forward to bringing Senator Sanders to Michigan on Oct. 27 for a tour of our district that will highlight economic justice issues and corporate tax giveaways, and (include) a roundtable with housing justice advocates,” Tlaib said. “I need to know that anyone I choose to endorse will fight for my residents, and I appreciate the opportunity for them to have a dialogue with Sen. Sanders about these critically important issues.”

But regardless of what Tlaib and Pressley ultimately decide to do, the Sanders endorsement by Omar – and rumored endorsement by Ocasio-Cortez – were blows to the Warren campaign, coming on the same night that the senator fended off fierce attacks from fellow Democrats at the party’s presidential debate in Ohio.

As Boston.com noted, Warren has courted Ocasio-Cortez, having lunch with her in March, writing a blurb for Ocasio-Cortez’s entry in Time magazine’s “Time 100” listing, and filming a video with Ocasio-Cortez in which the pair reviewed the final episode of “Game of Thrones.”"

Biden stays on top in the race with 32 percent support among primary voters, up 3 points since September. He’s followed by Elizabeth Warren at 22 percent -- that’s up 6 points and a new high for her. Bernie Sanders is at 17 percent, down 1 point since last month.

While Biden’s support has stayed between 29-35 percent since March, his current 10-point advantage is about half of his 19-point lead in June.

The rundown continues with Kamala Harris at 5 percent, Pete Buttigieg at 4 percent, Beto O’Rourke at 3 percent, and Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang each at 2 percent. Michael Bennet, Julian Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Tim Ryan, Tom Steyer, and Marianne Williamson receive 1 percent apiece.

Biden retains top billing with strong support among non-whites, voters over age 45, and moderates/conservatives. Warren has strengthened her position by increasing support among suburban voters, very liberals, and men.

When Democratic primary voters’ first and second choice preferences are considered together, Biden and Warren tie at 45 percent support, Sanders is at 34 percent, Harris 15 percent and Buttigieg 13 percent.

President Trump’s allegations about improper actions by Biden and his son have so far failed to chip away at Biden’s support in the primary race -- and Democratic primary voters continue to believe the former vice president is the candidate best equipped to beat Trump in 2020: 43 percent feel that way, up from 42 percent last month. Nineteen percent think Warren has the best chance to oust Trump and 15 percent say Sanders.

At the same time, the poll finds the three top Democratic candidates with sizable leads over the president in potential head-to-head matchups.

The poll, released Thursday, shows Biden (50-40 percent) and Warren (50-40 percent) both top Trump by 10 points, and Sanders is up by 9 (49-40 percent). This marks the first time all three Democrats have held a lead outside the poll’s margin of error. Last month, Biden was up by 14 points, Warren by 6 and Sanders by 8.

“If Warren continues to poll as strongly against Trump as the former vice president, it makes it increasingly difficult for the Biden team to keep making the argument he is the most electable candidate,” says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican Daron Shaw.

The impeachment inquiry hasn’t caused any real shifts in the ballot test, as Trump’s support in the two-way matchups has been between 37-42 percent all year. However, the poll finds an 8-point shift since last month in the number expecting Trump will be re-elected. In September, more thought he would win by a 6-point margin and now more expect he won’t by 2 points.

And while most Republican primary voters want to keep Trump as their party’s nominee, nearly one in five, 17 percent, would like to see someone else run.

“So far, Trump has been able to keep his Republican base on board,” says Shaw. “If the percentage opposing his re-nomination creeps into the 20s, that would be a troubling sign.”

Meanwhile, voters continue to believe Donald Trump is dishonest. Sixty-three percent say that -- far more than the 35 percent who think he is honest and trustworthy. By the way, that’s the same number who said Trump was honest before he won the 2016 election.

Vice President Mike Pence does a bit better than his boss, although not by much: 39 percent say he’s honest and 54 percent say dishonest.

On the other side, each of the top three Democratic candidates receives positive ratings on this measure. Sanders performs best with 59 percent saying he is honest and trustworthy (36 percent disagree). Fifty percent think Warren is honest vs. 44 percent dishonest, and for Biden voters split 48-47 percent.

Among Democrats, 87 percent think Sanders is honest and trustworthy, while 81 percent feel that way about Warren and 75 percent Biden. Seventy-three percent of Republicans say Trump is honest.

Currently, 51 percent of voters have a favorable opinion of Sanders, while 43 percent view him negatively. That puts him in positive territory by 8 points. More view Warren positively by 7 points (46 favorable vs. 39 unfavorable) and Biden by 6 (50 favorable vs. 44 unfavorable).

The ratings are closer to even for Buttigieg (+3 points), Yang (+3), Booker (-2), Harris (-3) and O’Rourke (-4). They each also have large numbers who have never heard of them or have no opinion of them. For example, 43 percent of voters are unable to rate Yang, while 36 percent can’t rate Buttigieg and 32 percent can’t rate Booker.

Voters view Trump more negatively than positively by 13 points (43-56). His personal favorable rating was underwater by 22 points in the days leading up to the 2016 election (38-60).

Twice as many primary voters say Trump’s allegations make them more likely to vote for Biden (21 percent more vs. 10 percent less), while twice as many say health concerns make them less (31 percent) rather than more likely (15 percent) to vote for Sanders in the primary.

Sanders is off the campaign trail since suffering a heart attack October 3. He’s 78 years old, while Biden is 76, Trump is 73, and Warren is 70.

The new survey, conducted by the Saint Anselm College Survey Center and released Tuesday, also shows Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont – who crushed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 New Hampshire primary – in a distant third place.

Warren, the populist senator who’s pushed out one progressive policy proposal after another, stands at 25 percent in the survey. Biden, the front-runner in most polls of voters nationwide and in early primary and caucus states since before announced his candidacy in late April, is at 24 percent. The margin between Warren and Biden is well within the poll's margin of error of 4.8 percentage points.

WARREN EDGES BIDEN, SANDERS SLIPS, IN NEW NH PRIMARY POLL

“There remain several months before New Hampshire Democrats cast their primary ballots, but Warren and Biden have clearly separated themselves from the rest of the field,” New Hampshire Institute of Politics executive director Neil Levesque emphasized.

“If the dynamic of Warren as the candidate that best expresses Democratic voters’ policy preferences and Biden as the one who has the best chance of beating Trump sets in with voters, this is likely turning into a two-person race absent a big shake-up,” he added.

Sanders, the populist independent senator, stands at 11 percent in the survey, with South Bend, Ind. Mayor Buttigieg a point back at 10 percent. Sen. Kamala Harris of California registers at 5 percent in the survey to round out the top five.

The poll’s release comes hours after Sanders reported raising a whopping $25.3 million during the July-September third quarter of fundraising, with Buttigieg hauling in $19.1 million and Harris bringing in $11.6 million.

SANDERS HAULS IN AN EYE-POPPING $25 MILLION JULY-SEPT. CAMPAIGN CASH HAUL

Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii are each at 3 percent in the survey. Businessman and billionaire environmental and progressive activist Tom Steyer and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang are each at 2 percent, with Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey at 1 percent. Everyone else sampled came in at less than 1 percent, with 9 percent undecided with just over four months to go until primary day.

Levesque highlighted that “there is still some fluidity in this race, as 65 percent of Warren supporters, 72 percent of Biden supporters, 56 percent of Sanders supporters, and 73 percent of Buttigieg voters indicate that they expect that their choice could change between now and the primary election.”

Among voters who were not firm in their choice of candidate, was the second choice of 26 percent, followed by Biden (12 percent), Buttigieg (11 percent), Sanders and Harris (7 percent each)

Warren also topped the field of candidates on the question of who would make the best president (27 percent, compared to 19 percent who picked Biden). But Biden came out on top when voters were asked who would be the strongest nominee to take on Republican President Donald Trump in next year’s general election (37 percent, compared to 26 percent who picked Warren).

Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah, Ted Cruz and John Cornyn of Texas, Mike Crapo of Idaho, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, John Kennedy of Louisiana and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee -- came as Democrats have sought to relitigate the Kavanaugh issue, with virtually all of the party's 2020 presidential contenders calling for the justice to be impeached.

The first criminal referral, the senators wrote, concerned the ""false allegation made by an individual who told the [Judiciary] Committee that he had direct knowledge that Judge Kavanaugh assaulted a close friend on a boat in the harbor at Newport, Rhode Island in 1985.""

The Twitter account belonging to that accuser apparently advocated for a military coup against the Trump administration. The accuser, who had contacted the office of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., recanted the sexual assault claim on the social media site days later, after an investigation by Senate Republicans.

""After a thorough investigation, the committee found no verifiable evidence to support any of the allegations made in the declaration,"" the senators wrote.

NBC News later reported that the apparent declarant had said Avenatti ""twisted her words.""

The final referral concerned a claim by Judy Munro-Leighton, who had sent an email to the Judiciary Committee indicating that she was ""the author of an unsigned letter containing highly graphic sexual-assault accusations against Judge Kavanaugh previously received by the office of Senator Kamala Harris."" But, when committee staff later interviewed her, ""she admitted that she falsely identified herself as the author of the letter and its allegations and had only claimed authorship 'as a way to grab attention.'""

The letter added: ""When asked by committee investigators if she had ever met Judge Kavanaugh, she said: 'Oh Lord, no.'""

In the process of evaluating claims against Kavanaugh, the senators wrote that committee investigators ""collected 25 written statements and spoke with 45 individuals,"" and those investigations ""culminated in the nominee’s confirmation and the release of a 414-page committee report concluding that there was no credible evidence to support any of the allegations.""

The senators asked Wray and Barr to provide an update by Oct. 21. Specifically, the senators requested to know ""for each criminal referral made by the committee to the FBI, did the FBI open a criminal investigation? If so, which investigation(s) resulted in a referral to the Justice Department for prosecution? If not, why not?""

Additionally, the senators asked: ""For each case that was referred to the Justice Department for prosecution, which cases were rejected and which were accepted for prosecution?""

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was the big winner Tuesday night in Westerville, Ohio in the most crowded presidential debate ever held. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., also delivered strong performances.

Former Vice President Joe Biden and the other eight candidates on stage came out the losers in the three-hour Democratic presidential primary debate.

BIGGEST WINNER: Elizabeth Warren

Warren’s strong performance will likely solidify her frontrunner status ahead of Biden and Sanders. She emerged the clear winner of the night by showing she was sharp and prepared as she fended off attacks from candidates who were looking to cut into her polling lead.

WARREN COMES UNDER ATTACK FROM ALL SIDES AT DEM DEBATE, AS BIDEN DEFENDS SON'S BUSINESS PRACTICES

Even during the heated exchanges over health care and a wealth tax, Warren was able to turn attacks leveled against her around, and still deliver the best answers of the evening.

Warren questioned why the other candidates “think it is more important to protect billionaires than to invest in Americans” when responding to an attack on her plan for a wealth tax.

And importantly, Warren remained the focal point of the debate, speaking for the most amount of time of all of the candidates.

The senator from Massachusetts now has unmatched fundraising and polling momentum, along with a series of strong debate performances. This, coupled with the fact that Biden and Sanders have been weakened in dissimilar but debilitating ways recently, almost guarantees that Warren will take over as the front-runner.

SURPRISE WINNER: Bernie Sanders

Sanders has faced a precipitous decline in the most recent polls given the significant questions about his health and stamina following his recent heart attack.

However, Sanders delivered a strong, forceful performance in the debate, succeeding in showing voters that he has not lost a step, making him the second-place finisher of the night.

But it is clear that Warren has supplanted Sanders as the leader of the progressive movement in the Democratic field. As a result, it will be difficult – if not impossible – for Sanders to reestablish himself ahead of Warren.

It is clear that Warren has supplanted Sanders as the leader of the progressive movement in the Democratic field. As a result, it will be difficult – if not impossible – for Sanders to reestablish himself ahead of Warren.

SURPRISE WINNER: Pete Buttigieg

Buttigieg has been called the breakout star of the Democratic field – though he has recently struggled to distinguish himself. He had several strong moments in the Tuesday night debate. He was able to make a compelling case as a young, center-left candidate from a swing state with a military background.

Buttigieg was particularly strong during a tense exchange with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii over President Trump’s decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria, delivering a response that elicited cheers from the audience.

“Respectfully congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong,” the mayor said. “The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it's a consequence of a withdrawal and betrayal by this president of American allies and American values.”

Ultimately, Buttigieg’s performance will likely result in a post-debate polling bump with moderate voters, especially given Biden’s relatively weak debate performance.

LOSERS

BIGGEST LOSER: Joe Biden

All eyes, particularly those of Democratic leaders, strategists, and donors were on Biden, who needed deliver a strong performance to reassure voters that he is ready for a general election fight against Trump.

However, Biden was unable to break through and deliver the forceful showing that he needed, dodging a question regarding his son’s work with Ukraine and delivering several other uneven answers throughout the night.

With each passing day, Biden seems to move further from securing the Democratic presidential nomination, and his unimpressive performance Tuesday night will likely result in a post-debate polling decline.

LOSER: Amy Klobuchar

Additionally, although Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota had a number of well-executed lines taking aim at Warren, many felt similar to the inconsequential attacks leveled against Warren by former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland during the first debate. Thus, Klobuchar’s performance is unlikely to result in the post-debate polling spike her campaign needed.

LOSER: Kamala Harris

Sen. Kamala Harris of California similarly fell short, as she failed to distinguish herself in any meaningful way at a time when her campaign desperately needs a boost. Given that recent polls have her hoovering at around 5 percent, she will likely not be able to regain the momentum she had just over two months ago.

LOSERS: Gabbard, Castro, Steyer, Booker, O’Rourke and Yang

The remaining candidates – all barely registering in polls – were the biggest losers of the night. Rep. Gabbard, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, philanthropist Tom Steyer, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas and entrepreneur Andrew Yang failed to have the breakout moment they all desperately needed to show voters they could defeat Trump in November 2020.

Project Veritas, whose founder, James O'Keefe, describes himself as a “guerrilla journalist,” built up the release on social media with an “#ExposeCNN” hashtag. The CNN/New York Times Democratic presidential debate is scheduled to feature 12 leading 2020 hopefuls duking it out from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio -- but the latest batch of alleged undercover recordings could indicate which candidates are preferred by CNN brass.

CNN'S BRIAN STELTER WIDELY RIDICULED AFTER BLAMING TECH ISSUES FOR BIZARRE ANTI-TRUMP SEGMENT

Fox News has not independently verified what Project Veritas says is a clandestine recording of CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker and members of his staff discussing their thoughts on the 2020 presidential race. The network has “already picked its winners and losers,” the Project Veritas narrator says.

“It's incredible that CNN is holding the debate when it's not a neutral referee, it's an advocate for the most-radical leftist policies. The Project Veritas videos are showing CNN for what it has become, the TV headquarters of The Resistance,” Media Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor told Fox News.

CNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

CNN HAS BAD WEEK AMID APRIL RYAN, CHRIS CUOMO AND DON LEMON NEWS: ‘IT WAS QUITE EMBARRASSING’

CNN’s previous Democratic debate, a two-night summer marathon, was criticized by both sides of the aisle. Viewers complained that CNN’s format did not allow articulate answers because of time restrictions and that questions were specifically designed to create tension between candidates. “It was not CNN’s finest hour,” Poynter’s Tom Jones wrote.

CNN hosts Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper are set to moderate the follow-up event on Tuesday, along with New York Times editor Marc Lacey. But the debate comes amid another public relations headache for the network.

A person identified as CNN’s senior justice correspondent, Evan Perez, is claimed to be featured on a recording saying “Joe Biden has a problem, because his son was trading in his name.” Another CNN staffer is claimed to be heard saying the network is less fair to candidates Andrew Yang and Amy Klobuchar than other 2020 hopefuls.

CNN BOSS JEFF ZUCKER ESCAPES QUESTIONS ABOUT OLD COLLEAGUE MATT LAUER

“I think they like Warren a lot,” a person identified as CNN Media Coordinator Christian Sierra says in the video. “They’re pro-Warren for now.”

Sierra is also claimed to have said, “They don’t like Tulsi Gabbard” and detailed Cooper’s disdain for Trump. “Every day, he’s always like mocking him and stuff.”

PROJECT VERITAS’ ALLEGED CNN WHISTLEBLOWER CLAIMS NETWORK IS ‘PUMPING OUT PROPAGANDA'

The Project Veritas videos feature now-former CNN satellite uplink technician Cary Poarch (he was fired after the first batch of recordings were released), who secretly recorded some of the network’s morning editorial meetings. Poarch said he still considers himself a Democrat but, “spent many sleepless night” pondering the bias within CNN and hope to ensure a “free and fair” election.

“It’s very obvious. It's an unwritten rule that if you are center, center right, or heaven forbid, full-right Republican Trump supporter, then you are not welcome at CNN,” Poarch said in the second installment of videos.

Zucker is also heard pushing coverage of Kamala Harris’ demand for Twitter to suspend President Trump’s account despite admitting it wasn’t actually going to happen.

TRUMP SAYS AMERICA WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT 'CNNs OF THE WORLD' AFTER FIERY NEWS CONFERENCE

“It’s not gonna happen, but it’s a good segment in the show, ‘Should Trump’s Twitter account be suspended?,’ It’s obviously what Kamala Harris has… others are talking about it. Not gonna happen, but it’s a good talk, it’s a good segment,” Zucker said.

Monday’s initial release featured recordings made by Poarch capturing Zucker telling top news executives to focus solely on impeachment even at the expense of other important news.

“I don’t care about the MSNBC event, OK? I don’t care about them. Let’s just stay very focused on impeachment,” a person identified as Zucker says in the recording on the day of an MSNBC town hall event. “We shouldn’t just pretend, oh, this is going one way. And so all of these moves are toward impeachment.”

Poarch said he decided to wear a hidden camera because of CNN's perceived bias, and said he secretly recorded Zucker’s 9 a.m. rundown conference call because the network was “pumping out propaganda.”

MAINSTREAM MEDIA SHREDS CNN DEMOCRATIC DEBATE: ‘THE CLEAR INTENT WAS TO SPARK FIGHTS’

“I noticed after… that there was a strong group-think that permeated through the halls and that everyone was onboard the ‘I hate Trump Train,” Poarch said.

Poarch said on “Hannity” during an exclusive interview on Monday night that he no longer works for CNN as a result of the secret recording.

Zucker, who began his career at NBC, rose from researcher all the way to president and CEO of NBC Universal. Along the way, he was responsible for increasing Donald Trump’s fame when he greenlighted “The Apprentice.”

Zucker and the president famously have feuded since Trump’s foray into politics, with the president attacking the liberal network on a regular basis and accusing CNN of unfair coverage. CNN has filled its primetime lineup with anti-Trump opinion hosts and the network’s White House correspondent, Jim Acosta, has made a name for himself by quarreling with members of the administration when they are available to the press.

“Its employees have been opposing the president and pushing for his removal so much that it is obvious it's the corporate position of the network,” Gainor said.

Biden’s haul is a drop of more than $6 million from the $21.5 million he raised in the April-June second quarter of fundraising, and is far behind the $25.3 million that nomination rival Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont brought in the past three months. It’s also less than the $19.1 million that South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg raised in the third quarter.

SANDERS HAULS IN AN EYE-POPPING $25.3 MILLION IN THIRD QUARTER

Highlighting the numbers, Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz noted that “today’s fundraising totals put the campaign in a strong position as we enter the fall. The question any campaign faces at this point is whether or not you have the resources to compete in early states and sustain your efforts beyond. Our campaign unequivocally does, and builds on our strength each week.”

The Biden camp emphasized that 98 percent of all donations were from grassroots donors giving $200 or less, and that 56 percent of contributors in the past three months were new to the campaign.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California reported bringing in $11.6 million in the third quarter, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang hauling in $10 million, triple what he raised in the second quarter. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey announced he raised over $6 million.

Best-selling spiritual author Marianne Williamson said she raised over $3 million and Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado reported raising $2.1 million.

Among those yet to report third-quarter fundraising figures is Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is tied with Biden for the lead position in most the recent national and early-voting-state Democratic nomination polls.

President Trump’s reelection team announced that it and the Republican National Committee combined had brought in a massive $125 million in the third quarter.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Tuesday was the first day campaigns could announce their third-quarter numbers, but they have until Oct. 15 to officially file their fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission.

Campaign cash is a crucial barometer of a candidate’s appeal and popularity and of his or her campaign’s strength. The third-quarter fundraising figures of the Democratic presidential candidates will be heavily analyzed and scrutinized. Fundraising dollars can be used by the candidates to pay for campaign staff and grassroots outreach efforts, travel, and ads."

Steven Reed, who became Montgomery County’s first African-American probate judge in 2012, won about 67 percent of the vote in a nonpartisan runoff election, according to unofficial results released Tuesday night.

Reed defeated David Woods, a white television station owner, after the two earned the most votes in a 12-person election in August, the New York Times reported. He will replace the current mayor of Montgomery, Todd Strange, who chose not to run for reelection after a decade in office, the Montgomery Advertiser reported. Reed will be sworn in Nov. 12.

""This election has never been about me,"" Reed said in his victory speech. ""This election has never been about just my ideas. It's been about all the hopes and dreams we have as individuals and collectively in this city.""

""Montgomery is a city with limitless potential, a city that has no limits outside of our imagination,"" Reed continued. ""The only thing that can hold us back is our fears. When we come together there's nothing that we can't accomplish. ""

In his concession speech, Woods said: “We’re just going to go forward and try to support Steven Reed as mayor. And I just want to encourage everyone to try to continue to work together to bring Montgomery as a unified city. A unified Montgomery is a lot stronger than a divided Montgomery.”

Montgomery has historically been a hotbed for racial tension. Southern delegates gathered in Montgomery in 1861 to vote to form the Confederacy. The city is also home to the church where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. organized the Montgomery bus boycott, in which Rosa Parks became a symbol of the 1960s civil rights movement.

Reed was endorsed by Democratic 2020 hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox, Montgomery's WSFA-TV reported. His father, Joe Reed, is the longtime leader of the black caucus of the Alabama Democratic Party.

""If there is an upset in Iowa, or even a close vote, and New Hampshire and it appears that Elizabeth Warren is the one that can beat Donald Trump, a lot of that vote will switch because a lot of the pro-Biden vote or the pro-any of the Democrats votes are based on anti-Trump,"" Sharpton said.

Sharpton's comments came as polling showed Warren beating Biden in key states before the 2020 Democratic nomination. Polling also continued showing those two dominating the field of potential Democratic candidates.

Together, Biden and Warren have captured the support of more than half of Democratic primary voters, according to the latest Fox News national poll on the 2020 election.

Biden is on top in the race with 32 percent support among primary voters, up 3 points since September. He’s followed by Warren at 22 percent -- up 6 points and a new high for her. Bernie Sanders is at 17 percent, down 1 point since last month.

It also commented on which Democrats appeared to qualify for the debate. As of Tuesday, the field included former Vice President Joe Biden, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.

For the fifth debate, Democratic candidates need to receive 165,000 unique donors -- including 600 spread out over 20 states -- and reach 3 percent in ""four qualifying state or national polls."" They can also make the stage with 5 percent in two qualifying state polls.

STAGE IS SET FOR RECORD-BREAKING PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY DEBATE

According to the announcement, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas, and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro have yet to meet the polling requirements.

NBC hosted the first Democratic primary debate in June with anchors Chuck Todd, Savannah Guthrie, Lester Holt, Jose Diaz-Balart, and Rachel Maddow. That debate sparked an early controversy between Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who also qualified for the fifth debate, after the former made controversial comments about racial issues.

Since June, the 2020 field has narrowed but at least 12 remained and qualified for the fourth debate set to take place in Ohio. That debate will be hosted by CNN and The New York Times on Oct. 15. Given the much smaller field, NBC can apparently avoid the two-night format of the first debate.

The DNC announced that the fourth-round debate would also be held on a single night. The 10 contenders who faced off in September automatically qualified for the October debate. And Gabbard and Steyer, who narrowly missed the September cut, reached the thresholds to qualify for the upcoming showdown by the deadline.

Elizabeth Warren to attacks on the specific questions asked by moderators.

The Hill media reporter Joe Concha told Fox News that CNN’s debate enhanced its already not-so-respectable reputation.

TULSI GABBARD SLAMS CNN, NEW YORK TIMES DURING DEBATE FOR 'DESPICABLE' 'SMEARS' OVER SYRIA, RUSSIA

“The network is under heavy criticism from the left and right today, and rightly so,” Concha said. “Its pursuit of sizzle over steak and focus on social issues over truly substantiate matters – economy, jobs, opioid crisis, border crisis, all-things China – has damaged the network's credibility even further.”

CNN partnered up with The New York Times for the event, which was moderated by CNN's Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper and Gray Lady editor Marc Lacey. While viewers complained about several issues with the moderators, a question Cooper asked about Ellen DeGeneres and former President George W. Bush’s friendship was perhaps the most lampooned.

“Three hours and no questions tonight about climate, housing, or immigration,” Julian Castro tweeted. “Climate change is an existential threat. America has a housing crisis. Children are still in cages at our border. But you know, Ellen.”

CNN FACES MORE ACCUSATIONS OF POLITICAL BIAS AHEAD OF DEMOCRATIC DEBATE

Sen. Kamala Harris also took to Twitter to criticize the moderators, noting there weren’t questions about climate change, LGBTQ rights or immigration.

“These issues are too important to ignore,” Harris wrote.

While Castro and Harris used social media, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hi., slammed CNN and The Times directly from the debate stage over what she described as ""smears"" against her on foreign policy.

""The New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime-change war,"" Gabbard said. ""Just two days ago, The New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia -- completely despicable.""

CNN BOSS JEFF ZUCKER ESCAPES QUESTIONS ABOUT OLD COLLEAGUE MATT LAUER

DePauw University professor and media critic Jeffrey McCall said the major flaw was that moderators allowed Sen. Elizabeth Warren to dominate the proceedings.

“The time imbalance was so obvious and quite unfair to Gabbard, Castro and the others. That Warren is now or at the top of recent polls is no excuse for allowing such an imbalance,” McCall told Fox News. “A candidate forum is supposed to give all candidates a fair opportunity to engage the dialogue and that absolutely did not happen. The debate moderators apparently don't own stopwatches.”

McCall said the imbalance “lends credence to the critics who say these forums are all about promoting some candidates over others” and Warren was clearly the favorite.

CNN, NYT SLAMMED FOR AVOIDING CHINA DURING PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'THIS IS LITERALLY A JOKE,' 'SHAMEFUL'

“The moderators were also quite powerless at times when they tried to move on or determine who would speak next. Candidates tended to ignore the moderators’ directions and interrupt as they wanted,” McCall said, adding that talking over the moderators is nothing new.

“This is standard procedure now in these televised spectacles, but it remains a weakness in the format and relegates moderators to bystanders at times,” he said.

The debate came hours after a secretly recorded video appeared to show a CNN staffer saying the network likes Warren “a lot” and dislikes Gabbard. CNN’s own Twitter account even pointed out that Gabbard received less time than other candidates. According to CNN itself, Warren spoke for over 22 minutes, followed by Biden’s 16-plus minutes, while Gabbard only spoke for roughly eight minutes.

Following the debate, Gabbard’s sister criticized CNN via a tweet sent by the candidate’s verified account that accused the network of cutting off Gabbard to “protect Warren.”

PROJECT VERITAS’ ALLEGED CNN WHISTLEBLOWER CLAIMS NETWORK IS ‘PUMPING OUT PROPAGANDA'

“It was no surprise that CNN began with almost 20 minutes talking about impeachment and defending the Bidens seeing as how CNN's been obsessed with impeachment for at least three years now,” NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck told Fox News.

“Between cutting off Tulsi Gabbard and asking far-left, leading questions on abortion, gun control, and the Supreme Court, CNN reminded America last night just how invested they are in defeating and removing the President from office,” Houck added.

Conservative strategist Chris Barron told Fox News that the debate was harmful to candidates because liberal moderators were so easy on them.

“CNN is actually doing a disservice to the Democratic candidates and to Democratic voters by refusing to ask tough questions of the front runners,” Barron said. “Whoever the Democrats nominate will have to square off against President Trump on the debate stage and I promise you he won’t treat the nominee with kid gloves”

Media Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor told Fox News that CNN wouldn’t be a “neutral referee” because of its own bias and that was before the debate even started -- and the moderators didn’t do anything to change his mind.

DAN GAINOR: ELIZABETH WARREN DRAWS MOST ATTENTION FROM MEDIA AND CANDIDATES IN DEMOCRATIC DEBATE

“CNN, which has done as much as any outlet in America to promote impeachment, began the entire debate with 12 questions on the subject – one easy one for each candidate,” Gainor wrote following the debate.

CNN and The Times were also heavily criticized for overlooking China, which has been a focal point of the recent news cycle. China made headlines in recent weeks between its trade war with the United States and the growing tensions between the communist nation and the NBA – but the moderators didn’t seem to care what 2020 candidates thought about the situation.

""There hasn’t been one question about China in this entire 3 hour debate. It is shameful,"" ""The View"" co-host Meghan McCain tweeted.

The ""foreign policy"" portion of the debate featured questions predominately about Trump's recent troop withdrawal from Syria as well as handling Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“It's patently amazing that the network couldn't find the time over three hours to ask one question about arguably a Top-3 topic going into the 2020 election, China, but did ask as its final question of the night about the friendship between Ellen DeGeneres and George W. Bush,” Concha said.

Plenty of others took to Twitter to chime in on the debate, too:

Homelessness in Los Angeles County and across Western states is skyrocketing. In 2019 so far, the number of homeless residents in Los Angeles has risen 12 percent from 2018, according to county statistics.

“We need a FEMA-like, Red Cross-like, National Guard-like [solution],"" said Rev. Andy Bales, the CEO of L.A.’s largest homeless shelter, Union Rescue Mission. ""Army Corps of Engineers needs to come and we need to figure out immediately how to get 44,000 people off the streets.""

Candidate plans that are more forward-looking, like five to 10 years down the road with millions of dollars in investment in affordable housing units, can be good in theory and are necessary, these advocates say, but don’t address “chronic” homelessness, or those who have lived out on the streets for six months or more in the past year.

HOMELESS MAN RANDOMLY PICKS UP 6-YEAR-OLD, SLAMS HIM ON CONCRETE: REPORT

“We’ve been doing $600,000 to $700,000 per person, per unit, and it’s planned over the next 10 years and that will not get it done,” Bales says. He added that only one candidate has reached out to him on how to remedy the situation.

Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary under President Obama Julian Castro and Beto O’ Rourke have actually visited homeless encampments on Skid Row, a notoriously expansive homeless encampment in downtown Los Angeles.

O’Rourke released a plan this week similar to Castro’s and Sen. Bernie Sanders’ plans, saying he wants to triple funding for homeless assistance grants through HUD providing $50 billion over the next 10 years, fully funding housing choice vouchers, capping rent increases, and pumping investment in dilapidated public housing units.

But for those who study the issue of homelessness, they say the problem should be coming up more in candidate rhetoric and dialogue as they campaign. It’s not so much to just have a job to maintain housing, they say, because rent prices have become so unsustainable.

“I think it’s becoming an intractable issue because we don’t have the investment and broader solutions to homelessness, which is why I think many of the presidential candidates are focused on affordable housing….it’s still something that’s just emerging and most of the candidates have not yet addressed,"" said Christopher Herring, a UCLA PhD student.

Herring said affordable housing is the main way to go, but there needs to be more steps done to prevent people from becoming homeless in the first place and notes that with Castro and Sanders’ plans, respectively, much of the dollar figures they’re proposing will be spent quickly and frivolously unless backed up by creating and maintaining affordable housing quickly and cost-efficiently.

""To put it another way, that expansion of the billions of dollars for homelessness in Castro and Sanders plans will be pissed away quickly and a waste of taxpayer money if not backed up by more robust structural reform in the production and preservation of affordable housing.""

TOMI LAHREN: CA DEMOCRATS IGNORING HOMELESS 'EPIDEMIC' IN FAVOR OF TRUMP IMPEACHMENT PUSH

California’s Democratic primary will be early in 2020, moving up to March from June, making the state in play again for candidates vying for the nomination with 500 delegates up for grabs.

Voters in the state have homelessness high on their list of issues. Some in Los Angeles county say it even trumps traffic and the environment in what needs to be fixed first in the city.

But ultimately, homeless people have very little, if any political power as a constituency, which could be why voters haven’t heard about the problem in states other than California.

“For the most part, the people who are experiencing homelessness are not voting, at least they’re not voting en masse, they don’t have a strong political voice, they don’t have political champions, and elected officials who are sensitive to what their constituents want or else they’re going to get voted out of office, it’s not a constituency they have to pay a lot of attention to,” said Adam Murray, executive director of LA’s Inner City Law Center.

California senator and presidential candidate Kamala Harris is supporting a bill in the Senate to provide $13 billion in emergency relief to areas affected by chronic homelessness over the next five years. But Republicans are unlikely to bring it up for a vote, citing the huge price tag.

Harris has blamed the Trump administration for cutting off funding to support what local government needs around affordable housing.

President Trump, on the other hand, has spoken about the issue on Twitter and at his rallies numerous times, largely in irreverent tones.

At a rally in Cincinnati in August, he said, ""What they are doing to our beautiful California is a disgrace to our country...It's a shame. The world is looking at it. Look at Los Angeles with the tents and the horrible, horrible conditions. Look at San Francisco, look at some of your other cities.""

Herring says California needs a federal response like what Trump is suggesting, saying, ""Trump has drawn attention to this and it’s woken up the Democratic candidates to putting forward and putting pressure on them to make real solutions.”"

What’s happening now, he tweeted, is not impeachment, “it is a COUP, intended to take away the Power of the People, their VOTE, their Freedoms, their Second Amendment, Religion, Military, Border Wall, and their God-given rights as a Citizen of The United States of America!”

Leaving aside all the terrible things he says would follow his ouster, let’s be clear: This is not a coup.

Impeachment is a remedy contained in the Constitution after considerable debate by Alexander Hamilton and the other founders. Impeaching Donald Trump, especially on a party-line vote, may be dumb, reckless, blindly partisan or downright suicidal. But it is not a coup, even of the bloodless variety.

ALL THE PRESIDENT’S MEN NOW BEING DRAGGED INTO THE IMPEACHMENT DRAMA

The president isn’t the only one using intemperate language. Maxine Waters, the left-wing Democratic congresswoman, responded to his “filthy talk” by declaring, “Impeachment is not good enough for Trump. He needs to be imprisoned & placed in solitary confinement.”

So much for due process or the formality of a trial. Waters is already picking out his jail cell.

I had barely finished writing these words when the president tweeted about the “Do Nothing Democrats,” saying they are “wasting everyone’s time and energy on [BS.”] Except he spelled it out.

Look, it’s hardly surprising that rhetoric is getting way overheated with the Democrats wielding a weapon that’s only been used against Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. But words matter, in political discourse as in life. And “coup” was no accident.

Trump obviously has every incentive to rouse his supporters by painting himself as the victim of dark forces, including the media and the Deep State.

And the critics can retire to their fainting couches when he retweets a phrase like “civil war.” Journalists use the term all the time, talking about a Republican civil war or Democratic civil war or some other war.

But coup is different, and so is calling for a congressman’s arrest. Trump yesterday called Adam Schiff a “lowlife” who should resign, saying he couldn’t carry Mike Pompeo’s “blank-strap.” (Suddenly jock is a dirty word?) He’s also ended a tweet about the House Intel chairman with: “Arrest for Treason?” (The supposed treason is that Schiff exaggerated Trump’s comments on the Ukraine call in what he said was a parody.)

Kamala Harris, trying to break into the news, is demanding that Twitter suspend the president’s account. There is zero chance of that happening, as the senator well knows. Can you imagine the backlash against the company, already accused of leaning left, for banning a commander-in-chief with 63 million followers?

Harris pointed to Trump’s postings in which he likened the intelligence whistle-blower to a spy and mentioned the word treason. “These tweets represent a clear intent to baselessly discredit the whistleblower and officials in our government who are following the proper channels to report allegations of presidential impropriety,” she wrote Twitter chief Jack Dorsey.

As for the fourth estate, the president told reporters he is largely dropping “fake” and will refer to them as the “corrupt media.”

Trump was teeing off on the Washington Post, but he was mistaken; the focus of his ire was a new book by two New York Times reporters, Michael Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis.

The Times story based on the book said that in private meetings Trump “often talked about fortifying a border wall with a water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators, prompting aides to seek a cost estimate. He wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh. After publicly suggesting that soldiers shoot migrants if they threw rocks, the president backed off when his staff told him that was illegal. But later in a meeting, aides recalled, he suggested that they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down. That’s not allowed either, they told him.”

Trump ridiculed the story as a lie and said it was “stupid” to ask whether he’d ever said such things. (Davis tweeted that the White House did not deny the account when twice presented with the details.)

The president then declared that he would largely retire his “fake news” formulation in favor of “corrupt news”—which, he added for good measure, is “truly the enemy of the people.”

That’s the latest sign of Trump’s frustration, after years of negative coverage, in the midst of an impeachment inquiry.

But here’s the kicker. When Fox’s John Roberts asked Trump about a just posted New York Times story that the whistle-blower told Schiff’s staff about his complaint days before filing it, he said he couldn’t believe the paper had written it and that maybe it’s getting better. When the president views a story as more favorable, he miraculously upgrades his opinion of the press."

Biden captures 41 percent support among Democratic primary voters (+6 points since July), Elizabeth Warren trails with 12 percent (+7), and Bernie Sanders gets 10 percent (-4).

The Sanders campaign announced Wednesday that he is off the trail indefinitely after undergoing a heart procedure. The poll was conducted Sunday through Wednesday evenings.

Kamala Harris receives 4 percent, down from 12 percent. Tom Steyer, who entered the race in July, also gets 4 percent. Cory Booker (3 percent) and Pete Buttigieg (2 percent) held steady. All others receive 1 percent or less.

South Carolina holds its Democratic primary February 29, 2020. It is the fourth state to vote in the nomination race and the first with a large African-American population.

The poll, released Sunday, shows Biden with large leads among blacks (+41 points), men (+31), and voters over age 45 (+38). Since July, his support has grown 9 points among blacks and 13 points among black men.

Warren is ahead among one group -- white voters with a college degree (+5 points), and comes close to Biden among white voters, trailing him by just 4 points.

Sanders is the top pick among voters under age 35, besting Biden by 9 points.

Hillary Clinton beat Sanders by 73-26 percent in the 2016 South Carolina primary.

When asked their second-choice candidate, Warren tops the list with 16 percent. When first and second-choice preferences are combined, it’s Biden at 52 percent, Warren at 28 and Sanders at 23 percent.

“Warren is a distant second even though she more than doubled her support since July -- and she would need to triple her support again to even get within striking distance of winning South Carolina,” says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican counterpart Daron Shaw. “But she is really in the delegate hunt here. The fact that she is the top second choice candidate puts her in a good position to gain momentum as the field narrows.”

Fifty-eight percent of South Carolina Democratic primary voters prioritize backing a candidate who can beat Donald Trump, up from 52 percent who felt that way in July. That’s twice the number saying supporting a candidate they like is more important (29 percent).

They also prefer a candidate who will build on former President Barack Obama’s legacy over one with a new and different approach (50-41 percent).

Biden dominates among those prioritizing beating Trump (+39 points) and those wanting to build on Obama’s legacy (+41). He has narrower advantages, although still commanding, among those wanting to back their favorite candidate (+15) and preferring a new approach (+16).

Some 83 percent of primary voters are dissatisfied with how things are going in the country today, and 78 percent favor impeaching Trump and removing him from office.

Conducted September 29-October 2, 2019 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 803 South Carolina Democratic primary voters who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Respondents were randomly selected from a statewide voter file and screened to identify potential participants in the Democratic presidential primary."

Hackers targeted 241 accounts in total, including those linked to the presidential campaign, government officials, media figures and prominent Iranian expatriates. Four accounts were penetrated successfully. Sources familiar with the operation told Reuters the Trump campaign was not among those successfully penetrated.

The announcement is the latest alarm that foreign governments may be looking for ways to influence the 2020 election. It comes less than a week after Iran’s foreign minister denied Iran was interfering in the 2020 presidential election, but ominously stated that “there is a cyberwar going on” in an interview with NBC.

IRAN PREPARES FOR CYBERWR AMID RISING TENSIONS, BOASTS THOUSANDS OF CYBER BATTALIONS

“The United States started that cyberwar, with attacking our nuclear facilities in a very dangerous, irresponsible way that could’ve killed millions of people. You remember Stuxnet?” Foreign Minister Javad Zarif told Chuck Todd on “Meet the Press.” “So there is a cyberwar … and Iran is engaged in that cyberwar.""

He further declared that ""any war that the United States starts, it won’t be able to finish.”

Tensions between the U.S. and Iran have been steadily rising in recent months after President Trump angered that foreign nation’s leadership by pulling out of a 2015 deal intended to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions and ramping up sanctions. Iran could be hoping to usher in a 2020 U.S. president who will look more kindly upon it.

In the 2016 election, Russian government hackers worked to infiltrate U.S. election infrastructure, and may have identified vulnerabilities ripe for exploitation in future elections. Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller warned in July that “many more countries are developing capabilities to replicate” Moscow’s activities.

The latest attacks occurred during a 30-day period between August and September, perpetrated by a group Microsoft calls Phosphorus. Keepers of the four compromised accounts have been notified and the Department of Homeland Security said it was working with Microsoft to “assess and mitigate impacts.”

Microsoft’s Tom Burt said the hackers used password reset and account recovery features to try to take over the accounts. Some 2,700 attempts were made to identify email addresses that belonged to Microsoft customers.

Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for Trump's 2020 reelection campaign, said Friday there was ""no indication that any of our campaign infrastructure was targeted."" The campaigns of Sen. Kamala Harris, Michael Bennet and Pete Buttigieg told The Associated Press they had not been targeted either.

On Friday, Fox News learned that the Islamic Republic of Iran has been beefing up its cyberintelligence forces. “Iran has been aggressive over the past several years when it comes to cyberattacks. Its back is against the wall, and it has less to lose from a cyberwar with the United States,” said David Kennedy, founder and CEO of TrustedSec and a onetime military intelligence analyst.

FAKE WEBSITE WITH IRANIAN TIES TARGETS US VETERANS, REPORT SAYS

On Sept. 27 it was announced that hackers thought to be linked to Iran were targeting servicemen and veterans, trying to infiltrate military networks. The hackers ran a fake veterans job site, hoping one of their targets would use a Department of Defense system to download and run the malware, a Homeland Security cybersecurity analyst said.

Christopher P. Hasson, 50, admitted to all four charges against him -- illegally possessing unregistered silencers, illegally possessing unserialized silencers, possession of a firearm by an unlawful user or addict of a controlled substance and illegal possession of a controlled substance -- in federal court in Greenbelt, Md.

He was not charged with any terror-related crimes.

The Coast Guard lieutenant was arrested in February in his Silver Spring, Md., home, where authorities said they found a stockpile of weapons, including 15 guns, smoke grenades, silencers and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, the opioid painkiller Tramadol and other items.

Federal prosecutors allege Hasson compiled a spreadsheet of names he planned to target and claimed the self-described white nationalist was hell-bent on the ""murder [of] innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country.""

COAST GUARD OFFICER ORDERED TO JAIL, ACCUSED OF BEING 'DOMESTIC TERRORIST'

After Thursday's hearing, Hasson's public defender said the case had been “mischaracterized and sensationalized.”

Liz Oyer said Hasson “was not plotting a terrorist attack or any of the abhorrent acts that the prosecution has repeatedly speculated about but never actually charged.”

Some of the prominent figures whose names were listed on Hasson's spreadsheet included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.; Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.; and Democratic presidential hopefuls Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris.

Several cable TV personalities, including MSNBC's Chris Hayes and Joe Scarborough and CNN's Chris Cuomo and Van Jones were also mentioned.

Investigators said Hasson searched for Scarborough’s home address in January and Googled “best place in dc to see congress people” and “civil war if trump impeached,"" according to The Washington Post.

Prosecutors said he also targeted two unidentified Supreme Court justices and two social media executives and also searched for their home addresses online.

Investigators said Hasson appeared to be inspired by Anders Behring Breivik, a Norwegian right-wing extremist who killed 77 people in a 2011 bomb attack and shooting rampage.

His lawyers filed a request last week to bar prosecutors from introducing evidence linking him to white supremacist views or associations. In 2017, Hasson wrote to a Nazi leader where he advocated for ""'focused violence' in order to establish a white homeland,"" according to prosecutors.

Hasson, who had served in the Marines, worked at Coast Guard headquarters in Washington as an acquisition officer to acquire advanced new cutters for the agency. He faces up to 31 years in prison when he is sentenced Jan. 31.

The massive fundraising figure is up more than $7 million from his second-quarter numbers.

SANDERS PROPOSES NEW TAX TO TARGET COMPANIES WITH LARGE PAY GAPS

Pete Buttigieg’s campaign also reported early Tuesday morning that the South Bend, Indiana mayor raised $19.1 million the past three months. While impressive, the candidate’s fundraising haul is down from the $24.8 million he brought in during the second quarter, which was the highest among the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls during the April-June quarter.

Sen. Kamala Harris announced raising $11.6 million over the past three months.

The California Democrat's third quarter figure is slightly behind the $11.8 million she brought in during the second quarter and the $12 million she hauled in during the January-March first quarter of fundraising.

Sen. Cory Booker also revealed his third-quarter fundraising figures on Tuesday.

The Democrat from New Jersey's presidential campaign said they raised more than $6 million in July-September period, their best quarter of fundraising to date.

President Trump’s re-election campaign reported on Tuesday that they and the Republican National Committee combined hauled in a massive $125 million in the third quarter. That’s up from their combined $105 million raised during the second quarter.

Unlike some of his rivals for the nomination – such as former Vice President Joe Biden, Buttigieg and Harris – Sanders eschews big donor fundraisers and instead relies solely on grassroots donations. The campaign announced it received 1.4 million donations the past three months.

Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement that ""Bernie is proud to be the only candidate running to defeat Donald Trump who is 100 percent funded by grassroots donations – both in the primary and in the general.""

News of Sanders’ cash haul comes as the populist independent senator from Vermont has faded in many recent polls to third place behind Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who along with Sanders is the other progressive standard-bearer in the 2020 Democratic nomination race.

Shakir argued that “media elites and professional pundits have tried repeatedly to dismiss this campaign, and yet working-class Americans keep saying loudly and clearly that they want a political revolution.""

The Sanders campaign announced that its average individual contribution was $19 and that more than 99.9 percent of contributors have not maxed out and are able to donate again to the campaign.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

The Buttigieg campaign highlighted that they’ve now raised more than $51 million since the beginning of the year. They said that 182,000 new people contributed to the campaign in the third quarter, bringing the total number of donors this year to 580,000. The campaign also reported that the average contribution the past three months was $32.

Buttigieg, a one-time long-shot for the nomination, soared in the spring to near top-tier status. While he's continued to haul in large amounts of campaign cash and build up a formidable team in the crucial early voting states, his poll numbers stagnated during the summer.

The Harris campaign, in reporting their fundraising figures, noted that they plan to double their organizing staff in Iowa and South Carolina - the first southern primary - in October and November.

Harris has seen her poll numbers deteriorate over the past two months, but campaign manager Juan Rodriguez pledged that ""this is a campaign that is growing, expanding, and built to win this primary.""

Booker's campaign said that a third of their campaign haul the past three months came during the last 10 days of September, after the candidate announced if he didn't bring in $1.7 million by end of the month, he'd likely drop his White House bid.

Booker's campaign said they'd use their new infusion of campaign cash to hire 40 more staff at headquarters and across the country and open more offices in the early voting states.

Tuesday was the first day campaigns could announce their third-quarter numbers, but they have until Oct. 15 to officially file their fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission.

Campaign cash is a crucial barometer of a candidate’s appeal and popularity and of his or her campaign’s strength. The third-quarter fundraising figures of the Democratic presidential candidates will be heavily analyzed and scrutinized. Fundraising dollars can be used by the candidates to pay for campaign staff and grassroots outreach efforts, travel, and ads."

BUTTIGIEG AND O'ROURKE CLASH OVER GUNS DURING DEBATE

Castro grabbed only 8.2 minutes of speaking time at the debate – the third least amount among the record-setting 12 candidates on the stage – and didn’t score a breakout moment.

But in an interview with Fox News in the spin room following the debate, Castro vowed that he’ll fight on even if fails to make November’s cut and optimistically said he’ll qualify for the next debate.

“I’m going to keep fighting on. I believe that with hard work, we can make the next debate in Atlanta. We have about three and a half weeks to do that. So I’m going to keep working hard to get there,” he said.

Castro’s comments stand in contrast to his dire warning to supporters in a fundraising email late last week.

""I don’t say this lightly: If I don’t make the next debate stage, it will be the end of my campaign,"" Castro emphasized.

FOX NEWS' BRETT BAIER ON DEBATE WINNERS AND LOSERS

To date, eight candidates say they’ve qualified: They are – in alphabetical order – are former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Kamala Harris of California and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, businessman and progressive and environmental advocate Tom Steyer, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

After the debate, it was hard to find a political pundit who praised Castro’s performance.

But asked by Fox News if his debate performance helped him in his goal to make the next debate stage, the candidate said, “I think so. It’s always a scramble for time with 12 people up there but I made the best use of the time that I did get. I was very sharp on issues that people care about and I think that will make a difference.”

And he touted on Twitter that “donations are coming in from all around the country.”

Castro also took aim at the media hosts for the debate - CNN and the New York Times – telling reporters in the spin room and highlighting on Twitter that there were “three hours and no questions tonight about climate, housing, or immigration. Climate change is an existential threat. America has a housing crisis. Children are still in cages at our border.”"

YANG TELLS FOX NEWS 'I WOULD NEVER WISH FOR' A RECESSION

Yang’s campaign also reported $6.3 million cash on hand as of the end of September and noted that the funds will go towards building up staff and infrastructure in the early voting primary and caucus states.

""Andrew Yang is the only contender showing exponential growth in the third quarter, more than tripling his fundraising number from last quarter,"" campaign manager Zach Graumann touted. ""This grassroots fundraising total, with over $6m in the bank, ensures this campaign will have the funding to compete and outperform expectations through Super Tuesday and beyond.""

Yang has become a serious contender for the Democratic nomination thanks to the popularity of his so-called ""Freedom Dividend."" That’s Yang’s universal basic income proposal to give each adult American $1,000 a month to ease the economic pain stemming from lost jobs due to automation and artificial intelligence. He says he’ll pay for the program by implementing a national value-added tax.

YANG'S CAMPAIGN CASH GIVEAWAYS RAISE LEGAL CONCERNS

He's also built a strong and devout base of grassroots supporters and donors, known as the Yang Gang. Thanks to his fundraising prowess and polling, Yang has made the stage for all the Democratic primary debates to date, something that some better-known governors and senators failed to do.

Yang closed out the third quarter of fundraising by headlining a rally in Los Angeles that drew some 5,000 people, according to his campaign. And they noted that Yang raised $2.28 million in the last ten days of September.

""Wow, we ended the quarter on the biggest rush of donations ever!"" Yang tweeted on Tuesday night. ""Thank you to everyone who worked your heart out to exceed our goal - you all are amazing!""

SANDERS HAULS IN A WHOPPING $25.3 MILLION IN THIRD QUARTER

The campaign cash figure from Yang, while impressive, paled in comparison to the whopping $25.3 million Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont hauled in during the third quarter. The Sanders campaign announced its fundraising figures early Tuesday morning.

South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg brought in $19.1 million over the past three months. Sen. Kamala Harris of California reported bringing in $11.6 million, with Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey raising over $6 million.

President Trump’s re-election team announced that they and the Republican National Committee combined hauled in a massive $125 million in the third quarter.

TRUMP'S RECORD-BREAKING $125 MILLION FUNDRAISING HAUL

Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado also released his fundraising figures on Wednesday. The long-shot contender for the nomination reported raising $2.1 million over the past three months, with $1.8 million cash on hand. The campaign noted that 86 percent of contributions were $25 or less.

“Our strategy to run a lean, strong campaign in early states is working, and we have the resources to compete and win. We’re continuing to run TV, rural radio, and digital ads and build out our infrastructure and staff,” Bennet campaign spokesperson Shannon Beckham emphasized.

Bennet didn’t make the cut for last month’s Democratic nomination debate and failed to qualify for this month’s showdown as well. That has not discouraged Bennet's campaign.

""Instead of allowing the DNC’s flawed debate criteria to dictate this race, we’re communicating directly with voters and caucusgoers,” Beckham said, taking aim at the Democratic National Committee’s thresholds to qualify for the debate."

The Trump 2020 campaign's fundraising arm said Tuesday that it has raised more than $308 million in 2019 and has more than $156 million in the bank.

Former President Barack Obama and the Democratic National Committee raised just over $70 million in the third quarter of 2011.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN, GOP RAKE IN MILLIONS IN 24 HOURS AFTER PELOSI ANNOUNCES IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

“President Trump has built a juggernaut of a campaign, raising record amounts of money at a record pace,” said Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale.

Republican insiders say that the impeachment effort against Trump could be a fundraising boon for the GOP.

WinRed, the new GOP online fundraising platform designed to compete for small-dollar campaign donations, reported raising a little more than $30 million in the third fundraising quarter, which began in July and ended Monday.

The online platform is used to raise money for President Trump’s re-election, campaign committees and various Republican candidates across the country.

WinRed President Gerrit Lansing said the Democrats’ moves to ramp up impeachment efforts against Trump “helped a lot,” saying fundraising numbers “spiked” after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s announcement of a formal inquiry last week.

WinRed has raised more than $13.7 million from over 276,000 contributors since the announcement by Pelosi, he said.

“It just poured gas on the situation where there is a ton of money being raised in all levels and all campaigns,” Lansing said.

RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel also credited Democratic attacks on Trump for motivating supporters to donate in record numbers.

“We are investing millions on the airwaves and on the ground to hold House Democrats accountable, highlight their obstruction, and take back the House and reelect President Trump in 2020,” she said.

The fundraising announcement comes as the pro-Trump groups launched their first major advertising campaign of the cycle. Trump’s team aims to devote $1 billion to his reelection.

However, Democrats are also putting up big fundraising numbers – albeit not as large as Trump’s campaign.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders hauled in a whopping $25.3 million during the third quarter of fundraising, up more than $7 million from his second-quarter numbers.

The freshman New York congresswoman traveled to Copenhagen for a meeting with the C40, a group of 94 mayors led by Los Angeles' Mayor Eric Garcetti -- who was just announced as the group's new chair. The plan aims to halve carbon emissions by 2030 through cleaner alternatives and the ""strictest possible building codes."" It also seeks to achieve the Paris Climate Agreement's goal of keeping warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Besides Garcetti, mayors from at least five U.S. cities released statements supporting the global adoption of Ocasio-Cortez's climate framework. Those included New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio; Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan; Austin, Texas, Mayor Steve Adler; Portland, Ore., Mayor Ted Wheeler; and Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney.

“I am inspired by this coalition and the commitments made for a global Green New Deal. If we work to join forces globally, we will be able to defeat our greatest threat and realize our greatest opportunity,"" said Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

The C40 group echoed months of Ocasio-Cortez's rhetoric, warning of an impending ""climate emergency"" and blaming ""a minority of very powerful, science-denying governments, representing the interests of the fossil-fuel industry"" for inaction.

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who also serves as C40's board president, portrayed the commitment as a way to improve public health and drive economic growth.

“Together, C40 cities have taken thousands of successful actions to reduce carbon emissions, and they are proving how fighting climate change helps drive economic growth and improve public health. There is no time to waste,"" he said.

DOOMSDAYS THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN: THINK TANK COMPILES DECADES' WORTH OF DIRE CLIMATE PREDICTIONS

Wednesday's news appeared to be a flagrant rebuke of the Trump administration's approach to foreign policy on climate change. The president controversially said he would rescind the U.S.'s support for the Paris Climate Agreement, citing economic impacts on cities like Pittsburgh.

It was also the latest indication that high-ranking officials were willing to embrace Ocasio-Cortez's ambitious vision for tackling climate change. A slew of 2020 Democratic candidates endorsed the framework of her ""Green New Deal"" while laying out multitrillion-dollar plans that involved substantial regulation.

Conservatives have balked at the plan as a thinly veiled attempt to bring socialism to the United States. The price tag alone could be problematic for Democrats in the 2020 election. Conservative estimates have projected the ""Green New Deal"" would cost trillions, inflict a heavy toll on economic growth and burden swing-state voters.

Advocates say that the alternative would be worse. ""We need to start getting comfortable with how extreme the problem is,"" Ocasio-Cortez previously said, ""because only until we accept ... how bad climate change is and how bad it can be for our children's lives, are we going to be comfortable pursuing really big solutions."""

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., announced that she would no longer be accepting campaign donations of more than $200 from big businesses and challenged her fellow White House hopefuls to be more transparent about how they’re funding their own campaigns.

Warren blasted some of her Democratic primary rivals in a post on Medium, in which she accused them of “hobnobbing with the rich and powerful” and “handing out secret titles and honors to rich donors.”

“I’m proud to be running a grassroots-funded campaign for president, and I hope my fellow candidates for the Democratic nomination will do the same,” Warren wrote. “That’s why I’m also calling on every candidate in this race to disclose any donor or fundraiser who has a special title on their campaign…and to disclose the dates and locations of their fundraising events and the names of every person who appears on a host committee on invitations tied to those events.”

THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL IN THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

Warren added: “If Democratic candidates for president want to spend their time hobnobbing with the rich and powerful, it is currently legal for them to do so – but they shouldn’t be handing out secret titles and honors to rich donors. Voters have a right to know who is buying access and recognition — and how much it costs.”

In her post, Warren does not specifically call out any of her fellow candidates, but her words appear to be a rebuke of Democratic presidential primary hopefuls like former Vice President Joe Bide, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif, and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Each of these candidates have raised millions of dollars through fundraisers and private events with wealthy donors — a practice that is common in both major political parties in the U.S.

Warren, along with fellow candidate and Vermont lawmaker Bernie Sanders, have spurned big-dollar donors this campaign season, in favor of relying on small-dollar, online donations. The results have surprisingly seen them outraising other candidates last quarter.

Warren’s critics have slammed her for holding fundraisers in the past and using some of the money left in her war chest to launch her 2020 presidential bid. But since announcing her candidacy, Warren has not taken any PAC or big-dollar donations.

“I’m not going to take any contributions over $200 from executives at big tech companies, big banks, private equity firms, or hedge funds,” Warren wrote. “And when I’m the Democratic nominee for president, I’m not going to change a thing in how I run my campaign: No PACs. No federal lobbyists. No special access or call time with rich donors or big dollar fundraisers to underwrite my campaign.”

Despite outraising most other candidates last quarter, Warren’s rivals still say that the small-dollar donations will hinder her chances of defeating President Trump should she win the Democratic nomination.

“We're not going to beat him with pocket change,"" Buttigieg said in a Snapchat post, adding that Democrats ""need the full spectrum of support in order to compete.”"

“Together, we’re building a movement that’s going to put power back in the hands of the people,” she pledged.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Warren’s third-quarter haul is up nearly $6 million from what she raised during the April-June quarter.

Her campaign announced that they received 943,000 contributions from more than a half-million individual donors, with 300,000 of those donors giving for the first time. And they reported that the average contribution to Warren was $26.

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg reported raising $19.1 million this quarter.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California reported bringing in $11.6 million in the third quarter, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang hauling in $10 million, triple what he raised in the second quarter. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey announced he raised over $6 million.

Best-selling spiritual author Marianne Williamson said she raised over $3 million and Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado reported raising $2.1 million.

President Trump’s reelection team, meanwhile, blew past all of them. The campaign announced that it and the Republican National Committee combined had brought in a massive $125 million in the third quarter.

Asked Thursday during a campaign stop in California how she could compete with Trump's massive war chest if she reaches the general election, Warren touted her ""grassroots movement"" and highlighted ""that's going to be our comparative advantage to win in November 2020.""

Tuesday was the first day campaigns could announce their third-quarter numbers, but they have until Oct. 15 to file their fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission.

""We don't have a homeless problem in California; we have a homeless epidemic and anyone who lives here can see that very clearly,"" Lahren said.

JOE, HUNTER BIDEN SEEN GOLFING WITH UKRAINE GAS COMPANY EXEC BACK IN 2014, PHOTO SHOWS

Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas and Councilman Joe Buscaino drafted a proposal urging Newsom to declare the state of emergency, which could redirect state and federal funds generally reserved for natural disasters like wildfires and earthquakes. It would also suspend some legal red tape that has halted affordable housing and shelter projects.

“Homelessness has ballooned into a crisis of seismic proportions outside of the control of the City of Los Angeles and the cities of the State of California,” wrote Buscaino. “The plight of individuals living on the streets jeopardizes the public health and safety of those individuals and imperils the broader citizenry of the State of California.”

Newsom said in a recent statement that “homelessness is a national emergency that demands more than just words, it demands action.""

In June he signed off on a $214.8 billion dollar budget, allocating $2.4 billion to address the state's housing and homelessness crisis.

However, a report to local lawmakers earlier in the year revealed that Los Angeles alone saw a 16 percent increase in its homeless population over the last year — a blow to Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and other officials working to combat the crisis.

""Throwing money at the problem does not solve the problem. We spent, in Los Angeles alone, $619 million dollars on the homeless epidemic last year. And, that's gotten us nowhere,"" said Lahren. ""Obviously, this is mismanagement of funds. This is failed leadership. And people think by just throwing money at the problem, it will solve the problem. But, it won't.""

""I have been really taking inventory of our leaders and those representatives in these districts,"" she said. ""And, I've been looking at their tweets. They tweet about 10 to 15 times a day.""

Lahren cited specific Twitter accounts including those of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, Rep. Maxine Waters, Rep. Ted Lieu, Rep. Karen Bass, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein.

""Shout out to all of the millennials for staying woke and supporting me all this time I've been warning Congress about Trump and why we needed to impeach him. Remember what I've always said: If you fight, you can win,"" Rep. Waters tweeted last Friday.

""It's going to be hard because the reality is that Republicans are going to cheat. They're going to try to keep people away from the polls, they're going to move polling places, they're going to do a whole variety of things,"" he told ""The Breakfast Club"" radio show.

Holder went on to argue that Republicans were able to suppress voting because of the Supreme Court's decision to strike down part of the Voting Rights Act in 2013.

“Sad, but not surprising, to see that disgraced former Attorney General Eric Holder has taken a break from threatening to 'kick' Republicans to leveling outlandish and baseless accusations against Republicans,” RNC spokesman Steve Guest told Fox News.

Holder's comments echoed those of Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams, who has repeatedly indicated she unfairly lost her gubernatorial race in 2018.

KAMALA HARRIS CLAIMS DEMOCRATS GILLUM, ABRAMS WOULD HAVE WON IN 2018 'WITHOUT VOTER SUPPRESSION'

""For the first time since 1981, the RNC will be allowed to cheat and lie and go into polling places and scare voters, particularly voters of color,"" Abrams said in August, citing the end of a consent decree related to voting.

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel blasted Abrams' comment as a ""flat-out lie."" RNC communications director Michael Ahrens responded by calling Abrams' statements ""totally baseless,"" and claiming that the RNC tried to increase voter turnout.

“What she’s saying is totally baseless and irresponsible,"" he previously said in a statement to Fox News. ""The RNC’s job is getting more people to vote, not less. If Abrams actually cared about the integrity of elections, she’d finally concede the governor’s race she lost by 55,000 votes. Even liberal election law experts have dismissed her claims as irresponsible and without merit.""

Holder has been outspoken since his former boss, President Obama, left office in 2017. He previously provoked Trump's ire when he suggested former First Lady Michelle Obama was too tame in her call to ""go high"" when the GOP goes ""low.""

""No. When they go low, we kick 'em,"" he said. He's also criticized Trump's 2016 campaign slogan and claimed the president could easily face prosecution after leaving office.

During his interview with ""The Breakfast Club"" on Monday, Holder suggested that Trump might try to stay in office to avoid jail time. ""As I've thought about it, I'm thinking ... I think he loses and then it'll be interesting between say November and January when he would have to start packing.""

He added that he wondered whether Trump would attempt to pardon himself. ""I don't think you can do that,"" Holder added, ""but no one's even thought about doing something like that."""

On Friday night's show he seemed to view radio jock Howard Stern as a kindred spirit.

"" ... (Y)ou and I are the last sane people,"" Maher told Stern at one point in their discussion, ""because we're liberals but we don't go for all the bulls--- on the far-left.""

""That's why you and I are the last sane people because we're liberals but we don't go for all the bulls--- on the far left."" — Bill Maher to Howard Stern

STAGE IS SET FOR RECORD-BREAKING DEMOCRATIC 2020 DEBATE

Maher also took aim at Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, the foreign-born associates of Rudy Giuliani who were arrested this week on campaign finance charges before allegedly attempting to flee the U.S.

""This is the great irony of the Trump presidency,"" Maher said. ""Foreign criminals must be kept out of the country at all costs, unless they're here to steal our elections.""

On the Trump impeachment inquiry, and Republicans' reluctance to cooperate with Democrat-led House committees, Maher quipped: ""The president of the United States is going to be impeached because he treats subpoenas like parking tickets.""

Maher also made the case that Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders were too ""far left"" to win the general election, and touted Sen. Amy Klobuchar as a ""dark horse"" who could potentially top the party's ticket.

Maher spoke to Klobuchar in a one-on-one interview. He argued that Klobuchar was ""plenty liberal"" but could actually beat President Trump.

""Obviously this is a fight between two wings of the party, which is almost every election. There is a center in the Democrat, a center-left wing. You're plenty liberal. You're plenty progressive,"" Maher told Klobuchar. ""And then there is a far-left which I think would be represented by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.""

Klobuchar would not address Warren and Sanders directly but clearly dismissed their platforms and pushed her center-left agenda.

""I want to win big and if someone is looking to kick one hundred forty nine million Americans off their current health insurance in four years then I'm not your candidate,"" Klobuchar said. ""If you want to use a bunch of hardworking people's money to send rich people's kids to college for free and I'm not your candidate. And just because people say ideas are bold doesn't mean they're bold. They may be bad.""

Maher also slammed former Vice President Joe Biden, saying he may be too old for the presidency, and that Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., wasn't doing well in the polls -- despite the media attention she's received after debate performances.

Klobuchar ripped Trump on his Ukraine phone call before making a case for her candidacy, saying ""she could bring in moderate Republicans"" and ""win big."" She is currently polling at 2 percent in the latest national Fox News Poll.

In an awkward moment, Maher emphasized that Klobuchar being a woman might help her chances as well.

""I'm saying it's a lot easier to be on the center side of things, as Obama was, if you are not a white man,"" Maher tried to clarify. ""If you're a white straight man.""

Klobuchar responded: ""I want to make clear and I am excited to be one of several women in this race. But I'm not just running on that.""

The freshman congresswoman is getting her very own action figure as part of a series of political toys created by a Brooklyn-based design company.

The company, FCTRY, showcased its ""AOC"" doll design through an online fundraising site, asking supporters to help finance its product along with other political action figures. The fundraiser started on Tuesday but has already surpassed its goal of $15,000, which it hoped to achieve by mid-November.

As of Tuesday afternoon, the campaign had nearly 800 backers and more than $20,000 in donations.

""We're toymakers, not prophets, so take what we say with a grain of salt,"" the company said. ""But we've got a pretty good track record of spotting real-life heroes in the making and from where we sit, AOC has the makings of a legend. So we're doing what we do best and turning her into an action figure.""

A promotional video debuts the ""AOC"" toy with a series of cheers describing her as a model feminist, activist and Democrat. ""Tell me what a role model looks like. This is what a role model looks like,"" voices on the video say in a call-and-response fashion typical of street protests.

FCTRY also displays infographics detailing the congresswoman's rise to prominence and touting her activism.

""Just two years ago, AOC was an anonymous 20-something waiting tables and tending bars in New York City, and now she is literally one of the most influential politicians in the United States. Things like this don't happen in real life, right?"" the company asked.

""But it is happening and we are all witnesses. What makes it even crazier is that she's just getting started. Like if this were a trilogy, we’re probably only about 45 minutes into part one -- aka the origin story -- so let's recap.""

The promotional video also praises AOC for supporting a climate protest outside of then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's office in November of 2018. Since becoming House speaker, Pelosi, D-Calif., has clashed with the congresswoman -- suggesting her social media following was relatively insignificant when compared with the amount of power she and other progressives had in Congress.

But FCTRY touted her Twitter following -- 5.5. million followers -- along with her status as the youngest congresswoman ever elected.

A harshly worded letter that was obtained by Fox News calls on parent company, Comcast's, board of directors to “override NBC’s decision and launch a full investigation of sexual misconduct within the news division,” allowed current and former staffers to speak out despite non-disclosure agreements and have an in-person meeting with sexual harassment victims and advocacy leaders.

Megyn Kelly, Addie Zinone, Linda Vester, Greta Van Susteren, Eleanor McManus and Gretchen Carlson signed the letter that is addressed to Comcast CEO Brian Roberts and the company’s board.

Ronan Farrow’s book, “Catch and Kill,” details claims that NBC News refused to expose movie mogul Harvey Weinstein as a sexual predator and wasn’t truthful regarding knowledge of alleged sexual misconduct by former “Today” co-host Matt Lauer.

“These were not isolated incidents. His years of predatory behavior toward female colleagues was tolerated by executives with the same attitudes toward women – some were even predators themselves,” the letter states.

“Certain network executives have enabled a corporate culture of widespread sexual harassment and abuse, and are still trying to cover it up today,” the letter said. “Comcast must prove to its shareholders that it will pursue the truth on behalf of NBC staffers. If necessary, it should remove executives who have abused or silenced women.”

The letter specifically calls out NBC News chairman Andy Lack and his top deputy, Noah Oppenheim, along with MSNBC president Phil Griffin.

“Are these the men you want running a news network news reliant on the FCC for license renewal?” the letter asked.

NBC NEWS BOSS ANDY LACK’S LEADERSHIP SCRUTINIZED AS RONAN FARROW TELL-ALL APPROACHES

Oppenheim, the president of NBC News, has downplayed Farrow’s reporting, but the book’s release has put the scandal back in the national spotlight, adding pressure to NBCUniversal and its parent company Comcast.

Hilary Smith, NBCUniversal senior vice president of communications, recently told NPR that “top leaders of NBC News still have the confidence of senior leadership within the company.” Smith also told The Hollywood Reporter that a new investigation

After the Weinstein and Lauer bombshells were reported in 2017, NBC refused to hire an outside investigator to determine who knew about Lauer’s sexual misconduct and whether NBC executives looked the other way. NBC relied on in-house general counsel Kim Harris despite widespread calls for an outside law firm to conduct the review.

NBC’s internal review eventually declared that management was completely oblivious to Lauer’s behavior and Harris’ colleagues were cleared by the network.

""There is no additional investigation being launched. We are very confident in the report that was conducted,” Smith told THR. ""We fired Matt Lauer within 24 hours of learning what he did, and promptly launched a corporate investigation. Based on our investigative findings, we have swiftly taken appropriate actions to address the situation and improve workplace culture. It is also worth noting that this was a corporate investigation that was conducted by an almost entirely female team, none of whom are part of the News division.""

Brady revealed Wednesday on NBC Sports Boston’s “Quick Slants” he has been wearing the same shoulder pads since he joined the Michigan Wolverines as a freshman in 1995.

TOM BRADY UNHAPPY WITH PATRIOTS' DECISION TO RELEASE ANTONIO BROWN, LEFT HIM 'BUMMED OUT': REPORT

“I’ve worn them for 25 years,” Brady said. “They’ve gotten reconditioned a little bit, but I think once you find something you like, you kind of stick with it. I’ve always kind of liked the way they felt, the shape of them. People have tried to put me in a lot of other ones.”

Brady said the pads are light enough and offer him the right amount of protection and still allow him to move around. He said he worked with then-Michigan equipment manager Jon Falk to get the right fit.

TOM BRADY'S POPULARITY TIED TO RISE IN 'WHITE RAGE AND WHITE SUPREMACY,' PROFESSOR SAYS

“It becomes a personal thing and you never want to mess with that. So as long as they're happy, I'm happy,” Falk said. “Quarterbacks always want to get their arms up, so we had to get special caps on their shoulder pads, and special epaulets. They were smaller, so you could raise your arm up and the flexibility was just unbelievable.”

Brady has been wearing the pads for longer than some of his teammates have been around walking the Earth. Jake Bailey, Ja’Whaun Bentley, Bryan Cowart, Damien Harris, Ryan Izzo, J.C. Jackson, Jakobi Meyers, Gunner Olszewski, Jarrett Stidham, and Joejuan Williams are all younger than the pads.
