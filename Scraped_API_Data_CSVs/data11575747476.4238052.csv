I remember in history class, must have been a junior, it was during the impeachment process of President Clinton or all the scandal, everything that was going on. And I remember the teacher was just kind of riffing on this, and he said, you know, would anybody here ever want to be president or want to run for office, seeing what a mess and what an ugly place Washington was? And I just — maybe involuntarily, my hand went up. And from then on, it became that the running joke of the class that I’d wind up running for president. And then by the time I got to college, they had this Institute of Politics at Harvard, and every day, there’d be a different speaker who would come through. And I remember when I was there as a freshman, people like Donna Brazile who had just come off managing the Gore campaign and Rick Davis, who had done the same thing for McCain. And the former president of Ecuador, he’d been deposed in a coup. You’d just kind of hang around and watch them and see what they were like. The biggest realization was that they’re just people. These people who were shaping the world, people I was seeing on TV were obviously very impressive people, but they were just people. I think it changed my awareness of the fact that, on some level, I could be part of that world, too. But in a very simple sense, especially coming from Indiana, it seemed that it was a choice. You could be in elected office, or you could be an out gay person, not both, at least not where I was from. From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

Pete Buttigieg. It’s Friday, November 22. So Jeremy Peters, you cover politics for The Times, and you’ve been closely tracking Mayor Buttigieg. And in order to better understand the Democratic field of presidential candidates, we’re trying to figure out the most revealing moments in their lives. So when it comes to Pete Buttigieg, what moment should we focus on?

jeremy peters

Well, Mayor Pete has always been a candidate for whom his story, his biography is very central to his appeal to voters, and he’s got a great story to tell. He’s been elected mayor of this medium-sized town in Indiana before turning 30. He has an Ivy League pedigree. He’s been a Rhodes Scholar. He’s worked at a prestigious consulting firm. He’s gone off to Afghanistan as part of the Navy Reserves. So he has all of these components that you kind of think if you’re a voter, wow, he really stands out. There’s something unique about this guy. But at the same time, for most of his adult life, he had this nagging secret, the secret that he couldn’t confront because he thought that it would mean the end to this political career that he had spent so much time perfecting, basically since he went away to college and decided, hey, you know, I can run for president. And he doesn’t see how it’s possible for the politician with the perfect background, the perfect resume to also be open about their sexuality, in his case. So how he reconciles this inner turmoil with his very public ambition I think is a defining moment in his life, if not the defining moment.

michael barbaro

All right. Welcome to the studio.

pete buttigieg

Thank you.

michael barbaro

You’re going to sit there.

pete buttigieg

All right.

jeremy peters

So that story begins in 1982 in South Bend, Indiana where Peter Buttigieg was born.

michael barbaro

Mayor, tell me about the kind of kid that you were, growing up in Indiana?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think I was, safe to say, a little on the nerdy side. I lived in a neighborhood kind of in the middle of South Bend, close to a park where you would have as much as possible what you’d call a prototypical Midwestern kid’s upbringing, you know, playing in the park with friends, a lot of time in the house. I was really interested in baseball cards, but I was more interested in categorizing them than I was in baseball, I think. I loved science and science fiction. I loved reading, plus I was an only child. So I think it’s safe to say I had a lot of interior life going on in a fairly quiet house where it was a dog and my parents, who were both academics, and me.

michael barbaro

What was your introduction to even the idea of politics?

pete buttigieg

Politics was always in the air in our house just because my parents were very politically passionate. They really cared about what was happening. I can remember the Democratic Convention. It must have been 1988.

archived recording NBC News continues its coverage of America’s convention.

pete buttigieg

I would’ve been six years old and my parents explaining what a convention was. I remember Jesse Jackson giving a speech.

archived recording (jesse jackson) When I look out at this convention, I see the face of America — red, yellow, brown, black, and white. We are all precious in God’s sight, the real rainbow coalition.

pete buttigieg

And I remember my parents thinking it was important to watch the Republican Convention, too. I mean, you would stop — even though I don’t it ever crossed their mind to ever vote for a Republican.

archived recording Now let’s go down to the podium. Here is George Herbert Walker Bush addressing his convention.

pete buttigieg

Everything in the house would kind of stop when it was time to watch what was playing out.

archived recording Thank you.

michael barbaro

At what moment in this early phase of your life did you go from just watching this and maybe finding it very fascinating to feeling really drawn to it?

pete buttigieg

Well, when I got to college, it felt like the Republicans and the Democrats, at the time, it’s crazy to think about now, polarized as we are. But what it felt like when I showed up as a freshman on campus was that the two parties were converging and not necessarily in a good place, that you had this kind of center-right and center-left, both of them very committed to growth in business, but it seemed not very committed at all to some of the questions of how we take care of vulnerable people around the country. And I think there’s a moment for any kind of well-spoken or intelligent young person watching the news when you see a senator or a candidate saying something or doing something and you think, well, that’s not right. I could do that. I could do it different. Now, you might be wrong. They might be way more sophisticated than you are, and you can’t see it. Or you might be right, and it might well be the case that what they’re saying is just not right. But I certainly had that feeling reinforced when I saw these figures come to campus, some of whom were extremely impressive, but none of whom seemed like they were on a different plane of existence. They were just people.

michael barbaro

So at this point, a year or two into Harvard, have you made up your mind that you were probably going to find a way to have a career in politics?

pete buttigieg

I knew I wanted a career that involved policy. I don’t think I’d figured out for sure that that meant running. Plus, you know, when I thought about it, even well before I was coming to terms with the fact that I was gay, I knew that I had no political connections at home. I had an unpronounceable name, and I was a Democrat who lived in Indiana. So it was not obvious that I could overcome some of the obstacles toward running. But I think it’s safe to say by the time I graduated, I had some sense that I could see myself doing it.

michael barbaro

Well, I want to talk to you about that realization of your sexuality in particular. Obviously, your candidacy is historic in a couple of different ways, and among those is the fact you’re the first major party presidential candidate who is openly gay. And so I want to ask you about that part of your identity. When did you sense that you were gay? When did that realization start to dawn on you?

pete buttigieg

I think it depends what you mean by realization, right? There are things you could point to going way back, certainly a fascination I had with a classmate when I was about 12 that, in hindsight, is very obviously a crush. But I was not willing to think of it that way, although some part of me must have — I mean, I wasn’t stupid either, right? So you have this kind of awareness that was definitely there by the time I was hitting middle school. But taking a word like gay and applying it to myself, I was still years away from being able to do that, even in my own mind.

michael barbaro

Well, what did you do with those feelings?

pete buttigieg

I guess I packed them up, yeah.

michael barbaro

Packed them up —

pete buttigieg

Not much would be the best answer.

michael barbaro

Pack them up and put them where?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I don’t know how these things work, even in your own mind. I just didn’t explore them. That’s for sure. First of all, there were not a lot of out gay people that I knew as such growing up. I mean, in high school, it was exactly zero. There was just no sense of gay life or a gay community. And when I got to college, that’s when the kind of internal battle was starting to heat up.

michael barbaro

Why?

pete buttigieg

I think because you just can’t escape it. I mean, my god, you’re in college, right? I mean, any feelings you have, especially in the romantic department, are going to start asserting themselves even more fiercely than they have when you get to college. For a lot of people, it’s a big part of what you spend college on.

michael barbaro

Right. So how did you deal with it?

pete buttigieg

Same way I dealt with it up to then, just packed it away. Dated women, remarkable women. Because I enjoyed these relationships, I think I could defer facing the fact that that wasn’t the same as what it was to be in love with somebody.

michael barbaro

And your political ambition was already solid at that point?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I still didn’t know exactly where it would take me or what it would mean, but I think by then, I knew that there was a good chance I was going to be running for office in my adult life. But at that point, I’m still clinging to some kind of hope, however vanishing, that maybe I’m straight or I’m bisexual and I can just not worry about the gay part. I think when I thought about my career, certainly when I talked about my future and how I was going to be involved, I wasn’t even thinking about the possibility that that would come into contact with this developing side of me. But I’m sure to the extent that I thought what it would mean to come to terms with the fact that I was at very least different and, as became increasingly clear, gay, that one of the things that would have kept that in its corner was the simple fact that that didn’t fit with any of the other things I wanted to do in life, not just a career, but a family. I wanted to get married. I wanted to have kids. From my perspective, you could be married and have kids or you could be gay, not both.

michael barbaro

You graduated in 2004. That — correct me if I’m wrong. That’s the year when Massachusetts —

pete buttigieg

That’s right.

michael barbaro

— legalizes gay marriage.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

archived recording The court today, as you know, in a 4-3 advisory opinion to the Senate has a rule that in a November 18, 2003 decision, they meant marriage. They meant equality. They meant that the Commonwealth may no longer deny marriage rights to same-sex couples, including —

michael barbaro

So I say that only to try to understand, are you falling behind the culture, in a sense? Are you ignoring some of the signs that these things are changing?

archived recording Marriage and only marriage will be enough to satisfy the requirements of the Massachusetts Constitution.

pete buttigieg

Well, the thing is I wasn’t from Massachusetts. I was in Massachusetts for a while, but I never felt like I was from there. And nothing against Massachusetts, but I realized pretty quick after turning up at Harvard that I didn’t belong there either.

michael barbaro

Why not?

pete buttigieg

It was just — it was just a different culture. I didn’t realize that. I didn’t realize that I was Midwestern until I left the Midwest. And just little things, cultural things, the way — I don’t know, the way people interact, what’s expected of you. Once I got there, I realized that socially, I was way more Midwestern than I thought.

michael barbaro

So take me from graduating from Harvard to your decision to join the Navy Reserves.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so it starts with 9/11. Actually, it starts before 9/11. There’s this family tradition of serving in the military. There’s a painting hanging on the wall of my parents’ house of a relative, a great uncle who I kind of idolized in theory. He was an Army Air Corps pilot. And so I had this idea, this maybe romantic idea, of being in the military, and then it never really became real. But I remember on 9/11 thinking, oh, well, war isn’t just a thing that happens in other places or in other periods of history. Like, war has come to my generation, and thinking, at least in the back of my head, that that might mean I would be involved, but not taking any steps to do that. But that turned into more and more of a nagging feeling when some friends of mine started to serve. A friend of mine from college shared with me just before we graduated that he had decided to join the Navy Reserve. I was fascinated. And then when I was talking to someone about applying for the Rhodes Scholarship and how I wanted to talk about my interest in public service and to the faculty member who was giving advice to students, and just said, pointedly, like, you might want to really think about how you’re going to say that, knowing that you’re going to be competing against people from the military academies. Oh yeah, that’s true. Like, my chest thumping about caring about public service feels a lot smaller held up against what others are doing.

michael barbaro

Do you think that was one of the things that might have drawn you to military service, knowing that to get a Rhodes, to be in that world, in that league, you know, it might be a good thing?

pete buttigieg

I think definitely that it was part of how you’re true to a culture of service. And also the Kennedy presidency kind of hangs over certainly the Kennedy School, as you might imagine. And that can’t be separated from his military career.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

I mean, really, it was almost an expectation that you would’ve served, up until roughly the time when I came of age when everything shifted.

michael barbaro

An expectation that you would serve —

pete buttigieg

Well, when you’re looking at the history of the people we were studying —

michael barbaro

Of presidents.

pete buttigieg

— who have made history. Yep, as presidents. And then the thing that put me over the top was this experience knocking on doors in Iowa with a couple of buddies from college who went out. We took a week off and rented a car, and it was the last few days before the Iowa caucuses, and we were volunteers for Obama. They sent us to this very rural area, some of the lowest income counties in Iowa. And it felt like any time I met a young — especially young man — it was somebody who was serving or was about to serve. And I started to realize, we had service that used to be something that bridged people together. Now it’s completely different, that if you were rural or low-income, you were highly likely to serve. If you were from a background like mine, which was middle class economically, but I’d had the chance to go to an institution like Harvard, almost nobody with that background was serving. And I began to feel like it wasn’t just this kind of thing I thought about that I hadn’t gotten around to. It was that I was part of the problem. I was part of the divide. That was the thing that kind of propelled me that last few inches toward being ready to yank open the door of the recruiting office in Indiana and say, hey, how do I sign up?

michael barbaro

I wondered, do you think you joined the military in part because you knew what it would mean for a political career?

pete buttigieg

You know, I wrestled with that because as soon as I get that question, there’s a part of me that thinks, if the answer is yes, does that mean the service wasn’t pure in some way? And I remember at the time asking myself if being in the military was as unpopular as it is today popular, would I still do it? And I want to believe the answer is yes, but there’s no way to go back and prove it. I’m not somebody who thinks that it’s, like, a prerequisite that if you want to run for office you need to have served. But I do think if you have a heart for elected office, one way to put your money where your mouth is to have been in that kind of service, too.

michael barbaro

That strikes me as a very candid answer because of course, you could just say, well, of course I would have done it, even if there was no possible —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

— political benefit.

pete buttigieg

And I want to say that. I just can’t prove it.

michael barbaro

So I want to talk about this run for mayor for just a little bit. Whenever you run for office, your character is on display. And at this point, you are keeping something quite elemental about yourself secret. Did it feel like you were hiding something?

pete buttigieg

Not really. The only time it felt that way was when there was small talk about whether I was dating, and I would crack a joke or something. We’d be sitting in a studio like this one and a radio host would ask a question. And I’d say, well, if anybody listening is into economic policy and long walks on the beach, go ahead and reach out and just kind of play the busy single person, which is what I was, except for the fact that I wasn’t actively looking for love. I was going out of my way to avoid it. But if somebody who is straight up asked me on the record, to this day, I’m not sure what I would have done.

michael barbaro

Do you think that that would have potentially cost you the mayoralty, might have kept you from being mayor or staying mayor?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I think there’s a good chance of it. There’s a reason why no — as far as I know, no out gay person had ever run for mayor of any place in Indiana.

michael barbaro

This is a state with strong Christian values, and —

pete buttigieg

— not known for progressive social outlooks on politics. And here I am, rocking up, 29 years old saying, trust me, support me. Never mind this state legislator who has earned tons of credibility in this community. Never mind this county councilman who’s the party favorite. Go with me instead. If there had been anything that looked like a skeleton or a vulnerability, I think it probably would have sunk me before I got anywhere at all.

michael barbaro

So I want to now move into this notion of you reconciling these things.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so when I first joined the Reserve, the message was kind of you’re pretty much going to go to one of these wars, and we’ll let you know which one. And so I knew that, at a certain point, it was coming. And of course, I didn’t want to take office in South Bend without a plan for this. So we had gamed it out with my team, if I get orders, here’s what you do. And when I received my orders and knew I was going for sure, I don’t think even then it occurred to me that it would have much to do with my sexuality. If anything, I was thankful that I was single, right? The hardest thing for people to deploy is the fact that you’re leaving behind somebody you love, in addition to all the professional complications. But then, the more I started getting mentally ready for going over and really thinking about what it meant, the more it started weighing on me that I didn’t have a — wasn’t coming back to a family, my parents, of course, but I wasn’t coming back to a household. And more than that, I had no idea what it was like to be in love. And the idea that I’m — here I am. I’m a grown-ass man. I own a home. I’m the mayor of my city. I’m a military officer. And if I get killed over there, I will go to my grave not knowing what it’s like to be in love. And that just made me realize how untenable the situation I was in really was. And up until then, it didn’t seem untenable, I guess because I was so busy, and I might have deferred coming out and having a dating life forever, if not for this moment where I’m thinking, shit, I could die.

michael barbaro

You wrote a letter I want to ask you about.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, you know, it’s a thing you do. I assume everybody does it. I don’t know. But it’s the thing you do when you go to war, right? You want to make sure that you have the last word on your life and leave a few instructions. So I wrote up a letter, put an envelope, put just in case on the outside. Put it in the desk drawer, would’ve been pretty easy to find if worse comes to worst. And that’s a real moment, too, because you’re sitting there staring at the screen trying to figure out how to give a short accounting of your life.

michael barbaro

And what did you say?

pete buttigieg

Well, what I said was that I wouldn’t want people to think that I’d been cheated, that obviously it’d be terrible if I didn’t come back, but I also had this amazing life where I have wonderful friendships, and I got to serve my community in a way that very few people get to do, let alone at my age, and that I’d had this very fulfilling life. And of course, it’d be too bad if something happened to me, but to keep that in perspective. But if you’re asking if there was, like, P.S. I’m gay, no.

michael barbaro

That’s kind of what I was asking. So you are deployed.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

You do not die.

pete buttigieg

Right.

michael barbaro

You come back, and you’re mayor.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

And how do you decide that it’s time to come out?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think by the time I hit the ground and I was back, I knew that I was going to come out and then it’s just — it was more how and when. I remember resenting the idea that you’re supposed to have to come out, right? Straight people don’t have to come out. Why do I? And then, while I’m in the process of figuring this out —

archived recording Thank you all for coming. It’s been a tough week here in the Hoosier state, but we’re going to move forward.

pete buttigieg

We have this explosive controversy over Mike Pence, the Governor Mike Pence and his so-called Religious Freedom bill.

archived recording The Religious Freedom Restoration Act was about religious liberty, not about discrimination.

pete buttigieg

So suddenly, we’re on national television, my state, as the most officially anti-gay state in the country. I’m fighting him on it, of course, because it’s a terrible policy. But now, I’m fighting this terrible, anti-gay policy putatively from the perspective of a straight ally, wondering whether I’m more effective because people don’t know that I’m gay. And at the same time, knowing that this just kind of speeds things up even more that, like, it’s just a really weird position to be in, to be having all these hypothetical arguments about discrimination against gay people, when it really means me. Meanwhile, this is also the period when we realize that soon the Supreme Court is going to weigh in on marriage. I mean, all of this was happening in that early part of 2015 while I’m wrestling with how to do this. And so oddly enough, it was — — as busy as I was as mayor. Military duty actually felt like, kind of almost like a break because it was eight hour days, 40 hour week. I wasn’t used to having that much time, and so is a lot of time to sit and write and think and call friends and get advice.

michael barbaro

So you produce a plan.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, well I produced a letter, an op-ed I guess.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. What was the essential line that I’m sure you remember that you wrote?

pete buttigieg

I remember saying that it’s just part of who I am and that it has no bearing on how I do my job, that the way I do my — did my job either as an officer or as a mayor or in business had nothing to do with the fact that I was gay and that —

michael barbaro

It still sounds a little defensive.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Or maybe a little scared.

pete buttigieg

Probably. Yeah, I mean, you know, I didn’t feel like I was coming out guns blazing. I felt like I — again, part of me was bothered that I had to share this at all. Then part of me knew that it would do some good if I did, I mean, not just in my own life. That I — my main agenda was, personally, I wanted to get out there and start dating. But also that it would mean something, might mean all kinds of things to a whole bunch of different people when I came out and said this.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording A very personal announcement coming from South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg today. In an essay published in today’s South Bend Tribune, the mayor announced he is gay. Currently in the midst of running for a second term, Pete Buttigieg penned an essay in Tuesday’s South Bend Tribune revealing he was gay. A lot of people wondering why he chose to make this announcement now. It comes just months after the state’s religious freedom law thrust the state into the national debate on gay rights. As for the mayor himself, he says nothing is different, nothing has changed, and his focus is on South Bend.

michael barbaro

I want to talk about the timing, the exact moment of the op-ed because my sense is that at this phase of your career, you’re up for re-election, right? You’ve won the primary. And winning the primary, in a sense, means you’re standing a very good shot of winning.

pete buttigieg

Depending on the year, but yeah, in South Bend, it should be.

michael barbaro

So does that mean you deliberately chose a — like, a safe, low-risk time to do this?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I would think that going into a Democratic primary would be a safer time than going into a general election. And I think also the decision to do this came by way of realizing that there is no such thing as a safe time. I was just done with not having the kind of personal life that I wanted to have.

michael barbaro

So once you come out, how does your personal life change?

pete buttigieg

Well, I started dating, and that kind of changes everything. I mean, I still had this very demanding job. You’re the mayor, and so anybody in town that you ask to have a cup of coffee is —

michael barbaro

It’s a thing.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, it’s a thing. It might be misinterpreted. You could cross some line without meaning to. I mean, most of the people I interacted with were either people who needed something from me, people I needed something from or people who worked for me. So it’s not, like, a very healthy pool for dating is what I’m saying. And I remember thinking there were all these kind of city fathers who, early on in my time as mayor, seemed determined to fix me up with their daughters. And I remember just thinking, like, where are you now? Did none of you have, like, a son or a nephew or something? So I did what millennials do. I went online. Turns out there’s apps for all of this. There was O.K. Cupid, Tinder. The one that actually came through for me was called Hinge. And it’s supposed to serve up people that — I don’t know how the algorithm works. But I find this guy, this cute guy with a big smile, and I’m like, I want to know this guy. So we start chatting. Well, I was chatting with a lot of people, but obviously, he’s the one I remember because that was Chasten.

Your future husband.

Yes.

michael barbaro

So your story, to many people, is particularly compelling one, everything we just discussed. You are a Harvard graduate, a Rhodes Scholar, you’re a veteran. You’re gay. You’re religious. And from your own description of yourself, it feels like you have been thinking about politics and preparing, to some degree, to run for president for a very long time, even though you’re quite young. And I’m sure you understand this and have heard this. That has led to this perception of a person kind of, perhaps, orchestrating a political biography. Do you ever question whether that, no matter what your intention, is — could possibly undermine the power of the story itself, however genuine?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I mean, I think we’re conditioned to not like the idea of somebody who sat around thinking all their lives about how to become president. And I don’t view myself that way, although I get that that story has been written around me. Although, I also don’t know what it is we expect, that somebody kind of gets struck by lightning and then they turn into somebody who might become president. We all have these paths, right, that bring us to where we are. And I think anybody in professional life or even social life thinks about the story that you tell about yourself. At the end of the day, I’m not doing this because I have this personal need to be in elected office or to be the president. I’m not coming at the presidency as a thing that I’d like to occupy. I’m coming at it as this way to do something that I think I’m able to do. And I think it’s helpful in the sense that I could also have a very happy life doing something else. And oddly, I think that — that helps prepare me to do what’s required to do this. And this is advice I give talking to students, too. Imagine somebody is being sworn in, an ambitious, talented person kind of in the middle of their career is being sworn in as an assistant secretary in the State Department for the Middle East. And then imagine if that person has got there one of two ways. In kind of universe A, it’s a person who woke up one day in high school and said, I want to be the assistant secretary for the Middle East, and took the right courses and got the right jobs and had the right fellowships and wrote the right papers and did everything in order to occupy that title. And the other person is somebody who said, I — woke up in high school and said, I want to be the person who makes the United States a force toward peace in the Middle East. And they don’t know what that’s going to mean, and maybe it means they start out becoming an activist or maybe they’re an academic or maybe they’re a civil servant or whatever. But by whatever winding path, they wind up in this job, right? Which of those two scenarios is going to lead to somebody who’s better equipped to take that job they’ve been handed? I’ve got to think it’s the latter. And so what I’ve tried to do in my life is to prepare myself to be useful to others. And yes, I think that, in all likelihood, means in a form that involves holding office or seeking office or at least public life where I speak to lots of people, sometimes millions at the same time. But it’s not about, necessarily, having one title or another. And so I think if you overthink it, that’s where you start to lose the fidelity to what it is that would guide you when you actually get what you’ve been chasing for a long time. Jeremy, what do we learn from Mayor Pete Buttigieg about the way he reconciled his political ambition with this essential fact about himself that he feared would endanger that ambition?

jeremy peters

I think we learn a lot about his decision-making process, not just how he internalizes decisions personally, but how he thinks about them in the longer arc of a political career. And he’s been very intentional all along the way about choosing certain endeavors that he thinks would benefit a long-term political career. Now some people would think, on the one hand, that’s too calculating. I don’t want somebody who’s thought about being president since he was a teenager. And, you know, in the era when voters seemed to prize authenticity in their political figures, they could see that as inauthentic. On the other hand, the decision that he made to wait seems to have borne out to his benefit. I mean, here he is, the first openly gay candidate for president of the United States who has a legitimate shot at being his party’s nominee. Look at where he is in the Democratic primary right now. He’s rocketed to the top of the polls. He’s brought in all this money in large part because he’s gay, and that opened a lot of doors with Democratic donors. He’s heading into the Iowa caucuses in the lead by some measures. But we won’t know if his decision to wait actually was the right one until people start voting. So it seems to have worked out well for him right now, but no one’s cast a single vote. And we don’t know how voters in the Democratic primary are going to react. We certainly don’t know how voters in a general election are going to react. So we’re just not going to know until Democratic voters have their say.

michael barbaro

Mayor, when you think back to your younger self —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Not just your teenage self, but even your college self and your post-collegiate self who was so fearful about telling the world that you were gay, what do you kind of wish you could tell that person, that version of Mayor Buttigieg?

pete buttigieg

Well, back then, I would have thought this other fact, if I dared to unpack it, this fact about my life, this way in which I was different, was the thing that could multiply all the other stuff by zero, in terms of the impact I was going to have in the world, that I might very well choose that path, but that the price would be that I wouldn’t get to make a difference in public life. And if you want proof of God having a sense of humor, one of the things I’m seeing now, especially in the interactions I have on the campaign trail and the fact that this campaign is historic in a lot of ways, is that that same fact that I thought would mean never getting to this point might actually be one of the things that makes it matter the most.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

It’s a strange thing to think about that the one thing that I couldn’t control, the one thing that might have meant that it would be better not to have any aspirations related to politics at all could be the very thing that anchors the moral and emotional purpose of this entire campaign.

michael barbaro

In the latest public testimony before impeachment investigators, Fiona Hill, the former top Russia expert on the National Security Council, recalled her growing frustration with Ambassador Gordon Sondland, as she realized he was pursuing a political agenda in Ukraine on behalf of President Trump.

archived recording (fiona hill) He was being involved in a domestic, political errand, and we were being involved in national security foreign policy and those two things have just diverged.

michael barbaro

Hill testified that when Trump and Sondland pressed Ukraine to investigate the discredited theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, they were playing directly into Russia’s hands, since Russia wants to deflect attention away from its interference.

archived recording (fiona hill) This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves. These fictions are harmful, even if they’re deployed for purely domestic, political purposes.

Here we go again.” At the heart of an impeachment inquiry is a nine-page whistle-blower complaint that names over two dozen people. Not counting the president himself, these are the people that appear the most: First, Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani. According to documents and interviews, Giuliani has been involved in shadowy diplomacy on behalf of the president’s interests. He encouraged Ukrainian officials to investigate the Biden family’s activities in the country, plus other avenues that could benefit Trump like whether the Ukrainians intentionally helped the Democrats during the 2016 election. It was an agenda he also pushed on TV. “So you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden.” “Of course I did!” A person Giuliani worked with, Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine’s former prosecutor general. He pushed for investigations that would also benefit Giuliani and Trump. Lutsenko also discussed conspiracy theories about the Bidens in the U.S. media. But he later walked back his allegations, saying there was no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens. This is where Hunter Biden comes in, the former vice president’s son. He served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company run by this guy, who’s had some issues with the law. While Biden was in office, he along with others, called for the dismissal of Lutsenko’s predecessor, a prosecutor named Viktor Shokin, whose office was overseeing investigations into the company that Hunter Biden was involved with. Shokin was later voted out by the Ukrainian government. Lutsenko replaced him, but was widely criticized for corruption himself. When a new president took office in May, Volodymyr Zelensky, Zelensky said that he’d replace Lutsenko. Giuliani and Trump? Not happy. They viewed Lutsenko as their ally. During a July 25 call between Trump and the new Ukrainian president, Trump defended him, saying, “I heard you had a prosecutor who is very good and he was shut down and that’s really unfair.” In that phone call, Trump also allegedly asked his counterpart to continue the investigation into Joe Biden, who is his main rival in the 2020 election. Zelensky has publicly denied feeling pressured by Trump. “In other words, no pressure.” And then finally, Attorney General William Barr, who also came up in the July 25 call. In the reconstructed transcript, Trump repeatedly suggested that Zelensky’s administration could work with Barr and Giuliani to investigate the Bidens and other matters of political interest to Trump. Since the whistle-blower complaint was made public, Democrats have criticized Barr for dismissing allegations that Trump had violated campaign finance laws during his call with Zelensky and not passing along the complaint to Congress. House Democrats have now subpoenaed several people mentioned in the complaint, as an impeachment inquiry into the president’s conduct continues."

Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, agreed with that recommendation, but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo argued against releasing the call record, saying that it would hurt American diplomacy if foreign leaders thought their conversations with the president might be made public. Mr. Pompeo was also on the call — which he initially obscured — giving him added reason to not want it publicly aired.

Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, was not included in the discussion and instead was among a number of aides blindsided when he learned that the president had decided to release the reconstructed transcript. In New York with Mr. Trump for meetings at the United Nations, Mr. Mulvaney declared to other aides that he would not be the one defending the call, according to people involved in the matter.

In the run-up to the release of the Ukraine call notes, the White House and the Justice Department exchanged plans for how they would share the information. Mr. Barr said that he could not recall whether Mr. Trump asked him to hold a news conference, according to an administration official. When the Justice Department said it would release a statement rather than hold a news conference saying that it found no campaign finance violation, the White House did not push back, according to an administration official.

To the extent that Mr. Trump was convinced that releasing the reconstructed transcript would clear him of wrongdoing, it was a major miscalculation. The record showed that after Mr. Zelensky talked about his country’s need for more security aid from the United States in the face of Russian aggression, Mr. Trump immediately pivoted and asked him to “do us a favor, though,” and investigate a conspiracy theory about Ukraine’s involvement with Democrats in 2016 as well as Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden.

Democrats have seized on that to say it made clear the president was pressing a foreign power for help against his domestic political rivals. In the days that followed, reports emerged about Mr. Barr’s own contacts with foreign leaders for help investigating the origins of the Russia interference investigation. While the Ukraine pressure campaign is separate from the Justice Department’s newest investigation into the 2016 election, critics have said it is more evidence that the Trump administration is trying to carry out work that personally benefits Mr. Trump.

Since the release of the reconstructed transcript, Mr. Trump has grown irked when he sees news coverage asserting that the call was problematic, harkening back to the fact that Mr. Barr was among those who told him it would be wise to release it, according to two people close to the president. One of them said that Mr. Mulvaney has fueled the president’s concerns about Mr. Barr, telling Mr. Trump that it was a mistake to make the document public.

In the call, which took place the day after Mr. Mueller testified before Congress, effectively ending his inquiry, Mr. Trump suggested that Mr. Barr was part of his effort to get damaging information about Democrats. “I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it,” Mr. Trump told Mr. Zelensky."

At a presidential forum sponsored by the League of United Latin American Citizens in Des Moines last month, Mr. Sanders spoke after Julián Castro, the former housing secretary, and Beto O’Rourke, the former Texas congressman. Only Mr. Sanders received a standing ovation as he entered the room.

In Los Angeles, a core group of Sanders volunteers from 2016 has stayed involved in causes they care about — successfully campaigning for a $15 minimum wage, marching with teachers during a weeklong strike for higher salaries and lobbying for Medicaid for undocumented immigrants.

Now, they are further galvanized by President Trump’s divisive language and hard-line policies toward immigrants. They are pressing their parents and their neighbors to join them, volunteering their Spanish at phone banks and organizing in the heavily Latino suburbs east of Los Angeles.

“In most campaigns, Latinos are usually an afterthought — we’re explicitly saying this is a cornerstone of our campaign,” said Rafael Návar , the California state director for the Sanders campaign. Earlier this month, the campaign opened field offices in the Central Valley and the Inland Empire, two heavily Latino regions of the state that are often overlooked in national elections. “We’re running the biggest operation in the biggest state, so we’re going to do better than we did the last time.”

In 2016, Mr. Sanders captured 45.7 percent of Democratic voters in California’s primary, compared to Hillary Clinton’s 53.4 percent.

The Sanders campaign office in East Los Angeles is tucked between taquerias in a small strip mall. During the October Democratic debate, it was filled with raucous energy — people in plastic folding chairs whooped with each jab Mr. Sanders took at the candidates surrounding him onstage."

A Steyer aide resigned

Pat Murphy, the Iowa political director for Tom Steyer, resigned after reports that he had offered campaign contributions to local Iowa candidates if they endorsed Mr. Steyer. The campaign said no contributions had actually been made.

“Our campaign policy is clear that we will not engage in this kind of activity, or any kind of communication that could be perceived as improper,” Mr. Steyer’s campaign manager, Heather Hargreaves, said in a statement on Friday announcing Mr. Murphy’s resignation. “Violation of this policy is not tolerated.”

Our colleague Stephanie Saul has more details on Mr. Murphy’s actions.

Sanders released an immigration plan

Mr. Sanders unveiled his immigration plan on Thursday, pledging to use executive action if Congress does not pass comprehensive legislation.

He said that on the first day of his presidency, he would reverse President Trump’s immigration policies, including the denial of asylum claims and the “zero tolerance” policy that has led to family separations. He also vowed to halt all deportations “until a thorough audit of current and past practices and policies is complete.”

More broadly, he called for ending deportations of people who have been in the United States for more than five years, creating a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, expanding the DACA program and making unauthorized immigration a civil, not criminal, offense.

Our colleague Reid J. Epstein has more details.

Mr. Sanders has been working hard to win over Latino voters, our colleague Jennifer Medina reports. He has raised more money than any other candidate from Latinos, and was leading among them in a recent set of New York Times/Siena College polls.

At a forum on Friday, Ms. Warren said she, too, was open to suspending deportations, “particularly as a way to push Congress for comprehensive immigration reform.”

In other policy news:

Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey announced an economic justice plan centered on what he called the City 2030 Project, in which 50 or more small and medium-size cities would be chosen as regional hubs and given federal funding. The plan would also create a fund for communities hurt by policies like the 1994 crime bill; strengthen antitrust regulations and block some corporate mergers; and expand tax-privileged “opportunity zones.”

Former Representative John Delaney of Maryland released a “Paris 2.0” proposal that would commit members of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and create a global institute for research on technologies that might mitigate climate change.

Ms. Warren outlined how she would support veterans and service members, pledging to raise service members’ pay, expand mental health services and eliminate the benefits backlog at federal agencies.

And finally …

Ms. Warren has wholeheartedly embraced attacks from Wall Street, and on Thursday, she took it one step further: Her campaign released a “calculator for the billionaires.”

“Some billionaires seem confused about how much they would pay under Elizabeth’s Ultra-Millionaire Tax,” it says. “Don’t worry, now we have a calculator for that too.”"

To the Editor:

Re “Trump Is Remaining Competitive if Not Popular” (front page, Nov. 5), about polls showing that the president is “highly competitive” against the three top Democratic candidates in battleground states:

A year out from the presidential election the Democrats are already making many of the same fatal mistakes they made in 2016. Elizabeth Warren, whatever her merits as a leader, will never beat Donald Trump in the general election. She, like Hillary Clinton before her, is perceived as too liberal by too many voters. Furthermore, I believe there is little either Ms. Warren or her supporters can do to change this perception over the next 12 months.

On the other hand, Joe Biden is seen as too moderate and ineffectual by many in the party. What will Warren supporters likely to do should Mr. Biden get the nomination? Just what they did in the last election when their favorite son, Bernie Sanders, failed to get it — stay home in protest.

All the while, President Trump and his people are lapping it up. Right now, things are going far better than even they dared hope.

To the Editor:

It ’s abundantly clear by now that it is futile for the Democrats to try to win over President Trump’s supporters. But there is another way they can win the battleground states, and with them the election: by taking advantage of the surplus of Democratic voters in California and New York. In 2016, the Democrats won those two states by a total of six million votes. If enough of these voters moved to the battleground states — retirees being the most obvious candidates — Mr. Trump would be defeated."

He wrote this week of a “my way or the highway” approach that is “condescending to the millions of Democrats who have a different view.” He said, “It’s representative of an elitism that working- and middle-class people do not share: ‘We know best; you know nothing.’”

For the record, I’m agnostic on the Democratic field. I would vote for a tree stump if it could beat Trump. Biden, Obama and Nancy Pelosi, along with recent polling and the election results on Tuesday, all show that the best way to rid this country of Trump is for Democrats to dial back the condescension of their natural allies and dig into the gritty concerns of daily life.

Pete Buttigieg, looking to pick up the moderate left vote if Biden falters, has already taken Obama’s lesson to heart. “I’m not about being in the right place ideologically, whatever that means,” he said in Iowa last week. “I’m about having answers that are going to make sense.”

One of the biggest takeaways from the recent New York Times/Siena College survey of battleground states is that Elizabeth Warren is not connecting with the very people her policies are supposed to help. Trump beats her or runs even in every tossup state but one. The persuadable voters in these states, many of them working class, say political correctness has gotten out of control, and they prefer someone seeking common ground over someone with a militantly progressive agenda.

It’s worth remembering that nearly two-thirds of all American adults do not have a four-year college degree. Warren, the Harvard professor who recently suggested that moderate Democrats belong with the other party, could be more effective with these folks if she showed more of her daughter-of-a-janitor side.

You can try to win the election by expanding the pool of progressive voters over all. But the inconvenient fact remains that a relatively small pool of working-class voters in the handful of battleground states are still likely to determine the fate of the country next year.

Democrats flipped 40 House seats in 2018 and attracted more white working-class voters — without insufferable wokedness. They hammered away on health care and kitchen table concerns. The same approach helped Democrats pull off an apparent upset in the Kentucky governor’s race this week."

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today — at the heart of the impeachment inquiry was a threat to withhold U.S. military assistance from Ukraine. Why that assistance had been so important to Ukraine, and to the United States, in the first place. It’s Monday, November 11.

andrew kramer

The word “Ukraine” means frontier or border land. This was a frontier between two competing empires. It’s been a country torn between East and West, between Western Europe and Russia.

archived recording [SPEAKING UKRAINIAN]

andrew kramer

For most of the 20th century, Russia had won out, and Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union.

archived recording The Declaration of Independence is on, as of today? That’s what it says. From the moment — It is effective as of today.

andrew kramer

Until August 24, 1991, when Ukraine took a step toward the West.

archived recording Good. An already emotional week ended today, as the people of the Ukraine embarked on a new beginning, becoming the fifth republic to break away from the Kremlin.

andrew kramer

It was the culmination of a long struggle for independence. And after years of hardship under Soviet rule, Ukraine was now an independent state.

archived recording This is one of the turning points in history. The vote for independence of the Ukraine is, in fact, one of those momentous events that is going to change the rest of history. It’s the end of the Russian Empire.

michael barbaro

So once Ukraine becomes an independent country, and it can have its own international relations with the rest of the world, what do those relationships start to look like?

andrew kramer

The key issue for Ukraine that defined both its foreign and its domestic policy in the post-Soviet period was the geopolitical struggle for Ukraine’s allegiance.

michael barbaro

I reached Andrew Kramer, a foreign correspondent for The Times in Kiev.

andrew kramer

On the one hand you had Ukraine, very closely tied to Russia by industrial supply chains, by energy pipelines, and indeed by culture and by history. But the European Union was pulling Ukraine in a Western direction, the European Union in the United States, trying to conceive of Ukraine as integrated into the Western European world. And as Europe pulled in one direction, Russia started to pull back.

michael barbaro

And what was it about Ukraine that interested the U.S. and the European Union?

andrew kramer

The idea was to encourage the development of a Democratic system, and to prevent the re-emergence of a Russian empire. There was the axiom that Russia without Ukraine is just a country, and Russia with Ukraine becomes an empire. So maintaining the independence of Ukraine was a policy objective to prevent the re-emergence of an expansionist imperial power in Moscow.

michael barbaro

It feels like at this point, the Cold War is officially over. But it’s not quite over.

andrew kramer

That’s right. There was a feeling that the Russians, although they had acquiesced to the independence of these countries, they had a phantom limb syndrome. They always felt that Ukraine, in fact, should belong to Russia.

michael barbaro

Phantom limb as if they could never really believe that Ukraine or Czechoslovakia or any of these countries were not really theirs anymore.

andrew kramer

Yes, that’s right. And there’s something more. There’s a cultural issue at play here. Both Russia and Ukraine trace their origin to Kiev. Kiev was the capital of the original Russian state. They feel this was the roots of their country, and they don’t want to see it in another state. So they feel that the Ukrainians are something like wayward cousins in this sense, that it should be obvious to Ukrainians that this is all one culture and one civilization.

michael barbaro

So Russians believe that Russia, as a concept, as a place, as a country, as an identity began in Kiev.

andrew kramer

That’s right.

michael barbaro

But of course the fact that Ukraine is independent means that no matter how Russia feels about it, Ukraine has the right to develop whatever relationship it wants with the U.S. and with the European Union.

andrew kramer

Theoretically, certainly, but they also have to be very cautious about not poking the Russian bear. That they have a powerful neighbor and they have to acknowledge the real politics of their circumstances. What’s developing here is the tug of war that becomes the story of post-independence Ukraine, with the West reaching out to form alliances, and Russia seeking to maintain its sphere of influence in Ukraine.

archived recording Ukraine is trying to decide whether it wants to align itself with Russia’s regional trade bloc or to push for E.U integration.

andrew kramer

This really came to a head with two competing trade agreements, which were offered to Ukraine.

archived recording The Ukrainian president arrived in Strasbourg, poised to work on concluding the association agreement —

andrew kramer

One from the European Union and one from Russia.

archived recording — with a view to later establishing a free trade area between Ukraine and the E.U.

andrew kramer

The European Union offered a more serious and formal trade arrangement with Ukraine that would be, possibly a path to membership in the E.U., although that was seen as a distant prospect.

archived recording After 15 years of eager anticipation, the Customs Union between Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan is up and running.

andrew kramer

And Russia responded by offering a trade agreement of its own, which was called the Customs Union.

archived recording The union, created to ease mutual trade, could be joined by another candidate, Ukraine.

andrew kramer

Which was very similar on paper to the European Union, but it was also, in a sense, a reforming of the Soviet Union as well.

archived recording The country is at a crossroads, deciding whether to turn East or West.

michael barbaro

This feels like a very consequential moment. Because to join the E.U would feel like Ukraine saying, officially we see ourselves as part of Europe. To choose a trade deal instead with Russia would be to say to the West, we ultimately see ourselves as part of the world of Russia.

andrew kramer

That’s right. So while on paper this was about trade, grain quotas, and so forth, this was really about the destiny of the country.

And where does the Ukrainian leader at the time fall on this decision, the West or Russia?

archived recording (viktor yanukovych) [SPEAKING UKRANIAN]

The Ukrainian leader, Viktor Yanukovych, had generally been seen as a pro-Russian politician. But he had promised that Ukraine would integrate economically with the European Union, while maintaining good relations with Russia.

But in the end, in a very dramatic moment —

— the Yanukovych government announces that they will turn to Russia instead of the European Union for a trade agreement.

michael barbaro

He goes with Russia.

andrew kramer

He went with Russia.

michael barbaro

That was genuinely surprising to me. I mean, here is this country just a couple of decades out of independence, and it is taking the most formal step possible to reintegrate itself with the country it had sought independence from.

andrew kramer

That’s right. And this is what a lot of people in Ukraine and in Kiev felt about this decision.

archived recording [CHANTS IN UKRAINIAN] There were immediate protests in Kiev that never let up from the day they began in November of 2013. [SPEAKING TO A CROWD IN UKRAINIAN]

michael barbaro

And tell me about these protests.

andrew kramer

Well, when I came down to cover these protests in the late fall of 2013, there was already a tent encampment in the center of Kiev, in Independence Square, with thousands and thousands of people on the square, around the clock.

archived recording [SINGING IN UKRAINIAN]

andrew kramer

People were genuinely outraged by this decision to lean back towards Russia.

archived recording [SPEAKING TO A CROWD IN UKRAINIAN]

andrew kramer

And it was also something of a party, really. Even though they were always riot policemen — some where hovering on the edges of these protests, sometimes making incursions, making arrests, there were also groups called “titushky,” which were hired thugs who would come in with a lead pipe or knives, straight razors, and would be attacking the protesters. It started to turn more violent as the winter came on. By February, I was living in a hotel, right on the square, and it became very tense. When I drove into the city in the early morning, I could see black smoke rising from the center of Kiev from burning cars. And there were a number of very violent confrontations over about two days in late February, in which the police eventually encroached on the square, overran much of the territory that the protesters had controlled, and pushed it back to a few hundred square yards. And at the last moment, the protesters, out of desperation, they started to burn tires and actually anything that was flammable to make a ring around this small, charred bit of pavement that was the only remaining area that they controlled, that they sort of felt this was what was left of their dream of the independent Ukraine. And then in the final day —

archived recording [GUNSHOT] [SPEAKING UKRAINIAN]

andrew kramer

— there was really a cacophony of gunfire.

archived recording [GUNSHOT] And there were snipers firing into the crowd. Over this hour and a half, 70 people were killed, and several hundred people were wounded. It was such a brutal moment that the Ukrainian elite and the international community realized that something had happened that could not be left unaddressed. And there was a revolt in the Yanukovych government against the president. And the police defected —

michael barbaro

Wow.

andrew kramer

— and betrayed their president, and actually left the city center. And within hours, the president fled the capital.

michael barbaro

So what happens next?

andrew kramer

Well, what happened next was a move by Russia. Because Russia and President Vladimir Putin had just lost its ally in Viktor Yanukovych. And the very next day Putin met with his security chiefs overnight. And by dawn, President Putin orders what he calls an operation to take back Crimea, which is in the south of Ukraine. And what this was really was an order of a military intervention into Ukraine.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording Russia is tightening its grip on Crimea, as we get reports of an increasing number of troops and takeovers of key military facilities. This despite intense diplomatic efforts —

michael barbaro

What is it about Crimea that makes it the most logical place for Putin to try to invade?

andrew kramer

Well, Crimea is host to a major Russian naval base in Sevastopol. So the military infrastructure is partly already in place. Also, the population in Crimea is predominantly Russian-speaking. So you would have a receptive population in this area.

archived recording Look at Ukraine and Crimea, down in the south there, jutting out into the waters of the Black Sea, home to a critical port the Russian navy has used for centuries. This morning, more unidentified pro-Russian armed militias, patrolling the streets of Crimea’s capital.

andrew kramer

So this was an unacknowledged intervention. These were men who had no insignia on their uniforms. They were called, disparagingly by the Ukrainians, “the little green men,” as if they’d come from space. Mystery men in green uniforms by the hundreds were showing up in their country.

andrew kramer

So by this point the political process starts. The de facto authorities declare a referendum. There are no observers, so it’s hard to say exactly what happened. But the people are asked, do you want to join Russia or would you like to remain in Ukraine? And by this point, of course, they are, in fact, already part of Russia. And the results come in, and a majority want to be annexed by Russia.

michael barbaro

So Russia, having invaded Crimea, then asks the people of Crimea, do you, basically mind that we just invaded Crimea? And it turns out that the answer is no.

andrew kramer

Exactly.

michael barbaro

Is it fair to say that Russia was using this kind of vote as a rationale to say, it’s OK that we just annexed Crimea, because in a sense, Crimea was always ours?

andrew kramer

Yes, absolutely. The message was, these are our people, and they’re coming home.

archived recording [SPEAKING UKRAINIAN]

andrew kramer

So we left off back in Kiev with Ukraine losing its leader. So what is the response in Ukraine to this military incursion by Russia? What happened next was, Russia tried a similar approach in other provinces.

archived recording Just yesterday, at this hour, thousands of Russian troops have been deployed to Ukraine’s border.

andrew kramer

They’ve fomented uprisings in Russian-speaking areas. And this led to the war that we have going on in Ukraine today between pro-Russian forces and pro-Ukrainian forces.

And what does this war look like?

andrew kramer

There was debate in the Obama administration about how to respond.

andrew kramer

And they settled on what they were calling non-lethal assistance.

archived recording (barack obama) — to provide American assistance for the Ukrainian government, so that they can weather this storm and stabilize their economy.

andrew kramer

And this was training for the Ukrainian army, ambulances, armored vehicles, body armor, radios, and other types of assistance, which were not deemed to be lethal, or most importantly, would not provoke a retaliatory escalation from Russia.

archived recording It’s time to ask the hard question. Are we willing to stand up to Vladimir Putin’s aggression before he kills more people, does more economic damage, further destabilizes Europe?

andrew kramer

So this began in 2014.

archived recording Our options grow fewer and less effective.

andrew kramer

Support for Ukraine in Congress had been bipartisan. Both parties had agreed that backing Ukrainian independence was really in the United State’s interests. This was about holding Russia at bay. There hadn’t been much controversy over that.

archived recording That’s why I’m announcing today my plan to introduce new legislation. It will offer Ukraine greater assistance on a variety of fronts.

andrew kramer

And this assistance was rolled over in Congress year after year.

michael barbaro

Right. And so this is the military assistance that we have now heard so much about over the past few weeks.

andrew kramer

Exactly.

michael barbaro

OK. So this is the situation after 2014. So what happens to this relationship once President Trump takes office?

andrew kramer

From the Ukrainian side, there was an effort to strike up a transactional relationship with President Trump, as sort of, you scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours. President Poroshenko and president of Ukraine at the time negotiated, for example, to buy coal from Pennsylvania. This was politically beneficial for Trump, because Pennsylvania coal miners were really Trump’s base, and Trump had promised to deliver jobs to coal miners in his campaign.

archived recording That’s a great honor and a great pleasure to be together with you, with the president, one of the most reliable, supportive, and partner — strategic partner for Ukraine. We really try to bring freedom and democracy.

michael barbaro

So the Ukrainian government is desperate to do whatever it needs to do to get into Trump’s good graces, because in their minds, if they can do that, they can restore a better relationship with the U.S., and one in which the U.S. sees Ukraine as a strategic partner, and leans away from Russia.

andrew kramer

Exactly.

archived recording (donald trump) Thank you very much. It’s wonderful to have President Poroshenko with us. We spent some time recently in the White House. And I know you’ve made good progress since then — a lot of progress, actually. And I wouldn’t say it’s the easiest place right now to live, but you’re making it better and better on a daily basis . And I do hear very, very good things.

michael barbaro

How is President Trump weighing in on this war, waging within the Ukraine between these pro-Russian forces and Ukrainian military?

archived recording (donald trump) And I really hope that Russia — because I really believe that President Putin would like to do something — I really hope that you and President Putin get together and can solve your problem. That would be a tremendous achievement. And I know you’re trying to do that.

andrew kramer

He’s been very quiet on Russia’s actions in Ukraine.

archived recording Silence in the White House, which is pretty distressing, given that we clearly have a powder keg. So will President Trump really put pressure on Vladimir Putin over this latest clash between Russia and Ukraine? Well we pressed the Trump administration repeatedly on that question. Neither the White House nor the State Department would comment.

andrew kramer

And amid all this uncertainty about whether the Trump administration is really supporting Ukraine in its conflict with Russia, the Ukrainians learned, by early August of this year, that about $400 million in military aid has been held up by the White House.

archived recording Hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. military aid has poured into Ukraine since 2014. But that could be at risk. Critics say the potential aid cut is an example of Trump capitulating to Russia. Some members of Congress are already sounding the alarm.

andrew kramer

And this was the time when they needed U.S. backing. And the aid was a symbol of U.S. backing. It was also quite valuable for their military. But it wasn’t quite clear initially what the issue was, or how serious it would become. There was a creeping awareness in Ukrainian government that the aid might, in fact, be lost by September.

michael barbaro

Finally, Andrew, the reason we’re talking to you about this military aid at all is, of course, the phone call that President Trump makes to Ukraine’s president, and everything that we have learned since about the withholding of that aid to Ukraine, unless the Ukrainians agreed to do these investigations that President Trump wanted into his rivals. And based on what you’ve told us, how critically important this aide is, I guess I’m curious what the people fighting the war in Ukraine on the ground, who rely on this military aid, what they make of this series of events.

andrew kramer

Ultimately, when I talked to dozens of soldiers, the feeling was one of disappointment. They felt they had maybe lost an ally in this war. I was at the front in October and met with some soldiers, and they naturally said that they were disappointed. The Ukrainian army is a poor army. They’re fighting with basic weapons — Kalashnikov rifles, binoculars. They’re living in dug out bunkers. Some of the soldiers, for example, are wearing tennis shoes and not boots. It’s a very grim existence. So for them to learn they were losing the military assistance was quite a blow. Soldiers said they were disappointed. So this was really a shock to soldiers to realize that they might be in this on their own.

michael barbaro

Andrew, thank you very much.

andrew kramer

This week, the first witness to be called in the public phase of the impeachment inquiry will be Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, who is expected to testify that he had a, quote, “Clear understanding that American military aid to Ukraine would not be released until the Ukrainians pursued investigations that would benefit President Trump.” In his closed door testimony, Taylor has described a quote snake pit of people around the president, who were willing to use the military aid as leverage over Ukraine, despite the danger it posed to Ukraine. We’ll be right back. Here is what else you need to know today.

Over the weekend, House Republicans released their list of witnesses for the next phase of the impeachment inquiry, including Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, Hunter Biden’s business partner, and the anonymous whistleblower whose complaint launched the inquiry.

archived recording I’m excited to see some of these witnesses that we’ve placed on the list. It’s finally — finally we have an opportunity to kind of get to the bottom of what’s going on, and to round out some of the evidence. Heretofore, as you know, it’s been a very one-sided sham of a process.

The witness list appeared to be an attempt by Republicans to shift the focus of the investigation away from President Trump.

“The question is whether Biden would use the same words to describe a male professor — and I suspect he would,” said Gloria Steinem, the feminist leader. “The larger problem is that they’re about style, not content.”

His criticism of Ms. Warren troubled some voters who came to see her on the campaign trail over the weekend.

“I think it’s sexist,” Savannah Johnson, 49, a social worker who supports Ms. Warren and who attended a town hall she held in Goose Creek, S.C., on Saturday, said of Mr. Biden’s criticism.

“I just don’t think that he’d be saying the same thing about a male candidate,” she added. “I think that all strong women kind of get labeled that unfairly.”

Niamh Cahill, 21, a college student who also came to the town hall, said Ms. Warren would not be getting as much grief if she were a male candidate. “Yeah, she’s fired up, she’s angry, but for a good reason,” she said. “There are a lot of things that are wrong in this country.”

Mr. Biden often discusses his record of advocacy for women’s rights by citing his championing of the Violence Against Women Act and his work combating campus sexual assault. And none of his remarks have come close to the audaciously sexist language and tactics that President Trump used against female political opponents like Mrs. Clinton and Carly Fiorina in the 2016 campaign or his offensive and demeaning language about Megyn Kelly, Stormy Daniels and the women he referenced in his taped interview with “Access Hollywood.”"

Mr. Trump froze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine shortly before a July 25 call with the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Mr. Trump personally sought investigations into the Bidens and claims that Ukrainians had meddled in the 2016 election. In the call, Mr. Trump did not explicitly link the aid and the investigations.

Mr. Trump has denied a quid pro quo involving aid, and Mr. Zelensky has said he never felt pressured to pursue an investigation.

The meeting in Kiev in May occurred after Mr. Giuliani, with Mr. Parnas’s help, had planned a trip there to urge Mr. Zelensky to pursue the investigations. Mr. Giuliani canceled his trip at the last minute, claiming he was being “set up.”

Only three people were present at the meeting: Mr. Parnas, Mr. Fruman and Serhiy Shefir, a member of the inner circle of Mr. Zelensky, then the Ukrainian president-elect. The sit-down took place at an outdoor cafe in the days before Mr. Zelensky’s May 20 inauguration, according to a person familiar with the events. The men sipped coffee and spoke in Russian, which is widely spoken in Ukraine, the person said.

Mr. Parnas’s lawyer, Joseph A. Bondy, said the message to the Ukrainians was given at the direction of Mr. Giuliani, whom Mr. Parnas believed was acting under Mr. Trump’s instruction. Mr. Giuliani said he “never authorized such a conversation.”

A lawyer for Mr. Fruman, John M. Dowd, said his client told him the men were seeking only a meeting with Mr. Zelensky, the new president. “There was no mention of any terms, military aid or whatever they are talking about it — it’s false,” said Mr. Dowd, who represents Mr. Fruman along with the lawyer Todd Blanche."

I remember in history class, must have been a junior, it was during the impeachment process of President Clinton or all the scandal, everything that was going on. And I remember the teacher was just kind of riffing on this, and he said, you know, would anybody here ever want to be president or want to run for office, seeing what a mess and what an ugly place Washington was? And I just — maybe involuntarily, my hand went up. And from then on, it became that the running joke of the class that I’d wind up running for president. And then by the time I got to college, they had this Institute of Politics at Harvard, and every day, there’d be a different speaker who would come through. And I remember when I was there as a freshman, people like Donna Brazile who had just come off managing the Gore campaign and Rick Davis, who had done the same thing for McCain. And the former president of Ecuador, he’d been deposed in a coup. You’d just kind of hang around and watch them and see what they were like. The biggest realization was that they’re just people. These people who were shaping the world, people I was seeing on TV were obviously very impressive people, but they were just people. I think it changed my awareness of the fact that, on some level, I could be part of that world, too. But in a very simple sense, especially coming from Indiana, it seemed that it was a choice. You could be in elected office, or you could be an out gay person, not both, at least not where I was from. From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

Pete Buttigieg. It’s Friday, November 22. So Jeremy Peters, you cover politics for The Times, and you’ve been closely tracking Mayor Buttigieg. And in order to better understand the Democratic field of presidential candidates, we’re trying to figure out the most revealing moments in their lives. So when it comes to Pete Buttigieg, what moment should we focus on?

jeremy peters

Well, Mayor Pete has always been a candidate for whom his story, his biography is very central to his appeal to voters, and he’s got a great story to tell. He’s been elected mayor of this medium-sized town in Indiana before turning 30. He has an Ivy League pedigree. He’s been a Rhodes Scholar. He’s worked at a prestigious consulting firm. He’s gone off to Afghanistan as part of the Navy Reserves. So he has all of these components that you kind of think if you’re a voter, wow, he really stands out. There’s something unique about this guy. But at the same time, for most of his adult life, he had this nagging secret, the secret that he couldn’t confront because he thought that it would mean the end to this political career that he had spent so much time perfecting, basically since he went away to college and decided, hey, you know, I can run for president. And he doesn’t see how it’s possible for the politician with the perfect background, the perfect resume to also be open about their sexuality, in his case. So how he reconciles this inner turmoil with his very public ambition I think is a defining moment in his life, if not the defining moment.

michael barbaro

All right. Welcome to the studio.

pete buttigieg

Thank you.

michael barbaro

You’re going to sit there.

pete buttigieg

All right.

jeremy peters

So that story begins in 1982 in South Bend, Indiana where Peter Buttigieg was born.

michael barbaro

Mayor, tell me about the kind of kid that you were, growing up in Indiana?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think I was, safe to say, a little on the nerdy side. I lived in a neighborhood kind of in the middle of South Bend, close to a park where you would have as much as possible what you’d call a prototypical Midwestern kid’s upbringing, you know, playing in the park with friends, a lot of time in the house. I was really interested in baseball cards, but I was more interested in categorizing them than I was in baseball, I think. I loved science and science fiction. I loved reading, plus I was an only child. So I think it’s safe to say I had a lot of interior life going on in a fairly quiet house where it was a dog and my parents, who were both academics, and me.

michael barbaro

What was your introduction to even the idea of politics?

pete buttigieg

Politics was always in the air in our house just because my parents were very politically passionate. They really cared about what was happening. I can remember the Democratic Convention. It must have been 1988.

archived recording NBC News continues its coverage of America’s convention.

pete buttigieg

I would’ve been six years old and my parents explaining what a convention was. I remember Jesse Jackson giving a speech.

archived recording (jesse jackson) When I look out at this convention, I see the face of America — red, yellow, brown, black, and white. We are all precious in God’s sight, the real rainbow coalition.

pete buttigieg

And I remember my parents thinking it was important to watch the Republican Convention, too. I mean, you would stop — even though I don’t it ever crossed their mind to ever vote for a Republican.

archived recording Now let’s go down to the podium. Here is George Herbert Walker Bush addressing his convention.

pete buttigieg

Everything in the house would kind of stop when it was time to watch what was playing out.

archived recording Thank you.

michael barbaro

At what moment in this early phase of your life did you go from just watching this and maybe finding it very fascinating to feeling really drawn to it?

pete buttigieg

Well, when I got to college, it felt like the Republicans and the Democrats, at the time, it’s crazy to think about now, polarized as we are. But what it felt like when I showed up as a freshman on campus was that the two parties were converging and not necessarily in a good place, that you had this kind of center-right and center-left, both of them very committed to growth in business, but it seemed not very committed at all to some of the questions of how we take care of vulnerable people around the country. And I think there’s a moment for any kind of well-spoken or intelligent young person watching the news when you see a senator or a candidate saying something or doing something and you think, well, that’s not right. I could do that. I could do it different. Now, you might be wrong. They might be way more sophisticated than you are, and you can’t see it. Or you might be right, and it might well be the case that what they’re saying is just not right. But I certainly had that feeling reinforced when I saw these figures come to campus, some of whom were extremely impressive, but none of whom seemed like they were on a different plane of existence. They were just people.

michael barbaro

So at this point, a year or two into Harvard, have you made up your mind that you were probably going to find a way to have a career in politics?

pete buttigieg

I knew I wanted a career that involved policy. I don’t think I’d figured out for sure that that meant running. Plus, you know, when I thought about it, even well before I was coming to terms with the fact that I was gay, I knew that I had no political connections at home. I had an unpronounceable name, and I was a Democrat who lived in Indiana. So it was not obvious that I could overcome some of the obstacles toward running. But I think it’s safe to say by the time I graduated, I had some sense that I could see myself doing it.

michael barbaro

Well, I want to talk to you about that realization of your sexuality in particular. Obviously, your candidacy is historic in a couple of different ways, and among those is the fact you’re the first major party presidential candidate who is openly gay. And so I want to ask you about that part of your identity. When did you sense that you were gay? When did that realization start to dawn on you?

pete buttigieg

I think it depends what you mean by realization, right? There are things you could point to going way back, certainly a fascination I had with a classmate when I was about 12 that, in hindsight, is very obviously a crush. But I was not willing to think of it that way, although some part of me must have — I mean, I wasn’t stupid either, right? So you have this kind of awareness that was definitely there by the time I was hitting middle school. But taking a word like gay and applying it to myself, I was still years away from being able to do that, even in my own mind.

michael barbaro

Well, what did you do with those feelings?

pete buttigieg

I guess I packed them up, yeah.

michael barbaro

Packed them up —

pete buttigieg

Not much would be the best answer.

michael barbaro

Pack them up and put them where?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I don’t know how these things work, even in your own mind. I just didn’t explore them. That’s for sure. First of all, there were not a lot of out gay people that I knew as such growing up. I mean, in high school, it was exactly zero. There was just no sense of gay life or a gay community. And when I got to college, that’s when the kind of internal battle was starting to heat up.

michael barbaro

Why?

pete buttigieg

I think because you just can’t escape it. I mean, my god, you’re in college, right? I mean, any feelings you have, especially in the romantic department, are going to start asserting themselves even more fiercely than they have when you get to college. For a lot of people, it’s a big part of what you spend college on.

michael barbaro

Right. So how did you deal with it?

pete buttigieg

Same way I dealt with it up to then, just packed it away. Dated women, remarkable women. Because I enjoyed these relationships, I think I could defer facing the fact that that wasn’t the same as what it was to be in love with somebody.

michael barbaro

And your political ambition was already solid at that point?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I still didn’t know exactly where it would take me or what it would mean, but I think by then, I knew that there was a good chance I was going to be running for office in my adult life. But at that point, I’m still clinging to some kind of hope, however vanishing, that maybe I’m straight or I’m bisexual and I can just not worry about the gay part. I think when I thought about my career, certainly when I talked about my future and how I was going to be involved, I wasn’t even thinking about the possibility that that would come into contact with this developing side of me. But I’m sure to the extent that I thought what it would mean to come to terms with the fact that I was at very least different and, as became increasingly clear, gay, that one of the things that would have kept that in its corner was the simple fact that that didn’t fit with any of the other things I wanted to do in life, not just a career, but a family. I wanted to get married. I wanted to have kids. From my perspective, you could be married and have kids or you could be gay, not both.

michael barbaro

You graduated in 2004. That — correct me if I’m wrong. That’s the year when Massachusetts —

pete buttigieg

That’s right.

michael barbaro

— legalizes gay marriage.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

archived recording The court today, as you know, in a 4-3 advisory opinion to the Senate has a rule that in a November 18, 2003 decision, they meant marriage. They meant equality. They meant that the Commonwealth may no longer deny marriage rights to same-sex couples, including —

michael barbaro

So I say that only to try to understand, are you falling behind the culture, in a sense? Are you ignoring some of the signs that these things are changing?

archived recording Marriage and only marriage will be enough to satisfy the requirements of the Massachusetts Constitution.

pete buttigieg

Well, the thing is I wasn’t from Massachusetts. I was in Massachusetts for a while, but I never felt like I was from there. And nothing against Massachusetts, but I realized pretty quick after turning up at Harvard that I didn’t belong there either.

michael barbaro

Why not?

pete buttigieg

It was just — it was just a different culture. I didn’t realize that. I didn’t realize that I was Midwestern until I left the Midwest. And just little things, cultural things, the way — I don’t know, the way people interact, what’s expected of you. Once I got there, I realized that socially, I was way more Midwestern than I thought.

michael barbaro

So take me from graduating from Harvard to your decision to join the Navy Reserves.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so it starts with 9/11. Actually, it starts before 9/11. There’s this family tradition of serving in the military. There’s a painting hanging on the wall of my parents’ house of a relative, a great uncle who I kind of idolized in theory. He was an Army Air Corps pilot. And so I had this idea, this maybe romantic idea, of being in the military, and then it never really became real. But I remember on 9/11 thinking, oh, well, war isn’t just a thing that happens in other places or in other periods of history. Like, war has come to my generation, and thinking, at least in the back of my head, that that might mean I would be involved, but not taking any steps to do that. But that turned into more and more of a nagging feeling when some friends of mine started to serve. A friend of mine from college shared with me just before we graduated that he had decided to join the Navy Reserve. I was fascinated. And then when I was talking to someone about applying for the Rhodes Scholarship and how I wanted to talk about my interest in public service and to the faculty member who was giving advice to students, and just said, pointedly, like, you might want to really think about how you’re going to say that, knowing that you’re going to be competing against people from the military academies. Oh yeah, that’s true. Like, my chest thumping about caring about public service feels a lot smaller held up against what others are doing.

michael barbaro

Do you think that was one of the things that might have drawn you to military service, knowing that to get a Rhodes, to be in that world, in that league, you know, it might be a good thing?

pete buttigieg

I think definitely that it was part of how you’re true to a culture of service. And also the Kennedy presidency kind of hangs over certainly the Kennedy School, as you might imagine. And that can’t be separated from his military career.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

I mean, really, it was almost an expectation that you would’ve served, up until roughly the time when I came of age when everything shifted.

michael barbaro

An expectation that you would serve —

pete buttigieg

Well, when you’re looking at the history of the people we were studying —

michael barbaro

Of presidents.

pete buttigieg

— who have made history. Yep, as presidents. And then the thing that put me over the top was this experience knocking on doors in Iowa with a couple of buddies from college who went out. We took a week off and rented a car, and it was the last few days before the Iowa caucuses, and we were volunteers for Obama. They sent us to this very rural area, some of the lowest income counties in Iowa. And it felt like any time I met a young — especially young man — it was somebody who was serving or was about to serve. And I started to realize, we had service that used to be something that bridged people together. Now it’s completely different, that if you were rural or low-income, you were highly likely to serve. If you were from a background like mine, which was middle class economically, but I’d had the chance to go to an institution like Harvard, almost nobody with that background was serving. And I began to feel like it wasn’t just this kind of thing I thought about that I hadn’t gotten around to. It was that I was part of the problem. I was part of the divide. That was the thing that kind of propelled me that last few inches toward being ready to yank open the door of the recruiting office in Indiana and say, hey, how do I sign up?

michael barbaro

I wondered, do you think you joined the military in part because you knew what it would mean for a political career?

pete buttigieg

You know, I wrestled with that because as soon as I get that question, there’s a part of me that thinks, if the answer is yes, does that mean the service wasn’t pure in some way? And I remember at the time asking myself if being in the military was as unpopular as it is today popular, would I still do it? And I want to believe the answer is yes, but there’s no way to go back and prove it. I’m not somebody who thinks that it’s, like, a prerequisite that if you want to run for office you need to have served. But I do think if you have a heart for elected office, one way to put your money where your mouth is to have been in that kind of service, too.

michael barbaro

That strikes me as a very candid answer because of course, you could just say, well, of course I would have done it, even if there was no possible —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

— political benefit.

pete buttigieg

And I want to say that. I just can’t prove it.

michael barbaro

So I want to talk about this run for mayor for just a little bit. Whenever you run for office, your character is on display. And at this point, you are keeping something quite elemental about yourself secret. Did it feel like you were hiding something?

pete buttigieg

Not really. The only time it felt that way was when there was small talk about whether I was dating, and I would crack a joke or something. We’d be sitting in a studio like this one and a radio host would ask a question. And I’d say, well, if anybody listening is into economic policy and long walks on the beach, go ahead and reach out and just kind of play the busy single person, which is what I was, except for the fact that I wasn’t actively looking for love. I was going out of my way to avoid it. But if somebody who is straight up asked me on the record, to this day, I’m not sure what I would have done.

michael barbaro

Do you think that that would have potentially cost you the mayoralty, might have kept you from being mayor or staying mayor?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I think there’s a good chance of it. There’s a reason why no — as far as I know, no out gay person had ever run for mayor of any place in Indiana.

michael barbaro

This is a state with strong Christian values, and —

pete buttigieg

— not known for progressive social outlooks on politics. And here I am, rocking up, 29 years old saying, trust me, support me. Never mind this state legislator who has earned tons of credibility in this community. Never mind this county councilman who’s the party favorite. Go with me instead. If there had been anything that looked like a skeleton or a vulnerability, I think it probably would have sunk me before I got anywhere at all.

michael barbaro

So I want to now move into this notion of you reconciling these things.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so when I first joined the Reserve, the message was kind of you’re pretty much going to go to one of these wars, and we’ll let you know which one. And so I knew that, at a certain point, it was coming. And of course, I didn’t want to take office in South Bend without a plan for this. So we had gamed it out with my team, if I get orders, here’s what you do. And when I received my orders and knew I was going for sure, I don’t think even then it occurred to me that it would have much to do with my sexuality. If anything, I was thankful that I was single, right? The hardest thing for people to deploy is the fact that you’re leaving behind somebody you love, in addition to all the professional complications. But then, the more I started getting mentally ready for going over and really thinking about what it meant, the more it started weighing on me that I didn’t have a — wasn’t coming back to a family, my parents, of course, but I wasn’t coming back to a household. And more than that, I had no idea what it was like to be in love. And the idea that I’m — here I am. I’m a grown-ass man. I own a home. I’m the mayor of my city. I’m a military officer. And if I get killed over there, I will go to my grave not knowing what it’s like to be in love. And that just made me realize how untenable the situation I was in really was. And up until then, it didn’t seem untenable, I guess because I was so busy, and I might have deferred coming out and having a dating life forever, if not for this moment where I’m thinking, shit, I could die.

michael barbaro

You wrote a letter I want to ask you about.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, you know, it’s a thing you do. I assume everybody does it. I don’t know. But it’s the thing you do when you go to war, right? You want to make sure that you have the last word on your life and leave a few instructions. So I wrote up a letter, put an envelope, put just in case on the outside. Put it in the desk drawer, would’ve been pretty easy to find if worse comes to worst. And that’s a real moment, too, because you’re sitting there staring at the screen trying to figure out how to give a short accounting of your life.

michael barbaro

And what did you say?

pete buttigieg

Well, what I said was that I wouldn’t want people to think that I’d been cheated, that obviously it’d be terrible if I didn’t come back, but I also had this amazing life where I have wonderful friendships, and I got to serve my community in a way that very few people get to do, let alone at my age, and that I’d had this very fulfilling life. And of course, it’d be too bad if something happened to me, but to keep that in perspective. But if you’re asking if there was, like, P.S. I’m gay, no.

michael barbaro

That’s kind of what I was asking. So you are deployed.

Well, I think by the time I hit the ground and I was back, I knew that I was going to come out and then it’s just — it was more how and when. I remember resenting the idea that you’re supposed to have to come out, right? Straight people don’t have to come out. Why do I? And then, while I’m in the process of figuring this out —

So suddenly, we’re on national television, my state, as the most officially anti-gay state in the country. I’m fighting him on it, of course, because it’s a terrible policy. But now, I’m fighting this terrible, anti-gay policy putatively from the perspective of a straight ally, wondering whether I’m more effective because people don’t know that I’m gay. And at the same time, knowing that this just kind of speeds things up even more that, like, it’s just a really weird position to be in, to be having all these hypothetical arguments about discrimination against gay people, when it really means me. Meanwhile, this is also the period when we realize that soon the Supreme Court is going to weigh in on marriage. I mean, all of this was happening in that early part of 2015 while I’m wrestling with how to do this. And so oddly enough, it was — — as busy as I was as mayor. Military duty actually felt like, kind of almost like a break because it was eight hour days, 40 hour week. I wasn’t used to having that much time, and so is a lot of time to sit and write and think and call friends and get advice.

michael barbaro

So you produce a plan.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, well I produced a letter, an op-ed I guess.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. What was the essential line that I’m sure you remember that you wrote?

pete buttigieg

I remember saying that it’s just part of who I am and that it has no bearing on how I do my job, that the way I do my — did my job either as an officer or as a mayor or in business had nothing to do with the fact that I was gay and that —

michael barbaro

It still sounds a little defensive.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Or maybe a little scared.

pete buttigieg

Probably. Yeah, I mean, you know, I didn’t feel like I was coming out guns blazing. I felt like I — again, part of me was bothered that I had to share this at all. Then part of me knew that it would do some good if I did, I mean, not just in my own life. That I — my main agenda was, personally, I wanted to get out there and start dating. But also that it would mean something, might mean all kinds of things to a whole bunch of different people when I came out and said this.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording A very personal announcement coming from South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg today. In an essay published in today’s South Bend Tribune, the mayor announced he is gay. Currently in the midst of running for a second term, Pete Buttigieg penned an essay in Tuesday’s South Bend Tribune revealing he was gay. A lot of people wondering why he chose to make this announcement now. It comes just months after the state’s religious freedom law thrust the state into the national debate on gay rights. As for the mayor himself, he says nothing is different, nothing has changed, and his focus is on South Bend.

michael barbaro

I want to talk about the timing, the exact moment of the op-ed because my sense is that at this phase of your career, you’re up for re-election, right? You’ve won the primary. And winning the primary, in a sense, means you’re standing a very good shot of winning.

pete buttigieg

Depending on the year, but yeah, in South Bend, it should be.

michael barbaro

So does that mean you deliberately chose a — like, a safe, low-risk time to do this?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I would think that going into a Democratic primary would be a safer time than going into a general election. And I think also the decision to do this came by way of realizing that there is no such thing as a safe time. I was just done with not having the kind of personal life that I wanted to have.

michael barbaro

So once you come out, how does your personal life change?

pete buttigieg

Well, I started dating, and that kind of changes everything. I mean, I still had this very demanding job. You’re the mayor, and so anybody in town that you ask to have a cup of coffee is —

michael barbaro

It’s a thing.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, it’s a thing. It might be misinterpreted. You could cross some line without meaning to. I mean, most of the people I interacted with were either people who needed something from me, people I needed something from or people who worked for me. So it’s not, like, a very healthy pool for dating is what I’m saying. And I remember thinking there were all these kind of city fathers who, early on in my time as mayor, seemed determined to fix me up with their daughters. And I remember just thinking, like, where are you now? Did none of you have, like, a son or a nephew or something? So I did what millennials do. I went online. Turns out there’s apps for all of this. There was O.K. Cupid, Tinder. The one that actually came through for me was called Hinge. And it’s supposed to serve up people that — I don’t know how the algorithm works. But I find this guy, this cute guy with a big smile, and I’m like, I want to know this guy. So we start chatting. Well, I was chatting with a lot of people, but obviously, he’s the one I remember because that was Chasten.

michael barbaro

Your future husband.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

michael barbaro

So your story, to many people, is particularly compelling one, everything we just discussed. You are a Harvard graduate, a Rhodes Scholar, you’re a veteran. You’re gay. You’re religious. And from your own description of yourself, it feels like you have been thinking about politics and preparing, to some degree, to run for president for a very long time, even though you’re quite young. And I’m sure you understand this and have heard this. That has led to this perception of a person kind of, perhaps, orchestrating a political biography. Do you ever question whether that, no matter what your intention, is — could possibly undermine the power of the story itself, however genuine?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I mean, I think we’re conditioned to not like the idea of somebody who sat around thinking all their lives about how to become president. And I don’t view myself that way, although I get that that story has been written around me. Although, I also don’t know what it is we expect, that somebody kind of gets struck by lightning and then they turn into somebody who might become president. We all have these paths, right, that bring us to where we are. And I think anybody in professional life or even social life thinks about the story that you tell about yourself. At the end of the day, I’m not doing this because I have this personal need to be in elected office or to be the president. I’m not coming at the presidency as a thing that I’d like to occupy. I’m coming at it as this way to do something that I think I’m able to do. And I think it’s helpful in the sense that I could also have a very happy life doing something else. And oddly, I think that — that helps prepare me to do what’s required to do this. And this is advice I give talking to students, too. Imagine somebody is being sworn in, an ambitious, talented person kind of in the middle of their career is being sworn in as an assistant secretary in the State Department for the Middle East. And then imagine if that person has got there one of two ways. In kind of universe A, it’s a person who woke up one day in high school and said, I want to be the assistant secretary for the Middle East, and took the right courses and got the right jobs and had the right fellowships and wrote the right papers and did everything in order to occupy that title. And the other person is somebody who said, I — woke up in high school and said, I want to be the person who makes the United States a force toward peace in the Middle East. And they don’t know what that’s going to mean, and maybe it means they start out becoming an activist or maybe they’re an academic or maybe they’re a civil servant or whatever. But by whatever winding path, they wind up in this job, right? Which of those two scenarios is going to lead to somebody who’s better equipped to take that job they’ve been handed? I’ve got to think it’s the latter. And so what I’ve tried to do in my life is to prepare myself to be useful to others. And yes, I think that, in all likelihood, means in a form that involves holding office or seeking office or at least public life where I speak to lots of people, sometimes millions at the same time. But it’s not about, necessarily, having one title or another. And so I think if you overthink it, that’s where you start to lose the fidelity to what it is that would guide you when you actually get what you’ve been chasing for a long time. Jeremy, what do we learn from Mayor Pete Buttigieg about the way he reconciled his political ambition with this essential fact about himself that he feared would endanger that ambition?

jeremy peters

I think we learn a lot about his decision-making process, not just how he internalizes decisions personally, but how he thinks about them in the longer arc of a political career. And he’s been very intentional all along the way about choosing certain endeavors that he thinks would benefit a long-term political career. Now some people would think, on the one hand, that’s too calculating. I don’t want somebody who’s thought about being president since he was a teenager. And, you know, in the era when voters seemed to prize authenticity in their political figures, they could see that as inauthentic. On the other hand, the decision that he made to wait seems to have borne out to his benefit. I mean, here he is, the first openly gay candidate for president of the United States who has a legitimate shot at being his party’s nominee. Look at where he is in the Democratic primary right now. He’s rocketed to the top of the polls. He’s brought in all this money in large part because he’s gay, and that opened a lot of doors with Democratic donors. He’s heading into the Iowa caucuses in the lead by some measures. But we won’t know if his decision to wait actually was the right one until people start voting. So it seems to have worked out well for him right now, but no one’s cast a single vote. And we don’t know how voters in the Democratic primary are going to react. We certainly don’t know how voters in a general election are going to react. So we’re just not going to know until Democratic voters have their say.

michael barbaro

Mayor, when you think back to your younger self —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Not just your teenage self, but even your college self and your post-collegiate self who was so fearful about telling the world that you were gay, what do you kind of wish you could tell that person, that version of Mayor Buttigieg?

pete buttigieg

Well, back then, I would have thought this other fact, if I dared to unpack it, this fact about my life, this way in which I was different, was the thing that could multiply all the other stuff by zero, in terms of the impact I was going to have in the world, that I might very well choose that path, but that the price would be that I wouldn’t get to make a difference in public life. And if you want proof of God having a sense of humor, one of the things I’m seeing now, especially in the interactions I have on the campaign trail and the fact that this campaign is historic in a lot of ways, is that that same fact that I thought would mean never getting to this point might actually be one of the things that makes it matter the most.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

It’s a strange thing to think about that the one thing that I couldn’t control, the one thing that might have meant that it would be better not to have any aspirations related to politics at all could be the very thing that anchors the moral and emotional purpose of this entire campaign.

michael barbaro

In the latest public testimony before impeachment investigators, Fiona Hill, the former top Russia expert on the National Security Council, recalled her growing frustration with Ambassador Gordon Sondland, as she realized he was pursuing a political agenda in Ukraine on behalf of President Trump.

archived recording (fiona hill) He was being involved in a domestic, political errand, and we were being involved in national security foreign policy and those two things have just diverged.

michael barbaro

Hill testified that when Trump and Sondland pressed Ukraine to investigate the discredited theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, they were playing directly into Russia’s hands, since Russia wants to deflect attention away from its interference.

archived recording (fiona hill) This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves. These fictions are harmful, even if they’re deployed for purely domestic, political purposes.

Bloomberg’s potential presidential bid, warning the former mayor of New York that he would not be able to “buy this election” and chastising his plan to skip campaigning in the early states.

Speaking at a rally in Coralville, near the liberal home of the University of Iowa, Mr. Sanders, the senator from Vermont, repeatedly addressed Mr. Bloomberg by name, almost daring him to enter a Democratic primary race that has already been in progress for months.

“Our campaign is going to end the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality which exists in America today,” said Mr. Sanders, who was joined by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a standard-bearer of the progressive left. “So tonight we say to Michael Bloomberg and other billionaires: Sorry, you ain’t going to buy this election.”

He also derided Mr. Bloomberg’s intended strategy of bypassing the key early voting states where so many of the current candidates are devoting time, money and resources."

Speaking of battleground states, a progressive organization plans to spend $75 million on digital advertising to counter Mr. Trump’s early spending advantage in them. Our colleague Shane Goldmacher has the story.

A Steyer aide resigned

Pat Murphy, the Iowa political director for Tom Steyer, resigned after reports that he had offered campaign contributions to local Iowa candidates if they endorsed Mr. Steyer. The campaign said no contributions had actually been made.

“Our campaign policy is clear that we will not engage in this kind of activity, or any kind of communication that could be perceived as improper,” Mr. Steyer’s campaign manager, Heather Hargreaves, said in a statement on Friday announcing Mr. Murphy’s resignation. “Violation of this policy is not tolerated.”

Our colleague Stephanie Saul has more details on Mr. Murphy’s actions.

Sanders released an immigration plan

Mr. Sanders unveiled his immigration plan on Thursday, pledging to use executive action if Congress does not pass comprehensive legislation.

He said that on the first day of his presidency, he would reverse President Trump’s immigration policies, including the denial of asylum claims and the “zero tolerance” policy that has led to family separations. He also vowed to halt all deportations “until a thorough audit of current and past practices and policies is complete.”

More broadly, he called for ending deportations of people who have been in the United States for more than five years, creating a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, expanding the DACA program and making unauthorized immigration a civil, not criminal, offense.

Our colleague Reid J. Epstein has more details.

Mr. Sanders has been working hard to win over Latino voters, our colleague Jennifer Medina reports. He has raised more money than any other candidate from Latinos, and was leading among them in a recent set of New York Times/Siena College polls.

At a forum on Friday, Ms. Warren said she, too, was open to suspending deportations, “particularly as a way to push Congress for comprehensive immigration reform.”

In other policy news:

Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey announced an economic justice plan centered on what he called the City 2030 Project, in which 50 or more small and medium-size cities would be chosen as regional hubs and given federal funding. The plan would also create a fund for communities hurt by policies like the 1994 crime bill; strengthen antitrust regulations and block some corporate mergers; and expand tax-privileged “opportunity zones.”

Former Representative John Delaney of Maryland released a “Paris 2.0” proposal that would commit members of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and create a global institute for research on technologies that might mitigate climate change.

Ms. Warren outlined how she would support veterans and service members, pledging to raise service members’ pay, expand mental health services and eliminate the benefits backlog at federal agencies.

And finally …

Ms. Warren has wholeheartedly embraced attacks from Wall Street, and on Thursday, she took it one step further: Her campaign released a “calculator for the billionaires.”

“Some billionaires seem confused about how much they would pay under Elizabeth’s Ultra-Millionaire Tax,” it says. “Don’t worry, now we have a calculator for that too.”"

The Times reported that “the Ukrainian government was aware of the freeze during most of the period in August when Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph Giuliani and two American diplomats were pressing President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to make a public commitment to the investigations.”

This week, Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union, testified that he explicitly told a top Ukrainian official that release of the aid was contingent on a public announcement of an investigation.

It’s all just hearsay. And the whistle-blower is a partisan Democrat.

Not just hearsay, but “triple hearsay.” This argument first appeared in October, as the outlines of the whistle-blower’s complaint came into focus. “Today was just more triple hearsay and selective leaks from the Democrats’ politically motivated, closed-door, secretive hearings,” said the White House Press secretary, Stephanie Grisham.

What about the anonymous whistle-blower? The president’s allies and conservative media outlets have been speculating about the person’s identity and motivations. But the truth is that the whistle-blower could have been Joe Biden himself at this point. What matters isn’t the motivation but the substance of the complaint. Virtually every element has been corroborated by multiple people.

It was a quid pro quo. But so what? This happens all the time.

“Did he also mention to me in passing the corruption related to the D.N.C. server?” Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, offered this during an October news conference. “Absolutely. No question about that,” he said. “That’s why we held up the money.”

For good measure, he added, “Get over it.”

To their credit, not even Mr. Trump’s most steadfast allies have signed on to this particular defense, at least not yet. Mr. Mulvaney, realizing the depth of the hole he had dug, later claimed he had not said what he said. Still, his claim did serve one important function, which was to pivot the administration’s basic case away from “no quid pro quo” to “yes, quid pro quo, but so what?”

It was a quid pro quo, but President Trump was only interested in rooting out corruption in Ukraine."

Biden Jr., she is also uneasy about his tendency to misspeak. “I am worried about the top four candidates because they all have issues,” said Ms. Wellman, a 54-year-old Iowa caucusgoer from West Des Moines who likes Senator Amy Klobuchar.

Ms. Wellman is not the only Democrat who keeps finding flaws as she searches for the best candidate to win the White House.

“Voters are holding back because just when they start to fall in love, they find something that gets them a little nervous,” former Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago said. “The reason it’s so fluid is because they’re still searching for the horse that can win.”



Michael R. Bloomberg believes that may be him.

Mr. Bloomberg has jolted the Democratic primary, drawing fire from the leading liberals in the field who said he was trying to buy the presidency while posing a direct threat to the centrist candidacy of Mr. Biden. But he has also exposed the jitters among establishment-aligned Democrats who fear that the leftward turn of the party is endangering their chances of building a winning coalition .



For weeks, senior Democratic officials and donors have been musing about whether a new candidate could be lured in the race, a striking illustration of nervousness just three months before the Iowa caucuses.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today — at the heart of the impeachment inquiry was a threat to withhold U.S. military assistance from Ukraine. Why that assistance had been so important to Ukraine, and to the United States, in the first place. It’s Monday, November 11.

andrew kramer

The word “Ukraine” means frontier or border land. This was a frontier between two competing empires. It’s been a country torn between East and West, between Western Europe and Russia.

archived recording [SPEAKING UKRAINIAN]

andrew kramer

For most of the 20th century, Russia had won out, and Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union.

archived recording The Declaration of Independence is on, as of today? That’s what it says. From the moment — It is effective as of today.

andrew kramer

Until August 24, 1991, when Ukraine took a step toward the West.

archived recording Good. An already emotional week ended today, as the people of the Ukraine embarked on a new beginning, becoming the fifth republic to break away from the Kremlin.

andrew kramer

It was the culmination of a long struggle for independence. And after years of hardship under Soviet rule, Ukraine was now an independent state.

archived recording This is one of the turning points in history. The vote for independence of the Ukraine is, in fact, one of those momentous events that is going to change the rest of history. It’s the end of the Russian Empire.

michael barbaro

So once Ukraine becomes an independent country, and it can have its own international relations with the rest of the world, what do those relationships start to look like?

andrew kramer

The key issue for Ukraine that defined both its foreign and its domestic policy in the post-Soviet period was the geopolitical struggle for Ukraine’s allegiance.

michael barbaro

I reached Andrew Kramer, a foreign correspondent for The Times in Kiev.

andrew kramer

On the one hand you had Ukraine, very closely tied to Russia by industrial supply chains, by energy pipelines, and indeed by culture and by history. But the European Union was pulling Ukraine in a Western direction, the European Union in the United States, trying to conceive of Ukraine as integrated into the Western European world. And as Europe pulled in one direction, Russia started to pull back.

michael barbaro

And what was it about Ukraine that interested the U.S. and the European Union?

andrew kramer

The idea was to encourage the development of a Democratic system, and to prevent the re-emergence of a Russian empire. There was the axiom that Russia without Ukraine is just a country, and Russia with Ukraine becomes an empire. So maintaining the independence of Ukraine was a policy objective to prevent the re-emergence of an expansionist imperial power in Moscow.

michael barbaro

It feels like at this point, the Cold War is officially over. But it’s not quite over.

andrew kramer

That’s right. There was a feeling that the Russians, although they had acquiesced to the independence of these countries, they had a phantom limb syndrome. They always felt that Ukraine, in fact, should belong to Russia.

michael barbaro

Phantom limb as if they could never really believe that Ukraine or Czechoslovakia or any of these countries were not really theirs anymore.

andrew kramer

Yes, that’s right. And there’s something more. There’s a cultural issue at play here. Both Russia and Ukraine trace their origin to Kiev. Kiev was the capital of the original Russian state. They feel this was the roots of their country, and they don’t want to see it in another state. So they feel that the Ukrainians are something like wayward cousins in this sense, that it should be obvious to Ukrainians that this is all one culture and one civilization.

michael barbaro

So Russians believe that Russia, as a concept, as a place, as a country, as an identity began in Kiev.

andrew kramer

That’s right.

michael barbaro

But of course the fact that Ukraine is independent means that no matter how Russia feels about it, Ukraine has the right to develop whatever relationship it wants with the U.S. and with the European Union.

andrew kramer

Theoretically, certainly, but they also have to be very cautious about not poking the Russian bear. That they have a powerful neighbor and they have to acknowledge the real politics of their circumstances. What’s developing here is the tug of war that becomes the story of post-independence Ukraine, with the West reaching out to form alliances, and Russia seeking to maintain its sphere of influence in Ukraine.

archived recording Ukraine is trying to decide whether it wants to align itself with Russia’s regional trade bloc or to push for E.U integration.

andrew kramer

This really came to a head with two competing trade agreements, which were offered to Ukraine.

archived recording The Ukrainian president arrived in Strasbourg, poised to work on concluding the association agreement —

andrew kramer

One from the European Union and one from Russia.

archived recording — with a view to later establishing a free trade area between Ukraine and the E.U.

andrew kramer

The European Union offered a more serious and formal trade arrangement with Ukraine that would be, possibly a path to membership in the E.U., although that was seen as a distant prospect.

archived recording After 15 years of eager anticipation, the Customs Union between Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan is up and running.

andrew kramer

And Russia responded by offering a trade agreement of its own, which was called the Customs Union.

archived recording The union, created to ease mutual trade, could be joined by another candidate, Ukraine.

andrew kramer

Which was very similar on paper to the European Union, but it was also, in a sense, a reforming of the Soviet Union as well.

archived recording The country is at a crossroads, deciding whether to turn East or West.

michael barbaro

This feels like a very consequential moment. Because to join the E.U would feel like Ukraine saying, officially we see ourselves as part of Europe. To choose a trade deal instead with Russia would be to say to the West, we ultimately see ourselves as part of the world of Russia.

andrew kramer

That’s right. So while on paper this was about trade, grain quotas, and so forth, this was really about the destiny of the country.

The Ukrainian leader, Viktor Yanukovych, had generally been seen as a pro-Russian politician. But he had promised that Ukraine would integrate economically with the European Union, while maintaining good relations with Russia.

But in the end, in a very dramatic moment —

— the Yanukovych government announces that they will turn to Russia instead of the European Union for a trade agreement.

michael barbaro

He goes with Russia.

andrew kramer

He went with Russia.

michael barbaro

That was genuinely surprising to me. I mean, here is this country just a couple of decades out of independence, and it is taking the most formal step possible to reintegrate itself with the country it had sought independence from.

andrew kramer

That’s right. And this is what a lot of people in Ukraine and in Kiev felt about this decision.

archived recording [CHANTS IN UKRAINIAN] There were immediate protests in Kiev that never let up from the day they began in November of 2013. [SPEAKING TO A CROWD IN UKRAINIAN]

michael barbaro

And tell me about these protests.

andrew kramer

Well, when I came down to cover these protests in the late fall of 2013, there was already a tent encampment in the center of Kiev, in Independence Square, with thousands and thousands of people on the square, around the clock.

archived recording [SINGING IN UKRAINIAN]

andrew kramer

People were genuinely outraged by this decision to lean back towards Russia.

archived recording [SPEAKING TO A CROWD IN UKRAINIAN]

andrew kramer

And it was also something of a party, really. Even though they were always riot policemen — some where hovering on the edges of these protests, sometimes making incursions, making arrests, there were also groups called “titushky,” which were hired thugs who would come in with a lead pipe or knives, straight razors, and would be attacking the protesters. It started to turn more violent as the winter came on. By February, I was living in a hotel, right on the square, and it became very tense. When I drove into the city in the early morning, I could see black smoke rising from the center of Kiev from burning cars. And there were a number of very violent confrontations over about two days in late February, in which the police eventually encroached on the square, overran much of the territory that the protesters had controlled, and pushed it back to a few hundred square yards. And at the last moment, the protesters, out of desperation, they started to burn tires and actually anything that was flammable to make a ring around this small, charred bit of pavement that was the only remaining area that they controlled, that they sort of felt this was what was left of their dream of the independent Ukraine. And then in the final day —

archived recording [GUNSHOT] [SPEAKING UKRAINIAN]

andrew kramer

— there was really a cacophony of gunfire.

archived recording [GUNSHOT] And there were snipers firing into the crowd. Over this hour and a half, 70 people were killed, and several hundred people were wounded. It was such a brutal moment that the Ukrainian elite and the international community realized that something had happened that could not be left unaddressed. And there was a revolt in the Yanukovych government against the president. And the police defected —

michael barbaro

Wow.

andrew kramer

— and betrayed their president, and actually left the city center. And within hours, the president fled the capital.

michael barbaro

So what happens next?

andrew kramer

Well, what happened next was a move by Russia. Because Russia and President Vladimir Putin had just lost its ally in Viktor Yanukovych. And the very next day Putin met with his security chiefs overnight. And by dawn, President Putin orders what he calls an operation to take back Crimea, which is in the south of Ukraine. And what this was really was an order of a military intervention into Ukraine.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording Russia is tightening its grip on Crimea, as we get reports of an increasing number of troops and takeovers of key military facilities. This despite intense diplomatic efforts —

michael barbaro

What is it about Crimea that makes it the most logical place for Putin to try to invade?

andrew kramer

Well, Crimea is host to a major Russian naval base in Sevastopol. So the military infrastructure is partly already in place. Also, the population in Crimea is predominantly Russian-speaking. So you would have a receptive population in this area.

archived recording Look at Ukraine and Crimea, down in the south there, jutting out into the waters of the Black Sea, home to a critical port the Russian navy has used for centuries. This morning, more unidentified pro-Russian armed militias, patrolling the streets of Crimea’s capital.

andrew kramer

So this was an unacknowledged intervention. These were men who had no insignia on their uniforms. They were called, disparagingly by the Ukrainians, “the little green men,” as if they’d come from space. Mystery men in green uniforms by the hundreds were showing up in their country.

andrew kramer

So by this point the political process starts. The de facto authorities declare a referendum. There are no observers, so it’s hard to say exactly what happened. But the people are asked, do you want to join Russia or would you like to remain in Ukraine? And by this point, of course, they are, in fact, already part of Russia. And the results come in, and a majority want to be annexed by Russia.

michael barbaro

So Russia, having invaded Crimea, then asks the people of Crimea, do you, basically mind that we just invaded Crimea? And it turns out that the answer is no.

andrew kramer

Exactly.

michael barbaro

Is it fair to say that Russia was using this kind of vote as a rationale to say, it’s OK that we just annexed Crimea, because in a sense, Crimea was always ours?

andrew kramer

Yes, absolutely. The message was, these are our people, and they’re coming home.

So we left off back in Kiev with Ukraine losing its leader. So what is the response in Ukraine to this military incursion by Russia? What happened next was, Russia tried a similar approach in other provinces.

archived recording Just yesterday, at this hour, thousands of Russian troops have been deployed to Ukraine’s border.

They’ve fomented uprisings in Russian-speaking areas. And this led to the war that we have going on in Ukraine today between pro-Russian forces and pro-Ukrainian forces.

And they settled on what they were calling non-lethal assistance.

archived recording (barack obama) — to provide American assistance for the Ukrainian government, so that they can weather this storm and stabilize their economy.

andrew kramer

And this was training for the Ukrainian army, ambulances, armored vehicles, body armor, radios, and other types of assistance, which were not deemed to be lethal, or most importantly, would not provoke a retaliatory escalation from Russia.

archived recording It’s time to ask the hard question. Are we willing to stand up to Vladimir Putin’s aggression before he kills more people, does more economic damage, further destabilizes Europe?

andrew kramer

So this began in 2014.

archived recording Our options grow fewer and less effective.

andrew kramer

Support for Ukraine in Congress had been bipartisan. Both parties had agreed that backing Ukrainian independence was really in the United State’s interests. This was about holding Russia at bay. There hadn’t been much controversy over that.

archived recording That’s why I’m announcing today my plan to introduce new legislation. It will offer Ukraine greater assistance on a variety of fronts.

andrew kramer

And this assistance was rolled over in Congress year after year.

michael barbaro

OK. So this is the situation after 2014. So what happens to this relationship once President Trump takes office?

andrew kramer

From the Ukrainian side, there was an effort to strike up a transactional relationship with President Trump, as sort of, you scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours. President Poroshenko and president of Ukraine at the time negotiated, for example, to buy coal from Pennsylvania. This was politically beneficial for Trump, because Pennsylvania coal miners were really Trump’s base, and Trump had promised to deliver jobs to coal miners in his campaign.

archived recording That’s a great honor and a great pleasure to be together with you, with the president, one of the most reliable, supportive, and partner — strategic partner for Ukraine. We really try to bring freedom and democracy.

michael barbaro

So the Ukrainian government is desperate to do whatever it needs to do to get into Trump’s good graces, because in their minds, if they can do that, they can restore a better relationship with the U.S., and one in which the U.S. sees Ukraine as a strategic partner, and leans away from Russia.

andrew kramer

Exactly.

archived recording (donald trump) Thank you very much. It’s wonderful to have President Poroshenko with us. We spent some time recently in the White House. And I know you’ve made good progress since then — a lot of progress, actually. And I wouldn’t say it’s the easiest place right now to live, but you’re making it better and better on a daily basis . And I do hear very, very good things.

michael barbaro

How is President Trump weighing in on this war, waging within the Ukraine between these pro-Russian forces and Ukrainian military?

archived recording (donald trump) And I really hope that Russia — because I really believe that President Putin would like to do something — I really hope that you and President Putin get together and can solve your problem. That would be a tremendous achievement. And I know you’re trying to do that.

andrew kramer

He’s been very quiet on Russia’s actions in Ukraine.

archived recording Silence in the White House, which is pretty distressing, given that we clearly have a powder keg. So will President Trump really put pressure on Vladimir Putin over this latest clash between Russia and Ukraine? Well we pressed the Trump administration repeatedly on that question. Neither the White House nor the State Department would comment.

andrew kramer

And amid all this uncertainty about whether the Trump administration is really supporting Ukraine in its conflict with Russia, the Ukrainians learned, by early August of this year, that about $400 million in military aid has been held up by the White House.

archived recording Hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. military aid has poured into Ukraine since 2014. But that could be at risk. Critics say the potential aid cut is an example of Trump capitulating to Russia. Some members of Congress are already sounding the alarm.

andrew kramer

And this was the time when they needed U.S. backing. And the aid was a symbol of U.S. backing. It was also quite valuable for their military. But it wasn’t quite clear initially what the issue was, or how serious it would become. There was a creeping awareness in Ukrainian government that the aid might, in fact, be lost by September.

michael barbaro

Finally, Andrew, the reason we’re talking to you about this military aid at all is, of course, the phone call that President Trump makes to Ukraine’s president, and everything that we have learned since about the withholding of that aid to Ukraine, unless the Ukrainians agreed to do these investigations that President Trump wanted into his rivals. And based on what you’ve told us, how critically important this aide is, I guess I’m curious what the people fighting the war in Ukraine on the ground, who rely on this military aid, what they make of this series of events.

andrew kramer

Ultimately, when I talked to dozens of soldiers, the feeling was one of disappointment. They felt they had maybe lost an ally in this war. I was at the front in October and met with some soldiers, and they naturally said that they were disappointed. The Ukrainian army is a poor army. They’re fighting with basic weapons — Kalashnikov rifles, binoculars. They’re living in dug out bunkers. Some of the soldiers, for example, are wearing tennis shoes and not boots. It’s a very grim existence. So for them to learn they were losing the military assistance was quite a blow. Soldiers said they were disappointed. So this was really a shock to soldiers to realize that they might be in this on their own.

michael barbaro

Andrew, thank you very much.

andrew kramer

Thank you.

This week, the first witness to be called in the public phase of the impeachment inquiry will be Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, who is expected to testify that he had a, quote, “Clear understanding that American military aid to Ukraine would not be released until the Ukrainians pursued investigations that would benefit President Trump.” In his closed door testimony, Taylor has described a quote snake pit of people around the president, who were willing to use the military aid as leverage over Ukraine, despite the danger it posed to Ukraine.

The meeting in Kiev in May occurred after Mr. Giuliani, with Mr. Parnas’s help, had planned a trip there to urge Mr. Zelensky to pursue the investigations. Mr. Giuliani canceled his trip at the last minute, claiming he was being “set up.”

Only three people were present at the meeting: Mr. Parnas, Mr. Fruman and Serhiy Shefir, a member of the inner circle of Mr. Zelensky, then the Ukrainian president-elect. The sit-down took place at an outdoor cafe in the days before Mr. Zelensky’s May 20 inauguration, according to a person familiar with the events. The men sipped coffee and spoke in Russian, which is widely spoken in Ukraine, the person said.

Mr. Parnas’s lawyer, Joseph A. Bondy, said the message to the Ukrainians was given at the direction of Mr. Giuliani, whom Mr. Parnas believed was acting under Mr. Trump’s instruction. Mr. Giuliani said he “never authorized such a conversation.”

A lawyer for Mr. Fruman, John M. Dowd, said his client told him the men were seeking only a meeting with Mr. Zelensky, the new president. “There was no mention of any terms, military aid or whatever they are talking about it — it’s false,” said Mr. Dowd, who represents Mr. Fruman along with the lawyer Todd Blanche."

Speaking at a rally in Coralville, near the liberal home of the University of Iowa, Mr. Sanders, the senator from Vermont, repeatedly addressed Mr. Bloomberg by name, almost daring him to enter a Democratic primary race that has already been in progress for months.

“Our campaign is going to end the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality which exists in America today,” said Mr. Sanders, who was joined by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a standard-bearer of the progressive left. “So tonight we say to Michael Bloomberg and other billionaires: Sorry, you ain’t going to buy this election.”

The Times reported that “the Ukrainian government was aware of the freeze during most of the period in August when Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph Giuliani and two American diplomats were pressing President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to make a public commitment to the investigations.”

This week, Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union, testified that he explicitly told a top Ukrainian official that release of the aid was contingent on a public announcement of an investigation.

It’s all just hearsay. And the whistle-blower is a partisan Democrat.

Not just hearsay, but “triple hearsay.” This argument first appeared in October, as the outlines of the whistle-blower’s complaint came into focus. “Today was just more triple hearsay and selective leaks from the Democrats’ politically motivated, closed-door, secretive hearings,” said the White House Press secretary, Stephanie Grisham.

What about the anonymous whistle-blower? The president’s allies and conservative media outlets have been speculating about the person’s identity and motivations. But the truth is that the whistle-blower could have been Joe Biden himself at this point. What matters isn’t the motivation but the substance of the complaint. Virtually every element has been corroborated by multiple people.

It was a quid pro quo. But so what? This happens all the time.

“Did he also mention to me in passing the corruption related to the D.N.C. server?” Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, offered this during an October news conference. “Absolutely. No question about that,” he said. “That’s why we held up the money.”

For good measure, he added, “Get over it.”

To their credit, not even Mr. Trump’s most steadfast allies have signed on to this particular defense, at least not yet. Mr. Mulvaney, realizing the depth of the hole he had dug, later claimed he had not said what he said. Still, his claim did serve one important function, which was to pivot the administration’s basic case away from “no quid pro quo” to “yes, quid pro quo, but so what?”

It was a quid pro quo, but President Trump was only interested in rooting out corruption in Ukraine."

But I’m still not convinced he could get there. Spin me the story of how he wins the nomination and trumps the Trump.

Bret: Beating Trump would be the easy part — assuming he can secure the nomination. Democrats will vote for him because he isn’t Trump, and because he shares their core values when it comes to reproductive rights, gun control and climate change. Independents will vote for him because he isn’t Trump and because they know he will be a good steward of the economy and a capable champion of American interests and values. That leaves Trump with nobody except his hard-core base, which is about 40 percent of the electorate.

I also see Bloomberg easily winning Florida. Our first Jewish president! I’m kvelling already.

Gail: He’d be the first-whole-bunch-of-things. Time for a change!

Bret: The toughie is getting the nomination. He’s an East Coast Master-of-the-Universe when Democrats have become the party that wants to “cancel billionaires,” whatever that means. He is jumping in the race very late and will tick off some voters for seeming like an opportunistic Johnny-come-lately. He will have a hard time winning in Iowa, where other candidates have been stumping for months. But he should definitely try to compete in New Hampshire. He needs a strong showing in at least one state to prove he’s for real and can actually win votes rather than merely buy them.

Gail: Looks like his plan is to skip Iowa and New Hampshire. Which worked so well for that other New York mayor, Rudy Giuliani. Still remember covering the Giuliani presidential campaign in Florida, watching him try to casually walk along the beach in a suit.

But I would never insult Bloomberg by comparing him to Rudy …

Bret: Comparing Bloomberg to Giuliani is like comparing Carlos Santana to Axl Rose: One of them definitely did not get better with age.

Bloomberg’s appeal to Democrats must be along the lines that he’s a uniter in an age of division; that he made his fortune honestly, ran his business ethically and has given billions back; that he’s ready to be president on Day 1; that he will restore sanity and sobriety to our politics; and, above all, that he is the only moderate in the race with a sure shot at the election.

In fact, even the president’s most loyal Republican allies, who participated in hours of closed-door questioning of the witnesses, have refrained from raising doubts about the veracity of the transcripts that have been released so far.

But Mr. Trump said the effort to remove him from office was an “Impeachment Scam,” and he has repeatedly demanded that Republicans join him in undermining the legitimacy of the Democratic-led inquiry. In one tweet on Monday, Mr. Trump called on Republicans to “put out their own transcripts.”

In another, the president called for fraud investigations into Mr. Schiff and the C.I.A. whistle-blower who revealed a July 25 call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. Mr. Trump also urged an inquiry into Mark Zaid, the whistle-blower’s lawyer, who has been a critic of Mr. Trump and once tweeted that a “coup has started.”

Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that the July 25 call was “perfect.” On Monday night, Mr. Trump said in a tweet that he planned to release the transcript of an earlier call with Mr. Zelensky, claiming to be the most transparent president in history.

“I am sure you will find it tantalizing!” Mr. Trump wrote.

The transcripts of the three officials released on Monday added more detail to the narrative that Democrats are hoping to present to the public about Mr. Trump’s efforts to use the power of his office to leverage Ukraine in ways that could help him in the 2020 election."

The race remains fluid, with less than a third of likely caucus-goers saying they are firmly set on their choice.

“Buttigieg is emerging as a top pick for a wide variety of Iowa Democrats,” Patrick Murray, the poll's director, said in a statement. “He is doing well with voters regardless of education or ideology.”

Other candidates registered single-digit support among likely caucusgoers, including Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar at 5%, California Sen.

michael barbaro

Today: Day one of the public hearings in the impeachment inquiry. It’s Thursday, November 14. So, Mike Schmidt, two days in a row.

michael schmidt

Guess we’re in the middle of a big story.

michael barbaro

We are. So, today is day one in the public hearings of this impeachment inquiry. How does this begin?

michael schmidt: 10

06 a.m.

archived recording (adam schiff) The committee will come to order.

michael schmidt

Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, gavels the hearing room to order. He’s got the Democrats on the panel to his right. He has the Republicans on the left. And he has two longtime State Department officials sitting in front of him: George Kent, who’s in charge of, basically, the State Department’s policy towards Ukraine, and Bill Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine.

archived recording (adam schiff) With that, I now recognize myself to give an opening statement in the impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump, the 45th president of the United States.

michael schmidt

And Schiff begins to lay out his argument for why he believes that what Donald Trump did in regards to Ukraine is so important that he needs to be impeached.

archived recording (adam schiff) In 2014, Russia invaded the United States ally Ukraine to reverse that nation’s embrace of the West and to fulfill Vladimir Putin’s desire to rebuild a Russian empire.

michael schmidt

Schiff says that Donald Trump tried to take advantage of a country that was in a very vulnerable spot.

archived recording (adam schiff) 14,000 Ukrainians died as they battled superior Russian forces.

michael schmidt

They needed the United States’s support, and perhaps more importantly, its military aid.

archived recording (adam schiff) Earlier this year, Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president of Ukraine on a platform of ending the conflict and tackling corruption. He was a newcomer to politics and immediately sought to establish a relationship with Ukraine’s most powerful patron, the United States.

michael barbaro

Right, and what Schiff seems to be trying to do is to remind the public that the stakes of what was happening here, and what most people think of as a quid pro quo, was the actual life and death of Ukraine and its people.

archived recording (adam schiff) The questions presented by this impeachment inquiry are whether President Trump sought to exploit that ally’s vulnerability and invite Ukraine’s interference in our elections, whether President Trump sought to condition official acts, such as a White House meeting or U.S. military assistance, on Ukraine’s willingness to assist to his two political investigations that would help his re-election campaign. And if President Trump did either, whether such an abuse of his power is compatible with the office of the presidency.

michael schmidt

And Schiff poses the question, is this such an egregious thing the president has done that we, as a country, have to take a move that we’ve only done twice before in history?

archived recording (adam schiff) The matter is as simple and as terrible as that. Our answer to these questions will affect not only the future of this presidency, but the future of the presidency itself, and what kind of conduct or misconduct the American people may come to expect from their commander in chief.

michael schmidt

Then, the top Republican on the committee —

archived recording (devin nunes) Thanks, gentlemen.

michael schmidt

— Devon Nunez, gives his opening statement.

archived recording (devin nunes) In a July open hearing of this committee, following publication of the Mueller report, the Democrats engaged in a last-ditch effort to convince the American people that President Trump is a Russian agent.

michael schmidt

It starts with him laying out how the Democrats tried as hard as they could to prove that Donald Trump was a Russian agent.

archived recording (devin nunes) That hearing was the pitiful finale of a three-year-long operation by the Democrats, the corrupt media and partisan bureaucrats to overturn the results of the 2016 election.

michael schmidt

They failed at that. Here they go again.

archived recording (devin nunes) They turned on a dime, and now claim the real malfeasance is Republicans’ dealings with Ukraine.

michael schmidt

And then —

archived recording (devin nunes) What we will witness today is a televised theatrical performance staged by the Democrats.

michael schmidt

— he turns to the witnesses.

archived recording (devin nunes) Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Kent, I’d like to welcome you here. I’d like to congratulate you for passing the Democrats’ star chamber auditions held for the last weeks in the basement of the Capitol.

michael barbaro

You have been recruited by the Democrats because of how well you performed in these private secret depositions.

archived recording (devin nunes) It seems you agreed, witting or unwittingly, to participate in a drama. But the main performance, the Russia hoax, has ended, and you’ve been cast in the low-rent Ukrainian sequel.

michael barbaro

Right, before these witnesses even have a chance to utter a word, the top Republican on the committee is besmirching them and saying, you’re here in cahoots with the Democrats, and everything you’re about to say is therefore poisoned by that reality.

michael schmidt

Correct.

archived recording (devin nunes) This spectacle is doing great damage to our country. It’s nothing more than an impeachment process in search of a crime. And I yield back.

michael schmidt

In response, Schiff starts reading the resumes of the witness.

archived recording (adam schiff) Ambassador William Taylor has served our country for over half a century.

michael schmidt

They’re the resumes of career diplomats who have served both parties.

archived recording (adam schiff) In 2006, President Bush nominated him as ambassador to Ukraine.

michael schmidt

And come from backgrounds that are pretty apolitical.

archived recording (george kent) Good morning. My name is George Kent, and I am the deputy assistant secretary of state for Eastern Europe and the Caucasus.

michael schmidt

And then, when George Kent starts to give his opening statement —

archived recording (george kent) I have served proudly as a nonpartisan career Foreign Service officer for more than 27 years under five presidents, three Republican and two Democrat.

michael schmidt

— he sort of echoes that theme.

archived recording (george kent) I represent the third generation of my family to have chosen a career in public service and sworn the oath of office that all U.S. public servants do in defense of our Constitution. Indeed, there has been a George Kent sworn to defend the Constitution continuously for nearly 60 years.

michael schmidt

Nunes is trying as hard as he can to paint them as part of this Democratic effort. And their resumes are rising up and speaking for themselves.

archived recording (george kent) The United States has very clear national interests at stake in Ukraine. Ukraine’s success is very much in our national interest.

michael schmidt

And it set a tone early on that these two witnesses were going to speak with great authority about not only what happened, but how it fits into the larger story of the United States’s foreign policy.

archived recording (george kent) Ukraine has been on the front lines not just of Russia’s conventional war in Eastern Europe since 2014 and its broader campaign of malign influence, but of the greater geopolitical challenges now facing the United States.

michael barbaro

And then it’s Bill Taylor’s turn.

archived recording (bill taylor) Mr. Chairman, I’m appearing today, at the committee’s request, to provide my perspective on the events that are the subject of the committee’s inquiry. I want to emphasize at the outset that while I am aware that the committee has requested my testimony as part of impeachment proceedings, I am not here to take one side or the other.

michael schmidt

And as soon as he begins speaking, his commanding nature and booming voice really start to steal the show.

archived recording (bill taylor) Once I arrived in Kiev, I discovered a weird combination of encouraging, confusing and, ultimately, alarming circumstances.

michael schmidt

He starts to describe how American foreign policy was functioning under Donald Trump.

archived recording (bill taylor) There appeared to be two channels of U.S. policymaking and implementation, one regular and one highly irregular. As the acting ambassador, I had authority over the regular, formal diplomatic processes.

michael schmidt

There’s essentially the American foreign policy on paper, which the State Department and diplomats are trying to carry out.

archived recording (bill taylor) At the same time, however, I encountered an irregular, informal channel of U.S. policymaking with respect to Ukraine, unaccountable to Congress.

michael schmidt

And then there’s this other track —

archived recording (bill taylor) I was clearly in the regular channel, but I was also in the irregular one to the extent that Ambassadors Volker and Sondland including me in certain conversations. Although this irregular channel was well-connected in Washington, it operated mostly outside the official State Department channels.

michael schmidt

— that has some diplomats who usually wouldn’t deal with Ukraine and a bit of Rudy Giuliani mixed in.

archived recording (bill taylor) I began to sense that these two separate decision making channels, the regular and the irregular, were separate and at odds.

michael schmidt

For those of us that have followed this closely, we’re sort of sitting there saying, well, that was in his testimony. We read that in the transcript that came out last week. But for everyone else in the country, it’s bringing this story to life.

archived recording (bill taylor) — so important, that security assistance was so important for Ukraine as well as our own national interests. To withhold that assistance, for no good reason other than help with the political campaign, made no sense. It was counterproductive to all of what we had been trying to do. It was illogical. It could not be explained. It was crazy.

michael barbaro

Right. So much of this has been laid out in closed-door testimony and in transcripts from that testimony that have been released to the public, so we know a lot of what Bill Taylor is saying here. So do we actually learn anything new?

michael schmidt

Taylor comes with two new pieces of information. One of the chief arguments the Trump administration has made is that how could there be a quid pro quo, because they didn’t know the aide was being held up?

michael barbaro

The Ukrainians never really understood the money was being withheld, they argue.

michael schmidt

Correct, no harm, no foul. They didn’t know what was going on.

archived recording (bill taylor) Also on July 20, I had a phone conversation with Oleksandr Danylyuk, President Zelensky’s national security adviser, who emphasized that President Zelensky did not want to be used as an instrument in a U.S. re-election campaign.

michael schmidt

But Taylor begins to describe conversations that he had with Ukrainians that give us a sense that this was being felt by them. They were feeling the pressure when he was asking them for the favor.

archived recording (bill taylor) I got several questions, other officials got several questions, as well, from Ukrainians asking about the security assistance. So what I know is the security assistance was very important to the Ukrainians. They had begun to hear from Ambassador Sondland that the security assistance was not going to come until the investigations were pursued.

michael schmidt

They knew that if they didn’t do what Trump wanted, they weren’t going to get the thing that they needed. And it makes the whole ploy more substantive and substantial, because the argument has been, they didn’t know. But they did. And Taylor says, here’s how I know that.

michael barbaro

And what’s the second thing?

michael schmidt

The second thing is new evidence that draws Donald Trump deeper into this story.

archived recording (bill taylor) Last Friday, a member of my staff told me of events that occurred on July 26.

michael schmidt

Taylor says, this is not something I saw, but one of my aides, the day after the now-famous call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, overhears a phone conversation between Trump and a top American diplomat.

archived recording (bill taylor) The member of my staff could hear President Trump on the phone asking Ambassador Sondland about the investigations. Ambassador Sondland told President Trump the Ukrainians were ready to move forward.

michael barbaro

And by investigations, he means the president’s desired digging into his political rivals, namely Joe Biden.

michael schmidt

Correct. And after the call, the aide follows up with the American diplomat and says, what was that all about?

archived recording (bill taylor) Following the call with President Trump, the member of my staff asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for.

michael schmidt

And the diplomat said the thing Trump cares more about is the investigations.

michael barbaro

More than Ukraine and its security?

michael schmidt

Correct. So here we are, a day after the famous call, learning about a new incident in which the president is reiterating how important these investigations, particularly on the Bidens, are to him.

michael barbaro

And this is all unfolding, chronologically, at a moment where the U.S. aid to Ukraine is being withheld after the president has, as you said, asked for a favor. So this is one more data point showing that the president wants Ukraine to do these politically-motivated investigations into his rivals. And it becomes increasingly hard — correct? — for anyone to claim that the president’s intentions and conduct here are ambiguous.

michael schmidt

Correct. You’re building towards a larger narrative of what Trump was up to and what he really wanted.

archived recording (bill taylor) Mr. Chairman, I recognize that this is rather a lengthy recitation of the events of the past few months, told from my vantage point in Kiev. But I also recognize the importance of the matters your committee is investigating. And I hope that this chronology will provide some framework for your questions.

michael barbaro

So at this point, Mike, it feels like the Democrats are pulling off a pretty successful day one of their public hearing, from their perspective. They are demonstrating that Ukrainian lives were at stake when this money was being withheld in this quid pro quo scheme. They establish that the Ukrainians felt the pressure of this arrangement, that it was not abstract to them. And finally, they are putting the president directly at the center of this all.

michael schmidt

Correct. They’re adding new details that bolster their story. And for the first day of testimony, that’s a pretty good accomplishment.

[music]

michael schmidt

But then the Republicans have a chance to ask questions, and they have a pretty effective strategy of their own.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So, Mike, once Republicans get to ask these two witnesses questions, what does their strategy actually look like?

michael schmidt

One by one, the Republican representatives try and water down the Democrats’ argument. They take on the issue of whether the Ukrainians truly felt pressure to commit to these investigations.

archived recording (devin nunes) Note this important fact: The security assistance was provided to Ukraine without the Ukrainians having done any of the things they were supposedly being blackmailed to do.

michael schmidt

And when the Ukrainians were asked, did you feel pressure from Donald Trump to do this? Ukrainians said no.

archived recording (devin nunes) The Ukrainian president stood in front of the world press and repeatedly, consistently, over and over again, interview after interview, said he had no knowledge of military aid being withheld, meaning no quid pro quo, no pressure, no demands, no threats, no blackmail, nothing corrupt.

michael barbaro

So this is a clear strategy of trying to take the air out of what the Democrats are arguing and saying instead, so there’s all this talk of a quid pro quo, but actually, the military aid gets to the Ukrainians, so that takes away one half of it. And those investigations that were sought, they never happened, which, they argue, takes away the other half of it.

michael schmidt

It’s the argument of quid pro so — so what?

michael barbaro

I mean, can both those things be true, though? That you can ask for something and not get it, and it still be wrong?

michael schmidt

Well, the Democrats, when they try and come back and clean this up, say, is attempted murder a crime? Is attempted robbery a crime? Even if Donald Trump didn’t succeed in this, he tried. And that matters.

michael barbaro

But how do the Republicans on this panel grapple with the new revelations that appear pretty damning from Bill Taylor?

archived recording (michael turner) Ambassador Taylor, the reason why the Sixth Amendment doesn’t allow hearsay is because it’s unreliable. It’s unreliable because frequently, it’s untruthful.

michael schmidt

They say it’s hearsay.

archived recording (adam schiff) Ambassador, you testified about a number of things that you heard. Isn’t it possible that the things that you heard were not true, that some of the beliefs and understandings that you had are not accurate, that, in fact, you’re mistaken about some of the things that you testified today, in a factual basis —

michael schmidt

Was that staffer that Taylor was talking about, was that staffer talking to the president? No, that staffer was not. The staffer just overheard that conversation.

michael barbaro

Hmm. And by the way, that staffer than conveys it to you, Bill Taylor, so it’s essentially thirdhand.

michael schmidt

Correct, and the Republicans ask Kent and Taylor —

archived recording (jim jordan) So you weren’t on the call, were you? The president — you didn’t listen in on President Trump’s call, and President Zelensky’s call? archived recording (bill taylor) I did not.

michael schmidt

— did you ever talk to the president about the quid pro quo? No.

archived recording (jim jordan) You’ve never talked with Chief of Staff Mulvaney? archived recording (bill taylor) I never did.

michael schmidt

Did you ever talk to the president?

archived recording (jim jordan) You never met the president? archived recording (bill taylor) That’s correct.

michael schmidt

No.

archived recording (jim jordan) This is what I can’t believe. And you’re their star witness. You’re their first witness.

michael schmidt

So where are these firsthand accounts? If we’re going to impeach the president and remove him from office, where is the direct evidence tying him to this?

michael barbaro

Why is it important that those two diplomats did or didn’t have a conversation with the president? As best I can tell, all the testimony so far has been from career diplomats who are essentially in the middle of the bureaucracy, and experienced what they regarded as this improper scheme in the places where they were, not as people who work directly with the president.

michael schmidt

Correct. Much of the testimony so far has been from this sort of second layer of folks, who were not directly talking to the president. And I think what the Republicans are trying to say is that if we are going to take this extreme measure of removing a president for the first time in American history, we need more evidence than just these people who were not talking directly to Trump.

archived recording (jim jordan) Over the next few weeks, we’re going to have more witnesses like we’ve had today that the Democrats will parade in here, and they’re all going to say this, so and so said such and such to so and so, and therefore we got to impeach the president. That’s what we’re going to hear.

michael barbaro

So by that argument, Republicans seem to be making the case that until they hear directly from a witness who heard something directly from the president, they are not going to be persuaded.

michael schmidt

Correct, and it’s a little disingenuous, because the White House is blocking those people closest to the president from talking to Congress.

michael barbaro

So in that sense, it’s kind of a convenient strategy.

michael schmidt

Correct.

michael barbaro

But is it effective?

michael schmidt

It starts to build room for Senate Republicans to say, we do not have enough evidence directly tying Trump to this. And it begins to open up that gap and water down the Democrats’ argument that this is something Trump should be removed for.

michael barbaro

It feels like this line of questioning for the Republicans, especially the hearsay argument, reveals a pretty complicated reality for the Democrats who are running these hearings, which is, it’s easy to poke holes in the case for impeachment, whereas it’s relatively difficult to make a highly compelling case to the whole country for impeachment, as you said, especially when the White House is blocking the witnesses with the most direct access to the president.

michael schmidt

Without those witnesses, the Democrats are sort of fighting with one hand tied behind their back. They do not have access to those closest to Trump. And to take such a severe move, Republicans are going to say, where are those accounts? Where is that evidence? And that’s where the Democrats will struggle.

archived recording (adam schiff) Over the weeks to come, or over the days to come, rather, we will hear from other dedicated public servants.

michael barbaro

So, Mike, how does this hearing come to an end?

michael schmidt

After six hours of back and forth between the Republicans and the Democrats and the witnesses, Schiff sort of bookends the hearing, and tries again to remind people of what was at stake here.

archived recording (adam schiff) At the end of the day, we’re going to have to decide based on the evidence that you and others provide whether we’re prepared to accept a situation where the president can condition military aid, diplomatic meetings or any other performance of an official act in order to get help in their re-election.

michael schmidt

And why this was so important.

archived recording (adam schiff) I appreciate members on both sides of the aisle who I think participated today in a civil way. This is as it should be.

michael schmidt

He thanks both parties for keeping things fairly civil.

archived recording (adam schiff) With that, this concludes this portion of the hearing.

michael schmidt

And he gavels it to a close.

archived recording (adam schiff) — call of the chair. When we resume shortly, we’ll take up Mr. Conaway’s motion.

michael barbaro

Mike, this hearing was designed very much for the public. And it was the first time that the public got a chance to meet these career Foreign Service officers who believe that the president did something wrong here. So what do you think that that public will take away from this day?

michael schmidt

They will have seen two witnesses in Kent and Taylor who saw things that they thought were real problems. They had been in government a long time, and this thing came along and could be real trouble in terms of life and death. Up until this point, we had heard about these concerns. We had read about them. But today, in Bill Taylor’s voice, you felt them, and that was different.

michael barbaro

But on the other hand, as the Republicans have pointed out, the thing they most feared, what Bill Taylor was so scared of, didn’t happen.

michael schmidt

It didn’t happen, and that dilutes the importance of it.

michael barbaro

Which suddenly creates an intriguing question that I suppose may hang over the rest of all these hearings. Are the president’s motivations, are his proven conduct, no matter what the outcome, no matter if the thing he plotted and schemed happened or didn’t happen, is the fact that he wanted it to happen and he put it in motion, is that enough to be impeached?

michael schmidt

It’s a reoccurring theme in the Trump story. The president tries to do something, but ultimately is not effective enough to actually get it done. So should we penalize him for those attempts? Is the attempt and everything that goes into it and everything that gets set in motion reach that bar for Congress to remove the president? And that’s where the debate may be in the coming weeks for the rest of these hearings.

michael barbaro

Thank you, Mike.

Thanks for having me.

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States and the president of the Republic of Turkey.

michael barbaro

On Wednesday, President Trump hosted Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, at the White House, despite the fact that Turkey has invaded Syria in a widely condemned operation that killed Kurdish allies of the U.S.

archived recording (donald trump) We’ve assured each other that Turkey will continue to uphold what it’s supposed to uphold. I’m a big fan of the president, to tell you that.

michael barbaro

During a joint news conference with Erdogan, Trump declined to criticize Erdogan for the operation, instead praising him for reaching a cease-fire in Syria.

State Dept. Official Who Described Trump’s Actions as ‘Wrong for the Rule of Law’,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/politics/who-is-george-kent.html,"WASHINGTON — As the senior State Department official in charge of Ukraine, George P. Kent was so alarmed by what he viewed as President Trump’s efforts to initiate “politically motivated prosecutions” there that he wrote a memo about it over the summer — weeks before an anonymous whistle-blower’s explosive complaint prompted the impeachment inquiry.

On Wednesday, he became one of the first public witnesses in the investigation.

In his closed-door interview with the House Intelligence Committee last month, Mr. Kent suggested the president was engaged in behavior the United States would never tolerate in nations with corrupt governments.

“There is an outstanding issue about people in office in those countries using selectively politically motivated prosecutions to go after their opponents,” Mr. Kent said, according to a transcript released last week. “And that’s wrong for the rule of law regardless of what country that happens.”"

But I’m still not convinced he could get there. Spin me the story of how he wins the nomination and trumps the Trump.

Bret: Beating Trump would be the easy part — assuming he can secure the nomination. Democrats will vote for him because he isn’t Trump, and because he shares their core values when it comes to reproductive rights, gun control and climate change. Independents will vote for him because he isn’t Trump and because they know he will be a good steward of the economy and a capable champion of American interests and values. That leaves Trump with nobody except his hard-core base, which is about 40 percent of the electorate.

I also see Bloomberg easily winning Florida. Our first Jewish president! I’m kvelling already.

Gail: He’d be the first-whole-bunch-of-things. Time for a change!

Bret: The toughie is getting the nomination. He’s an East Coast Master-of-the-Universe when Democrats have become the party that wants to “cancel billionaires,” whatever that means. He is jumping in the race very late and will tick off some voters for seeming like an opportunistic Johnny-come-lately. He will have a hard time winning in Iowa, where other candidates have been stumping for months. But he should definitely try to compete in New Hampshire. He needs a strong showing in at least one state to prove he’s for real and can actually win votes rather than merely buy them.

Gail: Looks like his plan is to skip Iowa and New Hampshire. Which worked so well for that other New York mayor, Rudy Giuliani. Still remember covering the Giuliani presidential campaign in Florida, watching him try to casually walk along the beach in a suit.

But I would never insult Bloomberg by comparing him to Rudy …

Bret: Comparing Bloomberg to Giuliani is like comparing Carlos Santana to Axl Rose: One of them definitely did not get better with age.

Bloomberg’s appeal to Democrats must be along the lines that he’s a uniter in an age of division; that he made his fortune honestly, ran his business ethically and has given billions back; that he’s ready to be president on Day 1; that he will restore sanity and sobriety to our politics; and, above all, that he is the only moderate in the race with a sure shot at the election. People love Pete Buttigieg, but he’s just too young. People should love Michael Bennet, but he failed to catch fire. And people don’t love Cory Booker because he seems way too contrived."

She feared that given his public demands for investigations by Ukraine into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son, “it was possible that the Trump administration would choose to change its policy to suit domestic politics.”

Mr. Trump railed against the coming hearings on Monday, offering another dose of his combative and unrelenting response to the impeachment inquiry. On Twitter, he accused Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, of releasing “doctored transcripts” of the administration officials who testified behind closed doors, though he offered no evidence.

In fact, even the president’s most loyal Republican allies, who participated in hours of closed-door questioning of the witnesses, have refrained from raising doubts about the veracity of the transcripts that have been released so far.

But Mr. Trump said the effort to remove him from office was an “Impeachment Scam,” and he has repeatedly demanded that Republicans join him in undermining the legitimacy of the Democratic-led inquiry. In one tweet on Monday, Mr. Trump called on Republicans to “put out their own transcripts.”

In another, the president called for fraud investigations into Mr. Schiff and the C.I.A. whistle-blower who revealed a July 25 call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. Mr. Trump also urged an inquiry into Mark Zaid, the whistle-blower’s lawyer, who has been a critic of Mr. Trump and once tweeted that a “coup has started.”

Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that the July 25 call was “perfect.” On Monday night, Mr. Trump said in a tweet that he planned to release the transcript of an earlier call with Mr. Zelensky, claiming to be the most transparent president in history.

“I am sure you will find it tantalizing!” Mr. Trump wrote.

The transcripts of the three officials released on Monday added more detail to the narrative that Democrats are hoping to present to the public about Mr. Trump’s efforts to use the power of his office to leverage Ukraine in ways that could help him in the 2020 election."

That is why, in our country’s history, only two presidents have been impeached.

But this is one of those times.

The evidence of wrongdoing by President Trump is overwhelming. The impeachment inquiry has been conducted so far in a sober, responsible way. As Wednesday’s hearing made clear, the witnesses are credible and clear, and the story they tell is alarming. All members of Congress are now compelled to listen to the witnesses and independently determine whether the president’s conduct warrants impeachment.

Mr. Trump used the immense powers of the American presidency to pressure an ally to open investigations that would help him personally. That much is clear just from the call memo of the July 25 conversation between President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. Any American who has not read the call memo should do so, because it is as shocking today to realize that Mr. Trump said the jaw-dropping phrase, “I would like you to do us a favor,” as it was the day it was released. He followed that by expressing his desire for Ukraine to investigate the 2016 election and the Bidens. That is sufficient in itself to prove unacceptable wrongdoing by the president.

But today’s testimony made clear that it goes much further. Two respected public servants — Ambassador William Taylor, an experienced diplomat and a decorated Vietnam War veteran, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, the State Department official overseeing European and Eurasian affairs — testified that the president and his personal attorney sought politically motivated investigations by the Ukrainian government into former Vice President Joseph Biden and allegations concerning the 2016 election (the latter references an unfounded conspiracy theory that Ukrainians, not Russians, were behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee, and the Ukrainians framed the Russian government to make it look like that country was working with Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign )."

The survey, which has a margin of error of 4.6 percentage points and was conducted Nov. 7-11, is the first major poll to show Mr. Buttigieg atop the field in Iowa.

Compared with Monmouth’s August poll, Mr. Buttigieg has gained 14 points, while Mr. Biden has lost 7 points. Mr. Buttigieg has gained support across nearly every demographic group, the university's polling institute said.

The race remains fluid, with less than a third of likely caucus-goers saying they are firmly set on their choice.

“Buttigieg is emerging as a top pick for a wide variety of Iowa Democrats,” Patrick Murray, the poll's director, said in a statement. “He is doing well with voters regardless of education or ideology.”

Other candidates registered single-digit support among likely caucusgoers, including Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar at 5%, California Sen. Kamala Harris at 3%, former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer at 3%, entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 3%, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker at 2%, and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard at 2%.

It is also true for other former captive nations still recovering from the ashes of Soviet misrule. It is why acting inconsistently with the core principle of rule-of-law comes with great peril.

I am grateful to all of the members of Congress and staffers who have traveled to Ukraine over the past five years and appropriated billions of dollars in assistance in support of our primary policy goals. Those funds increase Ukraine’s ability to fight Russian aggression in the defense, energy, cyber, and information spheres. They also empower state institutions and civil society to undertake systemic reforms and tackle corruption.

I believe all of us can be proud of our efforts in Ukraine over the past five years, even though much remains to be done. And by all of us I mean those in the legislative and executive branches, both parties, the interagency community working out of our embassy in Kyiv, with Ukrainians in government, the military, and civil society, and our transatlantic allies and partners. We cannot allow our resolve to waiver, since too much is at stake, not just for Ukraine and the future of European security, but for the national interests of the United States broadly defined.

My prior deposition covered a lot of ground over some ten hours. Here are the main themes from my testimony:

• I outlined my experience with longstanding U.S. interests in supporting anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine. This work gave me a front-seat to problematic activities by successive prosecutors general in Ukraine.

• For many of the issues that this Committee is investigating, my knowledge and understanding is sometimes first hand, and sometimes comes from others involved in some specific conversations and meetings. This is no different than how any one learns and carries out his or her job responsibilities. I have been and remain willing to share my factual observations with the Committee, and will make it clear when those are based on personal knowledge, or information gained from others.

• U.S. efforts to counter corruption in Ukraine focus on building institutional capacity so that the Ukrainian government has the ability to go after corruption and effectively investigate, prosecute, and judge alleged criminal activities using appropriate institutional mechanisms -- that is -- to create and follow the rule of law. That means if there is any criminal nexus for activity in the United States, then U.S. law enforcement should pursue that case. If we think there has been some criminal act overseas that violates U.S. law, we have the institutional mechanisms to address that. It could be through the Justice Department and FBI agents assigned oversees, or through treaty mechanisms, such as the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty. As a general principle, I do not believe the United States should ask other countries to engage in selective, politically associated investigations or prosecutions against opponents of those in power, because such selective actions undermine the rule of law regardless of the country.

• The pervasive and long standing problem of corruption in Ukraine included exposure to a situation involving the energy company Burisma. The primary concern of the U.S. government since 2014 was Burisma’s owner -- Mykola Zlochevsky -- whose frozen assets abroad we had attempted to recover on Ukraine’s behalf. In early 2015, I raised questions with the deputy Prosecutor General about why the investigation of Mr. Zlochevsky had been terminated, based on our belief that prosecutors had accepted bribes to close the case."

But as the first day of open hearings suggested, it’s simple. Forget about Ukraine and diplomacy for a moment.

Suppose that a low-ranking government official, the head of a branch Social Security office, intervened to halt a widow’s long-approved Social Security payments. The widow, alarmed that without that income she might lose her home, would call the branch director to ask for help.

“I’d like you to do me a favor, though,” the director might respond. He would suggest that her Social Security payments could resume, but he’d like the widow to give him her late husband’s collection of rare coins.

Everybody would see that as an outrageous abuse of power. Whether we’re Republicans or Democrats, we would all recognize that it’s inappropriate for a federal official to use his or her power over government resources to extract personal benefits. The Social Security official could say that the payments eventually resumed, or assert that the widow’s son had engaged in skulduggery — but he’d be out of a job in an instant and would face a criminal investigation."

Union officials said they had invited former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Kamala Harris of California to interview but each declined to do so.

Ms. Warren, another leading candidate for the nomination and Mr. Sanders’s top progressive rival, has also laid out a sweeping plan for single-payer health insurance, but the union stuck with the original architect of Medicare for all.

“ We enjoyed the difficulty this time around because last time the field was so barren” aside from Mr. Sanders, Ms. Ross said.

The endorsement also brings Mr. Sanders the support of the union’s super PAC, a thorny issue given that Mr. Sanders, like most of the Democrats seeking the party’s 2020 nomination, has disavowed support from super PACs.

In 2016 the union’s super PAC spent $5 million backing Mr. Sanders in the primary contest against Hillary Clinton, a relative pittance in the world of super PACs (the one supporting Jeb Bush blew through $87 million). Still, it spent more money backing Mr. Sanders than was spent by any other super PAC on behalf of Mrs. Clinton or other Democrats in the run-up to the Iowa caucuses."

michael barbaro

Today: Day one of the public hearings in the impeachment inquiry. It’s Thursday, November 14. So, Mike Schmidt, two days in a row.

michael schmidt

Guess we’re in the middle of a big story.

michael barbaro

We are. So, today is day one in the public hearings of this impeachment inquiry. How does this begin?

michael schmidt: 10

06 a.m.

archived recording (adam schiff) The committee will come to order.

michael schmidt

Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, gavels the hearing room to order. He’s got the Democrats on the panel to his right. He has the Republicans on the left. And he has two longtime State Department officials sitting in front of him: George Kent, who’s in charge of, basically, the State Department’s policy towards Ukraine, and Bill Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine.

archived recording (adam schiff) With that, I now recognize myself to give an opening statement in the impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump, the 45th president of the United States.

michael schmidt

And Schiff begins to lay out his argument for why he believes that what Donald Trump did in regards to Ukraine is so important that he needs to be impeached.

archived recording (adam schiff) In 2014, Russia invaded the United States ally Ukraine to reverse that nation’s embrace of the West and to fulfill Vladimir Putin’s desire to rebuild a Russian empire.

michael schmidt

Schiff says that Donald Trump tried to take advantage of a country that was in a very vulnerable spot.

archived recording (adam schiff) 14,000 Ukrainians died as they battled superior Russian forces.

michael schmidt

They needed the United States’s support, and perhaps more importantly, its military aid.

archived recording (adam schiff) Earlier this year, Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president of Ukraine on a platform of ending the conflict and tackling corruption. He was a newcomer to politics and immediately sought to establish a relationship with Ukraine’s most powerful patron, the United States.

michael barbaro

Right, and what Schiff seems to be trying to do is to remind the public that the stakes of what was happening here, and what most people think of as a quid pro quo, was the actual life and death of Ukraine and its people.

archived recording (adam schiff) The questions presented by this impeachment inquiry are whether President Trump sought to exploit that ally’s vulnerability and invite Ukraine’s interference in our elections, whether President Trump sought to condition official acts, such as a White House meeting or U.S. military assistance, on Ukraine’s willingness to assist to his two political investigations that would help his re-election campaign. And if President Trump did either, whether such an abuse of his power is compatible with the office of the presidency.

michael schmidt

And Schiff poses the question, is this such an egregious thing the president has done that we, as a country, have to take a move that we’ve only done twice before in history?

archived recording (adam schiff) The matter is as simple and as terrible as that. Our answer to these questions will affect not only the future of this presidency, but the future of the presidency itself, and what kind of conduct or misconduct the American people may come to expect from their commander in chief.

michael schmidt

Then, the top Republican on the committee —

archived recording (devin nunes) Thanks, gentlemen.

michael schmidt

— Devon Nunez, gives his opening statement.

archived recording (devin nunes) In a July open hearing of this committee, following publication of the Mueller report, the Democrats engaged in a last-ditch effort to convince the American people that President Trump is a Russian agent.

michael schmidt

It starts with him laying out how the Democrats tried as hard as they could to prove that Donald Trump was a Russian agent.

archived recording (devin nunes) That hearing was the pitiful finale of a three-year-long operation by the Democrats, the corrupt media and partisan bureaucrats to overturn the results of the 2016 election.

michael schmidt

They failed at that. Here they go again.

archived recording (devin nunes) They turned on a dime, and now claim the real malfeasance is Republicans’ dealings with Ukraine.

michael schmidt

And then —

archived recording (devin nunes) What we will witness today is a televised theatrical performance staged by the Democrats.

michael schmidt

— he turns to the witnesses.

archived recording (devin nunes) Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Kent, I’d like to welcome you here. I’d like to congratulate you for passing the Democrats’ star chamber auditions held for the last weeks in the basement of the Capitol.

archived recording (devin nunes) It seems you agreed, witting or unwittingly, to participate in a drama. But the main performance, the Russia hoax, has ended, and you’ve been cast in the low-rent Ukrainian sequel.

michael barbaro

Right, before these witnesses even have a chance to utter a word, the top Republican on the committee is besmirching them and saying, you’re here in cahoots with the Democrats, and everything you’re about to say is therefore poisoned by that reality.

michael schmidt

Correct.

archived recording (devin nunes) This spectacle is doing great damage to our country. It’s nothing more than an impeachment process in search of a crime. And I yield back.

michael schmidt

In response, Schiff starts reading the resumes of the witness.

archived recording (adam schiff) Ambassador William Taylor has served our country for over half a century.

michael schmidt

They’re the resumes of career diplomats who have served both parties.

archived recording (adam schiff) In 2006, President Bush nominated him as ambassador to Ukraine.

michael schmidt

And come from backgrounds that are pretty apolitical.

archived recording (george kent) Good morning. My name is George Kent, and I am the deputy assistant secretary of state for Eastern Europe and the Caucasus.

michael schmidt

And then, when George Kent starts to give his opening statement —

archived recording (george kent) I have served proudly as a nonpartisan career Foreign Service officer for more than 27 years under five presidents, three Republican and two Democrat.

michael schmidt

— he sort of echoes that theme.

archived recording (george kent) I represent the third generation of my family to have chosen a career in public service and sworn the oath of office that all U.S. public servants do in defense of our Constitution. Indeed, there has been a George Kent sworn to defend the Constitution continuously for nearly 60 years.

michael schmidt

Nunes is trying as hard as he can to paint them as part of this Democratic effort. And their resumes are rising up and speaking for themselves.

archived recording (george kent) The United States has very clear national interests at stake in Ukraine. Ukraine’s success is very much in our national interest.

michael schmidt

And it set a tone early on that these two witnesses were going to speak with great authority about not only what happened, but how it fits into the larger story of the United States’s foreign policy.

archived recording (george kent) Ukraine has been on the front lines not just of Russia’s conventional war in Eastern Europe since 2014 and its broader campaign of malign influence, but of the greater geopolitical challenges now facing the United States.

michael barbaro

And then it’s Bill Taylor’s turn.

archived recording (bill taylor) Mr. Chairman, I’m appearing today, at the committee’s request, to provide my perspective on the events that are the subject of the committee’s inquiry. I want to emphasize at the outset that while I am aware that the committee has requested my testimony as part of impeachment proceedings, I am not here to take one side or the other.

michael schmidt

And as soon as he begins speaking, his commanding nature and booming voice really start to steal the show.

archived recording (bill taylor) Once I arrived in Kiev, I discovered a weird combination of encouraging, confusing and, ultimately, alarming circumstances.

michael schmidt

He starts to describe how American foreign policy was functioning under Donald Trump.

archived recording (bill taylor) There appeared to be two channels of U.S. policymaking and implementation, one regular and one highly irregular. As the acting ambassador, I had authority over the regular, formal diplomatic processes.

michael schmidt

There’s essentially the American foreign policy on paper, which the State Department and diplomats are trying to carry out.

archived recording (bill taylor) At the same time, however, I encountered an irregular, informal channel of U.S. policymaking with respect to Ukraine, unaccountable to Congress.

michael schmidt

And then there’s this other track —

archived recording (bill taylor) I was clearly in the regular channel, but I was also in the irregular one to the extent that Ambassadors Volker and Sondland including me in certain conversations. Although this irregular channel was well-connected in Washington, it operated mostly outside the official State Department channels.

michael schmidt

— that has some diplomats who usually wouldn’t deal with Ukraine and a bit of Rudy Giuliani mixed in.

archived recording (bill taylor) I began to sense that these two separate decision making channels, the regular and the irregular, were separate and at odds.

michael schmidt

For those of us that have followed this closely, we’re sort of sitting there saying, well, that was in his testimony. We read that in the transcript that came out last week. But for everyone else in the country, it’s bringing this story to life.

archived recording (bill taylor) — so important, that security assistance was so important for Ukraine as well as our own national interests. To withhold that assistance, for no good reason other than help with the political campaign, made no sense. It was counterproductive to all of what we had been trying to do. It was illogical. It could not be explained. It was crazy.

michael barbaro

Right. So much of this has been laid out in closed-door testimony and in transcripts from that testimony that have been released to the public, so we know a lot of what Bill Taylor is saying here. So do we actually learn anything new?

michael schmidt

Taylor comes with two new pieces of information. One of the chief arguments the Trump administration has made is that how could there be a quid pro quo, because they didn’t know the aide was being held up?

michael barbaro

The Ukrainians never really understood the money was being withheld, they argue.

michael schmidt

Correct, no harm, no foul. They didn’t know what was going on.

archived recording (bill taylor) Also on July 20, I had a phone conversation with Oleksandr Danylyuk, President Zelensky’s national security adviser, who emphasized that President Zelensky did not want to be used as an instrument in a U.S. re-election campaign.

michael schmidt

But Taylor begins to describe conversations that he had with Ukrainians that give us a sense that this was being felt by them. They were feeling the pressure when he was asking them for the favor.

archived recording (bill taylor) I got several questions, other officials got several questions, as well, from Ukrainians asking about the security assistance. So what I know is the security assistance was very important to the Ukrainians. They had begun to hear from Ambassador Sondland that the security assistance was not going to come until the investigations were pursued.

michael schmidt

They knew that if they didn’t do what Trump wanted, they weren’t going to get the thing that they needed. And it makes the whole ploy more substantive and substantial, because the argument has been, they didn’t know. But they did. And Taylor says, here’s how I know that.

michael barbaro

And what’s the second thing?

michael schmidt

The second thing is new evidence that draws Donald Trump deeper into this story.

archived recording (bill taylor) Last Friday, a member of my staff told me of events that occurred on July 26.

michael schmidt

Taylor says, this is not something I saw, but one of my aides, the day after the now-famous call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, overhears a phone conversation between Trump and a top American diplomat.

archived recording (bill taylor) The member of my staff could hear President Trump on the phone asking Ambassador Sondland about the investigations. Ambassador Sondland told President Trump the Ukrainians were ready to move forward.

michael barbaro

And by investigations, he means the president’s desired digging into his political rivals, namely Joe Biden.

michael schmidt

Correct. And after the call, the aide follows up with the American diplomat and says, what was that all about?

archived recording (bill taylor) Following the call with President Trump, the member of my staff asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for.

michael schmidt

And the diplomat said the thing Trump cares more about is the investigations.

michael barbaro

More than Ukraine and its security?

michael schmidt

Correct. So here we are, a day after the famous call, learning about a new incident in which the president is reiterating how important these investigations, particularly on the Bidens, are to him.

michael barbaro

And this is all unfolding, chronologically, at a moment where the U.S. aid to Ukraine is being withheld after the president has, as you said, asked for a favor. So this is one more data point showing that the president wants Ukraine to do these politically-motivated investigations into his rivals. And it becomes increasingly hard — correct? — for anyone to claim that the president’s intentions and conduct here are ambiguous.

michael schmidt

Correct. You’re building towards a larger narrative of what Trump was up to and what he really wanted.

archived recording (bill taylor) Mr. Chairman, I recognize that this is rather a lengthy recitation of the events of the past few months, told from my vantage point in Kiev. But I also recognize the importance of the matters your committee is investigating. And I hope that this chronology will provide some framework for your questions.

michael barbaro

So at this point, Mike, it feels like the Democrats are pulling off a pretty successful day one of their public hearing, from their perspective. They are demonstrating that Ukrainian lives were at stake when this money was being withheld in this quid pro quo scheme. They establish that the Ukrainians felt the pressure of this arrangement, that it was not abstract to them. And finally, they are putting the president directly at the center of this all.

michael schmidt

Correct. They’re adding new details that bolster their story. And for the first day of testimony, that’s a pretty good accomplishment.

[music]

michael schmidt

But then the Republicans have a chance to ask questions, and they have a pretty effective strategy of their own.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So, Mike, once Republicans get to ask these two witnesses questions, what does their strategy actually look like?

michael schmidt

One by one, the Republican representatives try and water down the Democrats’ argument. They take on the issue of whether the Ukrainians truly felt pressure to commit to these investigations.

archived recording (devin nunes) Note this important fact: The security assistance was provided to Ukraine without the Ukrainians having done any of the things they were supposedly being blackmailed to do.

michael schmidt

And when the Ukrainians were asked, did you feel pressure from Donald Trump to do this? Ukrainians said no.

archived recording (devin nunes) The Ukrainian president stood in front of the world press and repeatedly, consistently, over and over again, interview after interview, said he had no knowledge of military aid being withheld, meaning no quid pro quo, no pressure, no demands, no threats, no blackmail, nothing corrupt.

michael barbaro

So this is a clear strategy of trying to take the air out of what the Democrats are arguing and saying instead, so there’s all this talk of a quid pro quo, but actually, the military aid gets to the Ukrainians, so that takes away one half of it. And those investigations that were sought, they never happened, which, they argue, takes away the other half of it.

michael schmidt

It’s the argument of quid pro so — so what?

michael barbaro

I mean, can both those things be true, though? That you can ask for something and not get it, and it still be wrong?

michael schmidt

Well, the Democrats, when they try and come back and clean this up, say, is attempted murder a crime? Is attempted robbery a crime? Even if Donald Trump didn’t succeed in this, he tried. And that matters.

michael barbaro

But how do the Republicans on this panel grapple with the new revelations that appear pretty damning from Bill Taylor?

archived recording (michael turner) Ambassador Taylor, the reason why the Sixth Amendment doesn’t allow hearsay is because it’s unreliable. It’s unreliable because frequently, it’s untruthful.

michael schmidt

They say it’s hearsay.

archived recording (adam schiff) Ambassador, you testified about a number of things that you heard. Isn’t it possible that the things that you heard were not true, that some of the beliefs and understandings that you had are not accurate, that, in fact, you’re mistaken about some of the things that you testified today, in a factual basis —

michael schmidt

Was that staffer that Taylor was talking about, was that staffer talking to the president? No, that staffer was not. The staffer just overheard that conversation.

michael barbaro

Hmm. And by the way, that staffer than conveys it to you, Bill Taylor, so it’s essentially thirdhand.

michael schmidt

Correct, and the Republicans ask Kent and Taylor —

archived recording (jim jordan) So you weren’t on the call, were you? The president — you didn’t listen in on President Trump’s call, and President Zelensky’s call? archived recording (bill taylor) I did not.

michael schmidt

— did you ever talk to the president about the quid pro quo? No.

archived recording (jim jordan) You’ve never talked with Chief of Staff Mulvaney? archived recording (bill taylor) I never did.

michael schmidt

Did you ever talk to the president?

archived recording (jim jordan) You never met the president? archived recording (bill taylor) That’s correct.

michael schmidt

No.

archived recording (jim jordan) This is what I can’t believe. And you’re their star witness. You’re their first witness.

michael schmidt

So where are these firsthand accounts? If we’re going to impeach the president and remove him from office, where is the direct evidence tying him to this?

michael barbaro

Why is it important that those two diplomats did or didn’t have a conversation with the president? As best I can tell, all the testimony so far has been from career diplomats who are essentially in the middle of the bureaucracy, and experienced what they regarded as this improper scheme in the places where they were, not as people who work directly with the president.

michael schmidt

Correct. Much of the testimony so far has been from this sort of second layer of folks, who were not directly talking to the president. And I think what the Republicans are trying to say is that if we are going to take this extreme measure of removing a president for the first time in American history, we need more evidence than just these people who were not talking directly to Trump.

archived recording (jim jordan) Over the next few weeks, we’re going to have more witnesses like we’ve had today that the Democrats will parade in here, and they’re all going to say this, so and so said such and such to so and so, and therefore we got to impeach the president. That’s what we’re going to hear.

michael barbaro

So by that argument, Republicans seem to be making the case that until they hear directly from a witness who heard something directly from the president, they are not going to be persuaded.

michael schmidt

Correct, and it’s a little disingenuous, because the White House is blocking those people closest to the president from talking to Congress.

michael barbaro

So in that sense, it’s kind of a convenient strategy.

michael schmidt

Correct.

michael barbaro

But is it effective?

michael schmidt

It starts to build room for Senate Republicans to say, we do not have enough evidence directly tying Trump to this. And it begins to open up that gap and water down the Democrats’ argument that this is something Trump should be removed for.

michael barbaro

It feels like this line of questioning for the Republicans, especially the hearsay argument, reveals a pretty complicated reality for the Democrats who are running these hearings, which is, it’s easy to poke holes in the case for impeachment, whereas it’s relatively difficult to make a highly compelling case to the whole country for impeachment, as you said, especially when the White House is blocking the witnesses with the most direct access to the president.

michael schmidt

Without those witnesses, the Democrats are sort of fighting with one hand tied behind their back. They do not have access to those closest to Trump. And to take such a severe move, Republicans are going to say, where are those accounts? Where is that evidence? And that’s where the Democrats will struggle.

archived recording (adam schiff) Over the weeks to come, or over the days to come, rather, we will hear from other dedicated public servants.

michael barbaro

So, Mike, how does this hearing come to an end?

michael schmidt

After six hours of back and forth between the Republicans and the Democrats and the witnesses, Schiff sort of bookends the hearing, and tries again to remind people of what was at stake here.

archived recording (adam schiff) At the end of the day, we’re going to have to decide based on the evidence that you and others provide whether we’re prepared to accept a situation where the president can condition military aid, diplomatic meetings or any other performance of an official act in order to get help in their re-election.

michael schmidt

And why this was so important.

archived recording (adam schiff) I appreciate members on both sides of the aisle who I think participated today in a civil way. This is as it should be.

michael schmidt

He thanks both parties for keeping things fairly civil.

archived recording (adam schiff) With that, this concludes this portion of the hearing.

michael schmidt

And he gavels it to a close.

archived recording (adam schiff) — call of the chair. When we resume shortly, we’ll take up Mr. Conaway’s motion.

michael barbaro

Mike, this hearing was designed very much for the public. And it was the first time that the public got a chance to meet these career Foreign Service officers who believe that the president did something wrong here. So what do you think that that public will take away from this day?

michael schmidt

They will have seen two witnesses in Kent and Taylor who saw things that they thought were real problems. They had been in government a long time, and this thing came along and could be real trouble in terms of life and death. Up until this point, we had heard about these concerns. We had read about them. But today, in Bill Taylor’s voice, you felt them, and that was different.

michael barbaro

But on the other hand, as the Republicans have pointed out, the thing they most feared, what Bill Taylor was so scared of, didn’t happen.

michael schmidt

It didn’t happen, and that dilutes the importance of it.

michael barbaro

Which suddenly creates an intriguing question that I suppose may hang over the rest of all these hearings. Are the president’s motivations, are his proven conduct, no matter what the outcome, no matter if the thing he plotted and schemed happened or didn’t happen, is the fact that he wanted it to happen and he put it in motion, is that enough to be impeached?

michael schmidt

It’s a reoccurring theme in the Trump story. The president tries to do something, but ultimately is not effective enough to actually get it done. So should we penalize him for those attempts? Is the attempt and everything that goes into it and everything that gets set in motion reach that bar for Congress to remove the president? And that’s where the debate may be in the coming weeks for the rest of these hearings.

michael barbaro

Thank you, Mike.

michael schmidt

Thanks for having me.

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States and the president of the Republic of Turkey.

michael barbaro

On Wednesday, President Trump hosted Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, at the White House, despite the fact that Turkey has invaded Syria in a widely condemned operation that killed Kurdish allies of the U.S.

archived recording (donald trump) We’ve assured each other that Turkey will continue to uphold what it’s supposed to uphold. I’m a big fan of the president, to tell you that.

michael barbaro

During a joint news conference with Erdogan, Trump declined to criticize Erdogan for the operation, instead praising him for reaching a cease-fire in Syria.

michael barbaro

Today: Day one of the public hearings in the impeachment inquiry. It’s Thursday, November 14. So, Mike Schmidt, two days in a row.

michael schmidt

Guess we’re in the middle of a big story.

michael barbaro

We are. So, today is day one in the public hearings of this impeachment inquiry. How does this begin?

michael schmidt: 10

06 a.m.

archived recording (adam schiff) The committee will come to order.

michael schmidt

Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, gavels the hearing room to order. He’s got the Democrats on the panel to his right. He has the Republicans on the left. And he has two longtime State Department officials sitting in front of him: George Kent, who’s in charge of, basically, the State Department’s policy towards Ukraine, and Bill Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine.

archived recording (adam schiff) With that, I now recognize myself to give an opening statement in the impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump, the 45th president of the United States.

michael schmidt

And Schiff begins to lay out his argument for why he believes that what Donald Trump did in regards to Ukraine is so important that he needs to be impeached.

archived recording (adam schiff) In 2014, Russia invaded the United States ally Ukraine to reverse that nation’s embrace of the West and to fulfill Vladimir Putin’s desire to rebuild a Russian empire.

michael schmidt

Schiff says that Donald Trump tried to take advantage of a country that was in a very vulnerable spot.

archived recording (adam schiff) 14,000 Ukrainians died as they battled superior Russian forces.

michael schmidt

They needed the United States’s support, and perhaps more importantly, its military aid.

archived recording (adam schiff) Earlier this year, Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president of Ukraine on a platform of ending the conflict and tackling corruption. He was a newcomer to politics and immediately sought to establish a relationship with Ukraine’s most powerful patron, the United States.

michael barbaro

Right, and what Schiff seems to be trying to do is to remind the public that the stakes of what was happening here, and what most people think of as a quid pro quo, was the actual life and death of Ukraine and its people.

archived recording (adam schiff) The questions presented by this impeachment inquiry are whether President Trump sought to exploit that ally’s vulnerability and invite Ukraine’s interference in our elections, whether President Trump sought to condition official acts, such as a White House meeting or U.S. military assistance, on Ukraine’s willingness to assist to his two political investigations that would help his re-election campaign. And if President Trump did either, whether such an abuse of his power is compatible with the office of the presidency.

michael schmidt

And Schiff poses the question, is this such an egregious thing the president has done that we, as a country, have to take a move that we’ve only done twice before in history?

archived recording (adam schiff) The matter is as simple and as terrible as that. Our answer to these questions will affect not only the future of this presidency, but the future of the presidency itself, and what kind of conduct or misconduct the American people may come to expect from their commander in chief.

michael schmidt

Then, the top Republican on the committee —

archived recording (devin nunes) Thanks, gentlemen.

michael schmidt

— Devon Nunez, gives his opening statement.

archived recording (devin nunes) In a July open hearing of this committee, following publication of the Mueller report, the Democrats engaged in a last-ditch effort to convince the American people that President Trump is a Russian agent.

michael schmidt

It starts with him laying out how the Democrats tried as hard as they could to prove that Donald Trump was a Russian agent.

archived recording (devin nunes) That hearing was the pitiful finale of a three-year-long operation by the Democrats, the corrupt media and partisan bureaucrats to overturn the results of the 2016 election.

michael schmidt

They failed at that. Here they go again.

archived recording (devin nunes) They turned on a dime, and now claim the real malfeasance is Republicans’ dealings with Ukraine.

michael schmidt

And then —

archived recording (devin nunes) What we will witness today is a televised theatrical performance staged by the Democrats.

michael schmidt

— he turns to the witnesses.

archived recording (devin nunes) Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Kent, I’d like to welcome you here. I’d like to congratulate you for passing the Democrats’ star chamber auditions held for the last weeks in the basement of the Capitol.

michael barbaro

You have been recruited by the Democrats because of how well you performed in these private secret depositions.

archived recording (devin nunes) It seems you agreed, witting or unwittingly, to participate in a drama. But the main performance, the Russia hoax, has ended, and you’ve been cast in the low-rent Ukrainian sequel.

michael barbaro

Right, before these witnesses even have a chance to utter a word, the top Republican on the committee is besmirching them and saying, you’re here in cahoots with the Democrats, and everything you’re about to say is therefore poisoned by that reality.

michael schmidt

Correct.

archived recording (devin nunes) This spectacle is doing great damage to our country. It’s nothing more than an impeachment process in search of a crime. And I yield back.

michael schmidt

In response, Schiff starts reading the resumes of the witness.

archived recording (adam schiff) Ambassador William Taylor has served our country for over half a century.

michael schmidt

They’re the resumes of career diplomats who have served both parties.

archived recording (adam schiff) In 2006, President Bush nominated him as ambassador to Ukraine.

michael schmidt

And come from backgrounds that are pretty apolitical.

archived recording (george kent) Good morning. My name is George Kent, and I am the deputy assistant secretary of state for Eastern Europe and the Caucasus.

michael schmidt

And then, when George Kent starts to give his opening statement —

archived recording (george kent) I have served proudly as a nonpartisan career Foreign Service officer for more than 27 years under five presidents, three Republican and two Democrat.

michael schmidt

— he sort of echoes that theme.

archived recording (george kent) I represent the third generation of my family to have chosen a career in public service and sworn the oath of office that all U.S. public servants do in defense of our Constitution. Indeed, there has been a George Kent sworn to defend the Constitution continuously for nearly 60 years.

michael schmidt

Nunes is trying as hard as he can to paint them as part of this Democratic effort. And their resumes are rising up and speaking for themselves.

archived recording (george kent) The United States has very clear national interests at stake in Ukraine. Ukraine’s success is very much in our national interest.

michael schmidt

And it set a tone early on that these two witnesses were going to speak with great authority about not only what happened, but how it fits into the larger story of the United States’s foreign policy.

archived recording (george kent) Ukraine has been on the front lines not just of Russia’s conventional war in Eastern Europe since 2014 and its broader campaign of malign influence, but of the greater geopolitical challenges now facing the United States.

michael barbaro

And then it’s Bill Taylor’s turn.

archived recording (bill taylor) Mr. Chairman, I’m appearing today, at the committee’s request, to provide my perspective on the events that are the subject of the committee’s inquiry. I want to emphasize at the outset that while I am aware that the committee has requested my testimony as part of impeachment proceedings, I am not here to take one side or the other.

michael schmidt

And as soon as he begins speaking, his commanding nature and booming voice really start to steal the show.

archived recording (bill taylor) Once I arrived in Kiev, I discovered a weird combination of encouraging, confusing and, ultimately, alarming circumstances.

michael schmidt

He starts to describe how American foreign policy was functioning under Donald Trump.

archived recording (bill taylor) There appeared to be two channels of U.S. policymaking and implementation, one regular and one highly irregular. As the acting ambassador, I had authority over the regular, formal diplomatic processes.

michael schmidt

There’s essentially the American foreign policy on paper, which the State Department and diplomats are trying to carry out.

archived recording (bill taylor) At the same time, however, I encountered an irregular, informal channel of U.S. policymaking with respect to Ukraine, unaccountable to Congress.

michael schmidt

And then there’s this other track —

archived recording (bill taylor) I was clearly in the regular channel, but I was also in the irregular one to the extent that Ambassadors Volker and Sondland including me in certain conversations. Although this irregular channel was well-connected in Washington, it operated mostly outside the official State Department channels.

michael schmidt

— that has some diplomats who usually wouldn’t deal with Ukraine and a bit of Rudy Giuliani mixed in.

archived recording (bill taylor) I began to sense that these two separate decision making channels, the regular and the irregular, were separate and at odds.

michael schmidt

For those of us that have followed this closely, we’re sort of sitting there saying, well, that was in his testimony. We read that in the transcript that came out last week. But for everyone else in the country, it’s bringing this story to life.

archived recording (bill taylor) — so important, that security assistance was so important for Ukraine as well as our own national interests. To withhold that assistance, for no good reason other than help with the political campaign, made no sense. It was counterproductive to all of what we had been trying to do. It was illogical. It could not be explained. It was crazy.

michael barbaro

Right. So much of this has been laid out in closed-door testimony and in transcripts from that testimony that have been released to the public, so we know a lot of what Bill Taylor is saying here. So do we actually learn anything new?

michael schmidt

Taylor comes with two new pieces of information. One of the chief arguments the Trump administration has made is that how could there be a quid pro quo, because they didn’t know the aide was being held up?

michael barbaro

The Ukrainians never really understood the money was being withheld, they argue.

michael schmidt

Correct, no harm, no foul. They didn’t know what was going on.

archived recording (bill taylor) Also on July 20, I had a phone conversation with Oleksandr Danylyuk, President Zelensky’s national security adviser, who emphasized that President Zelensky did not want to be used as an instrument in a U.S. re-election campaign.

michael schmidt

But Taylor begins to describe conversations that he had with Ukrainians that give us a sense that this was being felt by them. They were feeling the pressure when he was asking them for the favor.

archived recording (bill taylor) I got several questions, other officials got several questions, as well, from Ukrainians asking about the security assistance. So what I know is the security assistance was very important to the Ukrainians. They had begun to hear from Ambassador Sondland that the security assistance was not going to come until the investigations were pursued.

michael schmidt

They knew that if they didn’t do what Trump wanted, they weren’t going to get the thing that they needed. And it makes the whole ploy more substantive and substantial, because the argument has been, they didn’t know. But they did. And Taylor says, here’s how I know that.

michael barbaro

And what’s the second thing?

michael schmidt

The second thing is new evidence that draws Donald Trump deeper into this story.

archived recording (bill taylor) Last Friday, a member of my staff told me of events that occurred on July 26.

michael schmidt

Taylor says, this is not something I saw, but one of my aides, the day after the now-famous call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, overhears a phone conversation between Trump and a top American diplomat.

archived recording (bill taylor) The member of my staff could hear President Trump on the phone asking Ambassador Sondland about the investigations. Ambassador Sondland told President Trump the Ukrainians were ready to move forward.

michael barbaro

And by investigations, he means the president’s desired digging into his political rivals, namely Joe Biden.

michael schmidt

Correct. And after the call, the aide follows up with the American diplomat and says, what was that all about?

archived recording (bill taylor) Following the call with President Trump, the member of my staff asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for.

michael schmidt

And the diplomat said the thing Trump cares more about is the investigations.

michael barbaro

More than Ukraine and its security?

michael schmidt

Correct. So here we are, a day after the famous call, learning about a new incident in which the president is reiterating how important these investigations, particularly on the Bidens, are to him.

michael barbaro

And this is all unfolding, chronologically, at a moment where the U.S. aid to Ukraine is being withheld after the president has, as you said, asked for a favor. So this is one more data point showing that the president wants Ukraine to do these politically-motivated investigations into his rivals. And it becomes increasingly hard — correct? — for anyone to claim that the president’s intentions and conduct here are ambiguous.

michael schmidt

Correct. You’re building towards a larger narrative of what Trump was up to and what he really wanted.

archived recording (bill taylor) Mr. Chairman, I recognize that this is rather a lengthy recitation of the events of the past few months, told from my vantage point in Kiev. But I also recognize the importance of the matters your committee is investigating. And I hope that this chronology will provide some framework for your questions.

michael barbaro

So at this point, Mike, it feels like the Democrats are pulling off a pretty successful day one of their public hearing, from their perspective. They are demonstrating that Ukrainian lives were at stake when this money was being withheld in this quid pro quo scheme. They establish that the Ukrainians felt the pressure of this arrangement, that it was not abstract to them. And finally, they are putting the president directly at the center of this all.

michael schmidt

Correct. They’re adding new details that bolster their story. And for the first day of testimony, that’s a pretty good accomplishment.

[music]

michael schmidt

But then the Republicans have a chance to ask questions, and they have a pretty effective strategy of their own.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So, Mike, once Republicans get to ask these two witnesses questions, what does their strategy actually look like?

michael schmidt

One by one, the Republican representatives try and water down the Democrats’ argument. They take on the issue of whether the Ukrainians truly felt pressure to commit to these investigations.

archived recording (devin nunes) Note this important fact: The security assistance was provided to Ukraine without the Ukrainians having done any of the things they were supposedly being blackmailed to do.

michael schmidt

And when the Ukrainians were asked, did you feel pressure from Donald Trump to do this? Ukrainians said no.

archived recording (devin nunes) The Ukrainian president stood in front of the world press and repeatedly, consistently, over and over again, interview after interview, said he had no knowledge of military aid being withheld, meaning no quid pro quo, no pressure, no demands, no threats, no blackmail, nothing corrupt.

michael barbaro

So this is a clear strategy of trying to take the air out of what the Democrats are arguing and saying instead, so there’s all this talk of a quid pro quo, but actually, the military aid gets to the Ukrainians, so that takes away one half of it. And those investigations that were sought, they never happened, which, they argue, takes away the other half of it.

michael schmidt

It’s the argument of quid pro so — so what?

michael barbaro

I mean, can both those things be true, though? That you can ask for something and not get it, and it still be wrong?

michael schmidt

Well, the Democrats, when they try and come back and clean this up, say, is attempted murder a crime? Is attempted robbery a crime? Even if Donald Trump didn’t succeed in this, he tried. And that matters.

michael barbaro

But how do the Republicans on this panel grapple with the new revelations that appear pretty damning from Bill Taylor?

archived recording (michael turner) Ambassador Taylor, the reason why the Sixth Amendment doesn’t allow hearsay is because it’s unreliable. It’s unreliable because frequently, it’s untruthful.

michael schmidt

They say it’s hearsay.

archived recording (adam schiff) Ambassador, you testified about a number of things that you heard. Isn’t it possible that the things that you heard were not true, that some of the beliefs and understandings that you had are not accurate, that, in fact, you’re mistaken about some of the things that you testified today, in a factual basis —

michael schmidt

Was that staffer that Taylor was talking about, was that staffer talking to the president? No, that staffer was not. The staffer just overheard that conversation.

michael barbaro

Hmm. And by the way, that staffer than conveys it to you, Bill Taylor, so it’s essentially thirdhand.

michael schmidt

Correct, and the Republicans ask Kent and Taylor —

archived recording (jim jordan) So you weren’t on the call, were you? The president — you didn’t listen in on President Trump’s call, and President Zelensky’s call? archived recording (bill taylor) I did not.

michael schmidt

— did you ever talk to the president about the quid pro quo? No.

archived recording (jim jordan) You’ve never talked with Chief of Staff Mulvaney? archived recording (bill taylor) I never did.

michael schmidt

Did you ever talk to the president?

archived recording (jim jordan) You never met the president? archived recording (bill taylor) That’s correct.

michael schmidt

No.

archived recording (jim jordan) This is what I can’t believe. And you’re their star witness. You’re their first witness.

michael schmidt

So where are these firsthand accounts? If we’re going to impeach the president and remove him from office, where is the direct evidence tying him to this?

michael barbaro

Why is it important that those two diplomats did or didn’t have a conversation with the president? As best I can tell, all the testimony so far has been from career diplomats who are essentially in the middle of the bureaucracy, and experienced what they regarded as this improper scheme in the places where they were, not as people who work directly with the president.

michael schmidt

Correct. Much of the testimony so far has been from this sort of second layer of folks, who were not directly talking to the president. And I think what the Republicans are trying to say is that if we are going to take this extreme measure of removing a president for the first time in American history, we need more evidence than just these people who were not talking directly to Trump.

archived recording (jim jordan) Over the next few weeks, we’re going to have more witnesses like we’ve had today that the Democrats will parade in here, and they’re all going to say this, so and so said such and such to so and so, and therefore we got to impeach the president. That’s what we’re going to hear.

michael barbaro

So by that argument, Republicans seem to be making the case that until they hear directly from a witness who heard something directly from the president, they are not going to be persuaded.

michael schmidt

Correct, and it’s a little disingenuous, because the White House is blocking those people closest to the president from talking to Congress.

michael barbaro

So in that sense, it’s kind of a convenient strategy.

michael schmidt

Correct.

michael barbaro

But is it effective?

michael schmidt

It starts to build room for Senate Republicans to say, we do not have enough evidence directly tying Trump to this. And it begins to open up that gap and water down the Democrats’ argument that this is something Trump should be removed for.

michael barbaro

It feels like this line of questioning for the Republicans, especially the hearsay argument, reveals a pretty complicated reality for the Democrats who are running these hearings, which is, it’s easy to poke holes in the case for impeachment, whereas it’s relatively difficult to make a highly compelling case to the whole country for impeachment, as you said, especially when the White House is blocking the witnesses with the most direct access to the president.

michael schmidt

Without those witnesses, the Democrats are sort of fighting with one hand tied behind their back. They do not have access to those closest to Trump. And to take such a severe move, Republicans are going to say, where are those accounts? Where is that evidence? And that’s where the Democrats will struggle.

archived recording (adam schiff) Over the weeks to come, or over the days to come, rather, we will hear from other dedicated public servants.

michael barbaro

So, Mike, how does this hearing come to an end?

michael schmidt

After six hours of back and forth between the Republicans and the Democrats and the witnesses, Schiff sort of bookends the hearing, and tries again to remind people of what was at stake here.

archived recording (adam schiff) At the end of the day, we’re going to have to decide based on the evidence that you and others provide whether we’re prepared to accept a situation where the president can condition military aid, diplomatic meetings or any other performance of an official act in order to get help in their re-election.

michael schmidt

And why this was so important.

archived recording (adam schiff) I appreciate members on both sides of the aisle who I think participated today in a civil way. This is as it should be.

michael schmidt

He thanks both parties for keeping things fairly civil.

archived recording (adam schiff) With that, this concludes this portion of the hearing.

michael schmidt

And he gavels it to a close.

archived recording (adam schiff) — call of the chair. When we resume shortly, we’ll take up Mr. Conaway’s motion.

michael barbaro

Mike, this hearing was designed very much for the public. And it was the first time that the public got a chance to meet these career Foreign Service officers who believe that the president did something wrong here. So what do you think that that public will take away from this day?

michael schmidt

They will have seen two witnesses in Kent and Taylor who saw things that they thought were real problems. They had been in government a long time, and this thing came along and could be real trouble in terms of life and death. Up until this point, we had heard about these concerns. We had read about them. But today, in Bill Taylor’s voice, you felt them, and that was different.

michael barbaro

But on the other hand, as the Republicans have pointed out, the thing they most feared, what Bill Taylor was so scared of, didn’t happen.

michael schmidt

It didn’t happen, and that dilutes the importance of it.

michael barbaro

Which suddenly creates an intriguing question that I suppose may hang over the rest of all these hearings. Are the president’s motivations, are his proven conduct, no matter what the outcome, no matter if the thing he plotted and schemed happened or didn’t happen, is the fact that he wanted it to happen and he put it in motion, is that enough to be impeached?

michael schmidt

It’s a reoccurring theme in the Trump story. The president tries to do something, but ultimately is not effective enough to actually get it done. So should we penalize him for those attempts? Is the attempt and everything that goes into it and everything that gets set in motion reach that bar for Congress to remove the president? And that’s where the debate may be in the coming weeks for the rest of these hearings.

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States and the president of the Republic of Turkey.

michael barbaro

On Wednesday, President Trump hosted Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, at the White House, despite the fact that Turkey has invaded Syria in a widely condemned operation that killed Kurdish allies of the U.S.

archived recording (donald trump) We’ve assured each other that Turkey will continue to uphold what it’s supposed to uphold. I’m a big fan of the president, to tell you that.

michael barbaro

During a joint news conference with Erdogan, Trump declined to criticize Erdogan for the operation, instead praising him for reaching a cease-fire in Syria.

archived recording (donald trump) And I know that the cease-fire, while complicated, is moving forward and moving forward at a very rapid clip.

Why is this happening? As many observers have pointed out, failing to act on climate change, although it’s an indefensible crime against humanity, is also in some ways understandable. Greenhouse gas emissions are invisible, and the harm they do is global and very long-term, making denialism relatively easy.

Particulates, however, are visible, and the harm they do is both relatively localized and fairly quick. So you might have thought that the fight against dirty air would have widespread, bipartisan support. Indeed, modern environmental protection began under none other than Richard Nixon, and retired E.P.A. officials I’ve talked to describe the Nixon era as a golden age.

And Republicans continued to show at least some concern for the environment even after the party began to take a hard right turn. President Ronald Reagan signed a treaty to protect the ozone layer. The threat of acid rain was contained via a program enacted by President George H.W. Bush.

But that was a long time ago. Today’s Republican Party isn’t just a party that has embraced crazy conspiracy theories about global warming (and everything else where the facts are inconvenient.) It has also become the party of pollution.

Why? Follow the money. There’s huge variation among ind ustries in how much environmental damage they do per dollar of production. And the super-polluting industries have basically put all their chips on the Republicans. In 2016, for example, coal mining gave 97 percent of its political contributions to Republican candidates and causes. And polluters are getting what they paid for.

This, by the way, is one reason I and others find it so mind-boggling when people like Joe Biden say that everything will be fine once Trump is gone. If Trump doesn’t succeed in destroying our democracy (a big if), his most damaging legacy will be the vast environmental destruction he leaves behind. And Trump’s pro-pollution stance isn’t an aberration. In this, he is very much a man of his party."

While Mr. Trump’s administration withheld the aid, he said, Ukrainians were dying weekly in their conflict with Russian-backed forces, with Moscow ready to pounce on the slightest sign that the United States was pulling away from Ukraine. It was not just about Ukraine’s security, he said, it was about America’s as well.

“That security was so important for Ukraine as well as our own national interests, to withhold that assistance for no good reason other than help with a political campaign made no sense,” he said. “It was counterproductive to all of what we had been trying to do. It was illogical. It could not be explained. It was crazy.”

As for Republican claims that Mr. Biden had operated corruptly in Ukraine, the day’s other witness, the impressively bow-tied George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state and an expert in corruption, said there was no foundation “whatsoever” to those accusations.

Republicans offered an array of defenses, repeatedly challenging the two witnesses on the grounds that they had no direct knowledge of what the president’s orders or ideas were. They said the president was only acting prudently to protect American taxpayer interests by urging investigations into corruption in a nation with a history of self-dealing by top officials before committing American aid.

Mr. Trump’s allies said the military support was eventually approved, so no offense was committed. They ridiculed the idea that Mr. Taylor, the “star witness” for Democrats, had never even met the president, and dismissed his account and those of other witnesses as hearsay. And Republicans insisted that Democrats were seeking a do-over after the Mueller report failed to deliver a knockout blow to the president. They suggested Democrats had fired at the president and missed."
76,Noah Bookbinder,"As important, today Mr. Taylor revealed stunning new information.

That is why, in our country’s history, only two presidents have been impeached.

But this is one of those times.

The evidence of wrongdoing by President Trump is overwhelming. The impeachment inquiry has been conducted so far in a sober, responsible way. As Wednesday’s hearing made clear, the witnesses are credible and clear, and the story they tell is alarming. All members of Congress are now compelled to listen to the witnesses and independently determine whether the president’s conduct warrants impeachment.

Mr. Trump used the immense powers of the American presidency to pressure an ally to open investigations that would help him personally. That much is clear just from the call memo of the July 25 conversation between President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. Any American who has not read the call memo should do so, because it is as shocking today to realize that Mr. Trump said the jaw-dropping phrase, “I would like you to do us a favor,” as it was the day it was released. He followed that by expressing his desire for Ukraine to investigate the 2016 election and the Bidens. That is sufficient in itself to prove unacceptable wrongdoing by the president.

But today’s testimony made clear that it goes much further. Two respected public servants — Ambassador William Taylor, an experienced diplomat and a decorated Vietnam War veteran, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, the State Department official overseeing European and Eurasian affairs — testified that the president and his personal attorney sought politically motivated investigations by the Ukrainian government into former Vice President Joseph Biden and allegations concerning the 2016 election (the latter references an unfounded conspiracy theory that Ukrainians, not Russians, were behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee, and the Ukrainians framed the Russian government to make it look like that country was working with Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign )."

“It was counterproductive to all of what we had been trying to do,” he added. “It was illogical. It could not be explained. It was crazy.”

The issue is explained away by Mr. Taylor’s superiors in the State Department and the White House, who argue that the story of withheld aid is a political concoction. Ultimately, the funds were released. It was like paying your credit bill on the last day possible — in this case, the deadline was the end of the government’s fiscal year on Sept. 30.

No real harm, no impeachable foul, they contend, and did not President Barack Obama decline to provide the Ukrainians with Javelin antitank missiles? One of Mr. Trump’s senior advisers noted that Washington’s press corps was not writing several years ago that Mr. Obama was, in this official's words, leaving Ukrainians to die. In contrast, Mr. Trump offered them the Javelins. (Mr. Trump’s sale of those weapons prohibited the use of Javelins on the front lines, in an effort to cast them as deterrent weapons.)

But from where Mr. Taylor was sitting in Kiev, withholding the aid hardly seemed harmless. The power of his testimony lay in how starkly he laid out what amounted to an extortion scheme: that Mr. Trump was personally refusing to release the funds unless Ukraine’s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky , publicly announced two investigations.

One was into Burisma, the energy company in which the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had taken a board seat and payments of as much as $50,000 a month. The other was an investigation into a completely discredited theory that Ukrainian hackers, not Russia’s military intelligence unit, may have been responsible for the 2016 breach of the Democratic National Committee. If that was true, the Justice Department might have to consider withdrawing its indictment of a dozen Russian intelligence officials for masterminding and executing one of the boldest hackings in American political history. The indictment was issued last year by Jeff Sessions, who was then serving as attorney general."

Jon Allsop thinks about how the impeachment story might change now that it’s playing out on television. [The Columbia Journalism Review]

WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING

What’s new

Mr. Taylor revealed something important: a call, witnessed by one of his staff members, between Gordon D. Sondland, the American ambassador to the European Union, and Mr. Trump the day after his conversation with Ukraine’s president. Noah Bookbinder elaborates in The Times:

The staff member heard Mr. Trump ask Mr. Sondland about the status of “the investigations” — which witnesses have testified was shorthand for inquiries into the Bidens and the origins of the investigation into foreign interference in the 2016 election. Mr. Taylor testified that his staff member heard Mr. Sondland say Ukraine was moving forward on those investigations and that Mr. Sondland said that the president “cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for.”

That last quote is one you’re likely to hear again in the coming weeks.

The big picture

If the president were anyone else, the Times columnist Nicholas Kristof argues, he would be fired and maybe even subject to a criminal investigation. Members of both parties should recognize, he writes, that the hearing only affirmed Mr. Trump’s use of federal office for political gain as “an outrageous abuse of power”:

The first witnesses before the impeachment hearings were two distinguished foreign policy experts with a long commitment to public service and no history of partisanship . … Their testimony was blunt. President Trump withheld not only desperately needed security assistance to Ukraine but also a White House meeting with the Ukrainian president — unless he committed to investigating the Bidens.

But The Wall Street Journal editorial board argues that American presidents have long conducted foreign policy in ways that serve their personal political interest, such as when President Barack Obama was caught in 2012 on a hot mic telling the Russian president to wait until after his re-election to negotiate contentious plans for missile defense systems. The board adds:

Appropriate requests to foreign leaders include reducing corruption, which was one of Mr. Zelensky’s campaign planks. Joe Biden and Hunter Biden don’t have immunity from such a probe simply because Joe Biden is running for office against Mr. Trump.

The sticking points

Representative Elise Stefanik, a Republican from New York, hammered home a popular talking point within her party:

For the millions of Americans viewing today, the two most important facts are the following: Number one, Ukraine received the aid. Number two, there was, in fact, no investigation into Biden.

Yes, but the aid was released only after news of Mr. Trump’s withholding it broke, writes the Times’s editorial board. Plus, the board says, the idea that a crime is wrong only if it’s carried out successfully “has radical implications for America’s system of justice and overcrowded prisons.”

Another tack Republicans took was to dismiss Mr. Taylor and Mr. Kent as reliable witnesses because they were too distant from the president to offer anything more than hearsay. But the Times’s editorial board counters that “this wouldn’t be an issue if Mr. Trump were not obstructing the inquiry by refusing to allow White House officials, including the people who were on the call, to testify.”

In that regard, Neal Katyal writes in The Times, “President Trump is out-Nixoning Nixon.”

What the loyalists are saying

The president, for his part, called the hearings “a hoax.” That was the more concise cousin to Representative Devin Nunes’s extended metaphor comparing the testimonies to a “low-rent Ukrainian sequel” to the Russia investigation."

He also has little support from political activists. This has contributed not only to his financial deficit but also threatens his support in a relatively lower-turnout environment like a caucus. Mr. Biden was a distant fourth in Upshot/Siena polling, with 13 percent to 14 percent of support among voters who were “almost certain” to attend the caucus or those who had attended before.

All of this is separate from another question: whether Mr. Biden’s performance on the stump and on the debate stage is strong enough to retain his support as voters tune in more intensively. Mr. Biden’s resilience in the polls to this point suggests that these concerns could be overstated, though he does seem to have lost more ground in Iowa, where voters are generally paying more attention than they are nationwide. Of course, it is possible that Mr. Buttigieg’s rise, not Mr. Biden’s performance onstage, is primarily responsible for the weakening in his support.

Mr. Buttigieg’s gain might also come at the expense of another candidate: Ms. Warren, who also appeals to the meritocratic-minded, well-educated voters who tend to admire Rhodes scholars or Harvard law professors.

Ms. Warren’s rise in the polls has been impressive, but there is no reason to assume it will be durable. In Iowa, 78 percent of her supporters said they could change their mind, more than with any of her top rivals, according to the Upshot/Siena poll.

She has vulnerabilities of her own, and she has come under greater scrutiny since she began to match Mr. Biden in national surveys. Her position on “Medicare for all” funding has given her rivals an avenue to attack, and her standing in national and state polls has seemed to slump over the last month.

Her rivals could also point to questions of electability: Although there is still a long way to go, state and national polls show her underperforming her top rivals in matchups against President Trump."

It is also true for other former captive nations still recovering from the ashes of Soviet misrule. It is why acting inconsistently with the core principle of rule-of-law comes with great peril.

I am grateful to all of the members of Congress and staffers who have traveled to Ukraine over the past five years and appropriated billions of dollars in assistance in support of our primary policy goals. Those funds increase Ukraine’s ability to fight Russian aggression in the defense, energy, cyber, and information spheres. They also empower state institutions and civil society to undertake systemic reforms and tackle corruption.

I believe all of us can be proud of our efforts in Ukraine over the past five years, even though much remains to be done. And by all of us I mean those in the legislative and executive branches, both parties, the interagency community working out of our embassy in Kyiv, with Ukrainians in government, the military, and civil society, and our transatlantic allies and partners. We cannot allow our resolve to waiver, since too much is at stake, not just for Ukraine and the future of European security, but for the national interests of the United States broadly defined.

My prior deposition covered a lot of ground over some ten hours. Here are the main themes from my testimony:

• I outlined my experience with longstanding U.S. interests in supporting anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine. This work gave me a front-seat to problematic activities by successive prosecutors general in Ukraine.

• For many of the issues that this Committee is investigating, my knowledge and understanding is sometimes first hand, and sometimes comes from others involved in some specific conversations and meetings. This is no different than how any one learns and carries out his or her job responsibilities. I have been and remain willing to share my factual observations with the Committee, and will make it clear when those are based on personal knowledge, or information gained from others.

• U.S. efforts to counter corruption in Ukraine focus on building institutional capacity so that the Ukrainian government has the ability to go after corruption and effectively investigate, prosecute, and judge alleged criminal activities using appropriate institutional mechanisms -- that is -- to create and follow the rule of law. That means if there is any criminal nexus for activity in the United States, then U.S. law enforcement should pursue that case. If we think there has been some criminal act overseas that violates U.S. law, we have the institutional mechanisms to address that. It could be through the Justice Department and FBI agents assigned oversees, or through treaty mechanisms, such as the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty. As a general principle, I do not believe the United States should ask other countries to engage in selective, politically associated investigations or prosecutions against opponents of those in power, because such selective actions undermine the rule of law regardless of the country.

• The pervasive and long standing problem of corruption in Ukraine included exposure to a situation involving the energy company Burisma. The primary concern of the U.S. government since 2014 was Burisma’s owner -- Mykola Zlochevsky -- whose frozen assets abroad we had attempted to recover on Ukraine’s behalf. In early 2015, I raised questions with the deputy Prosecutor General about why the investigation of Mr. Zlochevsky had been terminated, based on our belief that prosecutors had accepted bribes to close the case."

But as the first day of open hearings suggested, it’s simple. Forget about Ukraine and diplomacy for a moment.

Suppose that a low-ranking government official, the head of a branch Social Security office, intervened to halt a widow’s long-approved Social Security payments. The widow, alarmed that without that income she might lose her home, would call the branch director to ask for help.

“I’d like you to do me a favor, though,” the director might respond. He would suggest that her Social Security payments could resume, but he’d like the widow to give him her late husband’s collection of rare coins.

Everybody would see that as an outrageous abuse of power. Whether we’re Republicans or Democrats, we would all recognize that it’s inappropriate for a federal official to use his or her power over government resources to extract personal benefits. The Social Security official could say that the payments eventually resumed, or assert that the widow’s son had engaged in skulduggery — but he’d be out of a job in an instant and would face a criminal investigation."

So to understand how it’s going to play out, the past is really our best guide. “I think we’re just all in for a really crazy ride.” Collectively, these New York Times reporters have covered U.S. politics for over 150 years. “I’m also a drummer in a band, so …” They’ve reported on past impeachment inquiries. “Yea, I’m lost in Senate wonderland.” And they say that the three we’ve had so far have been full of twists and turns. “The president of the United States is not guilty as charged.” In short, expect the unexpected. First, the process. Impeachment is technically only the initial stage. “Common misconceptions about impeachment are that impeachment by itself means removal from office. It doesn’t. The impeachment part of the process is only the indictment that sets up a trial.” The Constitution describes offenses that are grounds for removing the president from office as bribery, treason and — “They say high crimes and misdemeanors, which, really, is in the eye of the beholder.” “The framers didn’t give us a guidebook to it. They simply said, that the House had the responsibility for impeachment and the Senate had the responsibility for the trial.” One of the things missing from the Constitution? How an impeachment inquiry should start. And that has generally been a source of drama. Basically, anything goes. “In fact, in the Andrew Johnson case they voted to impeach him without even having drafted the articles of impeachment.” For Richard Nixon, his case started with several investigations that led to public hearings. That part of the process went on for two years, and yielded revelation after revelation, connecting Nixon to a politically-motivated burglary at D.N.C. headquarters — “… located in the Watergate office building.” — and its subsequent cover-up. “Mr. Butterfield, are you aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the president?” “I was aware of listening devices. Yes, sir.” “This was a shocker. Everybody in the White House recognized how damaging this could be.” As the House drafted articles of impeachment, Nixon lost the support of his party. “O.K., I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.” “I was asked to write the farewell piece that ran the morning after Nixon resigned. And this is what I wrote: The central question is how a man who won so much could have lost so much.” So for Nixon, it more or less ended after the investigations. But for Bill Clinton, that phase was just the beginning. “This is the information.” An independent counsel’s investigation into his business dealings unexpectedly turned into a very public inquiry about his personal life. “The idea that a president of the United States was having an affair with a White House intern and then a federal prosecutor was looking at that, it was just extraordinary.” That investigation led to public hearings in the House Judiciary Committee. “When the Starr Report was being delivered to Congress it was a little bit like the O.J. chase, only a political one. There were two black cars. They were being filmed live on CNN. They were heading towards the Capitol. We were watching it and a little bit agog.” Public opinion is key. And the media plays a huge part in the process. This was definitely true for Clinton. “You know it was just a crazy time. We worked in the Senate press gallery.” “All your colleagues are kind of piled on top of each other.” “We had crummy computers, the fax machine would always break. The printer would always break.” After committee hearings, the House brought formal impeachment charges. “It was very tense. I thought that the Saturday of the impeachment vote in the House was one of the most tense days I’d experienced in Washington.” And it turned out, also, full of surprises. “The day of impeachment arrived, everyone’s making very impassioned speeches about whether Bill Clinton should or should not be impeached and Livingston rises to give an argument for the House Republicans. He started to talk about how Clinton could resign.” “You, sir, may resign your post.” “And all of a sudden people start booing and saying, ‘Resign, resign’!” “So I must set the example.” “He announced he was resigning because he had had extramarital affairs and challenged President Clinton to do the only honorable thing, in his view —” “I hope President Clinton will follow.” “— to resign as well, so there was all this drama unfolding even in the midst of impeachment.” Then it went to the Senate for trial. The Constitution gets a little more specific about this part. “The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is supposed to preside over that trial.” “Rehnquist, he showed up in this robe he had made for himself, which had gold stripes on the sleeves because he liked Gilbert and Sullivan.” “The Senate is the actual jury.” “You will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws. So help you, God.” “This is a copy of the rules of the Senate for handling impeachment. They’re actually very specific.” “Meet six days a week.” “Convene at noon. The senators have to sit at their desks and remain quiet in their role as jurors. And not talk, which trust me, is going to be a problem for some of the senators who are used to talking all the time.” It’s just like a courtroom trial. There are prosecutors who present the case against the president. “That was perjury.” Only, they’re members of the House, and they’re called managers. Then the senators, or the jurors, vote. And things are still, unpredictable. “The options are guilty or not guilty. But there was one senator —” “Arlen Specter, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania.” “Under Scottish law, there are three possible verdicts: guilty, not guilty and not proved.” “— which is not a thing.” “And everybody just looks, you know, how do you even record that vote?” In the end, there were not enough votes to oust Clinton. “What’s amazing about this whole thing to me wasn’t so much the constitutional process. It was that it felt to me like the beginning of really intense partisanship, the weaponization of partisanship.” And here’s the thing: An impeachment charge has never gotten the two-thirds majority it needs in the Senate to actually oust a president from office. “So you could end up having a situation where the president is impeached, acquitted and runs for re-election and wins re-election.” And that would be a first. “This is my ticket to the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. I don’t think you’ll find these on StubHub.”"

Or, they might just find themselves entirely superfluous in an already crowded field.

“We have several moderates in the campaign now, but they’ve not been able to fill the lane,” said Marlon Kimpson, a state senator in South Carolina who has been hosting town hall-style events with presidential candidates. “Now, you’ve got all these people wanting to dip their toe in the water and test the likelihood that they can fill this role.”

Mr. Kimpson said Mr. Biden was still the most natural option for moderate voters, but warned that voters “don’t seem to be very motivated about his candidacy.” He said he was skeptical that either Mr. Bloomberg or Mr. Patrick could do better with such a delayed start, though he considered Mr. Patrick as by far the more intriguing option.

“I think Deval Patrick makes an excellent candidate, however, I am very, very concerned that he simply will not have enough time to make the case in the state of South Carolina,” Mr. Kimpson said, adding of Mr. Bloomberg, “We are familiar with him, but there doesn’t appear to me to be any excitement about his potential.”

Among the other Democratic campaigns, there is more confusion than consensus about what effect Mr. Patrick and Mr. Bloomberg might have on the primary, beyond straining the fund-raising efforts of other candidates who appeal to the business community. That could be an acute challenge for Mr. Biden, the only leading candidate who has been facing a significant cash crunch in recent months, as well as all of the less-prominent candidates hoping for a late breakthrough.

Neither of the two newcomers has done anything to build an operation in the early primary states, and Mr. Bloomberg has indicated he plans to skip those four February contests entirely. Any major effect they will have on the nomination fight would likely come in the states that vote after Iowa and New Hampshire, where the race is less defined."

Regarding the testimony of Marie Yovanovitch, the former United States ambassador to Ukraine, before the House Intelligence Committee’s impeachment hearings on Friday:

The great public congressional hearings often start slow and continue without making apparent progress toward a solution to the problem they address. Then suddenly there is a “eureka!” moment when quiet, civilly spoken words cast a light so bright that the public and their elected representatives cannot ignore or fail to right grievous wrongs.

Friday marked such a turning point for Trumpism and the Trump administration.

Any American citizen paying attention to the opening statement and testimony of Ms. Yovanovitch will experience a historic eureka moment.

This brave and heroic woman has no agenda other than to serve the country she loves. Her clear, straightforward depiction of the abuse and smears she received and the corruption of United States foreign policy and security to serve the political and financial interests of the president and his enablers cannot be ignored or dismissed.

Today: Day one of the public hearings in the impeachment inquiry. It’s Thursday, November 14. So, Mike Schmidt, two days in a row.

michael schmidt

Guess we’re in the middle of a big story.

michael barbaro

We are. So, today is day one in the public hearings of this impeachment inquiry. How does this begin?

michael schmidt: 10

06 a.m.

archived recording (adam schiff) The committee will come to order.

michael schmidt

Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, gavels the hearing room to order. He’s got the Democrats on the panel to his right. He has the Republicans on the left. And he has two longtime State Department officials sitting in front of him: George Kent, who’s in charge of, basically, the State Department’s policy towards Ukraine, and Bill Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine.

archived recording (adam schiff) With that, I now recognize myself to give an opening statement in the impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump, the 45th president of the United States.

michael schmidt

And Schiff begins to lay out his argument for why he believes that what Donald Trump did in regards to Ukraine is so important that he needs to be impeached.

archived recording (adam schiff) In 2014, Russia invaded the United States ally Ukraine to reverse that nation’s embrace of the West and to fulfill Vladimir Putin’s desire to rebuild a Russian empire.

michael schmidt

Schiff says that Donald Trump tried to take advantage of a country that was in a very vulnerable spot.

archived recording (adam schiff) 14,000 Ukrainians died as they battled superior Russian forces.

michael schmidt

They needed the United States’s support, and perhaps more importantly, its military aid.

archived recording (adam schiff) Earlier this year, Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president of Ukraine on a platform of ending the conflict and tackling corruption. He was a newcomer to politics and immediately sought to establish a relationship with Ukraine’s most powerful patron, the United States.

michael barbaro

Right, and what Schiff seems to be trying to do is to remind the public that the stakes of what was happening here, and what most people think of as a quid pro quo, was the actual life and death of Ukraine and its people.

archived recording (adam schiff) The questions presented by this impeachment inquiry are whether President Trump sought to exploit that ally’s vulnerability and invite Ukraine’s interference in our elections, whether President Trump sought to condition official acts, such as a White House meeting or U.S. military assistance, on Ukraine’s willingness to assist to his two political investigations that would help his re-election campaign. And if President Trump did either, whether such an abuse of his power is compatible with the office of the presidency.

michael schmidt

And Schiff poses the question, is this such an egregious thing the president has done that we, as a country, have to take a move that we’ve only done twice before in history?

archived recording (adam schiff) The matter is as simple and as terrible as that. Our answer to these questions will affect not only the future of this presidency, but the future of the presidency itself, and what kind of conduct or misconduct the American people may come to expect from their commander in chief.

michael schmidt

Then, the top Republican on the committee —

archived recording (devin nunes) Thanks, gentlemen.

michael schmidt

— Devon Nunez, gives his opening statement.

archived recording (devin nunes) In a July open hearing of this committee, following publication of the Mueller report, the Democrats engaged in a last-ditch effort to convince the American people that President Trump is a Russian agent.

michael schmidt

It starts with him laying out how the Democrats tried as hard as they could to prove that Donald Trump was a Russian agent.

archived recording (devin nunes) That hearing was the pitiful finale of a three-year-long operation by the Democrats, the corrupt media and partisan bureaucrats to overturn the results of the 2016 election.

michael schmidt

They failed at that. Here they go again.

archived recording (devin nunes) They turned on a dime, and now claim the real malfeasance is Republicans’ dealings with Ukraine.

michael schmidt

And then —

archived recording (devin nunes) What we will witness today is a televised theatrical performance staged by the Democrats.

michael schmidt

— he turns to the witnesses.

archived recording (devin nunes) Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Kent, I’d like to welcome you here. I’d like to congratulate you for passing the Democrats’ star chamber auditions held for the last weeks in the basement of the Capitol.

archived recording (devin nunes) It seems you agreed, witting or unwittingly, to participate in a drama. But the main performance, the Russia hoax, has ended, and you’ve been cast in the low-rent Ukrainian sequel.

michael barbaro

Right, before these witnesses even have a chance to utter a word, the top Republican on the committee is besmirching them and saying, you’re here in cahoots with the Democrats, and everything you’re about to say is therefore poisoned by that reality.

michael schmidt

Correct.

archived recording (devin nunes) This spectacle is doing great damage to our country. It’s nothing more than an impeachment process in search of a crime. And I yield back.

michael schmidt

In response, Schiff starts reading the resumes of the witness.

archived recording (adam schiff) Ambassador William Taylor has served our country for over half a century.

michael schmidt

They’re the resumes of career diplomats who have served both parties.

archived recording (adam schiff) In 2006, President Bush nominated him as ambassador to Ukraine.

michael schmidt

And come from backgrounds that are pretty apolitical.

archived recording (george kent) Good morning. My name is George Kent, and I am the deputy assistant secretary of state for Eastern Europe and the Caucasus.

michael schmidt

And then, when George Kent starts to give his opening statement —

archived recording (george kent) I have served proudly as a nonpartisan career Foreign Service officer for more than 27 years under five presidents, three Republican and two Democrat.

michael schmidt

— he sort of echoes that theme.

archived recording (george kent) I represent the third generation of my family to have chosen a career in public service and sworn the oath of office that all U.S. public servants do in defense of our Constitution. Indeed, there has been a George Kent sworn to defend the Constitution continuously for nearly 60 years.

michael schmidt

Nunes is trying as hard as he can to paint them as part of this Democratic effort. And their resumes are rising up and speaking for themselves.

archived recording (george kent) The United States has very clear national interests at stake in Ukraine. Ukraine’s success is very much in our national interest.

michael schmidt

And it set a tone early on that these two witnesses were going to speak with great authority about not only what happened, but how it fits into the larger story of the United States’s foreign policy.

archived recording (george kent) Ukraine has been on the front lines not just of Russia’s conventional war in Eastern Europe since 2014 and its broader campaign of malign influence, but of the greater geopolitical challenges now facing the United States.

michael barbaro

And then it’s Bill Taylor’s turn.

archived recording (bill taylor) Mr. Chairman, I’m appearing today, at the committee’s request, to provide my perspective on the events that are the subject of the committee’s inquiry. I want to emphasize at the outset that while I am aware that the committee has requested my testimony as part of impeachment proceedings, I am not here to take one side or the other.

michael schmidt

And as soon as he begins speaking, his commanding nature and booming voice really start to steal the show.

archived recording (bill taylor) Once I arrived in Kiev, I discovered a weird combination of encouraging, confusing and, ultimately, alarming circumstances.

michael schmidt

He starts to describe how American foreign policy was functioning under Donald Trump.

archived recording (bill taylor) There appeared to be two channels of U.S. policymaking and implementation, one regular and one highly irregular. As the acting ambassador, I had authority over the regular, formal diplomatic processes.

michael schmidt

There’s essentially the American foreign policy on paper, which the State Department and diplomats are trying to carry out.

archived recording (bill taylor) At the same time, however, I encountered an irregular, informal channel of U.S. policymaking with respect to Ukraine, unaccountable to Congress.

michael schmidt

And then there’s this other track —

archived recording (bill taylor) I was clearly in the regular channel, but I was also in the irregular one to the extent that Ambassadors Volker and Sondland including me in certain conversations. Although this irregular channel was well-connected in Washington, it operated mostly outside the official State Department channels.

michael schmidt

— that has some diplomats who usually wouldn’t deal with Ukraine and a bit of Rudy Giuliani mixed in.

archived recording (bill taylor) I began to sense that these two separate decision making channels, the regular and the irregular, were separate and at odds.

michael schmidt

For those of us that have followed this closely, we’re sort of sitting there saying, well, that was in his testimony. We read that in the transcript that came out last week. But for everyone else in the country, it’s bringing this story to life.

archived recording (bill taylor) — so important, that security assistance was so important for Ukraine as well as our own national interests. To withhold that assistance, for no good reason other than help with the political campaign, made no sense. It was counterproductive to all of what we had been trying to do. It was illogical. It could not be explained. It was crazy.

michael barbaro

Right. So much of this has been laid out in closed-door testimony and in transcripts from that testimony that have been released to the public, so we know a lot of what Bill Taylor is saying here. So do we actually learn anything new?

michael schmidt

Taylor comes with two new pieces of information. One of the chief arguments the Trump administration has made is that how could there be a quid pro quo, because they didn’t know the aide was being held up?

michael barbaro

The Ukrainians never really understood the money was being withheld, they argue.

michael schmidt

Correct, no harm, no foul. They didn’t know what was going on.

archived recording (bill taylor) Also on July 20, I had a phone conversation with Oleksandr Danylyuk, President Zelensky’s national security adviser, who emphasized that President Zelensky did not want to be used as an instrument in a U.S. re-election campaign.

michael schmidt

But Taylor begins to describe conversations that he had with Ukrainians that give us a sense that this was being felt by them. They were feeling the pressure when he was asking them for the favor.

archived recording (bill taylor) I got several questions, other officials got several questions, as well, from Ukrainians asking about the security assistance. So what I know is the security assistance was very important to the Ukrainians. They had begun to hear from Ambassador Sondland that the security assistance was not going to come until the investigations were pursued.

michael schmidt

They knew that if they didn’t do what Trump wanted, they weren’t going to get the thing that they needed. And it makes the whole ploy more substantive and substantial, because the argument has been, they didn’t know. But they did. And Taylor says, here’s how I know that.

michael barbaro

And what’s the second thing?

michael schmidt

The second thing is new evidence that draws Donald Trump deeper into this story.

archived recording (bill taylor) Last Friday, a member of my staff told me of events that occurred on July 26.

michael schmidt

Taylor says, this is not something I saw, but one of my aides, the day after the now-famous call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, overhears a phone conversation between Trump and a top American diplomat.

archived recording (bill taylor) The member of my staff could hear President Trump on the phone asking Ambassador Sondland about the investigations. Ambassador Sondland told President Trump the Ukrainians were ready to move forward.

michael barbaro

And by investigations, he means the president’s desired digging into his political rivals, namely Joe Biden.

michael schmidt

Correct. And after the call, the aide follows up with the American diplomat and says, what was that all about?

archived recording (bill taylor) Following the call with President Trump, the member of my staff asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for.

michael schmidt

And the diplomat said the thing Trump cares more about is the investigations.

michael barbaro

More than Ukraine and its security?

michael schmidt

Correct. So here we are, a day after the famous call, learning about a new incident in which the president is reiterating how important these investigations, particularly on the Bidens, are to him.

michael barbaro

And this is all unfolding, chronologically, at a moment where the U.S. aid to Ukraine is being withheld after the president has, as you said, asked for a favor. So this is one more data point showing that the president wants Ukraine to do these politically-motivated investigations into his rivals. And it becomes increasingly hard — correct? — for anyone to claim that the president’s intentions and conduct here are ambiguous.

michael schmidt

Correct. You’re building towards a larger narrative of what Trump was up to and what he really wanted.

archived recording (bill taylor) Mr. Chairman, I recognize that this is rather a lengthy recitation of the events of the past few months, told from my vantage point in Kiev. But I also recognize the importance of the matters your committee is investigating. And I hope that this chronology will provide some framework for your questions.

michael barbaro

So at this point, Mike, it feels like the Democrats are pulling off a pretty successful day one of their public hearing, from their perspective. They are demonstrating that Ukrainian lives were at stake when this money was being withheld in this quid pro quo scheme. They establish that the Ukrainians felt the pressure of this arrangement, that it was not abstract to them. And finally, they are putting the president directly at the center of this all.

michael schmidt

Correct. They’re adding new details that bolster their story. And for the first day of testimony, that’s a pretty good accomplishment.

[music]

michael schmidt

But then the Republicans have a chance to ask questions, and they have a pretty effective strategy of their own.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So, Mike, once Republicans get to ask these two witnesses questions, what does their strategy actually look like?

michael schmidt

One by one, the Republican representatives try and water down the Democrats’ argument. They take on the issue of whether the Ukrainians truly felt pressure to commit to these investigations.

archived recording (devin nunes) Note this important fact: The security assistance was provided to Ukraine without the Ukrainians having done any of the things they were supposedly being blackmailed to do.

michael schmidt

And when the Ukrainians were asked, did you feel pressure from Donald Trump to do this? Ukrainians said no.

archived recording (devin nunes) The Ukrainian president stood in front of the world press and repeatedly, consistently, over and over again, interview after interview, said he had no knowledge of military aid being withheld, meaning no quid pro quo, no pressure, no demands, no threats, no blackmail, nothing corrupt.

michael barbaro

So this is a clear strategy of trying to take the air out of what the Democrats are arguing and saying instead, so there’s all this talk of a quid pro quo, but actually, the military aid gets to the Ukrainians, so that takes away one half of it. And those investigations that were sought, they never happened, which, they argue, takes away the other half of it.

michael schmidt

It’s the argument of quid pro so — so what?

michael barbaro

I mean, can both those things be true, though? That you can ask for something and not get it, and it still be wrong?

michael schmidt

Well, the Democrats, when they try and come back and clean this up, say, is attempted murder a crime? Is attempted robbery a crime? Even if Donald Trump didn’t succeed in this, he tried. And that matters.

michael barbaro

But how do the Republicans on this panel grapple with the new revelations that appear pretty damning from Bill Taylor?

archived recording (michael turner) Ambassador Taylor, the reason why the Sixth Amendment doesn’t allow hearsay is because it’s unreliable. It’s unreliable because frequently, it’s untruthful.

michael schmidt

They say it’s hearsay.

archived recording (adam schiff) Ambassador, you testified about a number of things that you heard. Isn’t it possible that the things that you heard were not true, that some of the beliefs and understandings that you had are not accurate, that, in fact, you’re mistaken about some of the things that you testified today, in a factual basis —

michael schmidt

Was that staffer that Taylor was talking about, was that staffer talking to the president? No, that staffer was not. The staffer just overheard that conversation.

michael barbaro

Hmm. And by the way, that staffer than conveys it to you, Bill Taylor, so it’s essentially thirdhand.

michael schmidt

Correct, and the Republicans ask Kent and Taylor —

archived recording (jim jordan) So you weren’t on the call, were you? The president — you didn’t listen in on President Trump’s call, and President Zelensky’s call? archived recording (bill taylor) I did not.

michael schmidt

— did you ever talk to the president about the quid pro quo? No.

archived recording (jim jordan) You’ve never talked with Chief of Staff Mulvaney? archived recording (bill taylor) I never did.

michael schmidt

Did you ever talk to the president?

archived recording (jim jordan) You never met the president? archived recording (bill taylor) That’s correct.

michael schmidt

No.

archived recording (jim jordan) This is what I can’t believe. And you’re their star witness. You’re their first witness.

michael schmidt

So where are these firsthand accounts? If we’re going to impeach the president and remove him from office, where is the direct evidence tying him to this?

michael barbaro

Why is it important that those two diplomats did or didn’t have a conversation with the president? As best I can tell, all the testimony so far has been from career diplomats who are essentially in the middle of the bureaucracy, and experienced what they regarded as this improper scheme in the places where they were, not as people who work directly with the president.

michael schmidt

Correct. Much of the testimony so far has been from this sort of second layer of folks, who were not directly talking to the president. And I think what the Republicans are trying to say is that if we are going to take this extreme measure of removing a president for the first time in American history, we need more evidence than just these people who were not talking directly to Trump.

archived recording (jim jordan) Over the next few weeks, we’re going to have more witnesses like we’ve had today that the Democrats will parade in here, and they’re all going to say this, so and so said such and such to so and so, and therefore we got to impeach the president. That’s what we’re going to hear.

michael barbaro

So by that argument, Republicans seem to be making the case that until they hear directly from a witness who heard something directly from the president, they are not going to be persuaded.

michael schmidt

Correct, and it’s a little disingenuous, because the White House is blocking those people closest to the president from talking to Congress.

michael barbaro

So in that sense, it’s kind of a convenient strategy.

michael schmidt

Correct.

michael barbaro

But is it effective?

michael schmidt

It starts to build room for Senate Republicans to say, we do not have enough evidence directly tying Trump to this. And it begins to open up that gap and water down the Democrats’ argument that this is something Trump should be removed for.

michael barbaro

It feels like this line of questioning for the Republicans, especially the hearsay argument, reveals a pretty complicated reality for the Democrats who are running these hearings, which is, it’s easy to poke holes in the case for impeachment, whereas it’s relatively difficult to make a highly compelling case to the whole country for impeachment, as you said, especially when the White House is blocking the witnesses with the most direct access to the president.

michael schmidt

Without those witnesses, the Democrats are sort of fighting with one hand tied behind their back. They do not have access to those closest to Trump. And to take such a severe move, Republicans are going to say, where are those accounts? Where is that evidence? And that’s where the Democrats will struggle.

archived recording (adam schiff) Over the weeks to come, or over the days to come, rather, we will hear from other dedicated public servants.

michael barbaro

So, Mike, how does this hearing come to an end?

michael schmidt

After six hours of back and forth between the Republicans and the Democrats and the witnesses, Schiff sort of bookends the hearing, and tries again to remind people of what was at stake here.

archived recording (adam schiff) At the end of the day, we’re going to have to decide based on the evidence that you and others provide whether we’re prepared to accept a situation where the president can condition military aid, diplomatic meetings or any other performance of an official act in order to get help in their re-election.

michael schmidt

And why this was so important.

archived recording (adam schiff) I appreciate members on both sides of the aisle who I think participated today in a civil way. This is as it should be.

michael schmidt

He thanks both parties for keeping things fairly civil.

archived recording (adam schiff) With that, this concludes this portion of the hearing.

michael schmidt

And he gavels it to a close.

archived recording (adam schiff) — call of the chair. When we resume shortly, we’ll take up Mr. Conaway’s motion.

michael barbaro

Mike, this hearing was designed very much for the public. And it was the first time that the public got a chance to meet these career Foreign Service officers who believe that the president did something wrong here. So what do you think that that public will take away from this day?

michael schmidt

They will have seen two witnesses in Kent and Taylor who saw things that they thought were real problems. They had been in government a long time, and this thing came along and could be real trouble in terms of life and death. Up until this point, we had heard about these concerns. We had read about them. But today, in Bill Taylor’s voice, you felt them, and that was different.

michael barbaro

But on the other hand, as the Republicans have pointed out, the thing they most feared, what Bill Taylor was so scared of, didn’t happen.

michael schmidt

It didn’t happen, and that dilutes the importance of it.

michael barbaro

Which suddenly creates an intriguing question that I suppose may hang over the rest of all these hearings. Are the president’s motivations, are his proven conduct, no matter what the outcome, no matter if the thing he plotted and schemed happened or didn’t happen, is the fact that he wanted it to happen and he put it in motion, is that enough to be impeached?

michael schmidt

It’s a reoccurring theme in the Trump story. The president tries to do something, but ultimately is not effective enough to actually get it done. So should we penalize him for those attempts? Is the attempt and everything that goes into it and everything that gets set in motion reach that bar for Congress to remove the president? And that’s where the debate may be in the coming weeks for the rest of these hearings.

michael barbaro

Thank you, Mike.

michael schmidt

Thanks for having me.

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States and the president of the Republic of Turkey.

michael barbaro

On Wednesday, President Trump hosted Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, at the White House, despite the fact that Turkey has invaded Syria in a widely condemned operation that killed Kurdish allies of the U.S.

archived recording (donald trump) We’ve assured each other that Turkey will continue to uphold what it’s supposed to uphold. I’m a big fan of the president, to tell you that.

michael barbaro

During a joint news conference with Erdogan, Trump declined to criticize Erdogan for the operation, instead praising him for reaching a cease-fire in Syria.

archived recording (donald trump) And I know that the cease-fire, while complicated, is moving forward and moving forward at a very rapid clip.

Why is this happening? As many observers have pointed out, failing to act on climate change, although it’s an indefensible crime against humanity, is also in some ways understandable. Greenhouse gas emissions are invisible, and the harm they do is global and very long-term, making denialism relatively easy.

Particulates, however, are visible, and the harm they do is both relatively localized and fairly quick. So you might have thought that the fight against dirty air would have widespread, bipartisan support. Indeed, modern environmental protection began under none other than Richard Nixon, and retired E.P.A. officials I’ve talked to describe the Nixon era as a golden age.

And Republicans continued to show at least some concern for the environment even after the party began to take a hard right turn. President Ronald Reagan signed a treaty to protect the ozone layer. The threat of acid rain was contained via a program enacted by President George H.W. Bush.

But that was a long time ago. Today’s Republican Party isn’t just a party that has embraced crazy conspiracy theories about global warming (and everything else where the facts are inconvenient.) It has also become the party of pollution.

Why? Follow the money. There’s huge variation among ind ustries in how much environmental damage they do per dollar of production. And the super-polluting industries have basically put all their chips on the Republicans. In 2016, for example, coal mining gave 97 percent of its political contributions to Republican candidates and causes. And polluters are getting what they paid for.

This, by the way, is one reason I and others find it so mind-boggling when people like Joe Biden say that everything will be fine once Trump is gone. If Trump doesn’t succeed in destroying our democracy (a big if), his most damaging legacy will be the vast environmental destruction he leaves behind. And Trump’s pro-pollution stance isn’t an aberration. In this, he is very much a man of his party."

Republican senators say the split over how to approach what is likely to be the first presidential impeachment trial ever to unfold in an election year has been on vivid display in their private weekly lunches in the Capitol.

Some senators argued last week that the articles of impeachment likely to emerge from the House later this year do not merit the slightest consideration, and should be quickly dispensed with, so as to limit the damage they could do to Mr. Trump and his party. Others mused with relish this week about the prospect of keeping the six Democratic presidential candidates who are sitting senators chained to their desks in the Capitol for weeks on end as crucial primary contests unfold.

“There are lots of different opinions within the conference as to how long the impeachment in the Senate will take or should take, and those are different questions,” said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 3 Senate Republican. “Clearly there’s not 51 votes for any one thing, so this is going to have to begin and then play out over time.”"

By the reasoning of Representative Jim Jordan, I did absolutely nothing wrong.

You’re alive! Not a drop of blood on you! An unconsummated crime is no crime at all, or so Jordan, one of the Republican Party’s more rococo philosophers, argued on Wednesday in defense of President Trump. Ukraine got its military aid; Trump did not get his investigation of the Bidens. To Jordan, that’s proof of innocence.

To a normal person, that’s proof of incompetence, which doesn’t exonerate the president but should definitely reassure us. Trump’s an autocrat all right, but the silver lining is that he’s an inept one. All strongmen should be this weak.

And all of us should have the mental limberness and ethical elasticity that Jordan and his troupe possess. They’re the Cirque du Soleil of c’est la vie.

It was not just about Ukraine’s security, he said, it was about America’s as well.

“That security was so important for Ukraine as well as our own national interests, to withhold that assistance for no good reason other than help with a political campaign made no sense,” he said. “It was counterproductive to all of what we had been trying to do. It was illogical. It could not be explained. It was crazy.”

As for Republican claims that Mr. Biden had operated corruptly in Ukraine, the day’s other witness, the impressively bow-tied George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state and an expert in corruption, said there was no foundation “whatsoever” to those accusations.

Republicans offered an array of defenses, repeatedly challenging the two witnesses on the grounds that they had no direct knowledge of what the president’s orders or ideas were. They said the president was only acting prudently to protect American taxpayer interests by urging investigations into corruption in a nation with a history of self-dealing by top officials before committing American aid.

Mr. Trump’s allies said the military support was eventually approved, so no offense was committed. They ridiculed the idea that Mr. Taylor, the “star witness” for Democrats, had never even met the president, and dismissed his account and those of other witnesses as hearsay.

The issue is explained away by Mr. Taylor’s superiors in the State Department and the White House, who argue that the story of withheld aid is a political concoction. Ultimately, the funds were released. It was like paying your credit bill on the last day possible — in this case, the deadline was the end of the government’s fiscal year on Sept. 30.

No real harm, no impeachable foul, they contend, and did not President Barack Obama decline to provide the Ukrainians with Javelin antitank missiles? One of Mr. Trump’s senior advisers noted that Washington’s press corps was not writing several years ago that Mr. Obama was, in this official's words, leaving Ukrainians to die. In contrast, Mr. Trump offered them the Javelins. (Mr. Trump’s sale of those weapons prohibited the use of Javelins on the front lines, in an effort to cast them as deterrent weapons.)

But from where Mr. Taylor was sitting in Kiev, withholding the aid hardly seemed harmless. The power of his testimony lay in how starkly he laid out what amounted to an extortion scheme: that Mr. Trump was personally refusing to release the funds unless Ukraine’s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky , publicly announced two investigations.

One was into Burisma, the energy company in which the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had taken a board seat and payments of as much as $50,000 a month. The other was an investigation into a completely discredited theory that Ukrainian hackers, not Russia’s military intelligence unit, may have been responsible for the 2016 breach of the Democratic National Committee. If that was true, the Justice Department might have to consider withdrawing its indictment of a dozen Russian intelligence officials for masterminding and executing one of the boldest hackings in American political history. The indictment was issued last year by Jeff Sessions, who was then serving as attorney general."

So to understand how it’s going to play out, the past is really our best guide. “I think we’re just all in for a really crazy ride.” Collectively, these New York Times reporters have covered U.S. politics for over 150 years. “I’m also a drummer in a band, so …” They’ve reported on past impeachment inquiries. “Yea, I’m lost in Senate wonderland.” And they say that the three we’ve had so far have been full of twists and turns. “The president of the United States is not guilty as charged.” In short, expect the unexpected. First, the process. Impeachment is technically only the initial stage. “Common misconceptions about impeachment are that impeachment by itself means removal from office. It doesn’t. The impeachment part of the process is only the indictment that sets up a trial.” The Constitution describes offenses that are grounds for removing the president from office as bribery, treason and — “They say high crimes and misdemeanors, which, really, is in the eye of the beholder.” “The framers didn’t give us a guidebook to it. They simply said, that the House had the responsibility for impeachment and the Senate had the responsibility for the trial.” One of the things missing from the Constitution? How an impeachment inquiry should start. And that has generally been a source of drama. Basically, anything goes. “In fact, in the Andrew Johnson case they voted to impeach him without even having drafted the articles of impeachment.” For Richard Nixon, his case started with several investigations that led to public hearings. That part of the process went on for two years, and yielded revelation after revelation, connecting Nixon to a politically-motivated burglary at D.N.C. headquarters — “… located in the Watergate office building.” — and its subsequent cover-up. “Mr. Butterfield, are you aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the president?” “I was aware of listening devices. Yes, sir.” “This was a shocker. Everybody in the White House recognized how damaging this could be.” As the House drafted articles of impeachment, Nixon lost the support of his party. “O.K., I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.” “I was asked to write the farewell piece that ran the morning after Nixon resigned. And this is what I wrote: The central question is how a man who won so much could have lost so much.” So for Nixon, it more or less ended after the investigations. But for Bill Clinton, that phase was just the beginning. “This is the information.” An independent counsel’s investigation into his business dealings unexpectedly turned into a very public inquiry about his personal life. “The idea that a president of the United States was having an affair with a White House intern and then a federal prosecutor was looking at that, it was just extraordinary.” That investigation led to public hearings in the House Judiciary Committee. “When the Starr Report was being delivered to Congress it was a little bit like the O.J. chase, only a political one. There were two black cars. They were being filmed live on CNN. They were heading towards the Capitol. We were watching it and a little bit agog.” Public opinion is key. And the media plays a huge part in the process. This was definitely true for Clinton. “You know it was just a crazy time. We worked in the Senate press gallery.” “All your colleagues are kind of piled on top of each other.” “We had crummy computers, the fax machine would always break. The printer would always break.” After committee hearings, the House brought formal impeachment charges. “It was very tense. I thought that the Saturday of the impeachment vote in the House was one of the most tense days I’d experienced in Washington.” And it turned out, also, full of surprises. “The day of impeachment arrived, everyone’s making very impassioned speeches about whether Bill Clinton should or should not be impeached and Livingston rises to give an argument for the House Republicans. He started to talk about how Clinton could resign.” “You, sir, may resign your post.” “And all of a sudden people start booing and saying, ‘Resign, resign’!” “So I must set the example.” “He announced he was resigning because he had had extramarital affairs and challenged President Clinton to do the only honorable thing, in his view —” “I hope President Clinton will follow.” “— to resign as well, so there was all this drama unfolding even in the midst of impeachment.” Then it went to the Senate for trial. The Constitution gets a little more specific about this part. “The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is supposed to preside over that trial.” “Rehnquist, he showed up in this robe he had made for himself, which had gold stripes on the sleeves because he liked Gilbert and Sullivan.” “The Senate is the actual jury.” “You will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws. So help you, God.” “This is a copy of the rules of the Senate for handling impeachment. They’re actually very specific.” “Meet six days a week.” “Convene at noon. The senators have to sit at their desks and remain quiet in their role as jurors. And not talk, which trust me, is going to be a problem for some of the senators who are used to talking all the time.” It’s just like a courtroom trial. There are prosecutors who present the case against the president. “That was perjury.” Only, they’re members of the House, and they’re called managers. Then the senators, or the jurors, vote. And things are still, unpredictable. “The options are guilty or not guilty. But there was one senator —” “Arlen Specter, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania.” “Under Scottish law, there are three possible verdicts: guilty, not guilty and not proved.” “— which is not a thing.” “And everybody just looks, you know, how do you even record that vote?” In the end, there were not enough votes to oust Clinton. “What’s amazing about this whole thing to me wasn’t so much the constitutional process. It was that it felt to me like the beginning of really intense partisanship, the weaponization of partisanship.” And here’s the thing: An impeachment charge has never gotten the two-thirds majority it needs in the Senate to actually oust a president from office. “So you could end up having a situation where the president is impeached, acquitted and runs for re-election and wins re-election.” And that would be a first. “This is my ticket to the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. I don’t think you’ll find these on StubHub.”"

[The New York Times]

Jon Allsop thinks about how the impeachment story might change now that it’s playing out on television. [The Columbia Journalism Review]

WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING

What’s new

Mr. Taylor revealed something important: a call, witnessed by one of his staff members, between Gordon D. Sondland, the American ambassador to the European Union, and Mr. Trump the day after his conversation with Ukraine’s president. Noah Bookbinder elaborates in The Times:

The staff member heard Mr. Trump ask Mr. Sondland about the status of “the investigations” — which witnesses have testified was shorthand for inquiries into the Bidens and the origins of the investigation into foreign interference in the 2016 election. Mr. Taylor testified that his staff member heard Mr. Sondland say Ukraine was moving forward on those investigations and that Mr. Sondland said that the president “cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for.”

That last quote is one you’re likely to hear again in the coming weeks.

The big picture

If the president were anyone else, the Times columnist Nicholas Kristof argues, he would be fired and maybe even subject to a criminal investigation. Members of both parties should recognize, he writes, that the hearing only affirmed Mr. Trump’s use of federal office for political gain as “an outrageous abuse of power”:

The first witnesses before the impeachment hearings were two distinguished foreign policy experts with a long commitment to public service and no history of partisanship . … Their testimony was blunt. President Trump withheld not only desperately needed security assistance to Ukraine but also a White House meeting with the Ukrainian president — unless he committed to investigating the Bidens.

But The Wall Street Journal editorial board argues that American presidents have long conducted foreign policy in ways that serve their personal political interest, such as when President Barack Obama was caught in 2012 on a hot mic telling the Russian president to wait until after his re-election to negotiate contentious plans for missile defense systems. The board adds:

Appropriate requests to foreign leaders include reducing corruption, which was one of Mr. Zelensky’s campaign planks. Joe Biden and Hunter Biden don’t have immunity from such a probe simply because Joe Biden is running for office against Mr. Trump.

The sticking points

Representative Elise Stefanik, a Republican from New York, hammered home a popular talking point within her party:

For the millions of Americans viewing today, the two most important facts are the following: Number one, Ukraine received the aid. Number two, there was, in fact, no investigation into Biden.

Yes, but the aid was released only after news of Mr. Trump’s withholding it broke, writes the Times’s editorial board. Plus, the board says, the idea that a crime is wrong only if it’s carried out successfully “has radical implications for America’s system of justice and overcrowded prisons.”

Another tack Republicans took was to dismiss Mr. Taylor and Mr. Kent as reliable witnesses because they were too distant from the president to offer anything more than hearsay. But the Times’s editorial board counters that “this wouldn’t be an issue if Mr. Trump were not obstructing the inquiry by refusing to allow White House officials, including the people who were on the call, to testify.”

In that regard, Neal Katyal writes in The Times, “President Trump is out-Nixoning Nixon.”

What the loyalists are saying

The president, for his part, called the hearings “a hoax.” That was the more concise cousin to Representative Devin Nunes’s extended metaphor comparing the testimonies to a “low-rent Ukrainian sequel” to the Russia investigation."

He also has little support from political activists. This has contributed not only to his financial deficit but also threatens his support in a relatively lower-turnout environment like a caucus. Mr. Biden was a distant fourth in Upshot/Siena polling, with 13 percent to 14 percent of support among voters who were “almost certain” to attend the caucus or those who had attended before.

All of this is separate from another question: whether Mr. Biden’s performance on the stump and on the debate stage is strong enough to retain his support as voters tune in more intensively. Mr. Biden’s resilience in the polls to this point suggests that these concerns could be overstated, though he does seem to have lost more ground in Iowa, where voters are generally paying more attention than they are nationwide. Of course, it is possible that Mr. Buttigieg’s rise, not Mr. Biden’s performance onstage, is primarily responsible for the weakening in his support.

Mr. Buttigieg’s gain might also come at the expense of another candidate: Ms. Warren, who also appeals to the meritocratic-minded, well-educated voters who tend to admire Rhodes scholars or Harvard law professors.

Ms. Warren’s rise in the polls has been impressive, but there is no reason to assume it will be durable. In Iowa, 78 percent of her supporters said they could change their mind, more than with any of her top rivals, according to the Upshot/Siena poll.

She has vulnerabilities of her own, and she has come under greater scrutiny since she began to match Mr. Biden in national surveys. Her position on “Medicare for all” funding has given her rivals an avenue to attack, and her standing in national and state polls has seemed to slump over the last month.

Her rivals could also point to questions of electability: Although there is still a long way to go, state and national polls show her underperforming her top rivals in matchups against President Trump."

The initial bill she would seek to pass if elected would be a step short of the broader Medicare for all plan she has championed. But it would substantially expand the reach and generosity of public health insurance, creating a government plan that would offer free coverage to all American children and people earning less than double the federal poverty rate, or about $50,000 for a family of four, and that could be purchased by other Americans who want it.

Ms. Warren has long endorsed a Medicare for all bill sponsored by one of her rivals for the Democratic nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. But until now, she has not specified how quickly she would move to enact a health care plan. Friday’s proposal amounts to a detailed road map for eventually establishing Medicare for all, a single government-run health insurance program under which private coverage would be eliminated.

That goal — a wholesale transformation of how Americans receive health insurance — is a big political gamble, particularly given that many of them would have to give up the coverage they get through their employer s. Ms. Warren’s proposal for Medicare for all would require an estimated $20.5 trillion in new federal spending over a decade, according to a financing plan she released two weeks ago. To provide funding for it, she would impose new taxes on businesses and the richest Americans."

Or, they might just find themselves entirely superfluous in an already crowded field.

“We have several moderates in the campaign now, but they’ve not been able to fill the lane,” said Marlon Kimpson, a state senator in South Carolina who has been hosting town hall-style events with presidential candidates. “Now, you’ve got all these people wanting to dip their toe in the water and test the likelihood that they can fill this role.”

Mr. Kimpson said Mr. Biden was still the most natural option for moderate voters, but warned that voters “don’t seem to be very motivated about his candidacy.” He said he was skeptical that either Mr. Bloomberg or Mr. Patrick could do better with such a delayed start, though he considered Mr. Patrick as by far the more intriguing option.

“I think Deval Patrick makes an excellent candidate, however, I am very, very concerned that he simply will not have enough time to make the case in the state of South Carolina,” Mr. Kimpson said, adding of Mr. Bloomberg, “We are familiar with him, but there doesn’t appear to me to be any excitement about his potential.”

Among the other Democratic campaigns, there is more confusion than consensus about what effect Mr. Patrick and Mr. Bloomberg might have on the primary, beyond straining the fund-raising efforts of other candidates who appeal to the business community. That could be an acute challenge for Mr. Biden, the only leading candidate who has been facing a significant cash crunch in recent months, as well as all of the less-prominent candidates hoping for a late breakthrough.

Neither of the two newcomers has done anything to build an operation in the early primary states, and Mr. Bloomberg has indicated he plans to skip those four February contests entirely. Any major effect they will have on the nomination fight would likely come in the states that vote after Iowa and New Hampshire, where the race is less defined."

Regarding the testimony of Marie Yovanovitch, the former United States ambassador to Ukraine, before the House Intelligence Committee’s impeachment hearings on Friday:

The great public congressional hearings often start slow and continue without making apparent progress toward a solution to the problem they address. Then suddenly there is a “eureka!” moment when quiet, civilly spoken words cast a light so bright that the public and their elected representatives cannot ignore or fail to right grievous wrongs.

Friday marked such a turning point for Trumpism and the Trump administration.

Any American citizen paying attention to the opening statement and testimony of Ms. Yovanovitch will experience a historic eureka moment.

This brave and heroic woman has no agenda other than to serve the country she loves. Her clear, straightforward depiction of the abuse and smears she received and the corruption of United States foreign policy and security to serve the political and financial interests of the president and his enablers cannot be ignored or dismissed.

Ambassador Yovanovitch deserves a Presidential Medal of Freedom . Instead she is defamed, dismissed and threatened."

Leo is an artist, and had been making impeachment-inspired drawings. He was very informed, but there were some gaps in his understanding. For example, Leo thought that “whistle-blower” was an elected position in government. There was also some confusion over whether it was Joe Biden or his son running for president (because Biden’s name is technically Joseph Biden Jr. — it’s confusing!).

Talking to an 8-year-old in a critical moment for our country was a risky move. We had no idea how the conversation would go. Mike Schmidt travelled from Washington to New York on an early-morning train, because he wanted to be there in person. He showed up in a suit and cufflinks.

Leo sat with Mike, Michael and me in the studio. His parents watched from the control room as he consumed a hot chocolate in under 30 seconds. We knew the show would work as soon as Michael said, “Right, same concept. Do not chase after dolphins. Do not ask the president of Ukraine to do you a political favor.”

When Mike explained “this big thing called the Cold War,” we got to hear Leo learn American history in real time. I had hoped that our story would be funny and informative, but I hadn’t expected it to also be moving.

We plan to continue doing stories with kids. If you’re a parent, we want to hear your kids’ questions. The questions can be about the news (“What is happening with the Supreme Court and DACA?”) or about anything they want to learn (“How are pencils made?”). If you can record your kids asking questions on your phone and pass along the audio, that’s even better than a written question. And if your kids want to send us a song they made up, we’ll take that, too. Say hello at thedailykids@nytimes.com."

Republican senators say the split over how to approach what is likely to be the first presidential impeachment trial ever to unfold in an election year has been on vivid display in their private weekly lunches in the Capitol.

Some senators argued last week that the articles of impeachment likely to emerge from the House later this year do not merit the slightest consideration, and should be quickly dispensed with, so as to limit the damage they could do to Mr. Trump and his party. Others mused with relish this week about the prospect of keeping the six Democratic presidential candidates who are sitting senators chained to their desks in the Capitol for weeks on end as crucial primary contests unfold.

“There are lots of different opinions within the conference as to how long the impeachment in the Senate will take or should take, and those are different questions,” said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 3 Senate Republican. “Clearly there’s not 51 votes for any one thing, so this is going to have to begin and then play out over time.”"

You’re alive! Not a drop of blood on you!

Ukraine got its military aid; Trump did not get his investigation of the Bidens. To Jordan, that’s proof of innocence.

To a normal person, that’s proof of incompetence, which doesn’t exonerate the president but should definitely reassure us. Trump’s an autocrat all right, but the silver lining is that he’s an inept one. All strongmen should be this weak.

And all of us should have the mental limberness and ethical elasticity that Jordan and his troupe possess. They’re the Cirque du Soleil of c’est la vie.

So to understand how it’s going to play out, the past is really our best guide. “I think we’re just all in for a really crazy ride.” Collectively, these New York Times reporters have covered U.S. politics for over 150 years. “I’m also a drummer in a band, so …” They’ve reported on past impeachment inquiries. “Yea, I’m lost in Senate wonderland.” And they say that the three we’ve had so far have been full of twists and turns. “The president of the United States is not guilty as charged.” In short, expect the unexpected. First, the process. Impeachment is technically only the initial stage. “Common misconceptions about impeachment are that impeachment by itself means removal from office. It doesn’t. The impeachment part of the process is only the indictment that sets up a trial.” The Constitution describes offenses that are grounds for removing the president from office as bribery, treason and — “They say high crimes and misdemeanors, which, really, is in the eye of the beholder.” “The framers didn’t give us a guidebook to it. They simply said, that the House had the responsibility for impeachment and the Senate had the responsibility for the trial.” One of the things missing from the Constitution? How an impeachment inquiry should start. And that has generally been a source of drama. Basically, anything goes. “In fact, in the Andrew Johnson case they voted to impeach him without even having drafted the articles of impeachment.” For Richard Nixon, his case started with several investigations that led to public hearings. That part of the process went on for two years, and yielded revelation after revelation, connecting Nixon to a politically-motivated burglary at D.N.C. headquarters — “… located in the Watergate office building.” — and its subsequent cover-up. “Mr. Butterfield, are you aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the president?” “I was aware of listening devices. Yes, sir.” “This was a shocker. Everybody in the White House recognized how damaging this could be.” As the House drafted articles of impeachment, Nixon lost the support of his party. “O.K., I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.” “I was asked to write the farewell piece that ran the morning after Nixon resigned. And this is what I wrote: The central question is how a man who won so much could have lost so much.” So for Nixon, it more or less ended after the investigations. But for Bill Clinton, that phase was just the beginning. “This is the information.” An independent counsel’s investigation into his business dealings unexpectedly turned into a very public inquiry about his personal life. “The idea that a president of the United States was having an affair with a White House intern and then a federal prosecutor was looking at that, it was just extraordinary.” That investigation led to public hearings in the House Judiciary Committee. “When the Starr Report was being delivered to Congress it was a little bit like the O.J. chase, only a political one. There were two black cars. They were being filmed live on CNN. They were heading towards the Capitol. We were watching it and a little bit agog.” Public opinion is key. And the media plays a huge part in the process. This was definitely true for Clinton. “You know it was just a crazy time. We worked in the Senate press gallery.” “All your colleagues are kind of piled on top of each other.” “We had crummy computers, the fax machine would always break. The printer would always break.” After committee hearings, the House brought formal impeachment charges. “It was very tense. I thought that the Saturday of the impeachment vote in the House was one of the most tense days I’d experienced in Washington.” And it turned out, also, full of surprises. “The day of impeachment arrived, everyone’s making very impassioned speeches about whether Bill Clinton should or should not be impeached and Livingston rises to give an argument for the House Republicans. He started to talk about how Clinton could resign.” “You, sir, may resign your post.” “And all of a sudden people start booing and saying, ‘Resign, resign’!” “So I must set the example.” “He announced he was resigning because he had had extramarital affairs and challenged President Clinton to do the only honorable thing, in his view —” “I hope President Clinton will follow.” “— to resign as well, so there was all this drama unfolding even in the midst of impeachment.” Then it went to the Senate for trial. The Constitution gets a little more specific about this part. “The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is supposed to preside over that trial.” “Rehnquist, he showed up in this robe he had made for himself, which had gold stripes on the sleeves because he liked Gilbert and Sullivan.” “The Senate is the actual jury.” “You will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws. So help you, God.” “This is a copy of the rules of the Senate for handling impeachment. They’re actually very specific.” “Meet six days a week.” “Convene at noon. The senators have to sit at their desks and remain quiet in their role as jurors. And not talk, which trust me, is going to be a problem for some of the senators who are used to talking all the time.” It’s just like a courtroom trial. There are prosecutors who present the case against the president. “That was perjury.” Only, they’re members of the House, and they’re called managers. Then the senators, or the jurors, vote. And things are still, unpredictable. “The options are guilty or not guilty. But there was one senator —” “Arlen Specter, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania.” “Under Scottish law, there are three possible verdicts: guilty, not guilty and not proved.” “— which is not a thing.” “And everybody just looks, you know, how do you even record that vote?” In the end, there were not enough votes to oust Clinton. “What’s amazing about this whole thing to me wasn’t so much the constitutional process. It was that it felt to me like the beginning of really intense partisanship, the weaponization of partisanship.” And here’s the thing: An impeachment charge has never gotten the two-thirds majority it needs in the Senate to actually oust a president from office. “So you could end up having a situation where the president is impeached, acquitted and runs for re-election and wins re-election.” And that would be a first. “This is my ticket to the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. I don’t think you’ll find these on StubHub.”"

The initial bill she would seek to pass if elected would be a step short of the broader Medicare for all plan she has championed. But it would substantially expand the reach and generosity of public health insurance, creating a government plan that would offer free coverage to all American children and people earning less than double the federal poverty rate, or about $50,000 for a family of four, and that could be purchased by other Americans who want it.

Ms. Warren has long endorsed a Medicare for all bill sponsored by one of her rivals for the Democratic nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. But until now, she has not specified how quickly she would move to enact a health care plan. Friday’s proposal amounts to a detailed road map for eventually establishing Medicare for all, a single government-run health insurance program under which private coverage would be eliminated.

That goal — a wholesale transformation of how Americans receive health insurance — is a big political gamble, particularly given that many of them would have to give up the coverage they get through their employer s. Ms. Warren’s proposal for Medicare for all would require an estimated $20.5 trillion in new federal spending over a decade, according to a financing plan she released two weeks ago. To provide funding for it, she would impose new taxes on businesses and the richest Americans."

The poll showed that Mr. Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., was the first choice for 25 percent of would-be Democratic caucusgoers, a significant increase from the 9 percent he held in September, when The Register last polled the state. The support placed him far ahead of the rest of the field — with the other three top candidates in a virtual tie for second: Ms. Warren at 16 percent and Mr. Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders at 15 percent.

The results are the latest evidence of Mr. Buttigieg’s strength in Iowa, where his moderate political views, plain-spoken style and military history have resonated in the early voting state. Since September, when he placed fourth in the Register poll, he has more than doubled his on-the-ground staff to over 100 and has opened more than 20 field offices.

The backlash seemed to ensure that Ms. Warren will face even more pressure to explain her stance in the Democratic debate in Atlanta on Wednesday.

“Up until putting a price tag on Medicare for all she had imposed her will on the primary and dictated the tempo on her terms,” Mr. Lehane said. “This is first time that she is having to react and not follow her campaign script.”

A plan conspicuous by its absence

Ms. Warren had a plan for everything. That was her calling card almost from the start of the race. But health care was conspicuous it its absence, all the way back to her first trip to Iowa, when she barely mentioned Medicare for all. In June, Ms. Warren simply tucked into the slipstream of her liberal rival, Mr. Sanders, on his signature issue.

“I’m with Bernie on Medicare for all,” she said at the first debate.

But by fall, health care was emerging as the No. 1 issue in the campaign, and the absence of a plan was increasingly untenable. She was dogged for weeks by questions about whom she would raise taxes on, saying only that total costs for the middle class would go down."

Biden Jr. to hold a commanding lead among likely Democratic caucusgoers, according to a new poll from The Des Moines Register and CNN.

The poll showed that Mr. Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., was the first choice for 25 percent of would-be Democratic caucusgoers, a significant increase from the 9 percent he held in September, when The Register last polled the state. The support placed him far ahead of the rest of the field — with the other three top candidates in a virtual tie for second: Ms. Warren at 16 percent and Mr. Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders at 15 percent.

The results are the latest evidence of Mr. Buttigieg’s strength in Iowa, where his moderate political views, plain-spoken style and military history have resonated in the early voting state. Since September, when he placed fourth in the Register poll, he has more than doubled his on-the-ground staff to over 100 and has opened more than 20 field offices. He recently completed another bus tour in the state.

Speaking to reporters in Long Beach, Calif., on Saturday night during the state’s Democratic convention, Mr. Buttigieg said the just-released poll numbers were “extremely encouraging.”"

She also described how she would prioritize improvements to the Affordable Care Act, including the creation of an optional government health-insurance plan, before attempting to create a single-payer system.

Both Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders remain among the best-positioned candidates in the primary election, with distinctive appeal to young people and other voters seeking a large-scale redraw of the political system — an overlapping agenda that drew roars of approval at the “First in the West” dinner.

At the dinner, both expressed disdain for incremental politics, with Mr. Sanders saying that “tinkering around the edges just won’t do what needs to be done” and Ms. Warren dismissing more modest policies as “a nibble here and a nibble there.” Both are polling at or near the top of the pack in three of the four early primary states, including Nevada.

And both are actively working to persuade voters that their approach is the better bet in a general election, including by appealing to voters who feel alienated from the political system. “If the best that Democrats can offer is business as usual after Donald Trump, then Democrats will lose,” Ms. Warren said at a campaign stop here on Sunday afternoon. “We win when we have solutions for the problems in people’s lives.”

Andrea Griffin, an elementary school nurse in Las Vegas, said she had been wary of Ms. Warren as a general-election candidate but came away feeling more confident after watching her on Sunday.

“I was a little skeptical about a plan for everything, but she has a pretty good grasp on what the major issues are and I kind of think that she might be able to get it done,” said Ms. Griffin, 56, a former independent voter who said she registered as a Democrat two weeks ago.

Ms. Griffin said she was also curious about Mr. Buttigieg, but had essentially ruled out Mr. Biden, explaining, “I think America is not ready to go back to business as usual.”"

Some voters cited the misogyny and racism that female candidates and candidates of color have experienced in previous races.

And then there is the crucial fact that many of these voters — whether because of his down-to-earth persona, the tragedies he has endured or a combination of both — simply have warm feelings for the man they often address as Joe when they see him.

“He relates well to blue-collar voters and to non-college voters,” Jeff Link, a veteran Iowa Democratic strategist, said. “Those Scranton roots kind of come through.”

Despite this advantage, some Democrats are skeptical that Mr. Biden, who turns 77 on Wednesday, can sustain this support.

Since he entered the race in April, Mr. Biden’s poll numbers have dipped, he has suffered from a series of self-inflicted errors that raised concerns about his age, and he has absorbed ferocious attacks from Democrats and Republicans alike — including baseless attacks on his family from Mr. Trump.

Ty Livesay, the operations manager at a mall in Conway, S.C., said he connected with Mr. Biden — “I’m a common Joe, he’s a common Joe” — but acknowledged having doubts about Mr. Biden’s strength in the primary. “Is Joe going to be able to handle it?” he asked.

Others harbor no such reservations.

“I don’t care about his personal opinion, gaffes or comments he makes — what means most to me is what type of man he is,” said Pete Garrett, who works at an auto parts production company and wore an Obama campaign pin to a Biden appearance in Birmingham, Ala."

He is among the White House officials who have described the fallout as the president and his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, pressured Ukraine to investigate unfounded allegations about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Democratic rival of the president, and to help chase an unproven theory that Ukraine, not Russia, had intervened in the 2016 election. Democrats have accused the president of abusing his official powers to benefit his re-election efforts, while House Republicans argue he did nothing wrong."

Republicans and Democrats both believe Mr. Volker has something important to say.

Democrats are eager to have him testify because of text messages between him, Mr. Giuliani and another of the amigos, Gordon D. Sondland, Mr. Trump’s ambassador to the European Union. The messages reveal that Mr. Trump was trying to pressure President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to investigate a discredited theory about Ukraine’s involvement in the 2016 elections, as well as former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter, by dangling two things Mr. Zelensky coveted: a White House meeting with Mr. Trump, and $391 million in military aid that Congress had approved for Ukraine, but which the president was refusing to release.

(Mr. Sondland will testify Wednesday; the third amigo, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, is not on the list of witnesses.)

“Heard from White House — assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / ‘get to the bottom of what happened’ in 2016, we will nail down date for a visit to Washington,” Mr. Volker wrote to a top aide to Mr. Zelensky on July 25, the same day that the two presidents spoke by phone in a conversation that is now central to the inquiry.

But Republicans believe Mr. Volker can help exonerate Mr. Trump, because during his closed-door testimony he said that he was not aware of any quid pro quo that tied the investigations Mr. Trump sought to military aid. Mr. Volker plans to testify that he was out of the loop at key moments during the events in question."

On Tuesday, Ms. Williams is scheduled to testify in public, becoming the latest in a series of diplomats to express their concerns about the call.

Over the weekend, Mr. Trump lashed out at Ms. Williams — “whoever that is,” he tweeted — saying that she should read the transcripts of the July 25 call and another one between the two leaders that took place in April. “Then she should meet with the other Never Trumpers, who I don’t know & mostly never even heard of, & work out a better presidential attack!” Mr. Trump wrote. A spokeswoman for Mr. Pence said merely, “Jennifer is a State Department employee.”

A White House official said some were not surprised by Mr. Trump’s attack on Ms. Williams, whom the official described as an innocent bystander in the impeachment mess, and expressed disappointment that senior staff on Mr. Pence’s team did nothing to defend her. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment. The person said it reflected poorly on the vice president that he was apparently unable to protect Ms. Williams from being publicly disparaged by the president.

Ms. Williams joined the Foreign Service in 2006 after spending a year as a political appointee working for Michael Chertoff, the secretary of homeland security, in George W. Bush’s administration. In addition to serving in Jamaica under Mr. Bush and in Beirut, Lebanon, under President Barack Obama, Ms. Williams spent about three years working for the State Department on the humanitarian crisis involving refugees in Syria. Six months before Mr. Trump became president, Ms. Williams was transferred to London to work as the deputy spokeswoman at the embassy there."

As Brent Staples, a member of the Times editorial board has written, the history of the federal ban on marijuana possession is rooted in racist prejudices about African-Americans and Mexicans. The burden of the ban’s enforcement, especially since the advent of the war on drugs in the 1970s, has in turn disproportionately fallen on people of color: While whites and blacks use marijuana at roughly equal rates, blacks are 3.7 times as likely to get arrested for possessing it. “The costs of this national obsession, in both money and time, are astonishing,” writes Jesse Wegman, a member of the Times editorial board.

Repaying those costs requires tackling two main challenges.

Criminal justice

In 2018, over 663,000 people were arrested on charges involving marijuana. What happens to them if it’s legalized? As Mr. Wegman writes, marijuana convictions “can have lifelong consequences for employment, education, immigration status and family life,” even when prison time isn’t part of the sentence.

That’s why the Los Angeles Times editorial board came out in favor of retroactively expunging or resentencing marijuana-related convictions. They wrote:

Marijuana is now legal under California law, but hundreds of thousands of Californians have criminal records for possessing or selling the drug when it was still banned. Those records can make it harder for people to get a job, obtain a loan, go to college, rent an apartment or otherwise become productive members of their community — even if their marijuana arrest happened decades ago. … It’s cruel to allow people to continue to suffer the penalties of a conviction for marijuana-related acts that the state no longer considers a crime.

What’s clear is that racial disparities in the criminal justice system won’t disappear on their own: After Colorado legalized marijuana, arrests went down for white kids, but shot up for black and Latino kids.

[Related: The war on drugs, explained]

Economic justice

As legalization moves forward in the states, most of the new market opportunities in the cannabis industry are being captured by white people: According to a survey by Marijuana Business Daily, only 19 percent of cannabis businesses in 2017 had minority founders or owners (African-Americans accounted for just over 4 percent).

Summing up the historical irony, Michelle Alexander, author of “The New Jim Crow,” said in 2014, “40 years of impoverished black kids getting prison time for selling weed, and their families and futures destroyed,” and “now, white men are planning to get rich doing precisely the same thing?”"

She also described how she would prioritize improvements to the Affordable Care Act, including the creation of an optional government health-insurance plan, before attempting to create a single-payer system.

Both Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders remain among the best-positioned candidates in the primary election, with distinctive appeal to young people and other voters seeking a large-scale redraw of the political system — an overlapping agenda that drew roars of approval at the “First in the West” dinner.

At the dinner, both expressed disdain for incremental politics, with Mr. Sanders saying that “tinkering around the edges just won’t do what needs to be done” and Ms. Warren dismissing more modest policies as “a nibble here and a nibble there.” Both are polling at or near the top of the pack in three of the four early primary states, including Nevada.

And both are actively working to persuade voters that their approach is the better bet in a general election, including by appealing to voters who feel alienated from the political system. “If the best that Democrats can offer is business as usual after Donald Trump, then Democrats will lose,” Ms. Warren said at a campaign stop here on Sunday afternoon. “We win when we have solutions for the problems in people’s lives.”

Andrea Griffin, an elementary school nurse in Las Vegas, said she had been wary of Ms. Warren as a general-election candidate but came away feeling more confident after watching her on Sunday.

“I was a little skeptical about a plan for everything, but she has a pretty good grasp on what the major issues are and I kind of think that she might be able to get it done,” said Ms. Griffin, 56, a former independent voter who said she registered as a Democrat two weeks ago.

Ms. Griffin said she was also curious about Mr. Buttigieg, but had essentially ruled out Mr. Biden, explaining, “I think America is not ready to go back to business as usual.”"

I came to believe that the president’s long-held negative view toward Ukraine was causing hesitation in actually scheduling the meeting, much as we had seen in our Oval Office discussion.

After weeks of reassuring the Ukrainians that it was just a scheduling issue, I decided to tell President Zelensky that we had a problem with the information reaching President Trump from Mayor Giuliani. I did so in a bilateral meeting at a conference on Ukrainian economic reform in Toronto, on July 2, 2019, where I led the U.S. delegation. I suggested that he call President Trump directly in order to renew their personal relationship, and to assure President Trump that he was committed to investigating and fighting corruption, things on which President Zelensky had based his presidential campaign. I was convinced that getting the two presidents to talk with each other would overcome the negative perception of Ukraine that President Trump still harbored.

President Zelensky’s senior aide, Andrey Yermak, approached me several days later to ask to be connected to Mayor Giuliani. I agreed to make that connection. I did so because I understood that the new Ukrainian leadership wanted to convince those, like Mayor Giuliani, who believed such a negative narrative about Ukraine, that times have changed and that, under President Zelensky, Ukraine is worthy of U.S. support. The Ukrainians believed that if they could get their own narrative across in a way that convinced Mayor Giuliani that they were serious about fighting corruption and advancing reform, Mayor Giuliani would convey that assessment to President Trump, thus correcting the previous, negative narrative.

That made sense to me and I tried to be helpful. I made clear to the Ukrainians that Mayor Giuliani was a private citizen, the president’s personal lawyer, and not representing the U.S. government. Likewise, in my conversations with Mayor Giuliani, I never considered him to be speaking on the president’s behalf, or giving “instructions.” Rather, the information flow was the other way — from Ukraine to Mayor Giuliani, in the hopes this would clear up the information reaching President Trump.

On July 10, after hearing from Mr. Yermak, I wrote to Mayor Giuliani to seek to get together, and finally on July 19 we met for breakfast for a longer discussion. At that meeting, I told Mr. Giuliani that in my view, the prosecutor general with whom he had been speaking, Mr. Lutsenko, was not credible and was acting in a self-serving capacity. To my surprise, Mr. Giuliani said that he had already come to the same conclusion. Mr. Giuliani also mentioned both the accusations about Vice President Biden and about interference in the 2016 election, and stressed that all he wanted to see was for Ukraine to investigate what happened in the past and apply its own laws.

Concerning the allegations, I stressed that no one in the new team governing Ukraine had anything to do with anything that may have happened in 2016. They were making television shows at the time. I also said that it is not credible to me that former Vice President Biden would have been influenced in any way by financial or personal motives in carrying out his duties as vice president.

A different issue is whether some individual Ukrainians may have attempted to influence the 2016 election or thought they could buy influence: That is at least plausible, given Ukraine’s reputation for corruption. But the accusation that Vice President Biden acted inappropriately did not seem at all credible to me."
142,Katie Glueck and Jonathan Martin,"For some voters, Mr. Biden appeals because there are strategic assumptions at work: many black working-class Democrats believe that white America will only support a well-known white male, such as Mr. Biden, while a number of working-class white Democrats als… [+1542 chars]",Joseph R.

And then there is the crucial fact that many of these voters — whether because of his down-to-earth persona, the tragedies he has endured or a combination of both — simply have warm feelings for the man they often address as Joe when they see him.

“He relates well to blue-collar voters and to non-college voters,” Jeff Link, a veteran Iowa Democratic strategist, said. “Those Scranton roots kind of come through.”

Despite this advantage, some Democrats are skeptical that Mr. Biden, who turns 77 on Wednesday, can sustain this support.

Since he entered the race in April, Mr. Biden’s poll numbers have dipped, he has suffered from a series of self-inflicted errors that raised concerns about his age, and he has absorbed ferocious attacks from Democrats and Republicans alike — including baseless attacks on his family from Mr. Trump.

Ty Livesay, the operations manager at a mall in Conway, S.C., said he connected with Mr. Biden — “I’m a common Joe, he’s a common Joe” — but acknowledged having doubts about Mr. Biden’s strength in the primary. “Is Joe going to be able to handle it?” he asked.

Others harbor no such reservations.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Gordon Sondland is a Trump donor turned E.U. ambassador turned witness in the impeachment inquiry, whose testimony has been contradicted on multiple occasions. Today: How both Democrats and Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee choose to handle their most complicated witness to date. It’s Thursday, November 21. So Nick, give us a sense of what it felt like to be in that room this morning as the committee prepared to hear from Gordon Sondland, this very complicated witness.

nicholas fandos

So we knew that in the middle of this jam-packed week of impeachment testimony, Gordon Sondland’s appearance was going to be something different.

michael barbaro

Nick Fandos was in the Capitol for Sondland’s testimony.

nicholas fandos

Sondland has really been described by almost everybody as having been in the middle of this pressure campaign on Ukraine this summer. Now, there was particular anticipation, because Sondland’s story, unlike some other witnesses, has evolved as time has gone on. So when he first came in and spoke in private with investigators in October, he was pretty unclear about whether or not the president was trying to leverage a White House meeting or security aid for Ukraine to get the investigations that he wanted. He told them repeatedly, I can’t remember this, I can’t remember that. Well, after that happened, Sondland submitted a supplement to his testimony in writing that updated that and said, actually, I do think there was a quid pro quo. And so there was a lot of anticipation heading into his testimony as to which Gordon Sondland would show up. What story was he going to tell? Is he going to cop to all these different things? How is he going to treat the president? How’s he going to treat his own evolving story? And it really felt like it could go either way.

michael barbaro

So what happens? How does this much-anticipated hearing begin?

nicholas fandos

So a little after 9:00, Gordon Sondland walks into the same grand hearing room where all the impeachment hearings have been taking place. Chairman Schiff dropped his gavel.

archived recording (adam schiff) Meeting will come to order. [GAVEL BANG]

nicholas fandos

And then, after taking an oath to tell the truth and nothing but the truth —

archived recording (adam schiff) And nothing but the truth, so help you God.

nicholas fandos

— Sondland sits down and begins reading from a pretty thick stack of papers, an opening statement that he’s brought with him. And he starts by saying that —

archived recording (gordon sondland) I have not had access to all of my phone records, State Department emails and many, many other State Department documents.

nicholas fandos

— his job is made more difficult by the fact that he has not been allowed to go back to the State Department and look at notes or records that might be able to fill in his recollections.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Having access would have been very helpful to me in trying to reconstruct with whom I spoke and met and when and what was said.

nicholas fandos

Seems to be a nod at the fact that his story is, in the most generous sense, evolving. And he begins to tell the story about his involvement with Ukraine policy over the last, say, five or six months.

archived recording (gordon sondland) The U.S. delegation developed a very positive view of the Ukraine government.

nicholas fandos

He begins talking about a meeting with President Trump in May in the Oval Office after he attended the inauguration of Ukraine’s new president.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Unfortunately, President Trump was skeptical. In response to our persistent efforts in that meeting to change his views, President Trump directed us to, quote, “talk with Rudy.” We weren’t happy with the president’s directive to talk with Rudy. We did not want to involve Mr. Giuliani.

nicholas fandos

What he then starts to unspool is a set of facts and meetings that we’ve now heard a lot about in the last couple of months.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Simply put, we were playing the hand we were dealt. We all understood that if we refused to work with Mr. Giuliani, we would lose a very important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine. So we followed the president’s orders.

nicholas fandos

How, you know, May became June, became July and then August, and it became clear to him over time that President Trump, through his lawyer Mr. Giuliani and through actions that he took, wanted to extract from the Ukrainians certain politically beneficial investigations. And at one point, pretty early in his statement, he addresses the Latin phrase that has been confusing everyone as this has gone along.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Was there a quid pro quo?

nicholas fandos

Was it a quid pro quo, a this for that, or was it not? And he says —

archived recording (gordon sondland) With regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes.

nicholas fandos

Unequivocally, that as far as I’m concerned, there was a quid pro quo around the White House meeting.

michael barbaro

Right, and I was struck by how casually he says that, this thing that is very much at the center of the entire inquiry.

nicholas fandos

And the thing that has been contested by other witnesses. He states, you know, very authoritatively, without reservation. Now, he’s a little bit more cautious about whether or not there was a quid pro quo around the suspended military assistance.

archived recording (gordon sondland) In July and August of 2019, we learned that the White House had also suspended security aid to Ukraine. I tried diligently to ask why the aid was suspended, but I never received a clear answer. Still haven’t to this day.

nicholas fandos

So he came to conclude by August that that, too, was dependent on Ukraine announcing these investigations that the president wanted.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Committing to the investigations of the 2016 elections and Burisma, as Mr. Giuliani had demanded.

nicholas fandos

Now, Sondland has another clear objective as he’s laying out his story, and that is to defend himself against the testimony from other witnesses who have tried to describe him as either a rogue actor or somebody that was working through an improper diplomatic channel.

archived recording (gordon sondland) I’m not sure how someone could characterize something as an irregular channel when you’re talking to the president of the United States, the secretary of state, the national security adviser, the chief of staff at the White House, the secretary of energy. I don’t know how that’s irregular, if a bunch of —

nicholas fandos

He says, no. This was the real channel. I was working with the president of the United States. I was working with top American diplomats and officials. And not only was it proper, but all of those people knew what I was up to and what we were trying to accomplish as this went along.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Within my State Department emails, there is a July 19 email. This email was sent, this email was sent to Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Perry, Brian McCormack, who was Secretary Perry’s chief of staff at the time —

nicholas fandos

Basically, you know, if for weeks we’ve had witness after witness, and certainly the White House and the Republicans, willing to throw Gordon Sondland under the bus to try and push all of this onto him as a kind of lone wolf, I mean, he was taking everybody under the bus with him.

archived recording (gordon sondland) — Chief of Staff Mulvaney and Mr. Mulvaney’s senior adviser, Rob Blair, a lot of senior officials. These emails show that the leadership of the State Department, the National Security Council and the White House were all informed about the Ukraine efforts.

michael barbaro

Right, he’s saying, everybody who now wants to distance themselves from me, they were actually all in the loop.

nicholas fandos

That’s right. It’s a phrase he uses several times.

archived recording (gordon sondland) It was no secret. Everyone’s in the loop. Everyone was in the loop.

nicholas fandos

In the loop.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Again —

nicholas fandos

In the loop.

archived recording (gordon sondland) — everyone was in the loop.

nicholas fandos

They were in the loop.

archived recording (gordon sondland) There was a September 1 meeting with President Zelensky in Warsaw. During the actual meeting, President Zelensky raised the issue of security assistance directly with Vice President Pence. And the vice president said that he would speak to President Trump about it.

michael barbaro

And, Nick, what’s the significance of what he’s saying here? I mean, in theory, this is very explosive. The vice president, the secretary of state are being, in Sondland’s testimony, directly drawn into this.

nicholas fandos

Right, he’s trying to make the point that this wasn’t just me. Like, everyone understood this to be Trump’s objective out of this relationship, and we were all working toward that. And nobody found it unusual that I was doing what I was doing.

archived recording (gordon sondland) I sent Secretary Pompeo an email to express my appreciation for his joining a series of meetings in Brussels following the Warsaw trip. I wrote, “Mike, thanks for schlepping to Europe. I think it was really important and the chemistry seems promising. Really appreciate it.” Secretary Pompeo replied the next day, on Wednesday, September 4, quote, “All good. You’re doing great work; keep banging away.”

nicholas fandos

And with that, Sondland completes his opening statement.

archived recording (gordon sondland) It remains an honor to serve the people of the United States as their United States ambassador to the European Union. I look forward to answering the committee’s questions. Thank you.

nicholas fandos

And it’s the Democrat’s turn for 45 minutes to begin asking questions.

archived recording (adam schiff) We will now proceed the first round of questions, as detailed —

nicholas fandos

Of course, Chairman Schiff has a few of his own. But mostly, he passes the mic over to Dan Goldman, who is his chief investigator, who’s been playing a role in these hearings, questioning witnesses directly.

archived recording (adam schiff) Mr. Goldman. archived recording (daniel goldman) Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In your opening statement, Ambassador Sondland, you detailed the benefits that you have gained from obtaining some additional documents over the past few weeks. Is that right? archived recording (gordon sondland) In terms of refreshing my recollection, that’s — archived recording (daniel goldman) Right, because —

nicholas fandos

He doesn’t shy away from what becomes clear over the course of the day is a pretty shoddy memory on the part of Sondland.

archived recording (daniel goldman) You have remembered a lot more than you did when you were deposed. Is that right? archived recording (gordon sondland) That’s correct. archived recording (daniel goldman) And one of the things that —

nicholas fandos

And in doing that, Goldman does something interesting, which is that —

archived recording (daniel goldman) — conversation, Ambassador Taylor also testified, under oath, that you said that President Trump wanted Zelensky in a public box. Do you recall using that expression? archived recording (gordon sondland) Yeah, it goes back —

nicholas fandos

He repeatedly leans on those witnesses with better memories, or people who took contemporaneous notes.

archived recording (daniel goldman) Do you have any reason to question Ambassador Taylor’s testimony based on his meticulous and careful contemporaneous notes? archived recording (gordon sondland) I’m not going to question or not question. I’m just telling you what I believe I was referring to.

nicholas fandos

To describe things that Sondland told them or describe things that Sondland did, and basically asked Sondland to confirm that these things happened —

archived recording (daniel goldman) Let me fast forward a week and show you another text exchange, which may help refresh your recollection. On September 8, you sent a text to Ambassador Taylor and Ambassador Volker. Can you read what you wrote there?

nicholas fandos

— to basically bring Sondland up into line with testimony that they’ve gotten from other people about him.

archived recording (daniel goldman) So you do acknowledge you spoke to President Trump, as you indicated in that text, right? archived recording (gordon sondland) If I said I did, I did.

nicholas fandos

And that’s important as they move towards writing a report and presenting a kind of full case about what happened to the American people. It helps eliminate some of the discrepancies in the testimony they’ve gotten.

michael barbaro

Which of these exchanges stood out to you?

nicholas fandos

Well, one in particular is fresh in my mind, because we just learned about it for the first time last week.

archived recording (daniel goldman) And one of the things that you now remember is the discussion that you had with President Trump on July 26 in that restaurant in Kyiv, right?

nicholas fandos

Now remember, that’s the day after Trump himself spoke to Zelensky and told him that I want these investigations into the Bidens in 2016. Other witnesses have described Sondland basically speaking on the phone with the president, who was speaking so loud that he had to hold the phone away from his ear.

archived recording (gordon sondland) He claims to have overheard part of the conversation, and I’m not going to dispute what he did or didn’t hear.

nicholas fandos

Others could overhear President Trump asking about, quote, unquote, “the investigation,” and Sondland assured him, you know, don’t worry, with some expletive laid in, President Zelensky will do whatever we want.

michael barbaro

Right, because Ukraine loves your tush.

nicholas fandos

Something like that.

archived recording (daniel goldman) Well, he also testified that President Zelensky, quote, “loves your ass,” unquote. Do you recall saying that? archived recording (gordon sondland) Yeah, it sounds like something I would say. [LAUGHTER]

nicholas fandos

And what he basically does over the course of this back-and-forth is says —

archived recording (gordon sondland) Putting it in Trump-speak, by saying he loves your ass, he’ll do whatever you want, meant that he would really work with us on a whole host of issues.

nicholas fandos

— you’ve heard the president talk.

archived recording (gordon sondland) That’s how President Trump and I communicate, a lot of four-letter words. In this case, three-letter.

nicholas fandos

He also contests a couple of small points.

archived recording (gordon sondland) I don’t think I would have said that. I would have — I would have —

nicholas fandos

But in the end, he confirms the essence of the story as it’s been related by other witnesses, and for the first time, kind of established that that happened.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Again, trying to reconstruct a very busy day without the benefit, but if someone said I had a meeting, and I went to the meeting, then I’m not going to dispute that.

michael barbaro

So it’s kind of that familiar mix of Sondland’s self-protection, lack of recall, but overall, damning testimony.

nicholas fandos

I think that’s right.

archived recording (daniel goldman) Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

nicholas fandos

So the Democrats wrap up their questioning.

archived recording (adam schiff) That concludes our 45 minutes —

nicholas fandos

And after weeks of investigation, literally hundreds of hours of testimony, in private and in public, they’ve finally gotten, from a lead witness who had direct access to the president, a statement, an admission, of one of the things that they’ve been looking for and trying to prove out all along, that this White House meeting, an official act, was conditioned upon Ukraine publicly announcing investigations. And that Sondland, a top official, also believed that the withheld aid money — that that would only flow, too, if the investigations were announced. And so it’s with that in front of them —

archived recording (adam schiff) Why don’t we take a 5- or 10-minute break? archived recording (gordon sondland) Thank you.

nicholas fandos

That Schiff abruptly gavels the hearing into a pause, somewhat inexplicably at first. And then we quickly see why as he walks out behind the chamber —

archived recording (adam schiff) Just want to make a couple of quick observations while we’re on a break here.

nicholas fandos

— to a bank of cameras, where he begins to talk about what just took place.

archived recording (adam schiff) And what we have just heard from Ambassador Sondland is that the knowledge of this scheme was a basic quid pro quo. It was the conditioning —

nicholas fandos

Which all, of course, carried it live in the middle of the proceedings. And when he was done —

archived recording (adam schiff) So I think a very important moment in the history of this inquiry.

nicholas fandos

— he wrapped up and walked right back into the hearing room and gaveled the thing back into session.

archived recording (adam schiff) Come to order.

nicholas fandos

Now, it wasn’t lost on Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the committee, who quickly called Schiff out.

archived recording (devin nunes) Thank the gentleman. For those of you watching at home, that was not a bathroom break. That was actually a chance for the Democrats to go out and hold a press conference, Ambassador, for all the supposed bombshells that were in your opening testimony.

nicholas fandos

So there’s quite a bit of bad blood, obviously, between the two sides. But I don’t think that this helped.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So once we’re back, given that the Democrats have already sort of embraced the messiness and unreliability of Gordon Sondland and addressed it pretty directly, what is the Republican strategy when it’s their turn to question?

nicholas fandos

Well, Republicans are looking at the same guy and the same tendencies, and they see an amazing opportunity to weaponize it in defense of the president.

archived recording (steve castor) Hello again, Ambassador. archived recording (gordon sondland) Hi.

nicholas fandos

So it’s left to Steve Castor, who’s the Republicans’ lawyer in all of this, to start trying to do that work.

archived recording (steve castor) I just want to go through some distinctions between your opener and your deposition.

nicholas fandos

There’s a phone call that Sondland has where he says that he was getting such mixed signals and couldn’t get answers about what Trump wanted from Ukraine and why he was withholding the aid money.

archived recording (gordon sondland) And I was getting tired of going around in circles, frankly. So I made the call —

nicholas fandos

And he asked President Trump, just kind of point blank —

archived recording (gordon sondland) — what do you want from Ukraine? And that’s when I got the answer. archived recording (steve castor) And he was unequivocal, nothing.

nicholas fandos

The president tells him, I don’t want a quid pro quo. I don’t want anything from Ukraine. They should just do what’s right. They should do what Zelensky said he was going to do. And Republicans kept going back to this call again and again and again.

archived recording (john ratcliffe) Tell me if there’s anything sinister or nefarious in any of this, a vanilla request about corruption, a call to say, I’m on my way to Ukraine, a five-minute call you didn’t remember as significant, a call that you made where the president said, I want nothing, I want no quid pro quo, I want Zelensky to do the right thing, I want him to do what he ran on, and him telling you to go tell Congress the truth. Anything sinister and nefarious about any of that? archived recording (gordon sondland) Not the way you present it. archived recording (john ratcliffe) O.K., and that is the truth.

nicholas fandos

Because in this case, as they pointed out, you know, when the president is speaking directly to Sondland, he’s saying, no quid pro quo. I don’t want anything in particular from the Ukrainians.

archived recording (jim jordan) And you told Mr. Castor that the president never told you that the announcement had to happen to get anything. In fact, he didn’t just not tell you that, he explicitly said the opposite.

michael barbaro

So the most senior figure, and the most involved figure in all this from the Trump administration, who declares that this was a quid pro quo, is simultaneously testifying that the president gets on the phone with him and says, this is no quid pro quo. That is complicated.

nicholas fandos

It is. It’s very complicated. And if you’re listening at home and listening to Republican questioning, they’re able, I think, to raise some doubts about this account that he’s giving.

archived recording (michael turner) And if you pull up CNN today, right now, their banner says, “Sondland ties Trump to withholding aid.” Is that your testimony today, Ambassador Sondland, that you have evidence that Donald Trump tied the investigation to the aide? Because I don’t think you’re saying that.

nicholas fandos

And in this questioning, you know, Sondland says, I didn’t hear anything directly.

archived recording (gordon sondland) I’ve said repeatedly, Congressman, I was presuming. I also said that President Trump — archived recording (michael turner) So no one told you, not just the president. Giuliani didn’t tell you. Mulvaney didn’t tell you. Nobody — Pompeo didn’t tell you — nobody else on this planet told you that Donald Trump was tying aid to these investigations. Is that correct? archived recording (gordon sondland) I think I already testified to that. archived recording (michael turner) No, answer the question, yes or no. archived recording (gordon sondland) Yes.

michael barbaro

Nick, why do you think that they are so focused on that, what the president told him versus what he has concluded from all the information and conversations around him?

nicholas fandos

Republicans’ argument is basically that, if you’re going to impeach the president, you know, we need to know directly what his intentions were. What he told you, that’s evidence. That’s primary evidence. What you concluded, I mean, that’s no better than what we’ve heard from other witnesses. It’s hearsay.

archived recording (michael turner) I mean, that’s what I don’t understand. So, you know what hearsay evidence is, Ambassador? Hearsay is when I testify what someone else told me. You know what made-up testimony is? Made-up testimony is when I just presume it. I mean, you’re just assuming all of these things, and then you’re giving them the evidence — that they’re running out and doing press conferences, and CNN’s headline is saying that you’re saying the president of the United States should be impeached because he tied aid to investigations. And you don’t know that. Correct? archived recording (gordon sondland) I never said the president of the United States should be impeached. archived recording (michael turner) Nope, but you did —

nicholas fandos

So as this hearing starts to wind down after five or six hours of this back-and-forth, after a pretty explosive and direct opening statement and then cross-examination and examination and more cross-examination, spirits are starting to flag a little bit in the hearing room.

archived recording (adam schiff) Mr. Maloney. archived recording (sean patrick maloney) Mr. Ambassador, let’s pick up right there.

nicholas fandos

There’s an exchange near the end with Sean Patrick Maloney, a Democrat of New York.

archived recording (sean patrick maloney) Let me ask you something. Who would have benefited from an investigation of the president’s political opponents? archived recording (gordon sondland) I don’t want to characterize who would have and who would not have. archived recording (sean patrick maloney) I know you don’t want to, sir. That’s my question. Would you answer it for me?

nicholas fandos

And Maloney, you know, seeming to kind of burst forth with Democratic frustration that’s been boiling beneath the surface all day, basically says —

archived recording (sean patrick maloney) I guess I’m have trouble why you can’t just say — archived recording (gordon sondland) When he asked about investigations, I assumed he meant — archived recording (sean patrick maloney) I know what you assumed. But who would benefit from an investigation of the Bidens? archived recording (gordon sondland) I assume President Trump would benefit. archived recording (sean patrick maloney) There we have it. See? [APPLAUSE] Didn’t hurt a bit, did it? But let me ask you something — archived recording (gordon sondland) Mr. Maloney? archived recording (sean patrick maloney) Hold on, sir. archived recording (gordon sondland) Excuse me. I’ve been very forthright, and I really resent what you’re trying to do. archived recording (sean patrick maloney) Fair enough. You’ve been very forthright. This your third try to do so, sir. Didn’t work so well the first time, did it? And now we’re here a third time, and we got a doozy of a statement from you this morning. There’s a whole bunch of stuff you don’t recall. So all due respect, sir, we appreciate your candor. But let’s be really clear on what it took to get it out of you.

nicholas fandos

And that’s kind of the tone as this hearing begins to come to an end. Democrats are frustrated about some things. Republicans are frustrated about some things. Sondland, who’s trying to catch a flight back to Brussels, is certainly frustrated by some things. And we’ve had a pretty complex and conflicting day of testimony, where some people seem to be coming away quite happy, but not perfectly so.

michael barbaro

So is this unreliable witness turning out to be the most important witness in this inquiry? Or is he just an unreliable witness?

nicholas fandos

Well, the thing about Sondland is, the Democrats will tell you, prosecutors successfully bring cases all the time on highly flawed witnesses who maybe don’t even have a great history with the truth. But that doesn’t mean that what they’re saying isn’t true in a given scenario. And in this case, it’s important to remember, what he’s saying is incredibly, politically inconvenient for him. He still works for the president of the United States, who he donated a bunch of money to and whose policies he believes in. That itself lends it some power and credibility. Democrats seem to be emerging from today more comfortable and more certain that they need to bring forward this case of the president abusing his office, of committing high crimes and misdemeanors worthy of impeachment and putting it before the American people.

michael barbaro

Thank you, Nick.

nicholas fandos

Thanks for having me, Michael.

michael barbaro

For the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the latest developments in the impeachment inquiry in our new podcast. It’s called “The Latest.” You can hear these episodes at the end of the day, right here on “The Daily.” Or subscribe to “The Latest” wherever you listen. We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) How did Ambassador Sondland get there? You know, this is not a man who had any qualifications except one. He wrote a check for a million dollars.

michael barbaro

In the fifth Democratic presidential debate, candidates expressed outrage over Wednesday’s testimony in the impeachment inquiry, with Senator Elizabeth Warren accusing President Trump of selling off key ambassadorships to wealthy donors like Gordon Sondland.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) And that tells us about what’s happening in Washington.

michael barbaro

But with Mayor Pete Buttigieg now leading the polls in Iowa, the first state to pick a Democratic nominee, several of his rivals, including Senator Amy Klobuchar, sought to challenge his credentials and experience.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) Just like I have won statewide, and Mayor, I have all appreciation for your good work as a local official, and you did not when you tried, I also have actually done this work. I think experience should matter.

michael barbaro

Buttigieg fired back, suggesting that the federal experience of his opponent was its own liability.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) So first of all, Washington experience is not the only experience that matters. There’s more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage. And where are we right now as a country? [CHEERING]

Do not worry. I will be fine for telling the truth. It was improper for the president to request an — to demand an investigation into a political opponent, especially a foreign power where there is at best dubious belief that this would be a completely impartial investigation.” “What is it about the relationship between the president of the United States and the president of Ukraine that leads you to conclude that when the president of the United States asks a favor like this, it’s really a demand?” “Chairman, the culture I come from, the military culture, when a senior asks you to do something, even if it’s polite and pleasant, it’s not — it’s not to be taken as a request.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Gordon Sondland is a Trump donor turned E.U. ambassador turned witness in the impeachment inquiry, whose testimony has been contradicted on multiple occasions. Today: How both Democrats and Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee choose to handle their most complicated witness to date. It’s Thursday, November 21. So Nick, give us a sense of what it felt like to be in that room this morning as the committee prepared to hear from Gordon Sondland, this very complicated witness.

nicholas fandos

So we knew that in the middle of this jam-packed week of impeachment testimony, Gordon Sondland’s appearance was going to be something different.

michael barbaro

Nick Fandos was in the Capitol for Sondland’s testimony.

nicholas fandos

Sondland has really been described by almost everybody as having been in the middle of this pressure campaign on Ukraine this summer. Now, there was particular anticipation, because Sondland’s story, unlike some other witnesses, has evolved as time has gone on. So when he first came in and spoke in private with investigators in October, he was pretty unclear about whether or not the president was trying to leverage a White House meeting or security aid for Ukraine to get the investigations that he wanted. He told them repeatedly, I can’t remember this, I can’t remember that. Well, after that happened, Sondland submitted a supplement to his testimony in writing that updated that and said, actually, I do think there was a quid pro quo. And so there was a lot of anticipation heading into his testimony as to which Gordon Sondland would show up. What story was he going to tell? Is he going to cop to all these different things? How is he going to treat the president? How’s he going to treat his own evolving story? And it really felt like it could go either way.

michael barbaro

So what happens? How does this much-anticipated hearing begin?

nicholas fandos

So a little after 9:00, Gordon Sondland walks into the same grand hearing room where all the impeachment hearings have been taking place. Chairman Schiff dropped his gavel.

archived recording (adam schiff) Meeting will come to order. [GAVEL BANG]

nicholas fandos

And then, after taking an oath to tell the truth and nothing but the truth —

archived recording (adam schiff) And nothing but the truth, so help you God.

nicholas fandos

— Sondland sits down and begins reading from a pretty thick stack of papers, an opening statement that he’s brought with him. And he starts by saying that —

archived recording (gordon sondland) I have not had access to all of my phone records, State Department emails and many, many other State Department documents.

nicholas fandos

— his job is made more difficult by the fact that he has not been allowed to go back to the State Department and look at notes or records that might be able to fill in his recollections.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Having access would have been very helpful to me in trying to reconstruct with whom I spoke and met and when and what was said.

nicholas fandos

Seems to be a nod at the fact that his story is, in the most generous sense, evolving. And he begins to tell the story about his involvement with Ukraine policy over the last, say, five or six months.

archived recording (gordon sondland) The U.S. delegation developed a very positive view of the Ukraine government.

nicholas fandos

He begins talking about a meeting with President Trump in May in the Oval Office after he attended the inauguration of Ukraine’s new president.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Unfortunately, President Trump was skeptical. In response to our persistent efforts in that meeting to change his views, President Trump directed us to, quote, “talk with Rudy.” We weren’t happy with the president’s directive to talk with Rudy. We did not want to involve Mr. Giuliani.

nicholas fandos

What he then starts to unspool is a set of facts and meetings that we’ve now heard a lot about in the last couple of months.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Simply put, we were playing the hand we were dealt. We all understood that if we refused to work with Mr. Giuliani, we would lose a very important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine. So we followed the president’s orders.

nicholas fandos

How, you know, May became June, became July and then August, and it became clear to him over time that President Trump, through his lawyer Mr. Giuliani and through actions that he took, wanted to extract from the Ukrainians certain politically beneficial investigations. And at one point, pretty early in his statement, he addresses the Latin phrase that has been confusing everyone as this has gone along.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Was there a quid pro quo?

nicholas fandos

Was it a quid pro quo, a this for that, or was it not? And he says —

archived recording (gordon sondland) With regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes.

nicholas fandos

Unequivocally, that as far as I’m concerned, there was a quid pro quo around the White House meeting.

michael barbaro

Right, and I was struck by how casually he says that, this thing that is very much at the center of the entire inquiry.

nicholas fandos

And the thing that has been contested by other witnesses. He states, you know, very authoritatively, without reservation. Now, he’s a little bit more cautious about whether or not there was a quid pro quo around the suspended military assistance.

archived recording (gordon sondland) In July and August of 2019, we learned that the White House had also suspended security aid to Ukraine. I tried diligently to ask why the aid was suspended, but I never received a clear answer. Still haven’t to this day.

nicholas fandos

So he came to conclude by August that that, too, was dependent on Ukraine announcing these investigations that the president wanted.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Committing to the investigations of the 2016 elections and Burisma, as Mr. Giuliani had demanded.

nicholas fandos

Now, Sondland has another clear objective as he’s laying out his story, and that is to defend himself against the testimony from other witnesses who have tried to describe him as either a rogue actor or somebody that was working through an improper diplomatic channel.

archived recording (gordon sondland) I’m not sure how someone could characterize something as an irregular channel when you’re talking to the president of the United States, the secretary of state, the national security adviser, the chief of staff at the White House, the secretary of energy. I don’t know how that’s irregular, if a bunch of —

nicholas fandos

He says, no. This was the real channel. I was working with the president of the United States. I was working with top American diplomats and officials. And not only was it proper, but all of those people knew what I was up to and what we were trying to accomplish as this went along.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Within my State Department emails, there is a July 19 email. This email was sent, this email was sent to Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Perry, Brian McCormack, who was Secretary Perry’s chief of staff at the time —

nicholas fandos

Basically, you know, if for weeks we’ve had witness after witness, and certainly the White House and the Republicans, willing to throw Gordon Sondland under the bus to try and push all of this onto him as a kind of lone wolf, I mean, he was taking everybody under the bus with him.

archived recording (gordon sondland) — Chief of Staff Mulvaney and Mr. Mulvaney’s senior adviser, Rob Blair, a lot of senior officials. These emails show that the leadership of the State Department, the National Security Council and the White House were all informed about the Ukraine efforts.

michael barbaro

Right, he’s saying, everybody who now wants to distance themselves from me, they were actually all in the loop.

nicholas fandos

That’s right. It’s a phrase he uses several times.

archived recording (gordon sondland) It was no secret. Everyone’s in the loop. Everyone was in the loop.

nicholas fandos

In the loop.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Again —

nicholas fandos

In the loop.

archived recording (gordon sondland) — everyone was in the loop.

nicholas fandos

They were in the loop.

archived recording (gordon sondland) There was a September 1 meeting with President Zelensky in Warsaw. During the actual meeting, President Zelensky raised the issue of security assistance directly with Vice President Pence. And the vice president said that he would speak to President Trump about it.

michael barbaro

And, Nick, what’s the significance of what he’s saying here? I mean, in theory, this is very explosive. The vice president, the secretary of state are being, in Sondland’s testimony, directly drawn into this.

nicholas fandos

Right, he’s trying to make the point that this wasn’t just me. Like, everyone understood this to be Trump’s objective out of this relationship, and we were all working toward that. And nobody found it unusual that I was doing what I was doing.

archived recording (gordon sondland) I sent Secretary Pompeo an email to express my appreciation for his joining a series of meetings in Brussels following the Warsaw trip. I wrote, “Mike, thanks for schlepping to Europe. I think it was really important and the chemistry seems promising. Really appreciate it.” Secretary Pompeo replied the next day, on Wednesday, September 4, quote, “All good. You’re doing great work; keep banging away.”

nicholas fandos

And with that, Sondland completes his opening statement.

archived recording (gordon sondland) It remains an honor to serve the people of the United States as their United States ambassador to the European Union. I look forward to answering the committee’s questions. Thank you.

nicholas fandos

And it’s the Democrat’s turn for 45 minutes to begin asking questions.

archived recording (adam schiff) We will now proceed the first round of questions, as detailed —

nicholas fandos

Of course, Chairman Schiff has a few of his own. But mostly, he passes the mic over to Dan Goldman, who is his chief investigator, who’s been playing a role in these hearings, questioning witnesses directly.

archived recording (adam schiff) Mr. Goldman. archived recording (daniel goldman) Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In your opening statement, Ambassador Sondland, you detailed the benefits that you have gained from obtaining some additional documents over the past few weeks. Is that right? archived recording (gordon sondland) In terms of refreshing my recollection, that’s — archived recording (daniel goldman) Right, because —

nicholas fandos

He doesn’t shy away from what becomes clear over the course of the day is a pretty shoddy memory on the part of Sondland.

archived recording (daniel goldman) You have remembered a lot more than you did when you were deposed. Is that right? archived recording (gordon sondland) That’s correct. archived recording (daniel goldman) And one of the things that —

nicholas fandos

And in doing that, Goldman does something interesting, which is that —

archived recording (daniel goldman) — conversation, Ambassador Taylor also testified, under oath, that you said that President Trump wanted Zelensky in a public box. Do you recall using that expression? archived recording (gordon sondland) Yeah, it goes back —

He repeatedly leans on those witnesses with better memories, or people who took contemporaneous notes.

archived recording (daniel goldman) Do you have any reason to question Ambassador Taylor’s testimony based on his meticulous and careful contemporaneous notes? archived recording (gordon sondland) I’m not going to question or not question. I’m just telling you what I believe I was referring to.

nicholas fandos

To describe things that Sondland told them or describe things that Sondland did, and basically asked Sondland to confirm that these things happened —

archived recording (daniel goldman) Let me fast forward a week and show you another text exchange, which may help refresh your recollection. On September 8, you sent a text to Ambassador Taylor and Ambassador Volker. Can you read what you wrote there?

nicholas fandos

— to basically bring Sondland up into line with testimony that they’ve gotten from other people about him.

archived recording (daniel goldman) So you do acknowledge you spoke to President Trump, as you indicated in that text, right? archived recording (gordon sondland) If I said I did, I did.

nicholas fandos

And that’s important as they move towards writing a report and presenting a kind of full case about what happened to the American people. It helps eliminate some of the discrepancies in the testimony they’ve gotten.

michael barbaro

Which of these exchanges stood out to you?

nicholas fandos

Well, one in particular is fresh in my mind, because we just learned about it for the first time last week.

archived recording (daniel goldman) And one of the things that you now remember is the discussion that you had with President Trump on July 26 in that restaurant in Kyiv, right?

nicholas fandos

Now remember, that’s the day after Trump himself spoke to Zelensky and told him that I want these investigations into the Bidens in 2016. Other witnesses have described Sondland basically speaking on the phone with the president, who was speaking so loud that he had to hold the phone away from his ear.

archived recording (gordon sondland) He claims to have overheard part of the conversation, and I’m not going to dispute what he did or didn’t hear.

nicholas fandos

Others could overhear President Trump asking about, quote, unquote, “the investigation,” and Sondland assured him, you know, don’t worry, with some expletive laid in, President Zelensky will do whatever we want.

michael barbaro

Right, because Ukraine loves your tush.

nicholas fandos

Something like that.

archived recording (daniel goldman) Well, he also testified that President Zelensky, quote, “loves your ass,” unquote. Do you recall saying that? archived recording (gordon sondland) Yeah, it sounds like something I would say. [LAUGHTER]

nicholas fandos

And what he basically does over the course of this back-and-forth is says —

archived recording (gordon sondland) Putting it in Trump-speak, by saying he loves your ass, he’ll do whatever you want, meant that he would really work with us on a whole host of issues.

nicholas fandos

— you’ve heard the president talk.

archived recording (gordon sondland) That’s how President Trump and I communicate, a lot of four-letter words. In this case, three-letter.

nicholas fandos

He also contests a couple of small points.

archived recording (gordon sondland) I don’t think I would have said that. I would have — I would have —

nicholas fandos

But in the end, he confirms the essence of the story as it’s been related by other witnesses, and for the first time, kind of established that that happened.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Again, trying to reconstruct a very busy day without the benefit, but if someone said I had a meeting, and I went to the meeting, then I’m not going to dispute that.

michael barbaro

So it’s kind of that familiar mix of Sondland’s self-protection, lack of recall, but overall, damning testimony.

nicholas fandos

I think that’s right.

archived recording (daniel goldman) Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

nicholas fandos

So the Democrats wrap up their questioning.

archived recording (adam schiff) That concludes our 45 minutes —

nicholas fandos

And after weeks of investigation, literally hundreds of hours of testimony, in private and in public, they’ve finally gotten, from a lead witness who had direct access to the president, a statement, an admission, of one of the things that they’ve been looking for and trying to prove out all along, that this White House meeting, an official act, was conditioned upon Ukraine publicly announcing investigations. And that Sondland, a top official, also believed that the withheld aid money — that that would only flow, too, if the investigations were announced. And so it’s with that in front of them —

archived recording (adam schiff) Why don’t we take a 5- or 10-minute break? archived recording (gordon sondland) Thank you.

nicholas fandos

That Schiff abruptly gavels the hearing into a pause, somewhat inexplicably at first. And then we quickly see why as he walks out behind the chamber —

archived recording (adam schiff) Just want to make a couple of quick observations while we’re on a break here.

nicholas fandos

— to a bank of cameras, where he begins to talk about what just took place.

archived recording (adam schiff) And what we have just heard from Ambassador Sondland is that the knowledge of this scheme was a basic quid pro quo. It was the conditioning —

nicholas fandos

Which all, of course, carried it live in the middle of the proceedings. And when he was done —

archived recording (adam schiff) So I think a very important moment in the history of this inquiry.

nicholas fandos

— he wrapped up and walked right back into the hearing room and gaveled the thing back into session.

archived recording (adam schiff) Come to order.

nicholas fandos

Now, it wasn’t lost on Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the committee, who quickly called Schiff out.

archived recording (devin nunes) Thank the gentleman. For those of you watching at home, that was not a bathroom break. That was actually a chance for the Democrats to go out and hold a press conference, Ambassador, for all the supposed bombshells that were in your opening testimony.

nicholas fandos

So there’s quite a bit of bad blood, obviously, between the two sides. But I don’t think that this helped.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So once we’re back, given that the Democrats have already sort of embraced the messiness and unreliability of Gordon Sondland and addressed it pretty directly, what is the Republican strategy when it’s their turn to question?

nicholas fandos

Well, Republicans are looking at the same guy and the same tendencies, and they see an amazing opportunity to weaponize it in defense of the president.

archived recording (steve castor) Hello again, Ambassador. archived recording (gordon sondland) Hi.

nicholas fandos

So it’s left to Steve Castor, who’s the Republicans’ lawyer in all of this, to start trying to do that work.

archived recording (steve castor) I just want to go through some distinctions between your opener and your deposition.

nicholas fandos

There’s a phone call that Sondland has where he says that he was getting such mixed signals and couldn’t get answers about what Trump wanted from Ukraine and why he was withholding the aid money.

archived recording (gordon sondland) And I was getting tired of going around in circles, frankly. So I made the call —

nicholas fandos

And he asked President Trump, just kind of point blank —

archived recording (gordon sondland) — what do you want from Ukraine? And that’s when I got the answer. archived recording (steve castor) And he was unequivocal, nothing.

nicholas fandos

The president tells him, I don’t want a quid pro quo. I don’t want anything from Ukraine. They should just do what’s right. They should do what Zelensky said he was going to do. And Republicans kept going back to this call again and again and again.

archived recording (john ratcliffe) Tell me if there’s anything sinister or nefarious in any of this, a vanilla request about corruption, a call to say, I’m on my way to Ukraine, a five-minute call you didn’t remember as significant, a call that you made where the president said, I want nothing, I want no quid pro quo, I want Zelensky to do the right thing, I want him to do what he ran on, and him telling you to go tell Congress the truth. Anything sinister and nefarious about any of that? archived recording (gordon sondland) Not the way you present it. archived recording (john ratcliffe) O.K., and that is the truth.

nicholas fandos

Because in this case, as they pointed out, you know, when the president is speaking directly to Sondland, he’s saying, no quid pro quo. I don’t want anything in particular from the Ukrainians.

archived recording (jim jordan) And you told Mr. Castor that the president never told you that the announcement had to happen to get anything. In fact, he didn’t just not tell you that, he explicitly said the opposite.

michael barbaro

So the most senior figure, and the most involved figure in all this from the Trump administration, who declares that this was a quid pro quo, is simultaneously testifying that the president gets on the phone with him and says, this is no quid pro quo. That is complicated.

nicholas fandos

It is. It’s very complicated. And if you’re listening at home and listening to Republican questioning, they’re able, I think, to raise some doubts about this account that he’s giving.

archived recording (michael turner) And if you pull up CNN today, right now, their banner says, “Sondland ties Trump to withholding aid.” Is that your testimony today, Ambassador Sondland, that you have evidence that Donald Trump tied the investigation to the aide? Because I don’t think you’re saying that.

nicholas fandos

And in this questioning, you know, Sondland says, I didn’t hear anything directly.

archived recording (gordon sondland) I’ve said repeatedly, Congressman, I was presuming. I also said that President Trump — archived recording (michael turner) So no one told you, not just the president. Giuliani didn’t tell you. Mulvaney didn’t tell you. Nobody — Pompeo didn’t tell you — nobody else on this planet told you that Donald Trump was tying aid to these investigations. Is that correct? archived recording (gordon sondland) I think I already testified to that. archived recording (michael turner) No, answer the question, yes or no. archived recording (gordon sondland) Yes.

michael barbaro

Nick, why do you think that they are so focused on that, what the president told him versus what he has concluded from all the information and conversations around him?

nicholas fandos

Republicans’ argument is basically that, if you’re going to impeach the president, you know, we need to know directly what his intentions were. What he told you, that’s evidence. That’s primary evidence. What you concluded, I mean, that’s no better than what we’ve heard from other witnesses. It’s hearsay.

archived recording (michael turner) I mean, that’s what I don’t understand. So, you know what hearsay evidence is, Ambassador? Hearsay is when I testify what someone else told me. You know what made-up testimony is? Made-up testimony is when I just presume it. I mean, you’re just assuming all of these things, and then you’re giving them the evidence — that they’re running out and doing press conferences, and CNN’s headline is saying that you’re saying the president of the United States should be impeached because he tied aid to investigations. And you don’t know that. Correct? archived recording (gordon sondland) I never said the president of the United States should be impeached. archived recording (michael turner) Nope, but you did —

nicholas fandos

So as this hearing starts to wind down after five or six hours of this back-and-forth, after a pretty explosive and direct opening statement and then cross-examination and examination and more cross-examination, spirits are starting to flag a little bit in the hearing room.

archived recording (adam schiff) Mr. Maloney. archived recording (sean patrick maloney) Mr. Ambassador, let’s pick up right there.

nicholas fandos

There’s an exchange near the end with Sean Patrick Maloney, a Democrat of New York.

archived recording (sean patrick maloney) Let me ask you something. Who would have benefited from an investigation of the president’s political opponents? archived recording (gordon sondland) I don’t want to characterize who would have and who would not have. archived recording (sean patrick maloney) I know you don’t want to, sir. That’s my question. Would you answer it for me?

nicholas fandos

And Maloney, you know, seeming to kind of burst forth with Democratic frustration that’s been boiling beneath the surface all day, basically says —

archived recording (sean patrick maloney) I guess I’m have trouble why you can’t just say — archived recording (gordon sondland) When he asked about investigations, I assumed he meant — archived recording (sean patrick maloney) I know what you assumed. But who would benefit from an investigation of the Bidens? archived recording (gordon sondland) I assume President Trump would benefit. archived recording (sean patrick maloney) There we have it. See? [APPLAUSE] Didn’t hurt a bit, did it? But let me ask you something — archived recording (gordon sondland) Mr. Maloney? archived recording (sean patrick maloney) Hold on, sir. archived recording (gordon sondland) Excuse me. I’ve been very forthright, and I really resent what you’re trying to do. archived recording (sean patrick maloney) Fair enough. You’ve been very forthright. This your third try to do so, sir. Didn’t work so well the first time, did it? And now we’re here a third time, and we got a doozy of a statement from you this morning. There’s a whole bunch of stuff you don’t recall. So all due respect, sir, we appreciate your candor. But let’s be really clear on what it took to get it out of you.

nicholas fandos

And that’s kind of the tone as this hearing begins to come to an end. Democrats are frustrated about some things. Republicans are frustrated about some things. Sondland, who’s trying to catch a flight back to Brussels, is certainly frustrated by some things. And we’ve had a pretty complex and conflicting day of testimony, where some people seem to be coming away quite happy, but not perfectly so.

michael barbaro

So is this unreliable witness turning out to be the most important witness in this inquiry? Or is he just an unreliable witness?

nicholas fandos

Well, the thing about Sondland is, the Democrats will tell you, prosecutors successfully bring cases all the time on highly flawed witnesses who maybe don’t even have a great history with the truth. But that doesn’t mean that what they’re saying isn’t true in a given scenario. And in this case, it’s important to remember, what he’s saying is incredibly, politically inconvenient for him. He still works for the president of the United States, who he donated a bunch of money to and whose policies he believes in. That itself lends it some power and credibility. Democrats seem to be emerging from today more comfortable and more certain that they need to bring forward this case of the president abusing his office, of committing high crimes and misdemeanors worthy of impeachment and putting it before the American people.

michael barbaro

Thank you, Nick.

nicholas fandos

Thanks for having me, Michael.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) How did Ambassador Sondland get there? You know, this is not a man who had any qualifications except one. He wrote a check for a million dollars.

michael barbaro

In the fifth Democratic presidential debate, candidates expressed outrage over Wednesday’s testimony in the impeachment inquiry, with Senator Elizabeth Warren accusing President Trump of selling off key ambassadorships to wealthy donors like Gordon Sondland.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) And that tells us about what’s happening in Washington.

michael barbaro

But with Mayor Pete Buttigieg now leading the polls in Iowa, the first state to pick a Democratic nominee, several of his rivals, including Senator Amy Klobuchar, sought to challenge his credentials and experience.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) Just like I have won statewide, and Mayor, I have all appreciation for your good work as a local official, and you did not when you tried, I also have actually done this work. I think experience should matter.

michael barbaro

Buttigieg fired back, suggesting that the federal experience of his opponent was its own liability.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) So first of all, Washington experience is not the only experience that matters. There’s more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage. And where are we right now as a country? [CHEERING]

I found the July 25th phone call unusual because in contrast to other presidential calls I had observed, It involved discussion of what appeared to be a domestic political matter.” “Dad, I’m sitting here today in the U.S. Capitol talking to our elected professionals — talking to our elected professionals, is proof that you made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet Union and come here to the United States of America in search of a better life for our family. Do not worry. I will be fine for telling the truth. It was improper for the president to request an — to demand an investigation into a political opponent, especially a foreign power where there is at best dubious belief that this would be a completely impartial investigation.” “What is it about the relationship between the president of the United States and the president of Ukraine that leads you to conclude that when the president of the United States asks a favor like this, it’s really a demand?” “Chairman, the culture I come from, the military culture, when a senior asks you to do something, even if it’s polite and pleasant, it’s not — it’s not to be taken as a request. It’s to be taken as an order. In this case, the power disparity between the two leaders — my impression is that in order to get the White House meeting, President Zelensky would have to deliver these investigations.” “In no way shape, or form in either readouts from the United States or Ukraine did you receive any indication whatsoever or anything that resembled a quid pro quo — is that correct?” “That’s correct.” “And the same would go for this new allegation of bribery?” “I’ve only seen an allegation of bribery in the last week.” “It’s the same common set of facts — it’s just instead of quid pro quo, now it’s bribery.” “I was never involved in anything that I considered to be bribery at all.” “O.K. Or extortion?” “Or extortion.” “O.K.” “Ambassador Volker thinks it’s inappropriate to ask a foreign head of state to investigate a U.S. person, let alone a political rival. But you’ve said you had no concern with that. Do you think that’s appropriate?” “As a hypothetical matter, I do not.” “Well I’m not talking about a hypothetical matter. Read the transcript — in that transcript, does the president not ask Zelensky to look into the Bidens?” “Mr. Chairman, I can only tell you what I was thinking at the time. That is not what I understood the president to be doing.” “But nonetheless, this was the first and only time where you went from listening to a presidential call directly to the national security lawyer, is it not?” “Yes, that’s correct.” “Ms. Williams, on Sunday the president personally targeted you in a tweet. This is after he targeted Ambassador Yovanovitch during her hearing testimony. I’d like to show and read you the tweet. It reads: ‘Tell Jennifer Williams, whoever that is, to read both transcripts of the presidential calls and see the just-released statement from Ukraine. Then she should meet with the other Never Trumpers, who I don’t know and mostly never even heard of, and work out a better presidential attack.’ Did that tweet make an impression on you when you read it?” “It certainly surprised me. I was not expecting to be called out by name.” “Lt. Col. Vindman, did you discuss the July 25 phone call with anyone outside the White House on July 25 or the 26? And if so, with whom?” “Yes, I did.

Vindman, you testified in the deposition that you did not know who the whistle-blower was or is.” “I do not know who the whistle-blower is. That is correct.” “So how is it possible for you to name these people and then out the whistle-blower?” “Per the advice of my counsel, I’ve been advised not to answer specific questions about members of the intelligence community.” “You’re here to answer questions and you’re here under subpoena. So you can either answer the question or you can plead the Fifth.” “Excuse me. On behalf of my client, we are following the rule of the committee, the rule of the chair with regard to this issue. And this does not call for an answer that is invoking the Fifth or any theoretical issue like that.

So to understand how it’s going to play out, the past is really our best guide. “I think we’re just all in for a really crazy ride.” Collectively, these New York Times reporters have covered U.S. politics for over 150 years. “I’m also a drummer in a band, so …” They’ve reported on past impeachment inquiries. “Yea, I’m lost in Senate wonderland.” And they say that the three we’ve had so far have been full of twists and turns. “The president of the United States is not guilty as charged.” In short, expect the unexpected. First, the process. Impeachment is technically only the initial stage. “Common misconceptions about impeachment are that impeachment by itself means removal from office. It doesn’t. The impeachment part of the process is only the indictment that sets up a trial.” The Constitution describes offenses that are grounds for removing the president from office as bribery, treason and — “They say high crimes and misdemeanors, which, really, is in the eye of the beholder.” “The framers didn’t give us a guidebook to it. They simply said, that the House had the responsibility for impeachment and the Senate had the responsibility for the trial.” One of the things missing from the Constitution? How an impeachment inquiry should start. And that has generally been a source of drama. Basically, anything goes. “In fact, in the Andrew Johnson case they voted to impeach him without even having drafted the articles of impeachment.” For Richard Nixon, his case started with several investigations that led to public hearings. That part of the process went on for two years, and yielded revelation after revelation, connecting Nixon to a politically-motivated burglary at D.N.C. headquarters — “… located in the Watergate office building.” — and its subsequent cover-up. “Mr. Butterfield, are you aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the president?” “I was aware of listening devices. Yes, sir.” “This was a shocker. Everybody in the White House recognized how damaging this could be.” As the House drafted articles of impeachment, Nixon lost the support of his party. “O.K., I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.” “I was asked to write the farewell piece that ran the morning after Nixon resigned. And this is what I wrote: The central question is how a man who won so much could have lost so much.” So for Nixon, it more or less ended after the investigations. But for Bill Clinton, that phase was just the beginning. “This is the information.” An independent counsel’s investigation into his business dealings unexpectedly turned into a very public inquiry about his personal life. “The idea that a president of the United States was having an affair with a White House intern and then a federal prosecutor was looking at that, it was just extraordinary.” That investigation led to public hearings in the House Judiciary Committee. “When the Starr Report was being delivered to Congress it was a little bit like the O.J. chase, only a political one. There were two black cars. They were being filmed live on CNN. They were heading towards the Capitol. We were watching it and a little bit agog.” Public opinion is key. And the media plays a huge part in the process. This was definitely true for Clinton. “You know it was just a crazy time. We worked in the Senate press gallery.” “All your colleagues are kind of piled on top of each other.” “We had crummy computers, the fax machine would always break. The printer would always break.” After committee hearings, the House brought formal impeachment charges. “It was very tense. I thought that the Saturday of the impeachment vote in the House was one of the most tense days I’d experienced in Washington.” And it turned out, also, full of surprises. “The day of impeachment arrived, everyone’s making very impassioned speeches about whether Bill Clinton should or should not be impeached and Livingston rises to give an argument for the House Republicans. He started to talk about how Clinton could resign.” “You, sir, may resign your post.” “And all of a sudden people start booing and saying, ‘Resign, resign’!” “So I must set the example.” “He announced he was resigning because he had had extramarital affairs and challenged President Clinton to do the only honorable thing, in his view —” “I hope President Clinton will follow.” “— to resign as well, so there was all this drama unfolding even in the midst of impeachment.” Then it went to the Senate for trial. The Constitution gets a little more specific about this part. “The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is supposed to preside over that trial.” “Rehnquist, he showed up in this robe he had made for himself, which had gold stripes on the sleeves because he liked Gilbert and Sullivan.” “The Senate is the actual jury.” “You will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws. So help you, God.” “This is a copy of the rules of the Senate for handling impeachment. They’re actually very specific.” “Meet six days a week.” “Convene at noon. The senators have to sit at their desks and remain quiet in their role as jurors. And not talk, which trust me, is going to be a problem for some of the senators who are used to talking all the time.” It’s just like a courtroom trial. There are prosecutors who present the case against the president. “That was perjury.” Only, they’re members of the House, and they’re called managers. Then the senators, or the jurors, vote. And things are still, unpredictable. “The options are guilty or not guilty. But there was one senator —” “Arlen Specter, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania.” “Under Scottish law, there are three possible verdicts: guilty, not guilty and not proved.” “— which is not a thing.” “And everybody just looks, you know, how do you even record that vote?” In the end, there were not enough votes to oust Clinton. “What’s amazing about this whole thing to me wasn’t so much the constitutional process. It was that it felt to me like the beginning of really intense partisanship, the weaponization of partisanship.” And here’s the thing: An impeachment charge has never gotten the two-thirds majority it needs in the Senate to actually oust a president from office. “So you could end up having a situation where the president is impeached, acquitted and runs for re-election and wins re-election.” And that would be a first. “This is my ticket to the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. I don’t think you’ll find these on StubHub.”"

His account clashes directly with Mr. Sondland’s statement that he recalled “no discussions with any State Department or White House official about former Vice President Biden or his son.” He also said he did not recall participating “in any effort to encourage an investigation into the Bidens.”

Even if Mr. Sondland is now a damaged witness, he remains an important one. So far, he is the only one cooperating with the inquiry who dealt directly with Mr. Trump on Ukraine. Another witness, Kurt D. Volker, the special envoy to Ukraine, participated in an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump early on, but took a back seat to Mr. Sondland after that.

For Mr. Sondland, a bald, blustery 62-year-old, the inquiry has upended his work.

He used to boast to others that he could ring the president directly, complaining to one national security official that he was harder to reach than Mr. Trump. He told another colleague that Mr. Trump was often in a bad mood in the early morning. And Mr. Sondland became impatient when White House operators failed to promptly connect him to the Oval Office. Now his every exchange with the president is under scrutiny.

Mr. Sondland once described himself as a “results-oriented,” take-charge type. Now investigators are asking him why he pushed a so-called deliverable for the president — an announcement of the investigations — that other officials have said was ethically wrong and ran counter to American national security interests.

Mr. Sondland also liked to present himself as a refreshing alternative to hidebound bureaucrats. Now some of those same bureaucrats have described him as an aggressive operator who elbowed them out of the way, rejected time-honored protocols and turned his personal cellphone into a national security risk.

As national security adviser, John R. Bolton “was frustrated with Ambassador Sondland’s involvement in these issues — frankly in a lot of issues,” Timothy Morrison, a onetime top deputy to Mr. Bolton, testified. Although his concerns were widely shared, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo failed to rein in Mr. Sondland, Mr. Morrison said.

Fiona Hill, Mr. Morrison’s predecessor, told investigators that “all kinds” of foreign officials were “appearing at the gates of the White House, calling on our personal phones” and demanding meetings that Mr. Sondland had unilaterally promised to them."

(One friend said Mr. Obama had brushed off debate criticisms, joking that the eventual winner will “come back to me when they need me.”)

Mr. Obama was initially reluctant to attack Mr. Trump after he left the Oval Office, in part because he wanted to embrace the informal practice adopted by his predecessor, George W. Bush, of not attacking a presidential successor, former aides said. But he was also concerned that going after Mr. Trump would play into Republicans’ hands by prompting a backlash, they added.

By the 2018 midterms, Mr. Obama abandoned that reticence and campaigned aggressively against Mr. Trump, emboldened by the president’s halfhearted response to his attacks.

He also offered vague praise for the large-scale health care policy that Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren are now championing. “Democrats aren’t just running on good old ideas like a higher minimum wage, but they’re running on good new ideas like Medicare for all,” he said in a speech at the University of Illinois in September of 2018.

The big difference now is Mr. Obama’s willingness to publicly criticize others in his party, however indirectly, something he had avoided.

Katie Hill, a spokeswoman for Mr. Obama, said that he was not targeting Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren in his remarks last week, and that his public declarations in support of the Democratic field and a diversity of opinions are the core of his message.

“Since leaving office, President Obama has worked to stay out of the political fray in part to let other, new voices in the Democratic Party rise up,” Ms. Hill said on Wednesday. “Just like in 2018, he’ll be out on the campaign trail next fall working hard for whoever our nominee is.”"

Republicans and Democrats both believe Mr. Volker has something important to say.

Democrats are eager to have him testify because of text messages between him, Mr. Giuliani and another of the amigos, Gordon D. Sondland, Mr. Trump’s ambassador to the European Union. The messages reveal that Mr. Trump was trying to pressure President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to investigate a discredited theory about Ukraine’s involvement in the 2016 elections, as well as former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter, by dangling two things Mr. Zelensky coveted: a White House meeting with Mr. Trump, and $391 million in military aid that Congress had approved for Ukraine, but which the president was refusing to release.

(Mr. Sondland will testify Wednesday; the third amigo, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, is not on the list of witnesses.)

“Heard from White House — assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / ‘get to the bottom of what happened’ in 2016, we will nail down date for a visit to Washington,” Mr. Volker wrote to a top aide to Mr. Zelensky on July 25, the same day that the two presidents spoke by phone in a conversation that is now central to the inquiry.

But Republicans believe Mr. Volker can help exonerate Mr. Trump, because during his closed-door testimony he said that he was not aware of any quid pro quo that tied the investigations Mr. Trump sought to military aid. Mr. Volker plans to testify that he was out of the loop at key moments during the events in question."

Cooper was one of multiple Pentagon officials who warned the White House that freezing congressionally approved aid to Ukraine could violate the law.

Ms. Cooper, as well as other officials, repeatedly voiced concern that withholding the aid for a sustained period of time could run afoul of the Impoundment Control Act, which prevents the president from unilaterally deciding against spending money allocated by lawmakers. She also personally fielded two separate phone calls from alarmed Ukrainian diplomats quietly seeking information about the delay.

The security assistance to Ukraine — a total of nearly $400 million — and the timing of its delay is at the heart of the impeachment investigation into whether President Trump abused the power of his office to enlist a foreign government for help in an election. When she testifies Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee, Ms. Cooper, a career Defense Department official, is expected to provide some insight into efforts to persuade the Trump administration to release the aid.

After a mid-June meeting with Mr. Trump, nearly a month before the aid was frozen, the administration began asking Ms. Cooper detailed questions about the money, she told House investigators last month in a closed-door interview.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Gordon Sondland is a Trump donor turned E.U. ambassador turned witness in the impeachment inquiry, whose testimony has been contradicted on multiple occasions. Today: How both Democrats and Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee choose to handle their most complicated witness to date. It’s Thursday, November 21. So Nick, give us a sense of what it felt like to be in that room this morning as the committee prepared to hear from Gordon Sondland, this very complicated witness.

nicholas fandos

So we knew that in the middle of this jam-packed week of impeachment testimony, Gordon Sondland’s appearance was going to be something different.

michael barbaro

Nick Fandos was in the Capitol for Sondland’s testimony.

nicholas fandos

Sondland has really been described by almost everybody as having been in the middle of this pressure campaign on Ukraine this summer. Now, there was particular anticipation, because Sondland’s story, unlike some other witnesses, has evolved as time has gone on. So when he first came in and spoke in private with investigators in October, he was pretty unclear about whether or not the president was trying to leverage a White House meeting or security aid for Ukraine to get the investigations that he wanted. He told them repeatedly, I can’t remember this, I can’t remember that. Well, after that happened, Sondland submitted a supplement to his testimony in writing that updated that and said, actually, I do think there was a quid pro quo. And so there was a lot of anticipation heading into his testimony as to which Gordon Sondland would show up. What story was he going to tell? Is he going to cop to all these different things? How is he going to treat the president? How’s he going to treat his own evolving story? And it really felt like it could go either way.

michael barbaro

So what happens? How does this much-anticipated hearing begin?

nicholas fandos

So a little after 9:00, Gordon Sondland walks into the same grand hearing room where all the impeachment hearings have been taking place. Chairman Schiff dropped his gavel.

archived recording (adam schiff) Meeting will come to order. [GAVEL BANG]

nicholas fandos

And then, after taking an oath to tell the truth and nothing but the truth —

archived recording (adam schiff) And nothing but the truth, so help you God.

nicholas fandos

— Sondland sits down and begins reading from a pretty thick stack of papers, an opening statement that he’s brought with him. And he starts by saying that —

archived recording (gordon sondland) I have not had access to all of my phone records, State Department emails and many, many other State Department documents.

nicholas fandos

— his job is made more difficult by the fact that he has not been allowed to go back to the State Department and look at notes or records that might be able to fill in his recollections.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Having access would have been very helpful to me in trying to reconstruct with whom I spoke and met and when and what was said.

nicholas fandos

Seems to be a nod at the fact that his story is, in the most generous sense, evolving. And he begins to tell the story about his involvement with Ukraine policy over the last, say, five or six months.

archived recording (gordon sondland) The U.S. delegation developed a very positive view of the Ukraine government.

nicholas fandos

He begins talking about a meeting with President Trump in May in the Oval Office after he attended the inauguration of Ukraine’s new president.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Unfortunately, President Trump was skeptical. In response to our persistent efforts in that meeting to change his views, President Trump directed us to, quote, “talk with Rudy.” We weren’t happy with the president’s directive to talk with Rudy. We did not want to involve Mr. Giuliani.

nicholas fandos

What he then starts to unspool is a set of facts and meetings that we’ve now heard a lot about in the last couple of months.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Simply put, we were playing the hand we were dealt. We all understood that if we refused to work with Mr. Giuliani, we would lose a very important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine. So we followed the president’s orders.

nicholas fandos

How, you know, May became June, became July and then August, and it became clear to him over time that President Trump, through his lawyer Mr. Giuliani and through actions that he took, wanted to extract from the Ukrainians certain politically beneficial investigations. And at one point, pretty early in his statement, he addresses the Latin phrase that has been confusing everyone as this has gone along.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Was there a quid pro quo?

nicholas fandos

Was it a quid pro quo, a this for that, or was it not? And he says —

archived recording (gordon sondland) With regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes.

nicholas fandos

Unequivocally, that as far as I’m concerned, there was a quid pro quo around the White House meeting.

michael barbaro

Right, and I was struck by how casually he says that, this thing that is very much at the center of the entire inquiry.

nicholas fandos

And the thing that has been contested by other witnesses. He states, you know, very authoritatively, without reservation. Now, he’s a little bit more cautious about whether or not there was a quid pro quo around the suspended military assistance.

archived recording (gordon sondland) In July and August of 2019, we learned that the White House had also suspended security aid to Ukraine. I tried diligently to ask why the aid was suspended, but I never received a clear answer. Still haven’t to this day.

nicholas fandos

So he came to conclude by August that that, too, was dependent on Ukraine announcing these investigations that the president wanted.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Committing to the investigations of the 2016 elections and Burisma, as Mr. Giuliani had demanded.

nicholas fandos

Now, Sondland has another clear objective as he’s laying out his story, and that is to defend himself against the testimony from other witnesses who have tried to describe him as either a rogue actor or somebody that was working through an improper diplomatic channel.

archived recording (gordon sondland) I’m not sure how someone could characterize something as an irregular channel when you’re talking to the president of the United States, the secretary of state, the national security adviser, the chief of staff at the White House, the secretary of energy. I don’t know how that’s irregular, if a bunch of —

nicholas fandos

He says, no. This was the real channel. I was working with the president of the United States. I was working with top American diplomats and officials. And not only was it proper, but all of those people knew what I was up to and what we were trying to accomplish as this went along.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Within my State Department emails, there is a July 19 email. This email was sent, this email was sent to Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Perry, Brian McCormack, who was Secretary Perry’s chief of staff at the time —

nicholas fandos

Basically, you know, if for weeks we’ve had witness after witness, and certainly the White House and the Republicans, willing to throw Gordon Sondland under the bus to try and push all of this onto him as a kind of lone wolf, I mean, he was taking everybody under the bus with him.

archived recording (gordon sondland) — Chief of Staff Mulvaney and Mr. Mulvaney’s senior adviser, Rob Blair, a lot of senior officials. These emails show that the leadership of the State Department, the National Security Council and the White House were all informed about the Ukraine efforts.

michael barbaro

Right, he’s saying, everybody who now wants to distance themselves from me, they were actually all in the loop.

nicholas fandos

That’s right. It’s a phrase he uses several times.

archived recording (gordon sondland) It was no secret. Everyone’s in the loop. Everyone was in the loop.

nicholas fandos

In the loop.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Again —

nicholas fandos

In the loop.

archived recording (gordon sondland) — everyone was in the loop.

nicholas fandos

They were in the loop.

archived recording (gordon sondland) There was a September 1 meeting with President Zelensky in Warsaw. During the actual meeting, President Zelensky raised the issue of security assistance directly with Vice President Pence. And the vice president said that he would speak to President Trump about it.

michael barbaro

And, Nick, what’s the significance of what he’s saying here? I mean, in theory, this is very explosive. The vice president, the secretary of state are being, in Sondland’s testimony, directly drawn into this.

nicholas fandos

Right, he’s trying to make the point that this wasn’t just me. Like, everyone understood this to be Trump’s objective out of this relationship, and we were all working toward that. And nobody found it unusual that I was doing what I was doing.

archived recording (gordon sondland) I sent Secretary Pompeo an email to express my appreciation for his joining a series of meetings in Brussels following the Warsaw trip. I wrote, “Mike, thanks for schlepping to Europe. I think it was really important and the chemistry seems promising. Really appreciate it.” Secretary Pompeo replied the next day, on Wednesday, September 4, quote, “All good. You’re doing great work; keep banging away.”

nicholas fandos

And with that, Sondland completes his opening statement.

archived recording (gordon sondland) It remains an honor to serve the people of the United States as their United States ambassador to the European Union. I look forward to answering the committee’s questions. Thank you.

nicholas fandos

And it’s the Democrat’s turn for 45 minutes to begin asking questions.

archived recording (adam schiff) We will now proceed the first round of questions, as detailed —

nicholas fandos

Of course, Chairman Schiff has a few of his own. But mostly, he passes the mic over to Dan Goldman, who is his chief investigator, who’s been playing a role in these hearings, questioning witnesses directly.

archived recording (adam schiff) Mr. Goldman. archived recording (daniel goldman) Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In your opening statement, Ambassador Sondland, you detailed the benefits that you have gained from obtaining some additional documents over the past few weeks. Is that right? archived recording (gordon sondland) In terms of refreshing my recollection, that’s — archived recording (daniel goldman) Right, because —

nicholas fandos

He doesn’t shy away from what becomes clear over the course of the day is a pretty shoddy memory on the part of Sondland.

archived recording (daniel goldman) You have remembered a lot more than you did when you were deposed. Is that right? archived recording (gordon sondland) That’s correct. archived recording (daniel goldman) And one of the things that —

nicholas fandos

And in doing that, Goldman does something interesting, which is that —

archived recording (daniel goldman) — conversation, Ambassador Taylor also testified, under oath, that you said that President Trump wanted Zelensky in a public box. Do you recall using that expression? archived recording (gordon sondland) Yeah, it goes back —

nicholas fandos

He repeatedly leans on those witnesses with better memories, or people who took contemporaneous notes.

archived recording (daniel goldman) Do you have any reason to question Ambassador Taylor’s testimony based on his meticulous and careful contemporaneous notes? archived recording (gordon sondland) I’m not going to question or not question. I’m just telling you what I believe I was referring to.

nicholas fandos

To describe things that Sondland told them or describe things that Sondland did, and basically asked Sondland to confirm that these things happened —

archived recording (daniel goldman) Let me fast forward a week and show you another text exchange, which may help refresh your recollection. On September 8, you sent a text to Ambassador Taylor and Ambassador Volker. Can you read what you wrote there?

nicholas fandos

— to basically bring Sondland up into line with testimony that they’ve gotten from other people about him.

archived recording (daniel goldman) So you do acknowledge you spoke to President Trump, as you indicated in that text, right? archived recording (gordon sondland) If I said I did, I did.

nicholas fandos

And that’s important as they move towards writing a report and presenting a kind of full case about what happened to the American people. It helps eliminate some of the discrepancies in the testimony they’ve gotten.

michael barbaro

Which of these exchanges stood out to you?

nicholas fandos

Well, one in particular is fresh in my mind, because we just learned about it for the first time last week.

archived recording (daniel goldman) And one of the things that you now remember is the discussion that you had with President Trump on July 26 in that restaurant in Kyiv, right?

nicholas fandos

Now remember, that’s the day after Trump himself spoke to Zelensky and told him that I want these investigations into the Bidens in 2016. Other witnesses have described Sondland basically speaking on the phone with the president, who was speaking so loud that he had to hold the phone away from his ear.

archived recording (gordon sondland) He claims to have overheard part of the conversation, and I’m not going to dispute what he did or didn’t hear.

nicholas fandos

Others could overhear President Trump asking about, quote, unquote, “the investigation,” and Sondland assured him, you know, don’t worry, with some expletive laid in, President Zelensky will do whatever we want.

michael barbaro

Right, because Ukraine loves your tush.

nicholas fandos

Something like that.

archived recording (daniel goldman) Well, he also testified that President Zelensky, quote, “loves your ass,” unquote. Do you recall saying that? archived recording (gordon sondland) Yeah, it sounds like something I would say. [LAUGHTER]

nicholas fandos

And what he basically does over the course of this back-and-forth is says —

archived recording (gordon sondland) Putting it in Trump-speak, by saying he loves your ass, he’ll do whatever you want, meant that he would really work with us on a whole host of issues.

nicholas fandos

— you’ve heard the president talk.

archived recording (gordon sondland) That’s how President Trump and I communicate, a lot of four-letter words. In this case, three-letter.

nicholas fandos

He also contests a couple of small points.

archived recording (gordon sondland) I don’t think I would have said that. I would have — I would have —

nicholas fandos

But in the end, he confirms the essence of the story as it’s been related by other witnesses, and for the first time, kind of established that that happened.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Again, trying to reconstruct a very busy day without the benefit, but if someone said I had a meeting, and I went to the meeting, then I’m not going to dispute that.

michael barbaro

So it’s kind of that familiar mix of Sondland’s self-protection, lack of recall, but overall, damning testimony.

nicholas fandos

I think that’s right.

archived recording (daniel goldman) Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

nicholas fandos

So the Democrats wrap up their questioning.

archived recording (adam schiff) That concludes our 45 minutes —

nicholas fandos

And after weeks of investigation, literally hundreds of hours of testimony, in private and in public, they’ve finally gotten, from a lead witness who had direct access to the president, a statement, an admission, of one of the things that they’ve been looking for and trying to prove out all along, that this White House meeting, an official act, was conditioned upon Ukraine publicly announcing investigations. And that Sondland, a top official, also believed that the withheld aid money — that that would only flow, too, if the investigations were announced. And so it’s with that in front of them —

archived recording (adam schiff) Why don’t we take a 5- or 10-minute break? archived recording (gordon sondland) Thank you.

nicholas fandos

That Schiff abruptly gavels the hearing into a pause, somewhat inexplicably at first. And then we quickly see why as he walks out behind the chamber —

archived recording (adam schiff) Just want to make a couple of quick observations while we’re on a break here.

nicholas fandos

— to a bank of cameras, where he begins to talk about what just took place.

archived recording (adam schiff) And what we have just heard from Ambassador Sondland is that the knowledge of this scheme was a basic quid pro quo. It was the conditioning —

nicholas fandos

Which all, of course, carried it live in the middle of the proceedings. And when he was done —

archived recording (adam schiff) So I think a very important moment in the history of this inquiry.

nicholas fandos

— he wrapped up and walked right back into the hearing room and gaveled the thing back into session.

archived recording (adam schiff) Come to order.

nicholas fandos

Now, it wasn’t lost on Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the committee, who quickly called Schiff out.

archived recording (devin nunes) Thank the gentleman. For those of you watching at home, that was not a bathroom break. That was actually a chance for the Democrats to go out and hold a press conference, Ambassador, for all the supposed bombshells that were in your opening testimony.

nicholas fandos

So there’s quite a bit of bad blood, obviously, between the two sides. But I don’t think that this helped.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So once we’re back, given that the Democrats have already sort of embraced the messiness and unreliability of Gordon Sondland and addressed it pretty directly, what is the Republican strategy when it’s their turn to question?

nicholas fandos

Well, Republicans are looking at the same guy and the same tendencies, and they see an amazing opportunity to weaponize it in defense of the president.

archived recording (steve castor) Hello again, Ambassador. archived recording (gordon sondland) Hi.

nicholas fandos

So it’s left to Steve Castor, who’s the Republicans’ lawyer in all of this, to start trying to do that work.

archived recording (steve castor) I just want to go through some distinctions between your opener and your deposition.

nicholas fandos

There’s a phone call that Sondland has where he says that he was getting such mixed signals and couldn’t get answers about what Trump wanted from Ukraine and why he was withholding the aid money.

archived recording (gordon sondland) And I was getting tired of going around in circles, frankly. So I made the call —

nicholas fandos

And he asked President Trump, just kind of point blank —

archived recording (gordon sondland) — what do you want from Ukraine? And that’s when I got the answer. archived recording (steve castor) And he was unequivocal, nothing.

nicholas fandos

The president tells him, I don’t want a quid pro quo. I don’t want anything from Ukraine. They should just do what’s right. They should do what Zelensky said he was going to do. And Republicans kept going back to this call again and again and again.

archived recording (john ratcliffe) Tell me if there’s anything sinister or nefarious in any of this, a vanilla request about corruption, a call to say, I’m on my way to Ukraine, a five-minute call you didn’t remember as significant, a call that you made where the president said, I want nothing, I want no quid pro quo, I want Zelensky to do the right thing, I want him to do what he ran on, and him telling you to go tell Congress the truth. Anything sinister and nefarious about any of that? archived recording (gordon sondland) Not the way you present it. archived recording (john ratcliffe) O.K., and that is the truth.

nicholas fandos

Because in this case, as they pointed out, you know, when the president is speaking directly to Sondland, he’s saying, no quid pro quo. I don’t want anything in particular from the Ukrainians.

archived recording (jim jordan) And you told Mr. Castor that the president never told you that the announcement had to happen to get anything. In fact, he didn’t just not tell you that, he explicitly said the opposite.

michael barbaro

So the most senior figure, and the most involved figure in all this from the Trump administration, who declares that this was a quid pro quo, is simultaneously testifying that the president gets on the phone with him and says, this is no quid pro quo. That is complicated.

nicholas fandos

It is. It’s very complicated. And if you’re listening at home and listening to Republican questioning, they’re able, I think, to raise some doubts about this account that he’s giving.

archived recording (michael turner) And if you pull up CNN today, right now, their banner says, “Sondland ties Trump to withholding aid.” Is that your testimony today, Ambassador Sondland, that you have evidence that Donald Trump tied the investigation to the aide? Because I don’t think you’re saying that.

nicholas fandos

And in this questioning, you know, Sondland says, I didn’t hear anything directly.

archived recording (gordon sondland) I’ve said repeatedly, Congressman, I was presuming. I also said that President Trump — archived recording (michael turner) So no one told you, not just the president. Giuliani didn’t tell you. Mulvaney didn’t tell you. Nobody — Pompeo didn’t tell you — nobody else on this planet told you that Donald Trump was tying aid to these investigations. Is that correct? archived recording (gordon sondland) I think I already testified to that. archived recording (michael turner) No, answer the question, yes or no. archived recording (gordon sondland) Yes.

michael barbaro

Nick, why do you think that they are so focused on that, what the president told him versus what he has concluded from all the information and conversations around him?

nicholas fandos

Republicans’ argument is basically that, if you’re going to impeach the president, you know, we need to know directly what his intentions were. What he told you, that’s evidence. That’s primary evidence. What you concluded, I mean, that’s no better than what we’ve heard from other witnesses. It’s hearsay.

archived recording (michael turner) I mean, that’s what I don’t understand. So, you know what hearsay evidence is, Ambassador? Hearsay is when I testify what someone else told me. You know what made-up testimony is? Made-up testimony is when I just presume it. I mean, you’re just assuming all of these things, and then you’re giving them the evidence — that they’re running out and doing press conferences, and CNN’s headline is saying that you’re saying the president of the United States should be impeached because he tied aid to investigations. And you don’t know that. Correct? archived recording (gordon sondland) I never said the president of the United States should be impeached. archived recording (michael turner) Nope, but you did —

nicholas fandos

So as this hearing starts to wind down after five or six hours of this back-and-forth, after a pretty explosive and direct opening statement and then cross-examination and examination and more cross-examination, spirits are starting to flag a little bit in the hearing room.

archived recording (adam schiff) Mr. Maloney. archived recording (sean patrick maloney) Mr. Ambassador, let’s pick up right there.

nicholas fandos

There’s an exchange near the end with Sean Patrick Maloney, a Democrat of New York.

archived recording (sean patrick maloney) Let me ask you something. Who would have benefited from an investigation of the president’s political opponents? archived recording (gordon sondland) I don’t want to characterize who would have and who would not have. archived recording (sean patrick maloney) I know you don’t want to, sir. That’s my question. Would you answer it for me?

nicholas fandos

And Maloney, you know, seeming to kind of burst forth with Democratic frustration that’s been boiling beneath the surface all day, basically says —

archived recording (sean patrick maloney) I guess I’m have trouble why you can’t just say — archived recording (gordon sondland) When he asked about investigations, I assumed he meant — archived recording (sean patrick maloney) I know what you assumed. But who would benefit from an investigation of the Bidens? archived recording (gordon sondland) I assume President Trump would benefit. archived recording (sean patrick maloney) There we have it. See? [APPLAUSE] Didn’t hurt a bit, did it? But let me ask you something — archived recording (gordon sondland) Mr. Maloney? archived recording (sean patrick maloney) Hold on, sir. archived recording (gordon sondland) Excuse me. I’ve been very forthright, and I really resent what you’re trying to do. archived recording (sean patrick maloney) Fair enough. You’ve been very forthright. This your third try to do so, sir. Didn’t work so well the first time, did it? And now we’re here a third time, and we got a doozy of a statement from you this morning. There’s a whole bunch of stuff you don’t recall. So all due respect, sir, we appreciate your candor. But let’s be really clear on what it took to get it out of you.

nicholas fandos

And that’s kind of the tone as this hearing begins to come to an end. Democrats are frustrated about some things. Republicans are frustrated about some things. Sondland, who’s trying to catch a flight back to Brussels, is certainly frustrated by some things. And we’ve had a pretty complex and conflicting day of testimony, where some people seem to be coming away quite happy, but not perfectly so.

michael barbaro

So is this unreliable witness turning out to be the most important witness in this inquiry? Or is he just an unreliable witness?

nicholas fandos

Well, the thing about Sondland is, the Democrats will tell you, prosecutors successfully bring cases all the time on highly flawed witnesses who maybe don’t even have a great history with the truth. But that doesn’t mean that what they’re saying isn’t true in a given scenario. And in this case, it’s important to remember, what he’s saying is incredibly, politically inconvenient for him. He still works for the president of the United States, who he donated a bunch of money to and whose policies he believes in. That itself lends it some power and credibility. Democrats seem to be emerging from today more comfortable and more certain that they need to bring forward this case of the president abusing his office, of committing high crimes and misdemeanors worthy of impeachment and putting it before the American people.

Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, also testified that when Mr. Zelensky is shown to have referred to “the company you mentioned,” he actually said “Burisma.” Colonel Vindman said his attempt to correct the record of the call to include the company’s name, and to reflect that Mr. Trump said that he had recordings of Mr. Biden, failed.

On Tuesday, Ms. Williams is scheduled to testify in public, becoming the latest in a series of diplomats to express their concerns about the call.

Over the weekend, Mr. Trump lashed out at Ms. Williams — “whoever that is,” he tweeted — saying that she should read the transcripts of the July 25 call and another one between the two leaders that took place in April. “Then she should meet with the other Never Trumpers, who I don’t know & mostly never even heard of, & work out a better presidential attack!” Mr. Trump wrote. A spokeswoman for Mr. Pence said merely, “Jennifer is a State Department employee.”

A White House official said some were not surprised by Mr. Trump’s attack on Ms. Williams, whom the official described as an innocent bystander in the impeachment mess, and expressed disappointment that senior staff on Mr. Pence’s team did nothing to defend her. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment. The person said it reflected poorly on the vice president that he was apparently unable to protect Ms. Williams from being publicly disparaged by the president.

Ms. Williams joined the Foreign Service in 2006 after spending a year as a political appointee working for Michael Chertoff, the secretary of homeland security, in George W. Bush’s administration. In addition to serving in Jamaica under Mr. Bush and in Beirut, Lebanon, under President Barack Obama, Ms. Williams spent about three years working for the State Department on the humanitarian crisis involving refugees in Syria. Six months before Mr. Trump became president, Ms. Williams was transferred to London to work as the deputy spokeswoman at the embassy there."

As Brent Staples, a member of the Times editorial board has written, the history of the federal ban on marijuana possession is rooted in racist prejudices about African-Americans and Mexicans. The burden of the ban’s enforcement, especially since the advent of the war on drugs in the 1970s, has in turn disproportionately fallen on people of color: While whites and blacks use marijuana at roughly equal rates, blacks are 3.7 times as likely to get arrested for possessing it. “The costs of this national obsession, in both money and time, are astonishing,” writes Jesse Wegman, a member of the Times editorial board.

Repaying those costs requires tackling two main challenges.

Criminal justice

In 2018, over 663,000 people were arrested on charges involving marijuana. What happens to them if it’s legalized? As Mr. Wegman writes, marijuana convictions “can have lifelong consequences for employment, education, immigration status and family life,” even when prison time isn’t part of the sentence.

That’s why the Los Angeles Times editorial board came out in favor of retroactively expunging or resentencing marijuana-related convictions. They wrote:

Marijuana is now legal under California law, but hundreds of thousands of Californians have criminal records for possessing or selling the drug when it was still banned. Those records can make it harder for people to get a job, obtain a loan, go to college, rent an apartment or otherwise become productive members of their community — even if their marijuana arrest happened decades ago. … It’s cruel to allow people to continue to suffer the penalties of a conviction for marijuana-related acts that the state no longer considers a crime.

What’s clear is that racial disparities in the criminal justice system won’t disappear on their own: After Colorado legalized marijuana, arrests went down for white kids, but shot up for black and Latino kids.

[Related: The war on drugs, explained]

Economic justice

As legalization moves forward in the states, most of the new market opportunities in the cannabis industry are being captured by white people: According to a survey by Marijuana Business Daily, only 19 percent of cannabis businesses in 2017 had minority founders or owners (African-Americans accounted for just over 4 percent).

Summing up the historical irony, Michelle Alexander, author of “The New Jim Crow,” said in 2014, “40 years of impoverished black kids getting prison time for selling weed, and their families and futures destroyed,” and “now, white men are planning to get rich doing precisely the same thing?”"

Mr. Biden potentially stood to gain something himself from the prosecutor’s firing, though Ukrainian officials say no Burisma case was active at the time Mr. Biden called for Mr. Shokin’s firing.

Republicans, including President Trump, see corruption in the Biden family’s mix of business and politics in Ukraine. But in May this year, the last prosecutor general to serve under President Poroshenko, Yuriy Lutsenko, declared that Hunter Biden had violated no Ukrainian laws. That might have been the end of the matter, except that Mr. Poroshenko’s presidency came to an end that same month. He had been defeated by a challenger, Volodymyr Zelensky, who had painted the incumbent as corrupt.

So what can be proved about the motives of an American president who tries to get Ukraine’s new leader to look into Burisma, the Bidens and Mr. Shokin’s dismissal? Democrats are in the habit of assuming Mr. Trump’s guilt. They assumed he was Vladimir Putin’s puppet, and many still do so even after the yearslong F.B.I. investigation that culminated in the Mueller report, which found nothing to substantiate the claim.

So, unsurprisingly, when his foes look at President Trump’s behavior toward Ukraine, they see only an obvious case for impeachment: Of course Mr. Trump acted in bad faith, withholding aid to extort Ukraine into opening an unjustified investigation into the son of a potential 2020 Democratic presidential nominee. What else could he have been doing?

The thinking continues: He could not have been acting in good faith, the way Mr. Biden was when he strong-armed Mr. Poroshenko, because Mr. Biden had the support of career diplomats, while President Trump did not — in fact, the president used his personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, as an envoy to the Ukrainians. This maverick diplomacy is a prima facie indication of bad motives.

In all this, Mr. Trump’s opponents treat norms as if they were laws. But Mr. Trump openly campaigned in 2016 as someone who would rescind the nonlegal norms of American politics. He said he would “drain the swamp.” Washington’s traditional way of doing business, the legal but corrupt trade in money and influence, was something he was elected to attack. He has only contributed to the problem in the eyes of his critics, but for supporters the goal remains the same.

Mr. Trump was also elected to transform America’s foreign relations. The nation’s leadership in both parties and the Civil Service had embroiled the country in endless wars and a string of humiliations. That Mr. Trump considers officials serving in places like Ukraine to be part of the problem he was elected to solve is no secret. The testimony such officials have so far offered during impeachment hearings bears him out: Their view of American objectives is different from his. Such differences are supposed to be decided publicly, through elections. Mr. Trump happened to win the last one."

I wish to applaud Mr. Friedman on his article about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. As a West Point graduate and retired Army officer, I am appalled at Mr. Pompeo’s failure to speak truth to power to the president, and to defend the honor and reputation of career Foreign Service officers such as Marie Yovanovitch.

To the Editor:

Is good, old-fashioned political revenge no longer in fashion in Washington? Representative Adam Schiff is acting as if he’s shocked that President Trump would try to get back at the Democrats by giving them a taste of their own medicine, by going after Joe Biden and his son on the same charge of quid pro quo that they are bringing against him. Do they want to root out corruption? They can start by looking for it in their own backyard.

Mr. Trump may not have the purest of motives, but nothing he has done rises to the level of criminal misconduct. In fact, I would say it’s just business as usual in Washington and, sadly, the way of the world. Is there anything impeachable about it? Don’t make me laugh."

And there are so many other subjects to discuss.

How do the candidates think they’ll succeed in passing a sweeping climate bill even though Barack Obama failed? (Climate change will probably have a bigger long-term effect on Americans’ health than Medicare policy.) Which candidates oppose a wealth tax, and how would they instead raise taxes on the rich? Do they all favor statehood for the District of Columbia? How would their China policy differ from President Trump’s?

Do they think Pete Buttigieg is experienced enough to be president? Do they agree with Cory Booker that closing charter schools can hurt children? Why do they each think they can recapture the Midwestern states that swung to Trump in 2016, and what’s their plan for doing so?

At times, this year’s debate season has made it seem as if the candidates were running for president of Medicare. It would be great if the four of you could restore some balance tonight.

I came to believe that the president’s long-held negative view toward Ukraine was causing hesitation in actually scheduling the meeting, much as we had seen in our Oval Office discussion.

After weeks of reassuring the Ukrainians that it was just a scheduling issue, I decided to tell President Zelensky that we had a problem with the information reaching President Trump from Mayor Giuliani. I did so in a bilateral meeting at a conference on Ukrainian economic reform in Toronto, on July 2, 2019, where I led the U.S. delegation. I suggested that he call President Trump directly in order to renew their personal relationship, and to assure President Trump that he was committed to investigating and fighting corruption, things on which President Zelensky had based his presidential campaign. I was convinced that getting the two presidents to talk with each other would overcome the negative perception of Ukraine that President Trump still harbored.

President Zelensky’s senior aide, Andrey Yermak, approached me several days later to ask to be connected to Mayor Giuliani. I agreed to make that connection. I did so because I understood that the new Ukrainian leadership wanted to convince those, like Mayor Giuliani, who believed such a negative narrative about Ukraine, that times have changed and that, under President Zelensky, Ukraine is worthy of U.S. support. The Ukrainians believed that if they could get their own narrative across in a way that convinced Mayor Giuliani that they were serious about fighting corruption and advancing reform, Mayor Giuliani would convey that assessment to President Trump, thus correcting the previous, negative narrative.

That made sense to me and I tried to be helpful. I made clear to the Ukrainians that Mayor Giuliani was a private citizen, the president’s personal lawyer, and not representing the U.S. government. Likewise, in my conversations with Mayor Giuliani, I never considered him to be speaking on the president’s behalf, or giving “instructions.” Rather, the information flow was the other way — from Ukraine to Mayor Giuliani, in the hopes this would clear up the information reaching President Trump.

On July 10, after hearing from Mr. Yermak, I wrote to Mayor Giuliani to seek to get together, and finally on July 19 we met for breakfast for a longer discussion. At that meeting, I told Mr. Giuliani that in my view, the prosecutor general with whom he had been speaking, Mr. Lutsenko, was not credible and was acting in a self-serving capacity. To my surprise, Mr. Giuliani said that he had already come to the same conclusion. Mr. Giuliani also mentioned both the accusations about Vice President Biden and about interference in the 2016 election, and stressed that all he wanted to see was for Ukraine to investigate what happened in the past and apply its own laws.

Concerning the allegations, I stressed that no one in the new team governing Ukraine had anything to do with anything that may have happened in 2016. They were making television shows at the time. I also said that it is not credible to me that former Vice President Biden would have been influenced in any way by financial or personal motives in carrying out his duties as vice president.

A different issue is whether some individual Ukrainians may have attempted to influence the 2016 election or thought they could buy influence: That is at least plausible, given Ukraine’s reputation for corruption. But the accusation that Vice President Biden acted inappropriately did not seem at all credible to me."

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Yesterday, we looked at the origin of President Trump’s theory that Ukraine, not Russia, meddled in the 2016 election — one of the two theories that he asked Ukraine’s president to investigate. Today: Trump’s second theory. It’s Wednesday, November 27.

ken vogel

So when Trump goes on Fox and Friends on Friday for this long stream-of-conscious phone interview, he reiterates his theory — totally debunked theory about the Ukrainians and not the Russians hacking into the D.N.C. servers. And then he also brings up this other theory.

archived recording So, Mr. President, the accusation is this — that you’re using aid, taxpayer dollars, to attack a political opponent in Joe Biden.

ken vogel

And that has to do with Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden, and their work in Ukraine.

michael barbaro

Ken Vogel is a Washington correspondent for The Times.

archived recording (donald trump) And I will tell you this about Joe Biden I never said it specifically on him. But I watched Joe Biden with the prosecutor, who a lot of people said was a great prosecutor, and they took him off. And he was prosecuting that company. And the kid, who never made $0.10 in his life and all of a sudden is making millions of dollars the day he —

michael barbaro

Ken, what exactly is the president’s second theory here about the Bidens?

ken vogel

What Trump alleges is that Joe Biden, during his time as vice president, pressured the Ukrainian government to fire their top prosecutor — essentially their attorney general — because that prosecutor was pursuing an investigation into this energy company in Ukraine that was paying Hunter Biden as a board member, and that the reason why Joe Biden pushed for the firing was to protect Hunter Biden and his employer.

michael barbaro

So the theory is basically that the vice president does a favor for his son in the form of official action in Ukraine.

ken vogel

Correct.

michael barbaro

So where does the story behind that claim begin?

ken vogel

You’ve got to go back to 2014.

archived recording 44-year-old Hunter Biden, Vice President Joe Biden’s youngest son, was discharged from the Navy Reserve.

ken vogel

Hunter Biden, who is a Yale-educated lawyer and had dabbled in various business ventures —

archived recording Biden was given a routine drug test, which he failed.

ken vogel

— had just been discharged from the Navy Reserve after testing positive for cocaine during a drug test.

archived recording “It was the honor of my life to serve in the U.S. Navy, and I deeply regret and am embarrassed that my actions led to my administrative discharge.”

ken vogel

And at this point, he and some partners are starting to explore international opportunities. And one of his partners gets this gig on the board of this Ukrainian gas company that is looking for some Western political connections. And Hunter Biden asks if he can get in on this as well. And he is brought onto the board of this company.

archived recording And a son of the U.S. vise president has joined the board of directors of Ukraine’s largest private gas producer. Hunter Biden was appointed to the board of Burisma Holdings.

ken vogel

This company is called Burisma Holdings. It does primarily natural gas. And it is bringing onto its board a number of folks with big political names in the west. And one of them is Hunter Biden. He is paid as much as $50,000, or even more, in some months, to serve on the board of this company, and, ostensibly, to help it with governance reforms — to introduce Western corporate governance standards into this company.

michael barbaro

And how clear is it, Ken, that the reason why Hunter Biden is coming onto the board is because of his family connection? I mean, is it more or less explicit?

ken vogel

This is definitely the message that everyone in Ukraine and Washington takes away from it, as to why Hunter Biden is brought onto the board. His defenders point out that he had, in fact, served on other boards, including the board of Amtrak, where his dad famously has a lot of connections and clout. But he doesn’t really have much other applicable experience that would suggest that he is otherwise the ideal candidate to serve on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. He doesn’t have any experience in Ukraine or Ukrainian law, or even in energy.

michael barbaro

So what do we need to know about Burisma at this moment, when Hunter Biden arrives on the board?

ken vogel

Burisma has faced allegations of corruption, including many that are embraced by the West and by the State Department, which sees it, in many ways — both the company itself, Burisma, and the oligarch who owns the company as poster children for post-Soviet corruption in Ukraine.

michael barbaro

Hm. Ken, do we know if Hunter Biden understood this when he went on the board?

ken vogel

If he had done any due diligence, you would think that he should have known. There were certainly investigations that were already ongoing both in Ukraine and in the West into the oligarch who owned the company on suspicion of money laundering. And those investigations had support from the United States government. And that is where Joe Biden comes in.

What do you mean?

Well, Joe Biden, at this time, is vice president. And one of his key foreign policy tasks that he takes on at the assignment of President Barack Obama is to help Ukraine stand up to Russian aggression.

archived recording (joe biden) It is not just a foreign policy judgment. It is a personal, it’s an emotional commitment, as well.

ken vogel

And one of the things that is seen as an impediment to Ukraine establishing a stable government is this scourge of corruption that has long plagued it and is seen as limiting its ability to attract international investment and to be a stable government that can mount a response to Russian aggression.

michael barbaro

And when is he given that assignment?

ken vogel

It comes pretty much at about the same time as Hunter Biden is going onto the board of this Ukrainian gas company, in early 2014.

michael barbaro

So that’s kind of complicated.

ken vogel

It is. And it certainly would provide rationale for this Ukrainian gas company and its oligarch owner to want to have a powerful westerner who is seen as having connections to the Obama government, which at this point is pushing Ukraine to clamp down on the very type of corruption that this oligarch and his company is seen as embodying.

michael barbaro

Does anyone raise the question of whether this is not a great idea that Joe Biden is suddenly investigating corruption in Ukraine around the same time that his son is now on the board of a major Ukrainian energy company that is accused of corruption?

ken vogel

Yes. We know that there’s a guy in the State Department by the name of George Kent who had deep experience both in Ukraine and in fighting corruption. He had served as the anti-corruption coordinator in the State Department’s European bureau. And he does raise concerns about Hunter Biden joining the board of Burisma and how Hunter Biden’s position could affect Vice President Biden’s standing as a corruption fighter, or the leader of the U.S. effort to push Ukraine to clamp down on corruption.

michael barbaro

But a decision is made that father and son can simultaneously do these two things.

ken vogel

It actually appears as if the decision was to not make a decision and to not address this. George Kent tried to bring this to the attention of the vice president’s staff and was essentially told that Vice President Biden did not have the bandwidth to address this at a time when he was dealing with other family issues, particularly his son Beau Biden, his other son, struggling with brain cancer.

michael barbaro

So what exactly does Vice President Joe Biden do during this period in his role as the guy in the Obama administration who’s trying to root out corruption in Ukraine? What does it actually look like?

ken vogel

Well, Biden focuses on two areas that are seen in the West as bastions of Ukrainian corruption. One is the energy sector. And the other is the judicial system. The international community has long seen the Ukrainian judicial system, and particularly the prosecutors therein, as one of the key problems that perpetuate Ukrainian corruption. These prosecutors have long been known for using the threat of prosecution to essentially solicit bribes from potential targets of corruption. So they are not only not prosecuting corruption, they are, in fact, participating in their own brand of corruption. This was one of the key things that Joe Biden trained his sights on when he went after Ukrainian corruption.

michael barbaro

Got it. So a company would basically pay off the prosecutor, and the prosecutor, therefore, wouldn’t really prosecute.

ken vogel

Yes. And the guy who was seen as emblematic of this type of corruption is Viktor Shokin. He’s the prosecutor general of Ukraine. It’s essentially like the attorney general of Ukraine. And what makes this complicated, though, is that one of the folks who Shokin is not prosecuting because it is believed he is using the threat of prosecution to solicit bribes from is none other than the oligarch who owns the company Burisma Holdings that is paying Hunter Biden to serve as a board member.

michael barbaro

Ah.

ken vogel

Yeah. And this is why some of the folks in the State Department had flagged this as a potential concern that could undermine Joe Biden’s ability to drive this message and be seen as a credible messenger, when in his own house, under his own roof, there is someone who is working with a potential target of the type of prosecution that Joe Biden is trying to encourage the Ukrainians to pursue.

michael barbaro

So what does Biden ultimately do about Shokin? [APPLAUSE]

archived recording (joe biden) Thank you very much.

ken vogel

Well, Biden privately pressures the then-president of Ukraine to get rid of Shokin. And he actually goes and gives a speech that gets a lot of play before the Ukrainian Parliament —

archived recording (joe biden) But in addition, you also have a battle —

ken vogel

— urging them to clamp down on corruption.

archived recording (joe biden) — against corruption. But it’s not enough to set up a new Anti-Corruption Bureau and establish a special prosecutor fighting corruption. The Office of the General Prosecutor desperately needs reform. The judiciary should be overhauled. The energy sector needs to be competitive, ruled by market principles, not sweetheart deals.

ken vogel

That doesn’t really do the trick. Maybe the Ukrainians are starting to move in this direction, but they don’t actually take the steps necessary to fire Shokin. And what Biden does is, he threatens to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to Ukraine if the then-president doesn’t act to get rid of Shokin.

michael barbaro

So you’re saying that in order for Joe Biden to get rid of this problematic prosecutor, he is threatening to withhold money from Ukraine — which feels like a now-familiar concept.

ken vogel

Yeah, it certainly does have a certain familiar ring to it. But what’s different in what Biden did from what Trump’s team did is that what Biden was doing was actually carrying out the official policy of the United States government, which was to push for this prosecutor’s ouster and to use a combination of diplomatic carrots and sticks in order to achieve that end. And $1 billion in loan guarantees is certainly a rather big carrot or stick, depending on which way you look at it.

michael barbaro

Right. Right. And did it work?

archived recording So on Tuesday, 29th of March, [INAUDIBLE] of Ukraine voted to grant consent by President Petro Poroshenko to dismiss Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin.

ken vogel

Eventually, it did. It’s not totally clear what role Biden and the loan guarantees played in it versus the mounting pressure from the international community and other international, Western lenders.

archived recording [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

ken vogel

But eventually —

archived recording (interpreter) The person who was building the system of corruption in prosecutor’s office cannot reform it. Shokin’s appointment was a mistake.

ken vogel

The then-president does take the steps to get the parliament to officially oust Shokin.

michael barbaro

And what does Shokin’s ouster mean for Burisma — this company that Hunter Biden sits on?

ken vogel

You might think that this would be really bad for Burisma if it is widely regarded as a corrupt company. You’re getting rid of a corrupt prosecutor who could be bought off from bringing prosecutions against targets of corruption — that if you get rid of that guy and bring in someone who is going to be more of an anti-corruption crusader, that the potential targets of corruption prosecutions, like Burisma, might be really in a bad spot. But in fact, it turns out to be a lot more complicated than that.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So Ken, you said that the aftermath of Joe Biden forcing out this prosecutor was more complicated than it seemed for Burisma, this company that employs Biden’s son. So what actually happens?

ken vogel

Well, Burisma actually welcome this new prosecutor and the chance to work with him, because they thought that if this prosecutor subscribed to Western approaches to jurisprudence that they would be able to convince this prosecutor by giving him evidence that, in fact, these allegations against Burisma and its oligarch owner were baseless.

michael barbaro

So you’re saying that Burisma thinks, if we play by normal rules and we have a regular old prosecutor, we can get cleared of these charges because in their minds, they’re not actually corrupt.

ken vogel

Yes. And this is very important to them at the time, because they are trying to expand and pursuing Western investment. And the cloud of these corruption investigations that Shokin had hanging over them was a hindrance to them. So they welcome the chance to have a new prosecutor who they believe they can convince that the allegations against them are off base and should be dropped.

michael barbaro

So what ends up happening to Burisma once this new prosecutor is welcomed in to take a look around?

ken vogel

Well, Burisma sends in a team of very well compensated, very highly regarded American lawyers and PR folks to meet with the new prosecutor. And while the new prosecutor initially takes something of a hard line against Burisma and forces them to pay some back taxes or fines, eventually, after 10 months, the new prosecutor announces that he has fully closed all of the legal proceedings and pending criminal allegations against the oligarch owner of Burisma and his companies. And the new prosecutor announces that the oligarch owner of Burisma is being removed from the wanted list. So the oligarch, who had been in exile, returns to Ukraine.

michael barbaro

So this all ends up pretty well for Burisma — the elimination of this corrupt prosecutor. So should we then assume that Burisma was, perhaps, never corrupt in the first place?

ken vogel

No, I don’t think that we can assume that. In fact, the anti-corruption activists in Ukraine really decried this decision to drop the cases against Burisma and its oligarch owner. So in Ukraine, at least, as well as in some quarters in the State Department, it is not in any way viewed as a clean bill of health for Burisma or its oligarch owner.

michael barbaro

So Ken, I want to summarize everything you just told me and hold it up against President Trump’s theory — the theory that Vice President Biden did what he did as a favor to his son once his son is on the board of Burisma. So in reality, Biden pressures Ukraine to fire somebody who is widely seen as a dirty prosecutor, who seems to be basically holding companies, including Burisma, hostage, and taking bribes in order not to investigate them. And in pushing out that prosecutor, Biden sets in motion a series of events that conclude with an investigation of Burisma coming to an end, even though from everything you’re saying, the company is still seen as corrupt. Do I have all that correct?

ken vogel

Yes.

michael barbaro

So in the end, Biden takes an action that does benefit Burisma, and less directly, his son.

ken vogel

Indirectly, having the new prosecutor does benefit Burisma and its oligarch owner. And Hunter Biden does remain on the board of Burisma until this year. But I think this is where we get into questions of intent. And there is no evidence that it was the intent of Vice President Joe Biden to take this action to benefit Burisma, let alone his son.

michael barbaro

So can we say that this theory that the vice president did what he did in Ukraine to help his son — can we say that it is false?

ken vogel

We can say that there is no evidence that Joe Biden acted corruptly to help his son in Ukraine.

[music]

^ARCHIVED RECORDING (DONALD TRUMP)^” We’re looking for corruption. There’s tremendous corruption. We’re looking for — why should we be giving hundreds of millions of dollars to countries where there’s this kind of corruption? And if you look at my call, I said corruption. I think he said it to me. He’s looking. He got elected on the basis of corruption. And also, by the way —

michael barbaro

I’m struck, Ken, about what we can say definitively here versus what we can say definitively about the president’s first theory about CrowdStrike and Ukraine hacking the D.N.C. servers. That theory draws on fabricated facts and is thoroughly disprovable and has been disproven. The second theory, about the Bidens — it draws on real facts, but there’s no evidence of it. And yet it’s not really disprovable. Does that make sense?

ken vogel

Yeah. It’s a lot more complicated. It’s a lot more nuanced. There are a lot more facts. And there is a fact pattern that did trouble employees in the State Department at the time and then subsequently, as it’s gotten a lot more attention, has troubled ethics experts, who say that the Bidens did not do a good enough job addressing concerns about conflict of interest. Now, all that said, it does not mean that Trump’s theory that Biden acted corruptly to benefit his son is correct. There is no evidence of that, to be 100% clear.

michael barbaro

Right. It seems like both Joe Biden and Hunter Biden put themselves in a position where people could later question their motives and their judgment, because either Hunter Biden should not have been on that board at the same time that his father was taking on corruption in Ukraine, or his father, knowing that his son was on that board, should not have taken on corruption in Ukraine.

ken vogel

Yes, that’s right. And what’s interesting is that the way that the Bidens sought to address this and to avoid these conflicts of interest is by expressly not knowing about what one another were doing. In other words, Joe Biden said he did not want to know anything about what Hunter Biden was doing in the private sector, because how could he be doing anything in his job as vice president to help his son if he did not know what his son’s interests were? Now, there’s an argument to be made that that’s not really a good way to inoculate yourself against these concerns. The way to inoculate yourself is to know about one another are doing so you can avoid these potential areas of overlap.

michael barbaro

So Ken, I wonder, in the end, what is the power of these two theories that the president has pursued here about Ukraine and the D.N.C. and Ukraine and the Bidens in the impeachment inquiry, especially as it enters these final, crucial weeks?

ken vogel

These two theories are why we are in the middle of an impeachment inquiry. The fact that President Trump pressured the Ukrainian government to pursue investigations into these two theories is, for Democrats, a justification for removal from office — the very definition of the type of high crime and misdemeanor that is justification for removal from office. And that’s how Democrats have been talking about these theories, as debunked conspiracy theories, and will continue talking about them as impeachment proceeds.

[music]

And for Republicans, who are trying to defend Trump, he’s making their life more difficult here, because while they see there being some validity in the theories that he’s pushing about the Bidens, they see this theory that it was the Ukrainians and not the Russians who hacked into the D.N.C. servers as totally crazy. Many of them — most of them, I would say, even — privately, they’ll say this — they wished that he would stop talking about it because they think that this dilutes the argument that they can make that there was a legitimate corruption concern that President Trump was urging the Ukrainian government to pursue.

michael barbaro

So they prefer the Biden theory vastly to the D.N.C. server theory.

ken vogel

Yeah, that’s right. And they think that despite the way that the president has misrepresented the Biden theory and ascribed motivations that cannot be substantiated to Joe Biden, that nonetheless, this is a theory that could be politically helpful to the president and politically damaging to Joe Biden. And that is among the reasons why we are going to continue hearing the names Hunter Biden and Joe Biden from Republicans for as long as these impeachment proceedings go.

michael barbaro

Thank you, Ken.

ken vogel

Thank you.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Gordon Sondland is a Trump donor turned E.U. ambassador turned witness in the impeachment inquiry, whose testimony has been contradicted on multiple occasions. Today: How both Democrats and Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee choose to handle their most complicated witness to date. It’s Thursday, November 21. So Nick, give us a sense of what it felt like to be in that room this morning as the committee prepared to hear from Gordon Sondland, this very complicated witness.

nicholas fandos

So we knew that in the middle of this jam-packed week of impeachment testimony, Gordon Sondland’s appearance was going to be something different.

michael barbaro

Nick Fandos was in the Capitol for Sondland’s testimony.

nicholas fandos

Sondland has really been described by almost everybody as having been in the middle of this pressure campaign on Ukraine this summer. Now, there was particular anticipation, because Sondland’s story, unlike some other witnesses, has evolved as time has gone on. So when he first came in and spoke in private with investigators in October, he was pretty unclear about whether or not the president was trying to leverage a White House meeting or security aid for Ukraine to get the investigations that he wanted. He told them repeatedly, I can’t remember this, I can’t remember that. Well, after that happened, Sondland submitted a supplement to his testimony in writing that updated that and said, actually, I do think there was a quid pro quo. And so there was a lot of anticipation heading into his testimony as to which Gordon Sondland would show up. What story was he going to tell? Is he going to cop to all these different things? How is he going to treat the president? How’s he going to treat his own evolving story? And it really felt like it could go either way.

michael barbaro

So what happens? How does this much-anticipated hearing begin?

nicholas fandos

So a little after 9:00, Gordon Sondland walks into the same grand hearing room where all the impeachment hearings have been taking place. Chairman Schiff dropped his gavel.

archived recording (adam schiff) Meeting will come to order. [GAVEL BANG]

nicholas fandos

And then, after taking an oath to tell the truth and nothing but the truth —

archived recording (adam schiff) And nothing but the truth, so help you God.

nicholas fandos

— Sondland sits down and begins reading from a pretty thick stack of papers, an opening statement that he’s brought with him. And he starts by saying that —

archived recording (gordon sondland) I have not had access to all of my phone records, State Department emails and many, many other State Department documents.

nicholas fandos

— his job is made more difficult by the fact that he has not been allowed to go back to the State Department and look at notes or records that might be able to fill in his recollections.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Having access would have been very helpful to me in trying to reconstruct with whom I spoke and met and when and what was said.

nicholas fandos

Seems to be a nod at the fact that his story is, in the most generous sense, evolving. And he begins to tell the story about his involvement with Ukraine policy over the last, say, five or six months.

archived recording (gordon sondland) The U.S. delegation developed a very positive view of the Ukraine government.

nicholas fandos

He begins talking about a meeting with President Trump in May in the Oval Office after he attended the inauguration of Ukraine’s new president.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Unfortunately, President Trump was skeptical. In response to our persistent efforts in that meeting to change his views, President Trump directed us to, quote, “talk with Rudy.” We weren’t happy with the president’s directive to talk with Rudy. We did not want to involve Mr. Giuliani.

nicholas fandos

What he then starts to unspool is a set of facts and meetings that we’ve now heard a lot about in the last couple of months.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Simply put, we were playing the hand we were dealt. We all understood that if we refused to work with Mr. Giuliani, we would lose a very important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine. So we followed the president’s orders.

nicholas fandos

How, you know, May became June, became July and then August, and it became clear to him over time that President Trump, through his lawyer Mr. Giuliani and through actions that he took, wanted to extract from the Ukrainians certain politically beneficial investigations. And at one point, pretty early in his statement, he addresses the Latin phrase that has been confusing everyone as this has gone along.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Was there a quid pro quo?

nicholas fandos

Was it a quid pro quo, a this for that, or was it not? And he says —

archived recording (gordon sondland) With regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes.

nicholas fandos

Unequivocally, that as far as I’m concerned, there was a quid pro quo around the White House meeting.

michael barbaro

Right, and I was struck by how casually he says that, this thing that is very much at the center of the entire inquiry.

nicholas fandos

And the thing that has been contested by other witnesses. He states, you know, very authoritatively, without reservation. Now, he’s a little bit more cautious about whether or not there was a quid pro quo around the suspended military assistance.

archived recording (gordon sondland) In July and August of 2019, we learned that the White House had also suspended security aid to Ukraine. I tried diligently to ask why the aid was suspended, but I never received a clear answer. Still haven’t to this day.

nicholas fandos

So he came to conclude by August that that, too, was dependent on Ukraine announcing these investigations that the president wanted.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Committing to the investigations of the 2016 elections and Burisma, as Mr. Giuliani had demanded.

nicholas fandos

Now, Sondland has another clear objective as he’s laying out his story, and that is to defend himself against the testimony from other witnesses who have tried to describe him as either a rogue actor or somebody that was working through an improper diplomatic channel.

archived recording (gordon sondland) I’m not sure how someone could characterize something as an irregular channel when you’re talking to the president of the United States, the secretary of state, the national security adviser, the chief of staff at the White House, the secretary of energy. I don’t know how that’s irregular, if a bunch of —

nicholas fandos

He says, no. This was the real channel. I was working with the president of the United States. I was working with top American diplomats and officials. And not only was it proper, but all of those people knew what I was up to and what we were trying to accomplish as this went along.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Within my State Department emails, there is a July 19 email. This email was sent, this email was sent to Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Perry, Brian McCormack, who was Secretary Perry’s chief of staff at the time —

nicholas fandos

Basically, you know, if for weeks we’ve had witness after witness, and certainly the White House and the Republicans, willing to throw Gordon Sondland under the bus to try and push all of this onto him as a kind of lone wolf, I mean, he was taking everybody under the bus with him.

archived recording (gordon sondland) — Chief of Staff Mulvaney and Mr. Mulvaney’s senior adviser, Rob Blair, a lot of senior officials. These emails show that the leadership of the State Department, the National Security Council and the White House were all informed about the Ukraine efforts.

michael barbaro

Right, he’s saying, everybody who now wants to distance themselves from me, they were actually all in the loop.

nicholas fandos

That’s right. It’s a phrase he uses several times.

archived recording (gordon sondland) It was no secret. Everyone’s in the loop. Everyone was in the loop.

nicholas fandos

In the loop.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Again —

nicholas fandos

In the loop.

archived recording (gordon sondland) — everyone was in the loop.

nicholas fandos

They were in the loop.

archived recording (gordon sondland) There was a September 1 meeting with President Zelensky in Warsaw. During the actual meeting, President Zelensky raised the issue of security assistance directly with Vice President Pence. And the vice president said that he would speak to President Trump about it.

michael barbaro

And, Nick, what’s the significance of what he’s saying here? I mean, in theory, this is very explosive. The vice president, the secretary of state are being, in Sondland’s testimony, directly drawn into this.

nicholas fandos

Right, he’s trying to make the point that this wasn’t just me. Like, everyone understood this to be Trump’s objective out of this relationship, and we were all working toward that. And nobody found it unusual that I was doing what I was doing.

archived recording (gordon sondland) I sent Secretary Pompeo an email to express my appreciation for his joining a series of meetings in Brussels following the Warsaw trip. I wrote, “Mike, thanks for schlepping to Europe. I think it was really important and the chemistry seems promising. Really appreciate it.” Secretary Pompeo replied the next day, on Wednesday, September 4, quote, “All good. You’re doing great work; keep banging away.”

nicholas fandos

And with that, Sondland completes his opening statement.

archived recording (gordon sondland) It remains an honor to serve the people of the United States as their United States ambassador to the European Union. I look forward to answering the committee’s questions. Thank you.

nicholas fandos

And it’s the Democrat’s turn for 45 minutes to begin asking questions.

archived recording (adam schiff) We will now proceed the first round of questions, as detailed —

nicholas fandos

Of course, Chairman Schiff has a few of his own. But mostly, he passes the mic over to Dan Goldman, who is his chief investigator, who’s been playing a role in these hearings, questioning witnesses directly.

archived recording (adam schiff) Mr. Goldman. archived recording (daniel goldman) Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In your opening statement, Ambassador Sondland, you detailed the benefits that you have gained from obtaining some additional documents over the past few weeks. Is that right? archived recording (gordon sondland) In terms of refreshing my recollection, that’s — archived recording (daniel goldman) Right, because —

nicholas fandos

He doesn’t shy away from what becomes clear over the course of the day is a pretty shoddy memory on the part of Sondland.

archived recording (daniel goldman) You have remembered a lot more than you did when you were deposed. Is that right? archived recording (gordon sondland) That’s correct. archived recording (daniel goldman) And one of the things that —

nicholas fandos

And in doing that, Goldman does something interesting, which is that —

archived recording (daniel goldman) — conversation, Ambassador Taylor also testified, under oath, that you said that President Trump wanted Zelensky in a public box. Do you recall using that expression? archived recording (gordon sondland) Yeah, it goes back —

nicholas fandos

He repeatedly leans on those witnesses with better memories, or people who took contemporaneous notes.

archived recording (daniel goldman) Do you have any reason to question Ambassador Taylor’s testimony based on his meticulous and careful contemporaneous notes? archived recording (gordon sondland) I’m not going to question or not question. I’m just telling you what I believe I was referring to.

nicholas fandos

To describe things that Sondland told them or describe things that Sondland did, and basically asked Sondland to confirm that these things happened —

archived recording (daniel goldman) Let me fast forward a week and show you another text exchange, which may help refresh your recollection. On September 8, you sent a text to Ambassador Taylor and Ambassador Volker. Can you read what you wrote there?

nicholas fandos

— to basically bring Sondland up into line with testimony that they’ve gotten from other people about him.

archived recording (daniel goldman) So you do acknowledge you spoke to President Trump, as you indicated in that text, right? archived recording (gordon sondland) If I said I did, I did.

nicholas fandos

And that’s important as they move towards writing a report and presenting a kind of full case about what happened to the American people. It helps eliminate some of the discrepancies in the testimony they’ve gotten.

michael barbaro

Which of these exchanges stood out to you?

nicholas fandos

Well, one in particular is fresh in my mind, because we just learned about it for the first time last week.

archived recording (daniel goldman) And one of the things that you now remember is the discussion that you had with President Trump on July 26 in that restaurant in Kyiv, right?

nicholas fandos

Now remember, that’s the day after Trump himself spoke to Zelensky and told him that I want these investigations into the Bidens in 2016. Other witnesses have described Sondland basically speaking on the phone with the president, who was speaking so loud that he had to hold the phone away from his ear.

archived recording (gordon sondland) He claims to have overheard part of the conversation, and I’m not going to dispute what he did or didn’t hear.

nicholas fandos

Others could overhear President Trump asking about, quote, unquote, “the investigation,” and Sondland assured him, you know, don’t worry, with some expletive laid in, President Zelensky will do whatever we want.

michael barbaro

Right, because Ukraine loves your tush.

nicholas fandos

Something like that.

archived recording (daniel goldman) Well, he also testified that President Zelensky, quote, “loves your ass,” unquote. Do you recall saying that? archived recording (gordon sondland) Yeah, it sounds like something I would say. [LAUGHTER]

nicholas fandos

And what he basically does over the course of this back-and-forth is says —

archived recording (gordon sondland) Putting it in Trump-speak, by saying he loves your ass, he’ll do whatever you want, meant that he would really work with us on a whole host of issues.

nicholas fandos

— you’ve heard the president talk.

archived recording (gordon sondland) That’s how President Trump and I communicate, a lot of four-letter words. In this case, three-letter.

nicholas fandos

He also contests a couple of small points.

archived recording (gordon sondland) I don’t think I would have said that. I would have — I would have —

nicholas fandos

But in the end, he confirms the essence of the story as it’s been related by other witnesses, and for the first time, kind of established that that happened.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Again, trying to reconstruct a very busy day without the benefit, but if someone said I had a meeting, and I went to the meeting, then I’m not going to dispute that.

michael barbaro

So it’s kind of that familiar mix of Sondland’s self-protection, lack of recall, but overall, damning testimony.

nicholas fandos

I think that’s right.

archived recording (daniel goldman) Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

nicholas fandos

So the Democrats wrap up their questioning.

archived recording (adam schiff) That concludes our 45 minutes —

nicholas fandos

And after weeks of investigation, literally hundreds of hours of testimony, in private and in public, they’ve finally gotten, from a lead witness who had direct access to the president, a statement, an admission, of one of the things that they’ve been looking for and trying to prove out all along, that this White House meeting, an official act, was conditioned upon Ukraine publicly announcing investigations. And that Sondland, a top official, also believed that the withheld aid money — that that would only flow, too, if the investigations were announced. And so it’s with that in front of them —

archived recording (adam schiff) Why don’t we take a 5- or 10-minute break? archived recording (gordon sondland) Thank you.

nicholas fandos

That Schiff abruptly gavels the hearing into a pause, somewhat inexplicably at first. And then we quickly see why as he walks out behind the chamber —

archived recording (adam schiff) Just want to make a couple of quick observations while we’re on a break here.

nicholas fandos

— to a bank of cameras, where he begins to talk about what just took place.

archived recording (adam schiff) And what we have just heard from Ambassador Sondland is that the knowledge of this scheme was a basic quid pro quo. It was the conditioning —

nicholas fandos

Which all, of course, carried it live in the middle of the proceedings. And when he was done —

archived recording (adam schiff) So I think a very important moment in the history of this inquiry.

nicholas fandos

— he wrapped up and walked right back into the hearing room and gaveled the thing back into session.

archived recording (adam schiff) Come to order.

nicholas fandos

Now, it wasn’t lost on Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the committee, who quickly called Schiff out.

archived recording (devin nunes) Thank the gentleman. For those of you watching at home, that was not a bathroom break. That was actually a chance for the Democrats to go out and hold a press conference, Ambassador, for all the supposed bombshells that were in your opening testimony.

nicholas fandos

So there’s quite a bit of bad blood, obviously, between the two sides. But I don’t think that this helped.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So once we’re back, given that the Democrats have already sort of embraced the messiness and unreliability of Gordon Sondland and addressed it pretty directly, what is the Republican strategy when it’s their turn to question?

nicholas fandos

Well, Republicans are looking at the same guy and the same tendencies, and they see an amazing opportunity to weaponize it in defense of the president.

archived recording (steve castor) Hello again, Ambassador. archived recording (gordon sondland) Hi.

nicholas fandos

So it’s left to Steve Castor, who’s the Republicans’ lawyer in all of this, to start trying to do that work.

archived recording (steve castor) I just want to go through some distinctions between your opener and your deposition.

nicholas fandos

There’s a phone call that Sondland has where he says that he was getting such mixed signals and couldn’t get answers about what Trump wanted from Ukraine and why he was withholding the aid money.

archived recording (gordon sondland) And I was getting tired of going around in circles, frankly. So I made the call —

nicholas fandos

And he asked President Trump, just kind of point blank —

archived recording (gordon sondland) — what do you want from Ukraine? And that’s when I got the answer. archived recording (steve castor) And he was unequivocal, nothing.

nicholas fandos

The president tells him, I don’t want a quid pro quo. I don’t want anything from Ukraine. They should just do what’s right. They should do what Zelensky said he was going to do. And Republicans kept going back to this call again and again and again.

archived recording (john ratcliffe) Tell me if there’s anything sinister or nefarious in any of this, a vanilla request about corruption, a call to say, I’m on my way to Ukraine, a five-minute call you didn’t remember as significant, a call that you made where the president said, I want nothing, I want no quid pro quo, I want Zelensky to do the right thing, I want him to do what he ran on, and him telling you to go tell Congress the truth. Anything sinister and nefarious about any of that? archived recording (gordon sondland) Not the way you present it. archived recording (john ratcliffe) O.K., and that is the truth.

nicholas fandos

Because in this case, as they pointed out, you know, when the president is speaking directly to Sondland, he’s saying, no quid pro quo. I don’t want anything in particular from the Ukrainians.

archived recording (jim jordan) And you told Mr. Castor that the president never told you that the announcement had to happen to get anything. In fact, he didn’t just not tell you that, he explicitly said the opposite.

michael barbaro

So the most senior figure, and the most involved figure in all this from the Trump administration, who declares that this was a quid pro quo, is simultaneously testifying that the president gets on the phone with him and says, this is no quid pro quo. That is complicated.

nicholas fandos

It is. It’s very complicated. And if you’re listening at home and listening to Republican questioning, they’re able, I think, to raise some doubts about this account that he’s giving.

archived recording (michael turner) And if you pull up CNN today, right now, their banner says, “Sondland ties Trump to withholding aid.” Is that your testimony today, Ambassador Sondland, that you have evidence that Donald Trump tied the investigation to the aide? Because I don’t think you’re saying that.

nicholas fandos

And in this questioning, you know, Sondland says, I didn’t hear anything directly.

archived recording (gordon sondland) I’ve said repeatedly, Congressman, I was presuming. I also said that President Trump — archived recording (michael turner) So no one told you, not just the president. Giuliani didn’t tell you. Mulvaney didn’t tell you. Nobody — Pompeo didn’t tell you — nobody else on this planet told you that Donald Trump was tying aid to these investigations. Is that correct? archived recording (gordon sondland) I think I already testified to that. archived recording (michael turner) No, answer the question, yes or no. archived recording (gordon sondland) Yes.

michael barbaro

Nick, why do you think that they are so focused on that, what the president told him versus what he has concluded from all the information and conversations around him?

nicholas fandos

Republicans’ argument is basically that, if you’re going to impeach the president, you know, we need to know directly what his intentions were. What he told you, that’s evidence. That’s primary evidence. What you concluded, I mean, that’s no better than what we’ve heard from other witnesses. It’s hearsay.

archived recording (michael turner) I mean, that’s what I don’t understand. So, you know what hearsay evidence is, Ambassador? Hearsay is when I testify what someone else told me. You know what made-up testimony is? Made-up testimony is when I just presume it. I mean, you’re just assuming all of these things, and then you’re giving them the evidence — that they’re running out and doing press conferences, and CNN’s headline is saying that you’re saying the president of the United States should be impeached because he tied aid to investigations. And you don’t know that. Correct? archived recording (gordon sondland) I never said the president of the United States should be impeached. archived recording (michael turner) Nope, but you did —

nicholas fandos

So as this hearing starts to wind down after five or six hours of this back-and-forth, after a pretty explosive and direct opening statement and then cross-examination and examination and more cross-examination, spirits are starting to flag a little bit in the hearing room.

archived recording (adam schiff) Mr. Maloney. archived recording (sean patrick maloney) Mr. Ambassador, let’s pick up right there.

nicholas fandos

There’s an exchange near the end with Sean Patrick Maloney, a Democrat of New York.

archived recording (sean patrick maloney) Let me ask you something. Who would have benefited from an investigation of the president’s political opponents? archived recording (gordon sondland) I don’t want to characterize who would have and who would not have. archived recording (sean patrick maloney) I know you don’t want to, sir. That’s my question. Would you answer it for me?

nicholas fandos

And Maloney, you know, seeming to kind of burst forth with Democratic frustration that’s been boiling beneath the surface all day, basically says —

archived recording (sean patrick maloney) I guess I’m have trouble why you can’t just say — archived recording (gordon sondland) When he asked about investigations, I assumed he meant — archived recording (sean patrick maloney) I know what you assumed. But who would benefit from an investigation of the Bidens? archived recording (gordon sondland) I assume President Trump would benefit. archived recording (sean patrick maloney) There we have it. See? [APPLAUSE] Didn’t hurt a bit, did it? But let me ask you something — archived recording (gordon sondland) Mr. Maloney? archived recording (sean patrick maloney) Hold on, sir. archived recording (gordon sondland) Excuse me. I’ve been very forthright, and I really resent what you’re trying to do. archived recording (sean patrick maloney) Fair enough. You’ve been very forthright. This your third try to do so, sir. Didn’t work so well the first time, did it? And now we’re here a third time, and we got a doozy of a statement from you this morning. There’s a whole bunch of stuff you don’t recall. So all due respect, sir, we appreciate your candor. But let’s be really clear on what it took to get it out of you.

nicholas fandos

And that’s kind of the tone as this hearing begins to come to an end. Democrats are frustrated about some things. Republicans are frustrated about some things. Sondland, who’s trying to catch a flight back to Brussels, is certainly frustrated by some things. And we’ve had a pretty complex and conflicting day of testimony, where some people seem to be coming away quite happy, but not perfectly so.

michael barbaro

So is this unreliable witness turning out to be the most important witness in this inquiry? Or is he just an unreliable witness?

nicholas fandos

Well, the thing about Sondland is, the Democrats will tell you, prosecutors successfully bring cases all the time on highly flawed witnesses who maybe don’t even have a great history with the truth. But that doesn’t mean that what they’re saying isn’t true in a given scenario. And in this case, it’s important to remember, what he’s saying is incredibly, politically inconvenient for him. He still works for the president of the United States, who he donated a bunch of money to and whose policies he believes in. That itself lends it some power and credibility. Democrats seem to be emerging from today more comfortable and more certain that they need to bring forward this case of the president abusing his office, of committing high crimes and misdemeanors worthy of impeachment and putting it before the American people.

michael barbaro

Thank you, Nick.

nicholas fandos

Thanks for having me, Michael.

michael barbaro

For the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the latest developments in the impeachment inquiry in our new podcast. It’s called “The Latest.” You can hear these episodes at the end of the day, right here on “The Daily.” Or subscribe to “The Latest” wherever you listen. We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) How did Ambassador Sondland get there? You know, this is not a man who had any qualifications except one. He wrote a check for a million dollars.

michael barbaro

In the fifth Democratic presidential debate, candidates expressed outrage over Wednesday’s testimony in the impeachment inquiry, with Senator Elizabeth Warren accusing President Trump of selling off key ambassadorships to wealthy donors like Gordon Sondland.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) And that tells us about what’s happening in Washington.

michael barbaro

But with Mayor Pete Buttigieg now leading the polls in Iowa, the first state to pick a Democratic nominee, several of his rivals, including Senator Amy Klobuchar, sought to challenge his credentials and experience.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) Just like I have won statewide, and Mayor, I have all appreciation for your good work as a local official, and you did not when you tried, I also have actually done this work. I think experience should matter.

michael barbaro

Buttigieg fired back, suggesting that the federal experience of his opponent was its own liability.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) So first of all, Washington experience is not the only experience that matters. There’s more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage. And where are we right now as a country? [CHEERING]

Specifically, the three priorities of security, economy and justice, and our support for Ukrainian democratic resistance to Russian aggression, became overshadowed by a political agenda promoted by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and a cadre of officials operating with a direct channel to the White House.” “Based on questions and statements I’ve heard, some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country — and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did. This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves. The unfortunate truth is that Russia was the foreign power that systematically attacked our democratic institutions in 2016. And I refuse to be part of an effort to legitimize an alternate narrative that the Ukrainian government is a U.S. adversary and that Ukraine, not Russia, attacked us in 2016.” “Although the hold on the security assistance may have been lifted, there are still things they wanted that they weren’t getting, including a meeting with the president in the Oval Office. So — and I think that continues to this day, I think they’re being very careful. They still need us.” “Obviously what Mr. Giuliani was saying was pretty explosive in any case. He was frequently on television making quite incendiary remarks about everyone involved in this, and that he was clearly pushing forward issues and ideas that would, you know, probably come back to haunt us. And, in fact, I think that that’s where we are today.” “We asked Ambassador Sondland about that at his deposition. He indicated you were upset and you were upset with Ambassador Bolton and upset with the way things were going —” “Very unfortunately, I had a bit of a blowup with Ambassador Sondland, and I had a couple of testy encounters with him. He was being involved in a domestic political errand — and we were being involved in national security foreign policy. And those two things had just diverged. But I was irritated with him and angry with him that he wasn’t fully coordinating. And I did say to him, ‘Ambassador Sondland, Gordon, I think this is all going to blow up.’ And here we are.” “You may be aware of some of the attacks on Colonel Vindman suggesting that he has a dual loyalty — that he’s not really loyal to America, he’s loyal to Ukraine. I want to ask you as a fellow immigrant what you think of those kind of accusations when they’re leveled against Colonel Vindman or other Americans?” “This is my country, and the country that I serve. And I know for a fact that every single one of my colleagues, and there were many naturalized citizens in my office and across the National Security Council, felt exactly the same way. I think it’s deeply unfair. And so when I came in, Gordon Sondland was basically saying, well, look, we have a deal here that there will be a meeting, I have a deal here with Chief of Staff Mulvaney, there will be a meeting if the Ukrainians open up or announce these investigations into 2016 and Burisma — and I cut it off immediately there. Because by this point, having heard Mr. Giuliani over and over again on the television, and all of the issues that he was asserting, by this point it was clear that Burisma was code for the Bidens, because Giuliani was laying it out there. I could see why Colonel Vindman was alarmed and he said, this is inappropriate, we’re the National Security Council, we can’t be involved in this.” “Did your boss — Doctor, I mean, Ambassador Bolton, tell you that Giuliani was, quote, ‘a hand grenade’?” “He did, yes.” “What do you think he meant by his characterization of Giuliani as a hand grenade?” “What he meant by this was pretty clear to me in the context of all of the statements that Mr. Giuliani was making publicly — that the investigations that he was promoting, that the storyline he was promoting, the narrative he was promoting, was going to backfire.” “And it’s time for this phase of the publicly announced and proclaimed Democrat coup to end. Thank you for your service. Thanks for being here. And I yield back.” “Could I actually say something? Because we’ve had three —” “Doctor, I was going to — I was going to ask you if you’d like to respond. There have been —” “I yielded back!” “I — gentleman will suspend — Dr. Hill, you may respond.” I think all of us who came here under a legal obligation also felt we had a moral obligation to do so. We came as fact witnesses. We need to be together again in 2020, so the American people can make a choice about the future and about — to make their votes in a presidential election without any fear.”"

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Gordon Sondland is a Trump donor turned E.U. ambassador turned witness in the impeachment inquiry, whose testimony has been contradicted on multiple occasions. Today: How both Democrats and Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee choose to handle their most complicated witness to date. It’s Thursday, November 21. So Nick, give us a sense of what it felt like to be in that room this morning as the committee prepared to hear from Gordon Sondland, this very complicated witness.

nicholas fandos

So we knew that in the middle of this jam-packed week of impeachment testimony, Gordon Sondland’s appearance was going to be something different.

michael barbaro

Nick Fandos was in the Capitol for Sondland’s testimony.

nicholas fandos

Sondland has really been described by almost everybody as having been in the middle of this pressure campaign on Ukraine this summer. Now, there was particular anticipation, because Sondland’s story, unlike some other witnesses, has evolved as time has gone on. So when he first came in and spoke in private with investigators in October, he was pretty unclear about whether or not the president was trying to leverage a White House meeting or security aid for Ukraine to get the investigations that he wanted. He told them repeatedly, I can’t remember this, I can’t remember that. Well, after that happened, Sondland submitted a supplement to his testimony in writing that updated that and said, actually, I do think there was a quid pro quo. And so there was a lot of anticipation heading into his testimony as to which Gordon Sondland would show up. What story was he going to tell? Is he going to cop to all these different things? How is he going to treat the president? How’s he going to treat his own evolving story? And it really felt like it could go either way.

michael barbaro

So what happens? How does this much-anticipated hearing begin?

nicholas fandos

So a little after 9:00, Gordon Sondland walks into the same grand hearing room where all the impeachment hearings have been taking place. Chairman Schiff dropped his gavel.

archived recording (adam schiff) Meeting will come to order. [GAVEL BANG]

nicholas fandos

And then, after taking an oath to tell the truth and nothing but the truth —

archived recording (adam schiff) And nothing but the truth, so help you God.

nicholas fandos

— Sondland sits down and begins reading from a pretty thick stack of papers, an opening statement that he’s brought with him. And he starts by saying that —

archived recording (gordon sondland) I have not had access to all of my phone records, State Department emails and many, many other State Department documents.

nicholas fandos

— his job is made more difficult by the fact that he has not been allowed to go back to the State Department and look at notes or records that might be able to fill in his recollections.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Having access would have been very helpful to me in trying to reconstruct with whom I spoke and met and when and what was said.

nicholas fandos

Seems to be a nod at the fact that his story is, in the most generous sense, evolving. And he begins to tell the story about his involvement with Ukraine policy over the last, say, five or six months.

archived recording (gordon sondland) The U.S. delegation developed a very positive view of the Ukraine government.

nicholas fandos

He begins talking about a meeting with President Trump in May in the Oval Office after he attended the inauguration of Ukraine’s new president.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Unfortunately, President Trump was skeptical. In response to our persistent efforts in that meeting to change his views, President Trump directed us to, quote, “talk with Rudy.” We weren’t happy with the president’s directive to talk with Rudy. We did not want to involve Mr. Giuliani.

nicholas fandos

What he then starts to unspool is a set of facts and meetings that we’ve now heard a lot about in the last couple of months.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Simply put, we were playing the hand we were dealt. We all understood that if we refused to work with Mr. Giuliani, we would lose a very important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine. So we followed the president’s orders.

nicholas fandos

How, you know, May became June, became July and then August, and it became clear to him over time that President Trump, through his lawyer Mr. Giuliani and through actions that he took, wanted to extract from the Ukrainians certain politically beneficial investigations. And at one point, pretty early in his statement, he addresses the Latin phrase that has been confusing everyone as this has gone along.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Was there a quid pro quo?

nicholas fandos

Was it a quid pro quo, a this for that, or was it not? And he says —

archived recording (gordon sondland) With regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes.

nicholas fandos

Unequivocally, that as far as I’m concerned, there was a quid pro quo around the White House meeting.

michael barbaro

Right, and I was struck by how casually he says that, this thing that is very much at the center of the entire inquiry.

nicholas fandos

And the thing that has been contested by other witnesses. He states, you know, very authoritatively, without reservation. Now, he’s a little bit more cautious about whether or not there was a quid pro quo around the suspended military assistance.

archived recording (gordon sondland) In July and August of 2019, we learned that the White House had also suspended security aid to Ukraine. I tried diligently to ask why the aid was suspended, but I never received a clear answer. Still haven’t to this day.

nicholas fandos

So he came to conclude by August that that, too, was dependent on Ukraine announcing these investigations that the president wanted.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Committing to the investigations of the 2016 elections and Burisma, as Mr. Giuliani had demanded.

nicholas fandos

Now, Sondland has another clear objective as he’s laying out his story, and that is to defend himself against the testimony from other witnesses who have tried to describe him as either a rogue actor or somebody that was working through an improper diplomatic channel.

archived recording (gordon sondland) I’m not sure how someone could characterize something as an irregular channel when you’re talking to the president of the United States, the secretary of state, the national security adviser, the chief of staff at the White House, the secretary of energy. I don’t know how that’s irregular, if a bunch of —

nicholas fandos

He says, no. This was the real channel. I was working with the president of the United States. I was working with top American diplomats and officials. And not only was it proper, but all of those people knew what I was up to and what we were trying to accomplish as this went along.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Within my State Department emails, there is a July 19 email. This email was sent, this email was sent to Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Perry, Brian McCormack, who was Secretary Perry’s chief of staff at the time —

nicholas fandos

Basically, you know, if for weeks we’ve had witness after witness, and certainly the White House and the Republicans, willing to throw Gordon Sondland under the bus to try and push all of this onto him as a kind of lone wolf, I mean, he was taking everybody under the bus with him.

archived recording (gordon sondland) — Chief of Staff Mulvaney and Mr. Mulvaney’s senior adviser, Rob Blair, a lot of senior officials. These emails show that the leadership of the State Department, the National Security Council and the White House were all informed about the Ukraine efforts.

michael barbaro

Right, he’s saying, everybody who now wants to distance themselves from me, they were actually all in the loop.

nicholas fandos

That’s right. It’s a phrase he uses several times.

archived recording (gordon sondland) It was no secret. Everyone’s in the loop. Everyone was in the loop.

nicholas fandos

In the loop.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Again —

nicholas fandos

In the loop.

archived recording (gordon sondland) — everyone was in the loop.

nicholas fandos

They were in the loop.

archived recording (gordon sondland) There was a September 1 meeting with President Zelensky in Warsaw. During the actual meeting, President Zelensky raised the issue of security assistance directly with Vice President Pence. And the vice president said that he would speak to President Trump about it.

michael barbaro

And, Nick, what’s the significance of what he’s saying here? I mean, in theory, this is very explosive. The vice president, the secretary of state are being, in Sondland’s testimony, directly drawn into this.

nicholas fandos

Right, he’s trying to make the point that this wasn’t just me. Like, everyone understood this to be Trump’s objective out of this relationship, and we were all working toward that. And nobody found it unusual that I was doing what I was doing.

archived recording (gordon sondland) I sent Secretary Pompeo an email to express my appreciation for his joining a series of meetings in Brussels following the Warsaw trip. I wrote, “Mike, thanks for schlepping to Europe. I think it was really important and the chemistry seems promising. Really appreciate it.” Secretary Pompeo replied the next day, on Wednesday, September 4, quote, “All good. You’re doing great work; keep banging away.”

nicholas fandos

And with that, Sondland completes his opening statement.

archived recording (gordon sondland) It remains an honor to serve the people of the United States as their United States ambassador to the European Union. I look forward to answering the committee’s questions. Thank you.

nicholas fandos

And it’s the Democrat’s turn for 45 minutes to begin asking questions.

archived recording (adam schiff) We will now proceed the first round of questions, as detailed —

nicholas fandos

Of course, Chairman Schiff has a few of his own. But mostly, he passes the mic over to Dan Goldman, who is his chief investigator, who’s been playing a role in these hearings, questioning witnesses directly.

archived recording (adam schiff) Mr. Goldman. archived recording (daniel goldman) Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In your opening statement, Ambassador Sondland, you detailed the benefits that you have gained from obtaining some additional documents over the past few weeks. Is that right? archived recording (gordon sondland) In terms of refreshing my recollection, that’s — archived recording (daniel goldman) Right, because —

nicholas fandos

He doesn’t shy away from what becomes clear over the course of the day is a pretty shoddy memory on the part of Sondland.

archived recording (daniel goldman) You have remembered a lot more than you did when you were deposed. Is that right? archived recording (gordon sondland) That’s correct. archived recording (daniel goldman) And one of the things that —

nicholas fandos

And in doing that, Goldman does something interesting, which is that —

archived recording (daniel goldman) — conversation, Ambassador Taylor also testified, under oath, that you said that President Trump wanted Zelensky in a public box. Do you recall using that expression? archived recording (gordon sondland) Yeah, it goes back —

nicholas fandos

He repeatedly leans on those witnesses with better memories, or people who took contemporaneous notes.

archived recording (daniel goldman) Do you have any reason to question Ambassador Taylor’s testimony based on his meticulous and careful contemporaneous notes? archived recording (gordon sondland) I’m not going to question or not question. I’m just telling you what I believe I was referring to.

nicholas fandos

To describe things that Sondland told them or describe things that Sondland did, and basically asked Sondland to confirm that these things happened —

archived recording (daniel goldman) Let me fast forward a week and show you another text exchange, which may help refresh your recollection. On September 8, you sent a text to Ambassador Taylor and Ambassador Volker. Can you read what you wrote there?

nicholas fandos

— to basically bring Sondland up into line with testimony that they’ve gotten from other people about him.

archived recording (daniel goldman) So you do acknowledge you spoke to President Trump, as you indicated in that text, right? archived recording (gordon sondland) If I said I did, I did.

nicholas fandos

And that’s important as they move towards writing a report and presenting a kind of full case about what happened to the American people. It helps eliminate some of the discrepancies in the testimony they’ve gotten.

michael barbaro

Which of these exchanges stood out to you?

nicholas fandos

Well, one in particular is fresh in my mind, because we just learned about it for the first time last week.

archived recording (daniel goldman) And one of the things that you now remember is the discussion that you had with President Trump on July 26 in that restaurant in Kyiv, right?

nicholas fandos

Now remember, that’s the day after Trump himself spoke to Zelensky and told him that I want these investigations into the Bidens in 2016. Other witnesses have described Sondland basically speaking on the phone with the president, who was speaking so loud that he had to hold the phone away from his ear.

archived recording (gordon sondland) He claims to have overheard part of the conversation, and I’m not going to dispute what he did or didn’t hear.

nicholas fandos

Others could overhear President Trump asking about, quote, unquote, “the investigation,” and Sondland assured him, you know, don’t worry, with some expletive laid in, President Zelensky will do whatever we want.

michael barbaro

Right, because Ukraine loves your tush.

nicholas fandos

Something like that.

archived recording (daniel goldman) Well, he also testified that President Zelensky, quote, “loves your ass,” unquote. Do you recall saying that? archived recording (gordon sondland) Yeah, it sounds like something I would say. [LAUGHTER]

nicholas fandos

And what he basically does over the course of this back-and-forth is says —

archived recording (gordon sondland) Putting it in Trump-speak, by saying he loves your ass, he’ll do whatever you want, meant that he would really work with us on a whole host of issues.

nicholas fandos

— you’ve heard the president talk.

archived recording (gordon sondland) That’s how President Trump and I communicate, a lot of four-letter words. In this case, three-letter.

nicholas fandos

He also contests a couple of small points.

archived recording (gordon sondland) I don’t think I would have said that. I would have — I would have —

nicholas fandos

But in the end, he confirms the essence of the story as it’s been related by other witnesses, and for the first time, kind of established that that happened.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Again, trying to reconstruct a very busy day without the benefit, but if someone said I had a meeting, and I went to the meeting, then I’m not going to dispute that.

michael barbaro

So it’s kind of that familiar mix of Sondland’s self-protection, lack of recall, but overall, damning testimony.

nicholas fandos

I think that’s right.

archived recording (daniel goldman) Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

nicholas fandos

So the Democrats wrap up their questioning.

archived recording (adam schiff) That concludes our 45 minutes —

nicholas fandos

And after weeks of investigation, literally hundreds of hours of testimony, in private and in public, they’ve finally gotten, from a lead witness who had direct access to the president, a statement, an admission, of one of the things that they’ve been looking for and trying to prove out all along, that this White House meeting, an official act, was conditioned upon Ukraine publicly announcing investigations. And that Sondland, a top official, also believed that the withheld aid money — that that would only flow, too, if the investigations were announced. And so it’s with that in front of them —

archived recording (adam schiff) Why don’t we take a 5- or 10-minute break? archived recording (gordon sondland) Thank you.

nicholas fandos

That Schiff abruptly gavels the hearing into a pause, somewhat inexplicably at first. And then we quickly see why as he walks out behind the chamber —

archived recording (adam schiff) Just want to make a couple of quick observations while we’re on a break here.

nicholas fandos

— to a bank of cameras, where he begins to talk about what just took place.

archived recording (adam schiff) And what we have just heard from Ambassador Sondland is that the knowledge of this scheme was a basic quid pro quo. It was the conditioning —

nicholas fandos

Which all, of course, carried it live in the middle of the proceedings. And when he was done —

archived recording (adam schiff) So I think a very important moment in the history of this inquiry.

nicholas fandos

— he wrapped up and walked right back into the hearing room and gaveled the thing back into session.

archived recording (adam schiff) Come to order.

nicholas fandos

Now, it wasn’t lost on Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the committee, who quickly called Schiff out.

archived recording (devin nunes) Thank the gentleman. For those of you watching at home, that was not a bathroom break. That was actually a chance for the Democrats to go out and hold a press conference, Ambassador, for all the supposed bombshells that were in your opening testimony.

nicholas fandos

So there’s quite a bit of bad blood, obviously, between the two sides. But I don’t think that this helped.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So once we’re back, given that the Democrats have already sort of embraced the messiness and unreliability of Gordon Sondland and addressed it pretty directly, what is the Republican strategy when it’s their turn to question?

nicholas fandos

Well, Republicans are looking at the same guy and the same tendencies, and they see an amazing opportunity to weaponize it in defense of the president.

archived recording (steve castor) Hello again, Ambassador. archived recording (gordon sondland) Hi.

nicholas fandos

So it’s left to Steve Castor, who’s the Republicans’ lawyer in all of this, to start trying to do that work.

archived recording (steve castor) I just want to go through some distinctions between your opener and your deposition.

nicholas fandos

There’s a phone call that Sondland has where he says that he was getting such mixed signals and couldn’t get answers about what Trump wanted from Ukraine and why he was withholding the aid money.

archived recording (gordon sondland) And I was getting tired of going around in circles, frankly. So I made the call —

nicholas fandos

And he asked President Trump, just kind of point blank —

archived recording (gordon sondland) — what do you want from Ukraine? And that’s when I got the answer. archived recording (steve castor) And he was unequivocal, nothing.

nicholas fandos

The president tells him, I don’t want a quid pro quo. I don’t want anything from Ukraine. They should just do what’s right. They should do what Zelensky said he was going to do. And Republicans kept going back to this call again and again and again.

archived recording (john ratcliffe) Tell me if there’s anything sinister or nefarious in any of this, a vanilla request about corruption, a call to say, I’m on my way to Ukraine, a five-minute call you didn’t remember as significant, a call that you made where the president said, I want nothing, I want no quid pro quo, I want Zelensky to do the right thing, I want him to do what he ran on, and him telling you to go tell Congress the truth. Anything sinister and nefarious about any of that? archived recording (gordon sondland) Not the way you present it. archived recording (john ratcliffe) O.K., and that is the truth.

nicholas fandos

Because in this case, as they pointed out, you know, when the president is speaking directly to Sondland, he’s saying, no quid pro quo. I don’t want anything in particular from the Ukrainians.

archived recording (jim jordan) And you told Mr. Castor that the president never told you that the announcement had to happen to get anything. In fact, he didn’t just not tell you that, he explicitly said the opposite.

michael barbaro

So the most senior figure, and the most involved figure in all this from the Trump administration, who declares that this was a quid pro quo, is simultaneously testifying that the president gets on the phone with him and says, this is no quid pro quo. That is complicated.

nicholas fandos

It is. It’s very complicated. And if you’re listening at home and listening to Republican questioning, they’re able, I think, to raise some doubts about this account that he’s giving.

archived recording (michael turner) And if you pull up CNN today, right now, their banner says, “Sondland ties Trump to withholding aid.” Is that your testimony today, Ambassador Sondland, that you have evidence that Donald Trump tied the investigation to the aide? Because I don’t think you’re saying that.

nicholas fandos

And in this questioning, you know, Sondland says, I didn’t hear anything directly.

archived recording (gordon sondland) I’ve said repeatedly, Congressman, I was presuming. I also said that President Trump — archived recording (michael turner) So no one told you, not just the president. Giuliani didn’t tell you. Mulvaney didn’t tell you. Nobody — Pompeo didn’t tell you — nobody else on this planet told you that Donald Trump was tying aid to these investigations. Is that correct? archived recording (gordon sondland) I think I already testified to that. archived recording (michael turner) No, answer the question, yes or no. archived recording (gordon sondland) Yes.

michael barbaro

Nick, why do you think that they are so focused on that, what the president told him versus what he has concluded from all the information and conversations around him?

nicholas fandos

Republicans’ argument is basically that, if you’re going to impeach the president, you know, we need to know directly what his intentions were. What he told you, that’s evidence. That’s primary evidence. What you concluded, I mean, that’s no better than what we’ve heard from other witnesses. It’s hearsay.

archived recording (michael turner) I mean, that’s what I don’t understand. So, you know what hearsay evidence is, Ambassador? Hearsay is when I testify what someone else told me. You know what made-up testimony is? Made-up testimony is when I just presume it. I mean, you’re just assuming all of these things, and then you’re giving them the evidence — that they’re running out and doing press conferences, and CNN’s headline is saying that you’re saying the president of the United States should be impeached because he tied aid to investigations. And you don’t know that. Correct? archived recording (gordon sondland) I never said the president of the United States should be impeached. archived recording (michael turner) Nope, but you did —

nicholas fandos

So as this hearing starts to wind down after five or six hours of this back-and-forth, after a pretty explosive and direct opening statement and then cross-examination and examination and more cross-examination, spirits are starting to flag a little bit in the hearing room.

archived recording (adam schiff) Mr. Maloney. archived recording (sean patrick maloney) Mr. Ambassador, let’s pick up right there.

nicholas fandos

There’s an exchange near the end with Sean Patrick Maloney, a Democrat of New York.

archived recording (sean patrick maloney) Let me ask you something. Who would have benefited from an investigation of the president’s political opponents? archived recording (gordon sondland) I don’t want to characterize who would have and who would not have. archived recording (sean patrick maloney) I know you don’t want to, sir. That’s my question. Would you answer it for me?

nicholas fandos

And Maloney, you know, seeming to kind of burst forth with Democratic frustration that’s been boiling beneath the surface all day, basically says —

archived recording (sean patrick maloney) I guess I’m have trouble why you can’t just say — archived recording (gordon sondland) When he asked about investigations, I assumed he meant — archived recording (sean patrick maloney) I know what you assumed. But who would benefit from an investigation of the Bidens? archived recording (gordon sondland) I assume President Trump would benefit. archived recording (sean patrick maloney) There we have it. See? [APPLAUSE] Didn’t hurt a bit, did it? But let me ask you something — archived recording (gordon sondland) Mr. Maloney? archived recording (sean patrick maloney) Hold on, sir. archived recording (gordon sondland) Excuse me. I’ve been very forthright, and I really resent what you’re trying to do. archived recording (sean patrick maloney) Fair enough. You’ve been very forthright. This your third try to do so, sir. Didn’t work so well the first time, did it? And now we’re here a third time, and we got a doozy of a statement from you this morning. There’s a whole bunch of stuff you don’t recall. So all due respect, sir, we appreciate your candor. But let’s be really clear on what it took to get it out of you.

nicholas fandos

And that’s kind of the tone as this hearing begins to come to an end. Democrats are frustrated about some things. Republicans are frustrated about some things. Sondland, who’s trying to catch a flight back to Brussels, is certainly frustrated by some things. And we’ve had a pretty complex and conflicting day of testimony, where some people seem to be coming away quite happy, but not perfectly so.

michael barbaro

So is this unreliable witness turning out to be the most important witness in this inquiry? Or is he just an unreliable witness?

nicholas fandos

Well, the thing about Sondland is, the Democrats will tell you, prosecutors successfully bring cases all the time on highly flawed witnesses who maybe don’t even have a great history with the truth. But that doesn’t mean that what they’re saying isn’t true in a given scenario. And in this case, it’s important to remember, what he’s saying is incredibly, politically inconvenient for him. He still works for the president of the United States, who he donated a bunch of money to and whose policies he believes in. That itself lends it some power and credibility. Democrats seem to be emerging from today more comfortable and more certain that they need to bring forward this case of the president abusing his office, of committing high crimes and misdemeanors worthy of impeachment and putting it before the American people.

michael barbaro

Thank you, Nick.

nicholas fandos

Thanks for having me, Michael.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) How did Ambassador Sondland get there? You know, this is not a man who had any qualifications except one. He wrote a check for a million dollars.

michael barbaro

In the fifth Democratic presidential debate, candidates expressed outrage over Wednesday’s testimony in the impeachment inquiry, with Senator Elizabeth Warren accusing President Trump of selling off key ambassadorships to wealthy donors like Gordon Sondland.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) And that tells us about what’s happening in Washington.

michael barbaro

But with Mayor Pete Buttigieg now leading the polls in Iowa, the first state to pick a Democratic nominee, several of his rivals, including Senator Amy Klobuchar, sought to challenge his credentials and experience.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) Just like I have won statewide, and Mayor, I have all appreciation for your good work as a local official, and you did not when you tried, I also have actually done this work. I think experience should matter.

michael barbaro

Buttigieg fired back, suggesting that the federal experience of his opponent was its own liability.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) So first of all, Washington experience is not the only experience that matters. There’s more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage. And where are we right now as a country? [CHEERING]

Biden Jr. should not take support from African-Americans for granted.

Mr. Biden’s strength with black voters has been a key force in helping him maintain a polling edge in the race, even as the candidacies of Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont ascended among progressives. But on Thursday, both challengers — as well as Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, two black candidates in the race, and other contenders — made explicit appeals about how they would address concerns and priorities of black voters.

Ms. Warren, who is Mr. Biden’s leading rival in many state and national polls, took direct aim at his reliance on black support by delivering one of her biggest speeches of the campaign, describing how governments and powerful corporations use racism and racial injustice as a wedge to divide working-class people. And she argued that it was time for the nation’s policies to include specific correctives to address discrimination.

“Don’t talk about race-neutral laws,” she said at a rally on Thursday evening at Clark Atlanta University, a historically black institution. “The federal government helped create the racial divide in this country through decades of active, state-sponsored discrimination, and that means the federal government has a responsibility to fix it.”"

I remember in history class, must have been a junior, it was during the impeachment process of President Clinton or all the scandal, everything that was going on. And I remember the teacher was just kind of riffing on this, and he said, you know, would anybody here ever want to be president or want to run for office, seeing what a mess and what an ugly place Washington was? And I just — maybe involuntarily, my hand went up. And from then on, it became that the running joke of the class that I’d wind up running for president. And then by the time I got to college, they had this Institute of Politics at Harvard, and every day, there’d be a different speaker who would come through. And I remember when I was there as a freshman, people like Donna Brazile who had just come off managing the Gore campaign and Rick Davis, who had done the same thing for McCain. And the former president of Ecuador, he’d been deposed in a coup. You’d just kind of hang around and watch them and see what they were like. The biggest realization was that they’re just people. These people who were shaping the world, people I was seeing on TV were obviously very impressive people, but they were just people. I think it changed my awareness of the fact that, on some level, I could be part of that world, too. But in a very simple sense, especially coming from Indiana, it seemed that it was a choice. You could be in elected office, or you could be an out gay person, not both, at least not where I was from. From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

Pete Buttigieg. It’s Friday, November 22. So Jeremy Peters, you cover politics for The Times, and you’ve been closely tracking Mayor Buttigieg. And in order to better understand the Democratic field of presidential candidates, we’re trying to figure out the most revealing moments in their lives. So when it comes to Pete Buttigieg, what moment should we focus on?

jeremy peters

Well, Mayor Pete has always been a candidate for whom his story, his biography is very central to his appeal to voters, and he’s got a great story to tell. He’s been elected mayor of this medium-sized town in Indiana before turning 30. He has an Ivy League pedigree. He’s been a Rhodes Scholar. He’s worked at a prestigious consulting firm. He’s gone off to Afghanistan as part of the Navy Reserves. So he has all of these components that you kind of think if you’re a voter, wow, he really stands out. There’s something unique about this guy. But at the same time, for most of his adult life, he had this nagging secret, the secret that he couldn’t confront because he thought that it would mean the end to this political career that he had spent so much time perfecting, basically since he went away to college and decided, hey, you know, I can run for president. And he doesn’t see how it’s possible for the politician with the perfect background, the perfect resume to also be open about their sexuality, in his case. So how he reconciles this inner turmoil with his very public ambition I think is a defining moment in his life, if not the defining moment.

michael barbaro

All right. Welcome to the studio.

pete buttigieg

Thank you.

michael barbaro

You’re going to sit there.

pete buttigieg

All right.

jeremy peters

So that story begins in 1982 in South Bend, Indiana where Peter Buttigieg was born.

michael barbaro

Mayor, tell me about the kind of kid that you were, growing up in Indiana?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think I was, safe to say, a little on the nerdy side. I lived in a neighborhood kind of in the middle of South Bend, close to a park where you would have as much as possible what you’d call a prototypical Midwestern kid’s upbringing, you know, playing in the park with friends, a lot of time in the house. I was really interested in baseball cards, but I was more interested in categorizing them than I was in baseball, I think. I loved science and science fiction. I loved reading, plus I was an only child. So I think it’s safe to say I had a lot of interior life going on in a fairly quiet house where it was a dog and my parents, who were both academics, and me.

michael barbaro

What was your introduction to even the idea of politics?

pete buttigieg

Politics was always in the air in our house just because my parents were very politically passionate. They really cared about what was happening. I can remember the Democratic Convention. It must have been 1988.

archived recording NBC News continues its coverage of America’s convention.

pete buttigieg

I would’ve been six years old and my parents explaining what a convention was. I remember Jesse Jackson giving a speech.

archived recording (jesse jackson) When I look out at this convention, I see the face of America — red, yellow, brown, black, and white. We are all precious in God’s sight, the real rainbow coalition.

pete buttigieg

And I remember my parents thinking it was important to watch the Republican Convention, too. I mean, you would stop — even though I don’t it ever crossed their mind to ever vote for a Republican.

archived recording Now let’s go down to the podium. Here is George Herbert Walker Bush addressing his convention.

pete buttigieg

Everything in the house would kind of stop when it was time to watch what was playing out.

archived recording Thank you.

michael barbaro

At what moment in this early phase of your life did you go from just watching this and maybe finding it very fascinating to feeling really drawn to it?

pete buttigieg

Well, when I got to college, it felt like the Republicans and the Democrats, at the time, it’s crazy to think about now, polarized as we are. But what it felt like when I showed up as a freshman on campus was that the two parties were converging and not necessarily in a good place, that you had this kind of center-right and center-left, both of them very committed to growth in business, but it seemed not very committed at all to some of the questions of how we take care of vulnerable people around the country. And I think there’s a moment for any kind of well-spoken or intelligent young person watching the news when you see a senator or a candidate saying something or doing something and you think, well, that’s not right. I could do that. I could do it different. Now, you might be wrong. They might be way more sophisticated than you are, and you can’t see it. Or you might be right, and it might well be the case that what they’re saying is just not right. But I certainly had that feeling reinforced when I saw these figures come to campus, some of whom were extremely impressive, but none of whom seemed like they were on a different plane of existence. They were just people.

michael barbaro

So at this point, a year or two into Harvard, have you made up your mind that you were probably going to find a way to have a career in politics?

pete buttigieg

I knew I wanted a career that involved policy. I don’t think I’d figured out for sure that that meant running. Plus, you know, when I thought about it, even well before I was coming to terms with the fact that I was gay, I knew that I had no political connections at home. I had an unpronounceable name, and I was a Democrat who lived in Indiana. So it was not obvious that I could overcome some of the obstacles toward running. But I think it’s safe to say by the time I graduated, I had some sense that I could see myself doing it.

michael barbaro

Well, I want to talk to you about that realization of your sexuality in particular. Obviously, your candidacy is historic in a couple of different ways, and among those is the fact you’re the first major party presidential candidate who is openly gay. And so I want to ask you about that part of your identity. When did you sense that you were gay? When did that realization start to dawn on you?

pete buttigieg

I think it depends what you mean by realization, right? There are things you could point to going way back, certainly a fascination I had with a classmate when I was about 12 that, in hindsight, is very obviously a crush. But I was not willing to think of it that way, although some part of me must have — I mean, I wasn’t stupid either, right? So you have this kind of awareness that was definitely there by the time I was hitting middle school. But taking a word like gay and applying it to myself, I was still years away from being able to do that, even in my own mind.

michael barbaro

Well, what did you do with those feelings?

pete buttigieg

I guess I packed them up, yeah.

michael barbaro

Packed them up —

pete buttigieg

Not much would be the best answer.

michael barbaro

Pack them up and put them where?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I don’t know how these things work, even in your own mind. I just didn’t explore them. That’s for sure. First of all, there were not a lot of out gay people that I knew as such growing up. I mean, in high school, it was exactly zero. There was just no sense of gay life or a gay community. And when I got to college, that’s when the kind of internal battle was starting to heat up.

michael barbaro

Why?

pete buttigieg

I think because you just can’t escape it. I mean, my god, you’re in college, right? I mean, any feelings you have, especially in the romantic department, are going to start asserting themselves even more fiercely than they have when you get to college. For a lot of people, it’s a big part of what you spend college on.

michael barbaro

Right. So how did you deal with it?

pete buttigieg

Same way I dealt with it up to then, just packed it away. Dated women, remarkable women. Because I enjoyed these relationships, I think I could defer facing the fact that that wasn’t the same as what it was to be in love with somebody.

michael barbaro

And your political ambition was already solid at that point?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I still didn’t know exactly where it would take me or what it would mean, but I think by then, I knew that there was a good chance I was going to be running for office in my adult life. But at that point, I’m still clinging to some kind of hope, however vanishing, that maybe I’m straight or I’m bisexual and I can just not worry about the gay part. I think when I thought about my career, certainly when I talked about my future and how I was going to be involved, I wasn’t even thinking about the possibility that that would come into contact with this developing side of me. But I’m sure to the extent that I thought what it would mean to come to terms with the fact that I was at very least different and, as became increasingly clear, gay, that one of the things that would have kept that in its corner was the simple fact that that didn’t fit with any of the other things I wanted to do in life, not just a career, but a family. I wanted to get married. I wanted to have kids. From my perspective, you could be married and have kids or you could be gay, not both.

michael barbaro

You graduated in 2004. That — correct me if I’m wrong. That’s the year when Massachusetts —

pete buttigieg

That’s right.

michael barbaro

— legalizes gay marriage.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

archived recording The court today, as you know, in a 4-3 advisory opinion to the Senate has a rule that in a November 18, 2003 decision, they meant marriage. They meant equality. They meant that the Commonwealth may no longer deny marriage rights to same-sex couples, including —

michael barbaro

So I say that only to try to understand, are you falling behind the culture, in a sense? Are you ignoring some of the signs that these things are changing?

archived recording Marriage and only marriage will be enough to satisfy the requirements of the Massachusetts Constitution.

pete buttigieg

Well, the thing is I wasn’t from Massachusetts. I was in Massachusetts for a while, but I never felt like I was from there. And nothing against Massachusetts, but I realized pretty quick after turning up at Harvard that I didn’t belong there either.

michael barbaro

Why not?

pete buttigieg

It was just — it was just a different culture. I didn’t realize that. I didn’t realize that I was Midwestern until I left the Midwest. And just little things, cultural things, the way — I don’t know, the way people interact, what’s expected of you. Once I got there, I realized that socially, I was way more Midwestern than I thought.

michael barbaro

So take me from graduating from Harvard to your decision to join the Navy Reserves.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so it starts with 9/11. Actually, it starts before 9/11. There’s this family tradition of serving in the military. There’s a painting hanging on the wall of my parents’ house of a relative, a great uncle who I kind of idolized in theory. He was an Army Air Corps pilot. And so I had this idea, this maybe romantic idea, of being in the military, and then it never really became real. But I remember on 9/11 thinking, oh, well, war isn’t just a thing that happens in other places or in other periods of history. Like, war has come to my generation, and thinking, at least in the back of my head, that that might mean I would be involved, but not taking any steps to do that. But that turned into more and more of a nagging feeling when some friends of mine started to serve. A friend of mine from college shared with me just before we graduated that he had decided to join the Navy Reserve. I was fascinated. And then when I was talking to someone about applying for the Rhodes Scholarship and how I wanted to talk about my interest in public service and to the faculty member who was giving advice to students, and just said, pointedly, like, you might want to really think about how you’re going to say that, knowing that you’re going to be competing against people from the military academies. Oh yeah, that’s true. Like, my chest thumping about caring about public service feels a lot smaller held up against what others are doing.

michael barbaro

Do you think that was one of the things that might have drawn you to military service, knowing that to get a Rhodes, to be in that world, in that league, you know, it might be a good thing?

pete buttigieg

I think definitely that it was part of how you’re true to a culture of service. And also the Kennedy presidency kind of hangs over certainly the Kennedy School, as you might imagine. And that can’t be separated from his military career.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

I mean, really, it was almost an expectation that you would’ve served, up until roughly the time when I came of age when everything shifted.

michael barbaro

An expectation that you would serve —

pete buttigieg

Well, when you’re looking at the history of the people we were studying —

michael barbaro

Of presidents.

pete buttigieg

— who have made history. Yep, as presidents. And then the thing that put me over the top was this experience knocking on doors in Iowa with a couple of buddies from college who went out. We took a week off and rented a car, and it was the last few days before the Iowa caucuses, and we were volunteers for Obama. They sent us to this very rural area, some of the lowest income counties in Iowa. And it felt like any time I met a young — especially young man — it was somebody who was serving or was about to serve. And I started to realize, we had service that used to be something that bridged people together. Now it’s completely different, that if you were rural or low-income, you were highly likely to serve. If you were from a background like mine, which was middle class economically, but I’d had the chance to go to an institution like Harvard, almost nobody with that background was serving. And I began to feel like it wasn’t just this kind of thing I thought about that I hadn’t gotten around to. It was that I was part of the problem. I was part of the divide. That was the thing that kind of propelled me that last few inches toward being ready to yank open the door of the recruiting office in Indiana and say, hey, how do I sign up?

michael barbaro

I wondered, do you think you joined the military in part because you knew what it would mean for a political career?

pete buttigieg

You know, I wrestled with that because as soon as I get that question, there’s a part of me that thinks, if the answer is yes, does that mean the service wasn’t pure in some way? And I remember at the time asking myself if being in the military was as unpopular as it is today popular, would I still do it? And I want to believe the answer is yes, but there’s no way to go back and prove it. I’m not somebody who thinks that it’s, like, a prerequisite that if you want to run for office you need to have served. But I do think if you have a heart for elected office, one way to put your money where your mouth is to have been in that kind of service, too.

michael barbaro

That strikes me as a very candid answer because of course, you could just say, well, of course I would have done it, even if there was no possible —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

— political benefit.

pete buttigieg

And I want to say that. I just can’t prove it.

michael barbaro

So I want to talk about this run for mayor for just a little bit. Whenever you run for office, your character is on display. And at this point, you are keeping something quite elemental about yourself secret. Did it feel like you were hiding something?

pete buttigieg

Not really. The only time it felt that way was when there was small talk about whether I was dating, and I would crack a joke or something. We’d be sitting in a studio like this one and a radio host would ask a question. And I’d say, well, if anybody listening is into economic policy and long walks on the beach, go ahead and reach out and just kind of play the busy single person, which is what I was, except for the fact that I wasn’t actively looking for love. I was going out of my way to avoid it. But if somebody who is straight up asked me on the record, to this day, I’m not sure what I would have done.

michael barbaro

Do you think that that would have potentially cost you the mayoralty, might have kept you from being mayor or staying mayor?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I think there’s a good chance of it. There’s a reason why no — as far as I know, no out gay person had ever run for mayor of any place in Indiana.

michael barbaro

This is a state with strong Christian values, and —

pete buttigieg

— not known for progressive social outlooks on politics. And here I am, rocking up, 29 years old saying, trust me, support me. Never mind this state legislator who has earned tons of credibility in this community. Never mind this county councilman who’s the party favorite. Go with me instead. If there had been anything that looked like a skeleton or a vulnerability, I think it probably would have sunk me before I got anywhere at all.

michael barbaro

So I want to now move into this notion of you reconciling these things.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so when I first joined the Reserve, the message was kind of you’re pretty much going to go to one of these wars, and we’ll let you know which one. And so I knew that, at a certain point, it was coming. And of course, I didn’t want to take office in South Bend without a plan for this. So we had gamed it out with my team, if I get orders, here’s what you do. And when I received my orders and knew I was going for sure, I don’t think even then it occurred to me that it would have much to do with my sexuality. If anything, I was thankful that I was single, right? The hardest thing for people to deploy is the fact that you’re leaving behind somebody you love, in addition to all the professional complications. But then, the more I started getting mentally ready for going over and really thinking about what it meant, the more it started weighing on me that I didn’t have a — wasn’t coming back to a family, my parents, of course, but I wasn’t coming back to a household. And more than that, I had no idea what it was like to be in love. And the idea that I’m — here I am. I’m a grown-ass man. I own a home. I’m the mayor of my city. I’m a military officer. And if I get killed over there, I will go to my grave not knowing what it’s like to be in love. And that just made me realize how untenable the situation I was in really was. And up until then, it didn’t seem untenable, I guess because I was so busy, and I might have deferred coming out and having a dating life forever, if not for this moment where I’m thinking, shit, I could die.

michael barbaro

You wrote a letter I want to ask you about.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, you know, it’s a thing you do. I assume everybody does it. I don’t know. But it’s the thing you do when you go to war, right? You want to make sure that you have the last word on your life and leave a few instructions. So I wrote up a letter, put an envelope, put just in case on the outside. Put it in the desk drawer, would’ve been pretty easy to find if worse comes to worst. And that’s a real moment, too, because you’re sitting there staring at the screen trying to figure out how to give a short accounting of your life.

michael barbaro

And what did you say?

pete buttigieg

Well, what I said was that I wouldn’t want people to think that I’d been cheated, that obviously it’d be terrible if I didn’t come back, but I also had this amazing life where I have wonderful friendships, and I got to serve my community in a way that very few people get to do, let alone at my age, and that I’d had this very fulfilling life. And of course, it’d be too bad if something happened to me, but to keep that in perspective. But if you’re asking if there was, like, P.S. I’m gay, no.

michael barbaro

That’s kind of what I was asking. So you are deployed.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

You do not die.

pete buttigieg

Right.

michael barbaro

You come back, and you’re mayor.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

And how do you decide that it’s time to come out?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think by the time I hit the ground and I was back, I knew that I was going to come out and then it’s just — it was more how and when. I remember resenting the idea that you’re supposed to have to come out, right? Straight people don’t have to come out. Why do I? And then, while I’m in the process of figuring this out —

archived recording Thank you all for coming. It’s been a tough week here in the Hoosier state, but we’re going to move forward.

pete buttigieg

We have this explosive controversy over Mike Pence, the Governor Mike Pence and his so-called Religious Freedom bill.

archived recording The Religious Freedom Restoration Act was about religious liberty, not about discrimination.

pete buttigieg

So suddenly, we’re on national television, my state, as the most officially anti-gay state in the country. I’m fighting him on it, of course, because it’s a terrible policy. But now, I’m fighting this terrible, anti-gay policy putatively from the perspective of a straight ally, wondering whether I’m more effective because people don’t know that I’m gay. And at the same time, knowing that this just kind of speeds things up even more that, like, it’s just a really weird position to be in, to be having all these hypothetical arguments about discrimination against gay people, when it really means me. Meanwhile, this is also the period when we realize that soon the Supreme Court is going to weigh in on marriage. I mean, all of this was happening in that early part of 2015 while I’m wrestling with how to do this. And so oddly enough, it was — — as busy as I was as mayor. Military duty actually felt like, kind of almost like a break because it was eight hour days, 40 hour week. I wasn’t used to having that much time, and so is a lot of time to sit and write and think and call friends and get advice.

michael barbaro

So you produce a plan.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, well I produced a letter, an op-ed I guess.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. What was the essential line that I’m sure you remember that you wrote?

pete buttigieg

I remember saying that it’s just part of who I am and that it has no bearing on how I do my job, that the way I do my — did my job either as an officer or as a mayor or in business had nothing to do with the fact that I was gay and that —

michael barbaro

It still sounds a little defensive.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Or maybe a little scared.

pete buttigieg

Probably. Yeah, I mean, you know, I didn’t feel like I was coming out guns blazing. I felt like I — again, part of me was bothered that I had to share this at all. Then part of me knew that it would do some good if I did, I mean, not just in my own life. That I — my main agenda was, personally, I wanted to get out there and start dating. But also that it would mean something, might mean all kinds of things to a whole bunch of different people when I came out and said this.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording A very personal announcement coming from South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg today. In an essay published in today’s South Bend Tribune, the mayor announced he is gay. Currently in the midst of running for a second term, Pete Buttigieg penned an essay in Tuesday’s South Bend Tribune revealing he was gay. A lot of people wondering why he chose to make this announcement now. It comes just months after the state’s religious freedom law thrust the state into the national debate on gay rights. As for the mayor himself, he says nothing is different, nothing has changed, and his focus is on South Bend.

michael barbaro

I want to talk about the timing, the exact moment of the op-ed because my sense is that at this phase of your career, you’re up for re-election, right? You’ve won the primary. And winning the primary, in a sense, means you’re standing a very good shot of winning.

pete buttigieg

Depending on the year, but yeah, in South Bend, it should be.

michael barbaro

So does that mean you deliberately chose a — like, a safe, low-risk time to do this?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I would think that going into a Democratic primary would be a safer time than going into a general election. And I think also the decision to do this came by way of realizing that there is no such thing as a safe time. I was just done with not having the kind of personal life that I wanted to have.

michael barbaro

So once you come out, how does your personal life change?

pete buttigieg

Well, I started dating, and that kind of changes everything. I mean, I still had this very demanding job. You’re the mayor, and so anybody in town that you ask to have a cup of coffee is —

michael barbaro

It’s a thing.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, it’s a thing. It might be misinterpreted. You could cross some line without meaning to. I mean, most of the people I interacted with were either people who needed something from me, people I needed something from or people who worked for me. So it’s not, like, a very healthy pool for dating is what I’m saying. And I remember thinking there were all these kind of city fathers who, early on in my time as mayor, seemed determined to fix me up with their daughters. And I remember just thinking, like, where are you now? Did none of you have, like, a son or a nephew or something? So I did what millennials do. I went online. Turns out there’s apps for all of this. There was O.K. Cupid, Tinder. The one that actually came through for me was called Hinge. And it’s supposed to serve up people that — I don’t know how the algorithm works. But I find this guy, this cute guy with a big smile, and I’m like, I want to know this guy. So we start chatting. Well, I was chatting with a lot of people, but obviously, he’s the one I remember because that was Chasten.

michael barbaro

Your future husband.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

michael barbaro

So your story, to many people, is particularly compelling one, everything we just discussed. You are a Harvard graduate, a Rhodes Scholar, you’re a veteran. You’re gay. You’re religious. And from your own description of yourself, it feels like you have been thinking about politics and preparing, to some degree, to run for president for a very long time, even though you’re quite young. And I’m sure you understand this and have heard this. That has led to this perception of a person kind of, perhaps, orchestrating a political biography. Do you ever question whether that, no matter what your intention, is — could possibly undermine the power of the story itself, however genuine?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I mean, I think we’re conditioned to not like the idea of somebody who sat around thinking all their lives about how to become president. And I don’t view myself that way, although I get that that story has been written around me. Although, I also don’t know what it is we expect, that somebody kind of gets struck by lightning and then they turn into somebody who might become president. We all have these paths, right, that bring us to where we are. And I think anybody in professional life or even social life thinks about the story that you tell about yourself. At the end of the day, I’m not doing this because I have this personal need to be in elected office or to be the president. I’m not coming at the presidency as a thing that I’d like to occupy. I’m coming at it as this way to do something that I think I’m able to do. And I think it’s helpful in the sense that I could also have a very happy life doing something else. And oddly, I think that — that helps prepare me to do what’s required to do this. And this is advice I give talking to students, too. Imagine somebody is being sworn in, an ambitious, talented person kind of in the middle of their career is being sworn in as an assistant secretary in the State Department for the Middle East. And then imagine if that person has got there one of two ways. In kind of universe A, it’s a person who woke up one day in high school and said, I want to be the assistant secretary for the Middle East, and took the right courses and got the right jobs and had the right fellowships and wrote the right papers and did everything in order to occupy that title. And the other person is somebody who said, I — woke up in high school and said, I want to be the person who makes the United States a force toward peace in the Middle East. And they don’t know what that’s going to mean, and maybe it means they start out becoming an activist or maybe they’re an academic or maybe they’re a civil servant or whatever. But by whatever winding path, they wind up in this job, right? Which of those two scenarios is going to lead to somebody who’s better equipped to take that job they’ve been handed? I’ve got to think it’s the latter. And so what I’ve tried to do in my life is to prepare myself to be useful to others. And yes, I think that, in all likelihood, means in a form that involves holding office or seeking office or at least public life where I speak to lots of people, sometimes millions at the same time. But it’s not about, necessarily, having one title or another. And so I think if you overthink it, that’s where you start to lose the fidelity to what it is that would guide you when you actually get what you’ve been chasing for a long time. Jeremy, what do we learn from Mayor Pete Buttigieg about the way he reconciled his political ambition with this essential fact about himself that he feared would endanger that ambition?

jeremy peters

I think we learn a lot about his decision-making process, not just how he internalizes decisions personally, but how he thinks about them in the longer arc of a political career. And he’s been very intentional all along the way about choosing certain endeavors that he thinks would benefit a long-term political career. Now some people would think, on the one hand, that’s too calculating. I don’t want somebody who’s thought about being president since he was a teenager. And, you know, in the era when voters seemed to prize authenticity in their political figures, they could see that as inauthentic. On the other hand, the decision that he made to wait seems to have borne out to his benefit. I mean, here he is, the first openly gay candidate for president of the United States who has a legitimate shot at being his party’s nominee. Look at where he is in the Democratic primary right now. He’s rocketed to the top of the polls. He’s brought in all this money in large part because he’s gay, and that opened a lot of doors with Democratic donors. He’s heading into the Iowa caucuses in the lead by some measures. But we won’t know if his decision to wait actually was the right one until people start voting. So it seems to have worked out well for him right now, but no one’s cast a single vote. And we don’t know how voters in the Democratic primary are going to react. We certainly don’t know how voters in a general election are going to react. So we’re just not going to know until Democratic voters have their say.

michael barbaro

Mayor, when you think back to your younger self —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Not just your teenage self, but even your college self and your post-collegiate self who was so fearful about telling the world that you were gay, what do you kind of wish you could tell that person, that version of Mayor Buttigieg?

pete buttigieg

Well, back then, I would have thought this other fact, if I dared to unpack it, this fact about my life, this way in which I was different, was the thing that could multiply all the other stuff by zero, in terms of the impact I was going to have in the world, that I might very well choose that path, but that the price would be that I wouldn’t get to make a difference in public life. And if you want proof of God having a sense of humor, one of the things I’m seeing now, especially in the interactions I have on the campaign trail and the fact that this campaign is historic in a lot of ways, is that that same fact that I thought would mean never getting to this point might actually be one of the things that makes it matter the most.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

It’s a strange thing to think about that the one thing that I couldn’t control, the one thing that might have meant that it would be better not to have any aspirations related to politics at all could be the very thing that anchors the moral and emotional purpose of this entire campaign.

michael barbaro

Thank you very much.

pete buttigieg

Thanks for having me.

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (fiona hill) And I did say to him, Ambassador Sondland, Gordon, I think this is all going to blow up, and here we are.

michael barbaro

In the latest public testimony before impeachment investigators, Fiona Hill, the former top Russia expert on the National Security Council, recalled her growing frustration with Ambassador Gordon Sondland, as she realized he was pursuing a political agenda in Ukraine on behalf of President Trump.

archived recording (fiona hill) He was being involved in a domestic, political errand, and we were being involved in national security foreign policy and those two things have just diverged.

michael barbaro

Hill testified that when Trump and Sondland pressed Ukraine to investigate the discredited theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, they were playing directly into Russia’s hands, since Russia wants to deflect attention away from its interference.

archived recording (fiona hill) This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves. These fictions are harmful, even if they’re deployed for purely domestic, political purposes.

Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union set to testify in a public hearing Wednesday, has a lot of explaining to do.",2019-11-20,The New York Times,Why Discrepancies in Gordon Sondland’s Testimony in the Impeachment Inquiry Loom Large,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/us/politics/sondland-impeachment-testimony.html,"“Impeachment by its nature, it’s a political process.” “What people think is going to happen can turn out to be very different from what happens.” “Because it has to do with elected officials holding another elected official to account for their conduct.” When the framers of the Constitution created a process to remove a president from office, they were well … kind of vague. So to understand how it’s going to play out, the past is really our best guide. “I think we’re just all in for a really crazy ride.” Collectively, these New York Times reporters have covered U.S. politics for over 150 years. “I’m also a drummer in a band, so …” They’ve reported on past impeachment inquiries. “Yea, I’m lost in Senate wonderland.” And they say that the three we’ve had so far have been full of twists and turns. “The president of the United States is not guilty as charged.” In short, expect the unexpected. First, the process. Impeachment is technically only the initial stage. “Common misconceptions about impeachment are that impeachment by itself means removal from office. It doesn’t. The impeachment part of the process is only the indictment that sets up a trial.” The Constitution describes offenses that are grounds for removing the president from office as bribery, treason and — “They say high crimes and misdemeanors, which, really, is in the eye of the beholder.” “The framers didn’t give us a guidebook to it. They simply said, that the House had the responsibility for impeachment and the Senate had the responsibility for the trial.” One of the things missing from the Constitution? How an impeachment inquiry should start. And that has generally been a source of drama. Basically, anything goes. “In fact, in the Andrew Johnson case they voted to impeach him without even having drafted the articles of impeachment.” For Richard Nixon, his case started with several investigations that led to public hearings. That part of the process went on for two years, and yielded revelation after revelation, connecting Nixon to a politically-motivated burglary at D.N.C. headquarters — “… located in the Watergate office building.” — and its subsequent cover-up. “Mr. Butterfield, are you aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the president?” “I was aware of listening devices. Yes, sir.” “This was a shocker. Everybody in the White House recognized how damaging this could be.” As the House drafted articles of impeachment, Nixon lost the support of his party. “O.K., I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.” “I was asked to write the farewell piece that ran the morning after Nixon resigned. And this is what I wrote: The central question is how a man who won so much could have lost so much.” So for Nixon, it more or less ended after the investigations. But for Bill Clinton, that phase was just the beginning. “This is the information.” An independent counsel’s investigation into his business dealings unexpectedly turned into a very public inquiry about his personal life. “The idea that a president of the United States was having an affair with a White House intern and then a federal prosecutor was looking at that, it was just extraordinary.” That investigation led to public hearings in the House Judiciary Committee. “When the Starr Report was being delivered to Congress it was a little bit like the O.J. chase, only a political one. There were two black cars. They were being filmed live on CNN. They were heading towards the Capitol. We were watching it and a little bit agog.” Public opinion is key. And the media plays a huge part in the process. This was definitely true for Clinton. “You know it was just a crazy time. We worked in the Senate press gallery.” “All your colleagues are kind of piled on top of each other.” “We had crummy computers, the fax machine would always break. The printer would always break.” After committee hearings, the House brought formal impeachment charges. “It was very tense. I thought that the Saturday of the impeachment vote in the House was one of the most tense days I’d experienced in Washington.” And it turned out, also, full of surprises. “The day of impeachment arrived, everyone’s making very impassioned speeches about whether Bill Clinton should or should not be impeached and Livingston rises to give an argument for the House Republicans. He started to talk about how Clinton could resign.” “You, sir, may resign your post.” “And all of a sudden people start booing and saying, ‘Resign, resign’!” “So I must set the example.” “He announced he was resigning because he had had extramarital affairs and challenged President Clinton to do the only honorable thing, in his view —” “I hope President Clinton will follow.” “— to resign as well, so there was all this drama unfolding even in the midst of impeachment.” Then it went to the Senate for trial. The Constitution gets a little more specific about this part. “The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is supposed to preside over that trial.” “Rehnquist, he showed up in this robe he had made for himself, which had gold stripes on the sleeves because he liked Gilbert and Sullivan.” “The Senate is the actual jury.” “You will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws. So help you, God.” “This is a copy of the rules of the Senate for handling impeachment. They’re actually very specific.” “Meet six days a week.” “Convene at noon. The senators have to sit at their desks and remain quiet in their role as jurors. And not talk, which trust me, is going to be a problem for some of the senators who are used to talking all the time.” It’s just like a courtroom trial. There are prosecutors who present the case against the president. “That was perjury.” Only, they’re members of the House, and they’re called managers. Then the senators, or the jurors, vote. And things are still, unpredictable. “The options are guilty or not guilty. But there was one senator —” “Arlen Specter, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania.” “Under Scottish law, there are three possible verdicts: guilty, not guilty and not proved.” “— which is not a thing.” “And everybody just looks, you know, how do you even record that vote?” In the end, there were not enough votes to oust Clinton. “What’s amazing about this whole thing to me wasn’t so much the constitutional process. It was that it felt to me like the beginning of really intense partisanship, the weaponization of partisanship.” And here’s the thing: An impeachment charge has never gotten the two-thirds majority it needs in the Senate to actually oust a president from office. “So you could end up having a situation where the president is impeached, acquitted and runs for re-election and wins re-election.” And that would be a first. “This is my ticket to the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. I don’t think you’ll find these on StubHub.”"

I remember in history class, must have been a junior, it was during the impeachment process of President Clinton or all the scandal, everything that was going on. And I remember the teacher was just kind of riffing on this, and he said, you know, would anybody here ever want to be president or want to run for office, seeing what a mess and what an ugly place Washington was? And I just — maybe involuntarily, my hand went up. And from then on, it became that the running joke of the class that I’d wind up running for president. And then by the time I got to college, they had this Institute of Politics at Harvard, and every day, there’d be a different speaker who would come through. And I remember when I was there as a freshman, people like Donna Brazile who had just come off managing the Gore campaign and Rick Davis, who had done the same thing for McCain. And the former president of Ecuador, he’d been deposed in a coup. You’d just kind of hang around and watch them and see what they were like. The biggest realization was that they’re just people. These people who were shaping the world, people I was seeing on TV were obviously very impressive people, but they were just people. I think it changed my awareness of the fact that, on some level, I could be part of that world, too. But in a very simple sense, especially coming from Indiana, it seemed that it was a choice. You could be in elected office, or you could be an out gay person, not both, at least not where I was from. From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

Pete Buttigieg. It’s Friday, November 22. So Jeremy Peters, you cover politics for The Times, and you’ve been closely tracking Mayor Buttigieg. And in order to better understand the Democratic field of presidential candidates, we’re trying to figure out the most revealing moments in their lives. So when it comes to Pete Buttigieg, what moment should we focus on?

jeremy peters

Well, Mayor Pete has always been a candidate for whom his story, his biography is very central to his appeal to voters, and he’s got a great story to tell. He’s been elected mayor of this medium-sized town in Indiana before turning 30. He has an Ivy League pedigree. He’s been a Rhodes Scholar. He’s worked at a prestigious consulting firm. He’s gone off to Afghanistan as part of the Navy Reserves. So he has all of these components that you kind of think if you’re a voter, wow, he really stands out. There’s something unique about this guy. But at the same time, for most of his adult life, he had this nagging secret, the secret that he couldn’t confront because he thought that it would mean the end to this political career that he had spent so much time perfecting, basically since he went away to college and decided, hey, you know, I can run for president. And he doesn’t see how it’s possible for the politician with the perfect background, the perfect resume to also be open about their sexuality, in his case. So how he reconciles this inner turmoil with his very public ambition I think is a defining moment in his life, if not the defining moment.

michael barbaro

All right. Welcome to the studio.

pete buttigieg

Thank you.

michael barbaro

You’re going to sit there.

pete buttigieg

All right.

jeremy peters

So that story begins in 1982 in South Bend, Indiana where Peter Buttigieg was born.

michael barbaro

Mayor, tell me about the kind of kid that you were, growing up in Indiana?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think I was, safe to say, a little on the nerdy side. I lived in a neighborhood kind of in the middle of South Bend, close to a park where you would have as much as possible what you’d call a prototypical Midwestern kid’s upbringing, you know, playing in the park with friends, a lot of time in the house. I was really interested in baseball cards, but I was more interested in categorizing them than I was in baseball, I think. I loved science and science fiction. I loved reading, plus I was an only child. So I think it’s safe to say I had a lot of interior life going on in a fairly quiet house where it was a dog and my parents, who were both academics, and me.

michael barbaro

What was your introduction to even the idea of politics?

pete buttigieg

Politics was always in the air in our house just because my parents were very politically passionate. They really cared about what was happening. I can remember the Democratic Convention. It must have been 1988.

archived recording NBC News continues its coverage of America’s convention.

pete buttigieg

I would’ve been six years old and my parents explaining what a convention was. I remember Jesse Jackson giving a speech.

archived recording (jesse jackson) When I look out at this convention, I see the face of America — red, yellow, brown, black, and white. We are all precious in God’s sight, the real rainbow coalition.

pete buttigieg

And I remember my parents thinking it was important to watch the Republican Convention, too. I mean, you would stop — even though I don’t it ever crossed their mind to ever vote for a Republican.

archived recording Now let’s go down to the podium. Here is George Herbert Walker Bush addressing his convention.

pete buttigieg

Everything in the house would kind of stop when it was time to watch what was playing out.

archived recording Thank you.

michael barbaro

At what moment in this early phase of your life did you go from just watching this and maybe finding it very fascinating to feeling really drawn to it?

pete buttigieg

Well, when I got to college, it felt like the Republicans and the Democrats, at the time, it’s crazy to think about now, polarized as we are. But what it felt like when I showed up as a freshman on campus was that the two parties were converging and not necessarily in a good place, that you had this kind of center-right and center-left, both of them very committed to growth in business, but it seemed not very committed at all to some of the questions of how we take care of vulnerable people around the country. And I think there’s a moment for any kind of well-spoken or intelligent young person watching the news when you see a senator or a candidate saying something or doing something and you think, well, that’s not right. I could do that. I could do it different. Now, you might be wrong. They might be way more sophisticated than you are, and you can’t see it. Or you might be right, and it might well be the case that what they’re saying is just not right. But I certainly had that feeling reinforced when I saw these figures come to campus, some of whom were extremely impressive, but none of whom seemed like they were on a different plane of existence. They were just people.

michael barbaro

So at this point, a year or two into Harvard, have you made up your mind that you were probably going to find a way to have a career in politics?

pete buttigieg

I knew I wanted a career that involved policy. I don’t think I’d figured out for sure that that meant running. Plus, you know, when I thought about it, even well before I was coming to terms with the fact that I was gay, I knew that I had no political connections at home. I had an unpronounceable name, and I was a Democrat who lived in Indiana. So it was not obvious that I could overcome some of the obstacles toward running. But I think it’s safe to say by the time I graduated, I had some sense that I could see myself doing it.

michael barbaro

Well, I want to talk to you about that realization of your sexuality in particular. Obviously, your candidacy is historic in a couple of different ways, and among those is the fact you’re the first major party presidential candidate who is openly gay. And so I want to ask you about that part of your identity. When did you sense that you were gay? When did that realization start to dawn on you?

pete buttigieg

I think it depends what you mean by realization, right? There are things you could point to going way back, certainly a fascination I had with a classmate when I was about 12 that, in hindsight, is very obviously a crush. But I was not willing to think of it that way, although some part of me must have — I mean, I wasn’t stupid either, right? So you have this kind of awareness that was definitely there by the time I was hitting middle school. But taking a word like gay and applying it to myself, I was still years away from being able to do that, even in my own mind.

michael barbaro

Well, what did you do with those feelings?

pete buttigieg

I guess I packed them up, yeah.

michael barbaro

Packed them up —

pete buttigieg

Not much would be the best answer.

michael barbaro

Pack them up and put them where?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I don’t know how these things work, even in your own mind. I just didn’t explore them. That’s for sure. First of all, there were not a lot of out gay people that I knew as such growing up. I mean, in high school, it was exactly zero. There was just no sense of gay life or a gay community. And when I got to college, that’s when the kind of internal battle was starting to heat up.

michael barbaro

Why?

pete buttigieg

I think because you just can’t escape it. I mean, my god, you’re in college, right? I mean, any feelings you have, especially in the romantic department, are going to start asserting themselves even more fiercely than they have when you get to college. For a lot of people, it’s a big part of what you spend college on.

michael barbaro

Right. So how did you deal with it?

pete buttigieg

Same way I dealt with it up to then, just packed it away. Dated women, remarkable women. Because I enjoyed these relationships, I think I could defer facing the fact that that wasn’t the same as what it was to be in love with somebody.

michael barbaro

And your political ambition was already solid at that point?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I still didn’t know exactly where it would take me or what it would mean, but I think by then, I knew that there was a good chance I was going to be running for office in my adult life. But at that point, I’m still clinging to some kind of hope, however vanishing, that maybe I’m straight or I’m bisexual and I can just not worry about the gay part. I think when I thought about my career, certainly when I talked about my future and how I was going to be involved, I wasn’t even thinking about the possibility that that would come into contact with this developing side of me. But I’m sure to the extent that I thought what it would mean to come to terms with the fact that I was at very least different and, as became increasingly clear, gay, that one of the things that would have kept that in its corner was the simple fact that that didn’t fit with any of the other things I wanted to do in life, not just a career, but a family. I wanted to get married. I wanted to have kids. From my perspective, you could be married and have kids or you could be gay, not both.

michael barbaro

You graduated in 2004. That — correct me if I’m wrong. That’s the year when Massachusetts —

pete buttigieg

That’s right.

michael barbaro

— legalizes gay marriage.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

archived recording The court today, as you know, in a 4-3 advisory opinion to the Senate has a rule that in a November 18, 2003 decision, they meant marriage. They meant equality. They meant that the Commonwealth may no longer deny marriage rights to same-sex couples, including —

michael barbaro

So I say that only to try to understand, are you falling behind the culture, in a sense? Are you ignoring some of the signs that these things are changing?

archived recording Marriage and only marriage will be enough to satisfy the requirements of the Massachusetts Constitution.

pete buttigieg

Well, the thing is I wasn’t from Massachusetts. I was in Massachusetts for a while, but I never felt like I was from there. And nothing against Massachusetts, but I realized pretty quick after turning up at Harvard that I didn’t belong there either.

michael barbaro

Why not?

pete buttigieg

It was just — it was just a different culture. I didn’t realize that. I didn’t realize that I was Midwestern until I left the Midwest. And just little things, cultural things, the way — I don’t know, the way people interact, what’s expected of you. Once I got there, I realized that socially, I was way more Midwestern than I thought.

michael barbaro

So take me from graduating from Harvard to your decision to join the Navy Reserves.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so it starts with 9/11. Actually, it starts before 9/11. There’s this family tradition of serving in the military. There’s a painting hanging on the wall of my parents’ house of a relative, a great uncle who I kind of idolized in theory. He was an Army Air Corps pilot. And so I had this idea, this maybe romantic idea, of being in the military, and then it never really became real. But I remember on 9/11 thinking, oh, well, war isn’t just a thing that happens in other places or in other periods of history. Like, war has come to my generation, and thinking, at least in the back of my head, that that might mean I would be involved, but not taking any steps to do that. But that turned into more and more of a nagging feeling when some friends of mine started to serve. A friend of mine from college shared with me just before we graduated that he had decided to join the Navy Reserve. I was fascinated. And then when I was talking to someone about applying for the Rhodes Scholarship and how I wanted to talk about my interest in public service and to the faculty member who was giving advice to students, and just said, pointedly, like, you might want to really think about how you’re going to say that, knowing that you’re going to be competing against people from the military academies. Oh yeah, that’s true. Like, my chest thumping about caring about public service feels a lot smaller held up against what others are doing.

michael barbaro

Do you think that was one of the things that might have drawn you to military service, knowing that to get a Rhodes, to be in that world, in that league, you know, it might be a good thing?

pete buttigieg

I think definitely that it was part of how you’re true to a culture of service. And also the Kennedy presidency kind of hangs over certainly the Kennedy School, as you might imagine. And that can’t be separated from his military career.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

I mean, really, it was almost an expectation that you would’ve served, up until roughly the time when I came of age when everything shifted.

michael barbaro

An expectation that you would serve —

pete buttigieg

Well, when you’re looking at the history of the people we were studying —

michael barbaro

Of presidents.

pete buttigieg

— who have made history. Yep, as presidents. And then the thing that put me over the top was this experience knocking on doors in Iowa with a couple of buddies from college who went out. We took a week off and rented a car, and it was the last few days before the Iowa caucuses, and we were volunteers for Obama. They sent us to this very rural area, some of the lowest income counties in Iowa. And it felt like any time I met a young — especially young man — it was somebody who was serving or was about to serve. And I started to realize, we had service that used to be something that bridged people together. Now it’s completely different, that if you were rural or low-income, you were highly likely to serve. If you were from a background like mine, which was middle class economically, but I’d had the chance to go to an institution like Harvard, almost nobody with that background was serving. And I began to feel like it wasn’t just this kind of thing I thought about that I hadn’t gotten around to. It was that I was part of the problem. I was part of the divide. That was the thing that kind of propelled me that last few inches toward being ready to yank open the door of the recruiting office in Indiana and say, hey, how do I sign up?

michael barbaro

I wondered, do you think you joined the military in part because you knew what it would mean for a political career?

pete buttigieg

You know, I wrestled with that because as soon as I get that question, there’s a part of me that thinks, if the answer is yes, does that mean the service wasn’t pure in some way? And I remember at the time asking myself if being in the military was as unpopular as it is today popular, would I still do it? And I want to believe the answer is yes, but there’s no way to go back and prove it. I’m not somebody who thinks that it’s, like, a prerequisite that if you want to run for office you need to have served. But I do think if you have a heart for elected office, one way to put your money where your mouth is to have been in that kind of service, too.

michael barbaro

That strikes me as a very candid answer because of course, you could just say, well, of course I would have done it, even if there was no possible —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

— political benefit.

pete buttigieg

And I want to say that. I just can’t prove it.

michael barbaro

So I want to talk about this run for mayor for just a little bit. Whenever you run for office, your character is on display. And at this point, you are keeping something quite elemental about yourself secret. Did it feel like you were hiding something?

pete buttigieg

Not really. The only time it felt that way was when there was small talk about whether I was dating, and I would crack a joke or something. We’d be sitting in a studio like this one and a radio host would ask a question. And I’d say, well, if anybody listening is into economic policy and long walks on the beach, go ahead and reach out and just kind of play the busy single person, which is what I was, except for the fact that I wasn’t actively looking for love. I was going out of my way to avoid it. But if somebody who is straight up asked me on the record, to this day, I’m not sure what I would have done.

michael barbaro

Do you think that that would have potentially cost you the mayoralty, might have kept you from being mayor or staying mayor?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I think there’s a good chance of it. There’s a reason why no — as far as I know, no out gay person had ever run for mayor of any place in Indiana.

michael barbaro

This is a state with strong Christian values, and —

pete buttigieg

— not known for progressive social outlooks on politics. And here I am, rocking up, 29 years old saying, trust me, support me. Never mind this state legislator who has earned tons of credibility in this community. Never mind this county councilman who’s the party favorite. Go with me instead. If there had been anything that looked like a skeleton or a vulnerability, I think it probably would have sunk me before I got anywhere at all.

michael barbaro

So I want to now move into this notion of you reconciling these things.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so when I first joined the Reserve, the message was kind of you’re pretty much going to go to one of these wars, and we’ll let you know which one. And so I knew that, at a certain point, it was coming. And of course, I didn’t want to take office in South Bend without a plan for this. So we had gamed it out with my team, if I get orders, here’s what you do. And when I received my orders and knew I was going for sure, I don’t think even then it occurred to me that it would have much to do with my sexuality. If anything, I was thankful that I was single, right? The hardest thing for people to deploy is the fact that you’re leaving behind somebody you love, in addition to all the professional complications. But then, the more I started getting mentally ready for going over and really thinking about what it meant, the more it started weighing on me that I didn’t have a — wasn’t coming back to a family, my parents, of course, but I wasn’t coming back to a household. And more than that, I had no idea what it was like to be in love. And the idea that I’m — here I am. I’m a grown-ass man. I own a home. I’m the mayor of my city. I’m a military officer. And if I get killed over there, I will go to my grave not knowing what it’s like to be in love. And that just made me realize how untenable the situation I was in really was. And up until then, it didn’t seem untenable, I guess because I was so busy, and I might have deferred coming out and having a dating life forever, if not for this moment where I’m thinking, shit, I could die.

michael barbaro

You wrote a letter I want to ask you about.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, you know, it’s a thing you do. I assume everybody does it. I don’t know. But it’s the thing you do when you go to war, right? You want to make sure that you have the last word on your life and leave a few instructions. So I wrote up a letter, put an envelope, put just in case on the outside. Put it in the desk drawer, would’ve been pretty easy to find if worse comes to worst. And that’s a real moment, too, because you’re sitting there staring at the screen trying to figure out how to give a short accounting of your life.

michael barbaro

And what did you say?

pete buttigieg

Well, what I said was that I wouldn’t want people to think that I’d been cheated, that obviously it’d be terrible if I didn’t come back, but I also had this amazing life where I have wonderful friendships, and I got to serve my community in a way that very few people get to do, let alone at my age, and that I’d had this very fulfilling life. And of course, it’d be too bad if something happened to me, but to keep that in perspective. But if you’re asking if there was, like, P.S. I’m gay, no.

michael barbaro

That’s kind of what I was asking. So you are deployed.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

You do not die.

pete buttigieg

Right.

michael barbaro

You come back, and you’re mayor.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

And how do you decide that it’s time to come out?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think by the time I hit the ground and I was back, I knew that I was going to come out and then it’s just — it was more how and when. I remember resenting the idea that you’re supposed to have to come out, right? Straight people don’t have to come out. Why do I? And then, while I’m in the process of figuring this out —

archived recording Thank you all for coming. It’s been a tough week here in the Hoosier state, but we’re going to move forward.

pete buttigieg

We have this explosive controversy over Mike Pence, the Governor Mike Pence and his so-called Religious Freedom bill.

archived recording The Religious Freedom Restoration Act was about religious liberty, not about discrimination.

pete buttigieg

So suddenly, we’re on national television, my state, as the most officially anti-gay state in the country. I’m fighting him on it, of course, because it’s a terrible policy. But now, I’m fighting this terrible, anti-gay policy putatively from the perspective of a straight ally, wondering whether I’m more effective because people don’t know that I’m gay. And at the same time, knowing that this just kind of speeds things up even more that, like, it’s just a really weird position to be in, to be having all these hypothetical arguments about discrimination against gay people, when it really means me. Meanwhile, this is also the period when we realize that soon the Supreme Court is going to weigh in on marriage. I mean, all of this was happening in that early part of 2015 while I’m wrestling with how to do this. And so oddly enough, it was — — as busy as I was as mayor. Military duty actually felt like, kind of almost like a break because it was eight hour days, 40 hour week. I wasn’t used to having that much time, and so is a lot of time to sit and write and think and call friends and get advice.

michael barbaro

So you produce a plan.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, well I produced a letter, an op-ed I guess.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. What was the essential line that I’m sure you remember that you wrote?

pete buttigieg

I remember saying that it’s just part of who I am and that it has no bearing on how I do my job, that the way I do my — did my job either as an officer or as a mayor or in business had nothing to do with the fact that I was gay and that —

michael barbaro

It still sounds a little defensive.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Or maybe a little scared.

pete buttigieg

Probably. Yeah, I mean, you know, I didn’t feel like I was coming out guns blazing. I felt like I — again, part of me was bothered that I had to share this at all. Then part of me knew that it would do some good if I did, I mean, not just in my own life. That I — my main agenda was, personally, I wanted to get out there and start dating. But also that it would mean something, might mean all kinds of things to a whole bunch of different people when I came out and said this.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording A very personal announcement coming from South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg today. In an essay published in today’s South Bend Tribune, the mayor announced he is gay. Currently in the midst of running for a second term, Pete Buttigieg penned an essay in Tuesday’s South Bend Tribune revealing he was gay. A lot of people wondering why he chose to make this announcement now. It comes just months after the state’s religious freedom law thrust the state into the national debate on gay rights. As for the mayor himself, he says nothing is different, nothing has changed, and his focus is on South Bend.

michael barbaro

I want to talk about the timing, the exact moment of the op-ed because my sense is that at this phase of your career, you’re up for re-election, right? You’ve won the primary. And winning the primary, in a sense, means you’re standing a very good shot of winning.

pete buttigieg

Depending on the year, but yeah, in South Bend, it should be.

michael barbaro

So does that mean you deliberately chose a — like, a safe, low-risk time to do this?

I don’t know. I would think that going into a Democratic primary would be a safer time than going into a general election. And I think also the decision to do this came by way of realizing that there is no such thing as a safe time. I was just done with not having the kind of personal life that I wanted to have.

michael barbaro

So once you come out, how does your personal life change?

pete buttigieg

Well, I started dating, and that kind of changes everything. I mean, I still had this very demanding job. You’re the mayor, and so anybody in town that you ask to have a cup of coffee is —

michael barbaro

It’s a thing.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, it’s a thing. It might be misinterpreted. You could cross some line without meaning to. I mean, most of the people I interacted with were either people who needed something from me, people I needed something from or people who worked for me. So it’s not, like, a very healthy pool for dating is what I’m saying. And I remember thinking there were all these kind of city fathers who, early on in my time as mayor, seemed determined to fix me up with their daughters. And I remember just thinking, like, where are you now? Did none of you have, like, a son or a nephew or something? So I did what millennials do. I went online. Turns out there’s apps for all of this. There was O.K. Cupid, Tinder. The one that actually came through for me was called Hinge. And it’s supposed to serve up people that — I don’t know how the algorithm works. But I find this guy, this cute guy with a big smile, and I’m like, I want to know this guy. So we start chatting. Well, I was chatting with a lot of people, but obviously, he’s the one I remember because that was Chasten.

Your future husband.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

michael barbaro

So your story, to many people, is particularly compelling one, everything we just discussed. You are a Harvard graduate, a Rhodes Scholar, you’re a veteran. You’re gay. You’re religious. And from your own description of yourself, it feels like you have been thinking about politics and preparing, to some degree, to run for president for a very long time, even though you’re quite young. And I’m sure you understand this and have heard this. That has led to this perception of a person kind of, perhaps, orchestrating a political biography. Do you ever question whether that, no matter what your intention, is — could possibly undermine the power of the story itself, however genuine?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I mean, I think we’re conditioned to not like the idea of somebody who sat around thinking all their lives about how to become president. And I don’t view myself that way, although I get that that story has been written around me. Although, I also don’t know what it is we expect, that somebody kind of gets struck by lightning and then they turn into somebody who might become president. We all have these paths, right, that bring us to where we are. And I think anybody in professional life or even social life thinks about the story that you tell about yourself. At the end of the day, I’m not doing this because I have this personal need to be in elected office or to be the president. I’m not coming at the presidency as a thing that I’d like to occupy. I’m coming at it as this way to do something that I think I’m able to do. And I think it’s helpful in the sense that I could also have a very happy life doing something else. And oddly, I think that — that helps prepare me to do what’s required to do this. And this is advice I give talking to students, too. Imagine somebody is being sworn in, an ambitious, talented person kind of in the middle of their career is being sworn in as an assistant secretary in the State Department for the Middle East. And then imagine if that person has got there one of two ways. In kind of universe A, it’s a person who woke up one day in high school and said, I want to be the assistant secretary for the Middle East, and took the right courses and got the right jobs and had the right fellowships and wrote the right papers and did everything in order to occupy that title. And the other person is somebody who said, I — woke up in high school and said, I want to be the person who makes the United States a force toward peace in the Middle East. And they don’t know what that’s going to mean, and maybe it means they start out becoming an activist or maybe they’re an academic or maybe they’re a civil servant or whatever. But by whatever winding path, they wind up in this job, right? Which of those two scenarios is going to lead to somebody who’s better equipped to take that job they’ve been handed? I’ve got to think it’s the latter. And so what I’ve tried to do in my life is to prepare myself to be useful to others. And yes, I think that, in all likelihood, means in a form that involves holding office or seeking office or at least public life where I speak to lots of people, sometimes millions at the same time. But it’s not about, necessarily, having one title or another. And so I think if you overthink it, that’s where you start to lose the fidelity to what it is that would guide you when you actually get what you’ve been chasing for a long time. Jeremy, what do we learn from Mayor Pete Buttigieg about the way he reconciled his political ambition with this essential fact about himself that he feared would endanger that ambition?

jeremy peters

I think we learn a lot about his decision-making process, not just how he internalizes decisions personally, but how he thinks about them in the longer arc of a political career. And he’s been very intentional all along the way about choosing certain endeavors that he thinks would benefit a long-term political career. Now some people would think, on the one hand, that’s too calculating. I don’t want somebody who’s thought about being president since he was a teenager. And, you know, in the era when voters seemed to prize authenticity in their political figures, they could see that as inauthentic. On the other hand, the decision that he made to wait seems to have borne out to his benefit. I mean, here he is, the first openly gay candidate for president of the United States who has a legitimate shot at being his party’s nominee. Look at where he is in the Democratic primary right now. He’s rocketed to the top of the polls. He’s brought in all this money in large part because he’s gay, and that opened a lot of doors with Democratic donors. He’s heading into the Iowa caucuses in the lead by some measures. But we won’t know if his decision to wait actually was the right one until people start voting. So it seems to have worked out well for him right now, but no one’s cast a single vote. And we don’t know how voters in the Democratic primary are going to react. We certainly don’t know how voters in a general election are going to react. So we’re just not going to know until Democratic voters have their say.

michael barbaro

Mayor, when you think back to your younger self —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Not just your teenage self, but even your college self and your post-collegiate self who was so fearful about telling the world that you were gay, what do you kind of wish you could tell that person, that version of Mayor Buttigieg?

pete buttigieg

Well, back then, I would have thought this other fact, if I dared to unpack it, this fact about my life, this way in which I was different, was the thing that could multiply all the other stuff by zero, in terms of the impact I was going to have in the world, that I might very well choose that path, but that the price would be that I wouldn’t get to make a difference in public life. And if you want proof of God having a sense of humor, one of the things I’m seeing now, especially in the interactions I have on the campaign trail and the fact that this campaign is historic in a lot of ways, is that that same fact that I thought would mean never getting to this point might actually be one of the things that makes it matter the most.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

It’s a strange thing to think about that the one thing that I couldn’t control, the one thing that might have meant that it would be better not to have any aspirations related to politics at all could be the very thing that anchors the moral and emotional purpose of this entire campaign.

michael barbaro

Thank you very much.

pete buttigieg

Thanks for having me.

michael barbaro

In the latest public testimony before impeachment investigators, Fiona Hill, the former top Russia expert on the National Security Council, recalled her growing frustration with Ambassador Gordon Sondland, as she realized he was pursuing a political agenda in Ukraine on behalf of President Trump.

archived recording (fiona hill) He was being involved in a domestic, political errand, and we were being involved in national security foreign policy and those two things have just diverged.

michael barbaro

Hill testified that when Trump and Sondland pressed Ukraine to investigate the discredited theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, they were playing directly into Russia’s hands, since Russia wants to deflect attention away from its interference.

archived recording (fiona hill) This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves. These fictions are harmful, even if they’re deployed for purely domestic, political purposes.

No more.,2019-11-20,The New York Times,Gordon Sondland Is Likely to Face Tough Questions in Impeachment Hearing,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/us/gordon-sondland.html,"After hanging up, Mr. Sondland said that Mr. Trump did not care a whit about Ukraine but was focused on “big stuff,” like getting “the Biden investigation,” according to Mr. Holmes. His account clashes directly with Mr. Sondland’s statement that he recalled “no discussions with any State Department or White House official about former Vice President Biden or his son.” He also said he did not recall participating “in any effort to encourage an investigation into the Bidens.”

Even if Mr. Sondland is now a damaged witness, he remains an important one. So far, he is the only one cooperating with the inquiry who dealt directly with Mr. Trump on Ukraine. Another witness, Kurt D. Volker, the special envoy to Ukraine, participated in an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump early on, but took a back seat to Mr. Sondland after that.

For Mr. Sondland, a bald, blustery 62-year-old, the inquiry has upended his work.

He used to boast to others that he could ring the president directly, complaining to one national security official that he was harder to reach than Mr. Trump. He told another colleague that Mr. Trump was often in a bad mood in the early morning. And Mr. Sondland became impatient when White House operators failed to promptly connect him to the Oval Office. Now his every exchange with the president is under scrutiny.

Mr. Sondland once described himself as a “results-oriented,” take-charge type. Now investigators are asking him why he pushed a so-called deliverable for the president — an announcement of the investigations — that other officials have said was ethically wrong and ran counter to American national security interests.

Mr. Sondland also liked to present himself as a refreshing alternative to hidebound bureaucrats. Now some of those same bureaucrats have described him as an aggressive operator who elbowed them out of the way, rejected time-honored protocols and turned his personal cellphone into a national security risk.

As national security adviser, John R. Bolton “was frustrated with Ambassador Sondland’s involvement in these issues — frankly in a lot of issues,” Timothy Morrison, a onetime top deputy to Mr. Bolton, testified. Although his concerns were widely shared, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo failed to rein in Mr. Sondland, Mr. Morrison said.

Fiona Hill, Mr. Morrison’s predecessor, told investigators that “all kinds” of foreign officials were “appearing at the gates of the White House, calling on our personal phones” and demanding meetings that Mr. Sondland had unilaterally promised to them."

Digs at President Trump

“With all due deference to the fact that this is a presidential debate, Donald Trump got punked.”

Senator Kamala Harris of California said President Trump had compromised the checks and balances on North Korea’s nuclear capabilities with his unilateral dealings with the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un.

(One friend said Mr. Obama had brushed off debate criticisms, joking that the eventual winner will “come back to me when they need me.”)

Mr. Obama was initially reluctant to attack Mr. Trump after he left the Oval Office, in part because he wanted to embrace the informal practice adopted by his predecessor, George W. Bush, of not attacking a presidential successor, former aides said. But he was also concerned that going after Mr. Trump would play into Republicans’ hands by prompting a backlash, they added.

By the 2018 midterms, Mr. Obama abandoned that reticence and campaigned aggressively against Mr. Trump, emboldened by the president’s halfhearted response to his attacks.

He also offered vague praise for the large-scale health care policy that Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren are now championing. “Democrats aren’t just running on good old ideas like a higher minimum wage, but they’re running on good new ideas like Medicare for all,” he said in a speech at the University of Illinois in September of 2018.

The big difference now is Mr. Obama’s willingness to publicly criticize others in his party, however indirectly, something he had avoided.

Katie Hill, a spokeswoman for Mr. Obama, said that he was not targeting Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren in his remarks last week, and that his public declarations in support of the Democratic field and a diversity of opinions are the core of his message.

“Since leaving office, President Obama has worked to stay out of the political fray in part to let other, new voices in the Democratic Party rise up,” Ms. Hill said on Wednesday. “Just like in 2018, he’ll be out on the campaign trail next fall working hard for whoever our nominee is.”"

He asked Mr. Sondland whether he was aware of a series of facts and various allegations about Hunter Biden and Burisma, and about Ukrainians who expressed support for Hillary Clinton or opposition to Mr. Trump.

“So knowing all these facts from high-ranking Ukrainian officials, ambassador, it probably makes a little more sense now as to why the president may think that there’s problems with Ukraine and that Ukraine was out to get him?” Mr. Nunes asked Mr. Sondland.

“I understand your — I understand your point, yes, Mr. Chairman,” Mr. Sondland replied.

But if the premise of Mr. Nunes’s line of questioning was that it was righteous to seek the investigations, a line of questioning that followed, by the Republicans’ top staff lawyer, Stephen R. Castor, pointed to a different conclusion: The important point was that there was no clear proof that Mr. Trump himself was behind the pressure.

Mr. Castor marched Mr. Sondland through a lengthy series of questions to emphasize the point that Mr. Trump never personally told him there was any quid pro quo — highlighting that Mr. Sondland had no clear proof that the president was personally orchestrating anything untoward.

“So the president never told you about any preconditions for aid to be released?” Mr. Castor asked.

“No,” Mr. Sondland replied.

“The president never told you about preconditions for a White House meeting?” Mr. Castor followed up.

“Personally, no,” Mr. Sondland said.

Mr. Sondland said his understanding that Mr. Trump was offering a White House meeting to Mr. Zelensky on the condition that he announce investigations was based on what Mr. Giuliani told him. Pressed on how he could know that, Mr. Sondland replied that Mr. Trump had directed him to talk to Mr. Giuliani about the matter."

So to understand how it’s going to play out, the past is really our best guide. “I think we’re just all in for a really crazy ride.” Collectively, these New York Times reporters have covered U.S. politics for over 150 years. “I’m also a drummer in a band, so …” They’ve reported on past impeachment inquiries. “Yea, I’m lost in Senate wonderland.” And they say that the three we’ve had so far have been full of twists and turns. “The president of the United States is not guilty as charged.” In short, expect the unexpected. First, the process. Impeachment is technically only the initial stage. “Common misconceptions about impeachment are that impeachment by itself means removal from office. It doesn’t. The impeachment part of the process is only the indictment that sets up a trial.” The Constitution describes offenses that are grounds for removing the president from office as bribery, treason and — “They say high crimes and misdemeanors, which, really, is in the eye of the beholder.” “The framers didn’t give us a guidebook to it. They simply said, that the House had the responsibility for impeachment and the Senate had the responsibility for the trial.” One of the things missing from the Constitution? How an impeachment inquiry should start. And that has generally been a source of drama. Basically, anything goes. “In fact, in the Andrew Johnson case they voted to impeach him without even having drafted the articles of impeachment.” For Richard Nixon, his case started with several investigations that led to public hearings. That part of the process went on for two years, and yielded revelation after revelation, connecting Nixon to a politically-motivated burglary at D.N.C. headquarters — “… located in the Watergate office building.” — and its subsequent cover-up. “Mr. Butterfield, are you aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the president?” “I was aware of listening devices. Yes, sir.” “This was a shocker. Everybody in the White House recognized how damaging this could be.” As the House drafted articles of impeachment, Nixon lost the support of his party. “O.K., I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.” “I was asked to write the farewell piece that ran the morning after Nixon resigned. And this is what I wrote: The central question is how a man who won so much could have lost so much.” So for Nixon, it more or less ended after the investigations. But for Bill Clinton, that phase was just the beginning. “This is the information.” An independent counsel’s investigation into his business dealings unexpectedly turned into a very public inquiry about his personal life. “The idea that a president of the United States was having an affair with a White House intern and then a federal prosecutor was looking at that, it was just extraordinary.” That investigation led to public hearings in the House Judiciary Committee. “When the Starr Report was being delivered to Congress it was a little bit like the O.J. chase, only a political one. There were two black cars. They were being filmed live on CNN. They were heading towards the Capitol. We were watching it and a little bit agog.” Public opinion is key. And the media plays a huge part in the process. This was definitely true for Clinton. “You know it was just a crazy time. We worked in the Senate press gallery.” “All your colleagues are kind of piled on top of each other.” “We had crummy computers, the fax machine would always break. The printer would always break.” After committee hearings, the House brought formal impeachment charges. “It was very tense. I thought that the Saturday of the impeachment vote in the House was one of the most tense days I’d experienced in Washington.” And it turned out, also, full of surprises. “The day of impeachment arrived, everyone’s making very impassioned speeches about whether Bill Clinton should or should not be impeached and Livingston rises to give an argument for the House Republicans. He started to talk about how Clinton could resign.” “You, sir, may resign your post.” “And all of a sudden people start booing and saying, ‘Resign, resign’!” “So I must set the example.” “He announced he was resigning because he had had extramarital affairs and challenged President Clinton to do the only honorable thing, in his view —” “I hope President Clinton will follow.” “— to resign as well, so there was all this drama unfolding even in the midst of impeachment.” Then it went to the Senate for trial. The Constitution gets a little more specific about this part. “The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is supposed to preside over that trial.” “Rehnquist, he showed up in this robe he had made for himself, which had gold stripes on the sleeves because he liked Gilbert and Sullivan.” “The Senate is the actual jury.” “You will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws. So help you, God.” “This is a copy of the rules of the Senate for handling impeachment. They’re actually very specific.” “Meet six days a week.” “Convene at noon. The senators have to sit at their desks and remain quiet in their role as jurors. And not talk, which trust me, is going to be a problem for some of the senators who are used to talking all the time.” It’s just like a courtroom trial. There are prosecutors who present the case against the president. “That was perjury.” Only, they’re members of the House, and they’re called managers. Then the senators, or the jurors, vote. And things are still, unpredictable. “The options are guilty or not guilty. But there was one senator —” “Arlen Specter, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania.” “Under Scottish law, there are three possible verdicts: guilty, not guilty and not proved.” “— which is not a thing.” “And everybody just looks, you know, how do you even record that vote?” In the end, there were not enough votes to oust Clinton. “What’s amazing about this whole thing to me wasn’t so much the constitutional process. It was that it felt to me like the beginning of really intense partisanship, the weaponization of partisanship.” And here’s the thing: An impeachment charge has never gotten the two-thirds majority it needs in the Senate to actually oust a president from office. “So you could end up having a situation where the president is impeached, acquitted and runs for re-election and wins re-election.” And that would be a first. “This is my ticket to the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. I don’t think you’ll find these on StubHub.”"

We worked in the Senate press gallery.” “All your colleagues are kind of piled on top of each other.” “We had crummy computers, the fax machine would always break. The printer would always break.” After committee hearings, the House brought formal impeachment charges. “It was very tense. I thought that the Saturday of the impeachment vote in the House was one of the most tense days I’d experienced in Washington.” And it turned out, also, full of surprises. “The day of impeachment arrived, everyone’s making very impassioned speeches about whether Bill Clinton should or should not be impeached and Livingston rises to give an argument for the House Republicans. He started to talk about how Clinton could resign.” “You, sir, may resign your post.” “And all of a sudden people start booing and saying, ‘Resign, resign’!” “So I must set the example.” “He announced he was resigning because he had had extramarital affairs and challenged President Clinton to do the only honorable thing, in his view —” “I hope President Clinton will follow.” “— to resign as well, so there was all this drama unfolding even in the midst of impeachment.” Then it went to the Senate for trial. The Constitution gets a little more specific about this part. “The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is supposed to preside over that trial.” “Rehnquist, he showed up in this robe he had made for himself, which had gold stripes on the sleeves because he liked Gilbert and Sullivan.” “The Senate is the actual jury.” “You will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws. So help you, God.” “This is a copy of the rules of the Senate for handling impeachment. They’re actually very specific.” “Meet six days a week.” “Convene at noon. The senators have to sit at their desks and remain quiet in their role as jurors. And not talk, which trust me, is going to be a problem for some of the senators who are used to talking all the time.” It’s just like a courtroom trial. There are prosecutors who present the case against the president. “That was perjury.” Only, they’re members of the House, and they’re called managers. Then the senators, or the jurors, vote. And things are still, unpredictable. “The options are guilty or not guilty. But there was one senator —” “Arlen Specter, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania.” “Under Scottish law, there are three possible verdicts: guilty, not guilty and not proved.” “— which is not a thing.” “And everybody just looks, you know, how do you even record that vote?” In the end, there were not enough votes to oust Clinton. “What’s amazing about this whole thing to me wasn’t so much the constitutional process. It was that it felt to me like the beginning of really intense partisanship, the weaponization of partisanship.” And here’s the thing: An impeachment charge has never gotten the two-thirds majority it needs in the Senate to actually oust a president from office. “So you could end up having a situation where the president is impeached, acquitted and runs for re-election and wins re-election.” And that would be a first. “This is my ticket to the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. I don’t think you’ll find these on StubHub.”"

Pentagon’s Russia-Ukraine Expert to Testify in Inquiry,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/us/politics/laura-cooper-impeachment.html,"WASHINGTON — As the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, Laura K. Cooper was one of multiple Pentagon officials who warned the White House that freezing congressionally approved aid to Ukraine could violate the law.

Ms. Cooper, as well as other officials, repeatedly voiced concern that withholding the aid for a sustained period of time could run afoul of the Impoundment Control Act, which prevents the president from unilaterally deciding against spending money allocated by lawmakers. She also personally fielded two separate phone calls from alarmed Ukrainian diplomats quietly seeking information about the delay.

The security assistance to Ukraine — a total of nearly $400 million — and the timing of its delay is at the heart of the impeachment investigation into whether President Trump abused the power of his office to enlist a foreign government for help in an election. When she testifies Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee, Ms. Cooper, a career Defense Department official, is expected to provide some insight into efforts to persuade the Trump administration to release the aid.

After a mid-June meeting with Mr. Trump, nearly a month before the aid was frozen, the administration began asking Ms. Cooper detailed questions about the money, she told House investigators last month in a closed-door interview. Those questions appeared prompted in part by an announcement from her office that the Pentagon planned to provide $250 million to Ukraine for training and equipment."

But No One Was Attacked Like Warren.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/opinion/democratic-debate-warren.html,"That criticism, both technical and philosophical, continued in an inevitable segment about Medicare for All with Ms. Warren facing criticism from both her left and right flanks. In previous debates, Ms. Warren avoided saying exactly how she would pay for the tens of trillions in new government spending the health care system she favors would entail. But she recently released both a financing plan and an implementation timeline in which she proposed putting off the push for a full-fledged single-payer system.

That segment opened with Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., touting his own plan, which he calls Medicare for All Who Want It, as a way to avoid the “divisive” step of eliminating most private insurance and forcing most Americans onto a government health care plan. Mr. Biden, similarly, framed his opposition to Ms. Warren’s proposal by saying, “I trust the American people.” Once again, it was an attack not only on Ms. Warren’s plan, but on the political philosophy it represents.

From the other side of the debate, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose Medicare for All bill Ms. Warren backs, implied that he didn’t trust Ms. Warren’s plan to hold off on Medicare for All until late in her first term. Now is the time, he said, practically pounding the podium. “In the first week of my administration, we will introduce Medicare for All.” The message was clear: Warrenism, which would wait until year three to fight for single-payer, was insufficiently devoted to the revolutionary cause.

These exchanges illustrate the Democratic Party’s growing uneasiness with Ms. Warren and her brand of fussy technocratic populism, which can come across as both too radical and too timidly wonky at the same time.

Throughout her campaign, Ms. Warren has attempted to occupy a middle ground between the party’s moderate wing and its progressive base. But her have-it-both-ways strategy may well have backfired. Despite Ms. Warren’s ascension to the primary’s top tier, the steadiness of Mr. Biden’s polling and the recent rise of Mr. Buttigieg in Iowa and New Hampshire — along with the dips in Ms. Warren’s own polling — suggest not only the limits of her strategy but the limitations of the underlying worldview itself."

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Gordon Sondland is a Trump donor turned E.U. ambassador turned witness in the impeachment inquiry, whose testimony has been contradicted on multiple occasions. Today: How both Democrats and Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee choose to handle their most complicated witness to date. It’s Thursday, November 21. So Nick, give us a sense of what it felt like to be in that room this morning as the committee prepared to hear from Gordon Sondland, this very complicated witness.

nicholas fandos

So we knew that in the middle of this jam-packed week of impeachment testimony, Gordon Sondland’s appearance was going to be something different.

michael barbaro

Nick Fandos was in the Capitol for Sondland’s testimony.

nicholas fandos

Sondland has really been described by almost everybody as having been in the middle of this pressure campaign on Ukraine this summer. Now, there was particular anticipation, because Sondland’s story, unlike some other witnesses, has evolved as time has gone on. So when he first came in and spoke in private with investigators in October, he was pretty unclear about whether or not the president was trying to leverage a White House meeting or security aid for Ukraine to get the investigations that he wanted. He told them repeatedly, I can’t remember this, I can’t remember that. Well, after that happened, Sondland submitted a supplement to his testimony in writing that updated that and said, actually, I do think there was a quid pro quo. And so there was a lot of anticipation heading into his testimony as to which Gordon Sondland would show up. What story was he going to tell? Is he going to cop to all these different things? How is he going to treat the president? How’s he going to treat his own evolving story? And it really felt like it could go either way.

michael barbaro

So what happens? How does this much-anticipated hearing begin?

nicholas fandos

So a little after 9:00, Gordon Sondland walks into the same grand hearing room where all the impeachment hearings have been taking place. Chairman Schiff dropped his gavel.

archived recording (adam schiff) Meeting will come to order. [GAVEL BANG]

nicholas fandos

And then, after taking an oath to tell the truth and nothing but the truth —

archived recording (adam schiff) And nothing but the truth, so help you God.

nicholas fandos

— Sondland sits down and begins reading from a pretty thick stack of papers, an opening statement that he’s brought with him. And he starts by saying that —

archived recording (gordon sondland) I have not had access to all of my phone records, State Department emails and many, many other State Department documents.

nicholas fandos

— his job is made more difficult by the fact that he has not been allowed to go back to the State Department and look at notes or records that might be able to fill in his recollections.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Having access would have been very helpful to me in trying to reconstruct with whom I spoke and met and when and what was said.

nicholas fandos

Seems to be a nod at the fact that his story is, in the most generous sense, evolving. And he begins to tell the story about his involvement with Ukraine policy over the last, say, five or six months.

archived recording (gordon sondland) The U.S. delegation developed a very positive view of the Ukraine government.

nicholas fandos

He begins talking about a meeting with President Trump in May in the Oval Office after he attended the inauguration of Ukraine’s new president.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Unfortunately, President Trump was skeptical. In response to our persistent efforts in that meeting to change his views, President Trump directed us to, quote, “talk with Rudy.” We weren’t happy with the president’s directive to talk with Rudy. We did not want to involve Mr. Giuliani.

nicholas fandos

What he then starts to unspool is a set of facts and meetings that we’ve now heard a lot about in the last couple of months.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Simply put, we were playing the hand we were dealt. We all understood that if we refused to work with Mr. Giuliani, we would lose a very important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine. So we followed the president’s orders.

nicholas fandos

How, you know, May became June, became July and then August, and it became clear to him over time that President Trump, through his lawyer Mr. Giuliani and through actions that he took, wanted to extract from the Ukrainians certain politically beneficial investigations. And at one point, pretty early in his statement, he addresses the Latin phrase that has been confusing everyone as this has gone along.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Was there a quid pro quo?

nicholas fandos

Was it a quid pro quo, a this for that, or was it not? And he says —

archived recording (gordon sondland) With regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes.

nicholas fandos

Unequivocally, that as far as I’m concerned, there was a quid pro quo around the White House meeting.

michael barbaro

Right, and I was struck by how casually he says that, this thing that is very much at the center of the entire inquiry.

nicholas fandos

And the thing that has been contested by other witnesses. He states, you know, very authoritatively, without reservation. Now, he’s a little bit more cautious about whether or not there was a quid pro quo around the suspended military assistance.

archived recording (gordon sondland) In July and August of 2019, we learned that the White House had also suspended security aid to Ukraine. I tried diligently to ask why the aid was suspended, but I never received a clear answer. Still haven’t to this day.

nicholas fandos

So he came to conclude by August that that, too, was dependent on Ukraine announcing these investigations that the president wanted.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Committing to the investigations of the 2016 elections and Burisma, as Mr. Giuliani had demanded.

nicholas fandos

Now, Sondland has another clear objective as he’s laying out his story, and that is to defend himself against the testimony from other witnesses who have tried to describe him as either a rogue actor or somebody that was working through an improper diplomatic channel.

archived recording (gordon sondland) I’m not sure how someone could characterize something as an irregular channel when you’re talking to the president of the United States, the secretary of state, the national security adviser, the chief of staff at the White House, the secretary of energy. I don’t know how that’s irregular, if a bunch of —

nicholas fandos

He says, no. This was the real channel. I was working with the president of the United States. I was working with top American diplomats and officials. And not only was it proper, but all of those people knew what I was up to and what we were trying to accomplish as this went along.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Within my State Department emails, there is a July 19 email. This email was sent, this email was sent to Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Perry, Brian McCormack, who was Secretary Perry’s chief of staff at the time —

nicholas fandos

Basically, you know, if for weeks we’ve had witness after witness, and certainly the White House and the Republicans, willing to throw Gordon Sondland under the bus to try and push all of this onto him as a kind of lone wolf, I mean, he was taking everybody under the bus with him.

archived recording (gordon sondland) — Chief of Staff Mulvaney and Mr. Mulvaney’s senior adviser, Rob Blair, a lot of senior officials. These emails show that the leadership of the State Department, the National Security Council and the White House were all informed about the Ukraine efforts.

michael barbaro

Right, he’s saying, everybody who now wants to distance themselves from me, they were actually all in the loop.

nicholas fandos

That’s right. It’s a phrase he uses several times.

archived recording (gordon sondland) It was no secret. Everyone’s in the loop. Everyone was in the loop.

nicholas fandos

In the loop.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Again —

nicholas fandos

In the loop.

archived recording (gordon sondland) — everyone was in the loop.

nicholas fandos

They were in the loop.

archived recording (gordon sondland) There was a September 1 meeting with President Zelensky in Warsaw. During the actual meeting, President Zelensky raised the issue of security assistance directly with Vice President Pence. And the vice president said that he would speak to President Trump about it.

michael barbaro

And, Nick, what’s the significance of what he’s saying here? I mean, in theory, this is very explosive. The vice president, the secretary of state are being, in Sondland’s testimony, directly drawn into this.

nicholas fandos

Right, he’s trying to make the point that this wasn’t just me. Like, everyone understood this to be Trump’s objective out of this relationship, and we were all working toward that. And nobody found it unusual that I was doing what I was doing.

archived recording (gordon sondland) I sent Secretary Pompeo an email to express my appreciation for his joining a series of meetings in Brussels following the Warsaw trip. I wrote, “Mike, thanks for schlepping to Europe. I think it was really important and the chemistry seems promising. Really appreciate it.” Secretary Pompeo replied the next day, on Wednesday, September 4, quote, “All good. You’re doing great work; keep banging away.”

nicholas fandos

And with that, Sondland completes his opening statement.

archived recording (gordon sondland) It remains an honor to serve the people of the United States as their United States ambassador to the European Union. I look forward to answering the committee’s questions. Thank you.

nicholas fandos

And it’s the Democrat’s turn for 45 minutes to begin asking questions.

archived recording (adam schiff) We will now proceed the first round of questions, as detailed —

nicholas fandos

Of course, Chairman Schiff has a few of his own. But mostly, he passes the mic over to Dan Goldman, who is his chief investigator, who’s been playing a role in these hearings, questioning witnesses directly.

archived recording (adam schiff) Mr. Goldman. archived recording (daniel goldman) Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In your opening statement, Ambassador Sondland, you detailed the benefits that you have gained from obtaining some additional documents over the past few weeks. Is that right? archived recording (gordon sondland) In terms of refreshing my recollection, that’s — archived recording (daniel goldman) Right, because —

nicholas fandos

He doesn’t shy away from what becomes clear over the course of the day is a pretty shoddy memory on the part of Sondland.

archived recording (daniel goldman) You have remembered a lot more than you did when you were deposed. Is that right? archived recording (gordon sondland) That’s correct. archived recording (daniel goldman) And one of the things that —

nicholas fandos

And in doing that, Goldman does something interesting, which is that —

archived recording (daniel goldman) — conversation, Ambassador Taylor also testified, under oath, that you said that President Trump wanted Zelensky in a public box. Do you recall using that expression? archived recording (gordon sondland) Yeah, it goes back —

nicholas fandos

He repeatedly leans on those witnesses with better memories, or people who took contemporaneous notes.

archived recording (daniel goldman) Do you have any reason to question Ambassador Taylor’s testimony based on his meticulous and careful contemporaneous notes? archived recording (gordon sondland) I’m not going to question or not question. I’m just telling you what I believe I was referring to.

nicholas fandos

To describe things that Sondland told them or describe things that Sondland did, and basically asked Sondland to confirm that these things happened —

archived recording (daniel goldman) Let me fast forward a week and show you another text exchange, which may help refresh your recollection. On September 8, you sent a text to Ambassador Taylor and Ambassador Volker. Can you read what you wrote there?

nicholas fandos

— to basically bring Sondland up into line with testimony that they’ve gotten from other people about him.

archived recording (daniel goldman) So you do acknowledge you spoke to President Trump, as you indicated in that text, right? archived recording (gordon sondland) If I said I did, I did.

nicholas fandos

And that’s important as they move towards writing a report and presenting a kind of full case about what happened to the American people. It helps eliminate some of the discrepancies in the testimony they’ve gotten.

michael barbaro

Which of these exchanges stood out to you?

nicholas fandos

Well, one in particular is fresh in my mind, because we just learned about it for the first time last week.

archived recording (daniel goldman) And one of the things that you now remember is the discussion that you had with President Trump on July 26 in that restaurant in Kyiv, right?

nicholas fandos

Now remember, that’s the day after Trump himself spoke to Zelensky and told him that I want these investigations into the Bidens in 2016. Other witnesses have described Sondland basically speaking on the phone with the president, who was speaking so loud that he had to hold the phone away from his ear.

archived recording (gordon sondland) He claims to have overheard part of the conversation, and I’m not going to dispute what he did or didn’t hear.

nicholas fandos

Others could overhear President Trump asking about, quote, unquote, “the investigation,” and Sondland assured him, you know, don’t worry, with some expletive laid in, President Zelensky will do whatever we want.

michael barbaro

Right, because Ukraine loves your tush.

nicholas fandos

Something like that.

archived recording (daniel goldman) Well, he also testified that President Zelensky, quote, “loves your ass,” unquote. Do you recall saying that? archived recording (gordon sondland) Yeah, it sounds like something I would say. [LAUGHTER]

nicholas fandos

And what he basically does over the course of this back-and-forth is says —

archived recording (gordon sondland) Putting it in Trump-speak, by saying he loves your ass, he’ll do whatever you want, meant that he would really work with us on a whole host of issues.

nicholas fandos

— you’ve heard the president talk.

archived recording (gordon sondland) That’s how President Trump and I communicate, a lot of four-letter words. In this case, three-letter.

nicholas fandos

He also contests a couple of small points.

archived recording (gordon sondland) I don’t think I would have said that. I would have — I would have —

nicholas fandos

But in the end, he confirms the essence of the story as it’s been related by other witnesses, and for the first time, kind of established that that happened.

archived recording (gordon sondland) Again, trying to reconstruct a very busy day without the benefit, but if someone said I had a meeting, and I went to the meeting, then I’m not going to dispute that.

michael barbaro

So it’s kind of that familiar mix of Sondland’s self-protection, lack of recall, but overall, damning testimony.

nicholas fandos

I think that’s right.

archived recording (daniel goldman) Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

nicholas fandos

So the Democrats wrap up their questioning.

archived recording (adam schiff) That concludes our 45 minutes —

nicholas fandos

And after weeks of investigation, literally hundreds of hours of testimony, in private and in public, they’ve finally gotten, from a lead witness who had direct access to the president, a statement, an admission, of one of the things that they’ve been looking for and trying to prove out all along, that this White House meeting, an official act, was conditioned upon Ukraine publicly announcing investigations. And that Sondland, a top official, also believed that the withheld aid money — that that would only flow, too, if the investigations were announced. And so it’s with that in front of them —

archived recording (adam schiff) Why don’t we take a 5- or 10-minute break? archived recording (gordon sondland) Thank you.

nicholas fandos

That Schiff abruptly gavels the hearing into a pause, somewhat inexplicably at first. And then we quickly see why as he walks out behind the chamber —

archived recording (adam schiff) Just want to make a couple of quick observations while we’re on a break here.

nicholas fandos

— to a bank of cameras, where he begins to talk about what just took place.

archived recording (adam schiff) And what we have just heard from Ambassador Sondland is that the knowledge of this scheme was a basic quid pro quo. It was the conditioning —

nicholas fandos

Which all, of course, carried it live in the middle of the proceedings. And when he was done —

archived recording (adam schiff) So I think a very important moment in the history of this inquiry.

nicholas fandos

— he wrapped up and walked right back into the hearing room and gaveled the thing back into session.

archived recording (adam schiff) Come to order.

nicholas fandos

Now, it wasn’t lost on Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the committee, who quickly called Schiff out.

archived recording (devin nunes) Thank the gentleman. For those of you watching at home, that was not a bathroom break. That was actually a chance for the Democrats to go out and hold a press conference, Ambassador, for all the supposed bombshells that were in your opening testimony.

nicholas fandos

So there’s quite a bit of bad blood, obviously, between the two sides. But I don’t think that this helped.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So once we’re back, given that the Democrats have already sort of embraced the messiness and unreliability of Gordon Sondland and addressed it pretty directly, what is the Republican strategy when it’s their turn to question?

nicholas fandos

Well, Republicans are looking at the same guy and the same tendencies, and they see an amazing opportunity to weaponize it in defense of the president.

archived recording (steve castor) Hello again, Ambassador. archived recording (gordon sondland) Hi.

nicholas fandos

So it’s left to Steve Castor, who’s the Republicans’ lawyer in all of this, to start trying to do that work.

archived recording (steve castor) I just want to go through some distinctions between your opener and your deposition.

nicholas fandos

There’s a phone call that Sondland has where he says that he was getting such mixed signals and couldn’t get answers about what Trump wanted from Ukraine and why he was withholding the aid money.

archived recording (gordon sondland) And I was getting tired of going around in circles, frankly. So I made the call —

nicholas fandos

And he asked President Trump, just kind of point blank —

archived recording (gordon sondland) — what do you want from Ukraine? And that’s when I got the answer. archived recording (steve castor) And he was unequivocal, nothing.

nicholas fandos

The president tells him, I don’t want a quid pro quo. I don’t want anything from Ukraine. They should just do what’s right. They should do what Zelensky said he was going to do. And Republicans kept going back to this call again and again and again.

archived recording (john ratcliffe) Tell me if there’s anything sinister or nefarious in any of this, a vanilla request about corruption, a call to say, I’m on my way to Ukraine, a five-minute call you didn’t remember as significant, a call that you made where the president said, I want nothing, I want no quid pro quo, I want Zelensky to do the right thing, I want him to do what he ran on, and him telling you to go tell Congress the truth. Anything sinister and nefarious about any of that? archived recording (gordon sondland) Not the way you present it. archived recording (john ratcliffe) O.K., and that is the truth.

nicholas fandos

Because in this case, as they pointed out, you know, when the president is speaking directly to Sondland, he’s saying, no quid pro quo. I don’t want anything in particular from the Ukrainians.

archived recording (jim jordan) And you told Mr. Castor that the president never told you that the announcement had to happen to get anything. In fact, he didn’t just not tell you that, he explicitly said the opposite.

michael barbaro

So the most senior figure, and the most involved figure in all this from the Trump administration, who declares that this was a quid pro quo, is simultaneously testifying that the president gets on the phone with him and says, this is no quid pro quo. That is complicated.

nicholas fandos

It is. It’s very complicated. And if you’re listening at home and listening to Republican questioning, they’re able, I think, to raise some doubts about this account that he’s giving.

archived recording (michael turner) And if you pull up CNN today, right now, their banner says, “Sondland ties Trump to withholding aid.” Is that your testimony today, Ambassador Sondland, that you have evidence that Donald Trump tied the investigation to the aide? Because I don’t think you’re saying that.

nicholas fandos

And in this questioning, you know, Sondland says, I didn’t hear anything directly.

archived recording (gordon sondland) I’ve said repeatedly, Congressman, I was presuming. I also said that President Trump — archived recording (michael turner) So no one told you, not just the president. Giuliani didn’t tell you. Mulvaney didn’t tell you. Nobody — Pompeo didn’t tell you — nobody else on this planet told you that Donald Trump was tying aid to these investigations. Is that correct? archived recording (gordon sondland) I think I already testified to that. archived recording (michael turner) No, answer the question, yes or no. archived recording (gordon sondland) Yes.

michael barbaro

Nick, why do you think that they are so focused on that, what the president told him versus what he has concluded from all the information and conversations around him?

nicholas fandos

Republicans’ argument is basically that, if you’re going to impeach the president, you know, we need to know directly what his intentions were. What he told you, that’s evidence. That’s primary evidence. What you concluded, I mean, that’s no better than what we’ve heard from other witnesses. It’s hearsay.

archived recording (michael turner) I mean, that’s what I don’t understand. So, you know what hearsay evidence is, Ambassador? Hearsay is when I testify what someone else told me. You know what made-up testimony is? Made-up testimony is when I just presume it. I mean, you’re just assuming all of these things, and then you’re giving them the evidence — that they’re running out and doing press conferences, and CNN’s headline is saying that you’re saying the president of the United States should be impeached because he tied aid to investigations. And you don’t know that. Correct? archived recording (gordon sondland) I never said the president of the United States should be impeached. archived recording (michael turner) Nope, but you did —

nicholas fandos

So as this hearing starts to wind down after five or six hours of this back-and-forth, after a pretty explosive and direct opening statement and then cross-examination and examination and more cross-examination, spirits are starting to flag a little bit in the hearing room.

There’s an exchange near the end with Sean Patrick Maloney, a Democrat of New York.

archived recording (sean patrick maloney) Let me ask you something. Who would have benefited from an investigation of the president’s political opponents? archived recording (gordon sondland) I don’t want to characterize who would have and who would not have. archived recording (sean patrick maloney) I know you don’t want to, sir. That’s my question. Would you answer it for me?

nicholas fandos

And Maloney, you know, seeming to kind of burst forth with Democratic frustration that’s been boiling beneath the surface all day, basically says —

archived recording (sean patrick maloney) I guess I’m have trouble why you can’t just say — archived recording (gordon sondland) When he asked about investigations, I assumed he meant — archived recording (sean patrick maloney) I know what you assumed. But who would benefit from an investigation of the Bidens? archived recording (gordon sondland) I assume President Trump would benefit. archived recording (sean patrick maloney) There we have it. See? [APPLAUSE] Didn’t hurt a bit, did it? But let me ask you something — archived recording (gordon sondland) Mr. Maloney? archived recording (sean patrick maloney) Hold on, sir. archived recording (gordon sondland) Excuse me. I’ve been very forthright, and I really resent what you’re trying to do. archived recording (sean patrick maloney) Fair enough. You’ve been very forthright. This your third try to do so, sir. Didn’t work so well the first time, did it? And now we’re here a third time, and we got a doozy of a statement from you this morning. There’s a whole bunch of stuff you don’t recall. So all due respect, sir, we appreciate your candor. But let’s be really clear on what it took to get it out of you.

nicholas fandos

And that’s kind of the tone as this hearing begins to come to an end. Democrats are frustrated about some things. Republicans are frustrated about some things. Sondland, who’s trying to catch a flight back to Brussels, is certainly frustrated by some things. And we’ve had a pretty complex and conflicting day of testimony, where some people seem to be coming away quite happy, but not perfectly so.

So is this unreliable witness turning out to be the most important witness in this inquiry? Or is he just an unreliable witness?

nicholas fandos

Well, the thing about Sondland is, the Democrats will tell you, prosecutors successfully bring cases all the time on highly flawed witnesses who maybe don’t even have a great history with the truth. But that doesn’t mean that what they’re saying isn’t true in a given scenario. And in this case, it’s important to remember, what he’s saying is incredibly, politically inconvenient for him. He still works for the president of the United States, who he donated a bunch of money to and whose policies he believes in. That itself lends it some power and credibility. Democrats seem to be emerging from today more comfortable and more certain that they need to bring forward this case of the president abusing his office, of committing high crimes and misdemeanors worthy of impeachment and putting it before the American people.

In the fifth Democratic presidential debate, candidates expressed outrage over Wednesday’s testimony in the impeachment inquiry, with Senator Elizabeth Warren accusing President Trump of selling off key ambassadorships to wealthy donors like Gordon Sondland.

archived recording (elizabeth warren) And that tells us about what’s happening in Washington.

But with Mayor Pete Buttigieg now leading the polls in Iowa, the first state to pick a Democratic nominee, several of his rivals, including Senator Amy Klobuchar, sought to challenge his credentials and experience.

archived recording (amy klobuchar) Just like I have won statewide, and Mayor, I have all appreciation for your good work as a local official, and you did not when you tried, I also have actually done this work. I think experience should matter.

michael barbaro

Buttigieg fired back, suggesting that the federal experience of his opponent was its own liability.

archived recording (pete buttigieg) So first of all, Washington experience is not the only experience that matters. There’s more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage. And where are we right now as a country? [CHEERING]

“There is a scenario where we could have security cooperation as we do with countries around the world,” Mr. Buttigieg said. “Now, I would only order American troops into conflict if there were no other choice, if American lives were on the line and if this was necessary to meet treaty obligations. But we could absolutely be in some kind of partnership role, if and only if it welcomed by our partner south of the border.”

What they’re talking about

Senator Elizabeth Warren claimed that her 2 percent wealth tax on households worth more than $50 million would pay for a sweeping expansion of the nation’s social safety net, providing free child care and college tuition.

What Ms. Warren said:

“We can put $800 billion new federal dollars into all of our public schools. We can make college tuition-free for every kid. We can put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities. And we can cancel student loan debt for 95 percent of the folks who have got it.”

The revenue that Ms. Warren would raise from her tax proposal is a subject of intense debate and it is not clear that her wealth tax could pay for the plans she listed. According to a New York Times analysis, the total cost of Ms. Warren’s plans for universal child care, increased spending on public schools, student debt cancellation and free college would be about $2.9 trillion over a decade. The two Berkeley economists advising her campaign, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, estimate that her wealth tax would generate $2.75 trillion over that period of time. If that is correct, then Ms. Warren would be close to being able to pay for those proposals. (Ms. Warren has recently revised her wealth tax proposal, and Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman have refined their calculations but the general conclusions are the same.)

But other economists disagree, arguing that a wealth tax would spur waves of new loopholes and tax evasion efforts. Lawrence H. Summers, a Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, and Natasha Sarin, a law and finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania, estimated that Ms. Warren’s wealth tax would raise just 40 percent of what her campaign claims."

(Pence’s chief of staff denied this.) Sondland didn’t substantially dispute the closed-door testimony of David Holmes, a senior U.S. Embassy official in Ukraine, who said he overheard a call to Trump that Sondland made on his cellphone. According to Holmes, on the call, made the day after the July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Zelensky for a “favor,” Trump asked Sondland if the Ukrainians were in fact going to pursue investigations. Sondland replied that they’d do whatever the president wanted.

After the call, Holmes testified, Sondland told him that Trump “did not give a [expletive] about Ukraine,” and cared only about what Sondland called “big stuff” that benefits the president. About that call, Sondland testified, “I would have been more surprised if President Trump had not mentioned investigations, particularly given what we were hearing from Mr. Giuliani.”

Further, Sondland testified that Trump didn’t necessarily care about investigations per se, only the public announcement of investigations. Zelensky “had to announce the investigations, he didn’t actually have to do them,” he said. The public announcement, of course, would be sufficient to give Trump material to defame Biden and muddy the waters about Russia’s help in getting Trump elected in the first place.

Speaking of Russia’s role in 2016: A few Republicans have tried to massage Trump’s claims of Ukrainian election interference to make them sound marginally less insane. At Wednesday’s hearing, Nunes accused Ukraine of meddling in America’s election largely through public statements by Ukrainian officials. Among these statements was a 2016 op-ed essay by Valeriy Chaly, then the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, objecting to Trump’s statement that as president he’d consider recognizing Russian-occupied Crimea as Russian, rather than Ukrainian, territory.

Leave aside that there is nothing illicit about public officials expressing their opinions about matters of urgent concern to their own countries. Sondland’s testimony made it plain that such public comments are not what Trump had in mind in calling for investigations into what Ukraine did in 2016. Trump wanted an inquiry into the conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the D.N.C., which is why Sondland repeatedly spoke about proposed investigations involving the “D.N.C. server.” He wanted Ukraine’s help exonerating Russia for its attack on America.

Sondland is not a wholly reliable witness; his insistence that he was ignorant of the connection between Burisma and the Bidens when he pressed Ukraine for investigations is hardly credible. (Volker made the same preposterous claim on Tuesday — both men were likely trying to distance themselves from one of the ugliest aspects of Trump’s shakedown.) Republicans will likely cling to the fact that Sondland said he never heard directly from Trump about a linkage between security aid to Ukraine and investigations; Sondland said he put it together because, as he repeated several times, “two plus two equals four.”"

The American ambassador to the E.U. delivered blunt testimony that implicated President Trump and top U.S. officials — including the vice president, the secretary of state, the acting chief of staff and others — in the pressure campaign on Ukraine.

“Everyone,” the ambassador, Gordon Sondland, said, “was in the loop.” And he affirmed that there was a quid pro quo over Mr. Trump’s desire for investigations by Ukraine into his political rivals.

Mr. Sondland said he reluctantly worked with Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to pressure Ukraine to publicly commit to investigating Joe Biden “at the express direction of the president.”

Response: Mr. Trump, reading from a notepad of talking points scrawled in Sharpie, seized on part of Mr. Sondland’s testimony in which he said that Mr. Trump did not explicitly tell him about conditions on a White House meeting coveted by Ukraine’s president or the release of security assistance to Kyiv."

Biden Jr. for saying he did not support legalizing marijuana. During the Democratic primary debate in Atlanta on Wednesday, he joked that Mr. Biden “might have been high” when he said that.

Below are transcripts of parts of the exchange:

BOOKER: I want to turn back to this issue of black voters. I have a lifetime of experience with black voters. I’ve been one since I was 18. Nobody on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African-American voters. Black voters are pissed off, and they’re worried. They’re pissed off because the only time our issues seem to be paid attention to by politicians is when people are looking for a vote. We don’t want to see people miss this opportunity and lose because we are nominating someone that isn’t trusted, doesn’t have authentic connection. And so that’s what’s on the ballot. And issues do matter.

I have a lot of respect for the vice president. He has sworn me into my office and he’s a hero. This week I hear him literally say that “I don’t think we should legalize marijuana.” I thought you might have been high when you said it. And let me tell you, because marijuana — marijuana in our country is already legal for privileged people. And it’s — the war on drugs has been a war on black and brown people. So let me just say this, with more African-Americans under criminal supervision in America than all the slaves since 1850, do not roll up into communities and not talk directly to issues that are going to relate to the liberation of children. Because there are people in Congress right now that admit to smoking marijuana, while there are people — our kids are in jail right now for those drug crimes."

Giuliani who have been charged with violating campaign finance laws, according to people familiar with the investigation.

The subpoenas went to a lobbying firm run by a top fund-raiser for Mr. Trump, Brian Ballard, and to two people who have helped raise money for America First Action, a super PAC created to support the president and allied candidates, the people said.

Mr. Ballard and the America First fund-raisers worked to varying extents with Mr. Giuliani’s associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, American citizens who helped Mr. Giuliani wage a pressure campaign on Ukraine that is now at the center of the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump.

The recent activity by prosecutors and F.B.I. agents shows that they have cast a wide net as they collect evidence about Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, who were arrested last month. It also comes as the same prosecutors look into whether Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, violated a federal lobbying law in some of his dealings with Ukrainians."

Mr. Biden potentially stood to gain something himself from the prosecutor’s firing, though Ukrainian officials say no Burisma case was active at the time Mr. Biden called for Mr. Shokin’s firing.

Republicans, including President Trump, see corruption in the Biden family’s mix of business and politics in Ukraine. But in May this year, the last prosecutor general to serve under President Poroshenko, Yuriy Lutsenko, declared that Hunter Biden had violated no Ukrainian laws. That might have been the end of the matter, except that Mr. Poroshenko’s presidency came to an end that same month. He had been defeated by a challenger, Volodymyr Zelensky, who had painted the incumbent as corrupt.

So what can be proved about the motives of an American president who tries to get Ukraine’s new leader to look into Burisma, the Bidens and Mr. Shokin’s dismissal? Democrats are in the habit of assuming Mr. Trump’s guilt. They assumed he was Vladimir Putin’s puppet, and many still do so even after the yearslong F.B.I. investigation that culminated in the Mueller report, which found nothing to substantiate the claim.

So, unsurprisingly, when his foes look at President Trump’s behavior toward Ukraine, they see only an obvious case for impeachment: Of course Mr. Trump acted in bad faith, withholding aid to extort Ukraine into opening an unjustified investigation into the son of a potential 2020 Democratic presidential nominee. What else could he have been doing?

The thinking continues: He could not have been acting in good faith, the way Mr. Biden was when he strong-armed Mr. Poroshenko, because Mr. Biden had the support of career diplomats, while President Trump did not — in fact, the president used his personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, as an envoy to the Ukrainians. This maverick diplomacy is a prima facie indication of bad motives.

In all this, Mr. Trump’s opponents treat norms as if they were laws. But Mr. Trump openly campaigned in 2016 as someone who would rescind the nonlegal norms of American politics. He said he would “drain the swamp.” Washington’s traditional way of doing business, the legal but corrupt trade in money and influence, was something he was elected to attack. He has only contributed to the problem in the eyes of his critics, but for supporters the goal remains the same.

Mr. Trump was also elected to transform America’s foreign relations. The nation’s leadership in both parties and the Civil Service had embroiled the country in endless wars and a string of humiliations. That Mr. Trump considers officials serving in places like Ukraine to be part of the problem he was elected to solve is no secret. The testimony such officials have so far offered during impeachment hearings bears him out: Their view of American objectives is different from his. Such differences are supposed to be decided publicly, through elections. Mr. Trump happened to win the last one."

Re “The Courses Pompeo Failed at West Point,” by Thomas L. Friedman (column, Nov. 20):

I wish to applaud Mr. Friedman on his article about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. As a West Point graduate and retired Army officer, I am appalled at Mr. Pompeo’s failure to speak truth to power to the president, and to defend the honor and reputation of career Foreign Service officers such as Marie Yovanovitch.

Mr. Pompeo should look to the moral courage being displayed by Ambassador Bill Taylor as an example of how to conduct himself, rather than stoop to the level of President Trump, a man totally devoid of honor and integrity.

To the Editor:

Is good, old-fashioned political revenge no longer in fashion in Washington? Representative Adam Schiff is acting as if he’s shocked that President Trump would try to get back at the Democrats by giving them a taste of their own medicine, by going after Joe Biden and his son on the same charge of quid pro quo that they are bringing against him. Do they want to root out corruption? They can start by looking for it in their own backyard.

Mr. Trump may not have the purest of motives, but nothing he has done rises to the level of criminal misconduct. In fact, I would say it’s just business as usual in Washington and, sadly, the way of the world. Is there anything impeachable about it? Don’t make me laugh."

I’m also interested to see whether Joe Biden can show better command of the subject than he has so far. But I hope you’ll save the Medicare conversation for the debate’s second hour. Even with Warren’s new proposal, much of the argument is predictable at this point.

And there are so many other subjects to discuss.

How do the candidates think they’ll succeed in passing a sweeping climate bill even though Barack Obama failed? (Climate change will probably have a bigger long-term effect on Americans’ health than Medicare policy.) Which candidates oppose a wealth tax, and how would they instead raise taxes on the rich? Do they all favor statehood for the District of Columbia? How would their China policy differ from President Trump’s?

Do they think Pete Buttigieg is experienced enough to be president? Do they agree with Cory Booker that closing charter schools can hurt children? Why do they each think they can recapture the Midwestern states that swung to Trump in 2016, and what’s their plan for doing so?

At times, this year’s debate season has made it seem as if the candidates were running for president of Medicare. It would be great if the four of you could restore some balance tonight.

“That is the same thing Ambassador Volker said yesterday,” Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, responded.

That was sort of interesting — in part because it was one of the relatively few times Nunes managed to complete a sentence without crying, “Identify the whistle-blower!” or “Hunter Biden!”

Also because Volker actually said the nickname made him “cringe.” He believes “three amigos” should only refer to the glorious bipartisan Senate trio of John McCain, Joseph Lieberman and Lindsey Graham. Now, of course, McCain has passed away, Lieberman is a lobbyist for a Chinese telecom company and Graham is Donald Trump’s lap puppy. So the cringy thing really could make sense.

The rest of the world thinks about an old so-bad-it’s-good movie with Chevy Chase, Martin Short and Steve Martin. If there’s a remake, who plays the Chevy Chase role? Rick Perry?

Back to Rudy: Sondland said the Trump amigos hated working with Giuliani, but he was the only person who could get President Zelensky a meeting at the White House. The diplomats who testified really did seem concerned about helping Ukraine out. Sure, some of them got the job via a million-dollar political donation and then spent way too much refurbishing their official residence. (Looking at you, Mr. S.) Still.

If Trump wants to change the conversation for a minute, he should definitely turn on Giuliani. Almost everybody has come to realize how horrible Rudy is, although some innocent souls remember him from his glory days running New York City after 9/11."

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Yesterday, we looked at the origin of President Trump’s theory that Ukraine, not Russia, meddled in the 2016 election — one of the two theories that he asked Ukraine’s president to investigate. Today: Trump’s second theory. It’s Wednesday, November 27.

ken vogel

So when Trump goes on Fox and Friends on Friday for this long stream-of-conscious phone interview, he reiterates his theory — totally debunked theory about the Ukrainians and not the Russians hacking into the D.N.C. servers. And then he also brings up this other theory.

archived recording So, Mr. President, the accusation is this — that you’re using aid, taxpayer dollars, to attack a political opponent in Joe Biden.

ken vogel

And that has to do with Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden, and their work in Ukraine.

michael barbaro

Ken Vogel is a Washington correspondent for The Times.

archived recording (donald trump) And I will tell you this about Joe Biden I never said it specifically on him. But I watched Joe Biden with the prosecutor, who a lot of people said was a great prosecutor, and they took him off. And he was prosecuting that company. And the kid, who never made $0.10 in his life and all of a sudden is making millions of dollars the day he —

michael barbaro

Ken, what exactly is the president’s second theory here about the Bidens?

ken vogel

What Trump alleges is that Joe Biden, during his time as vice president, pressured the Ukrainian government to fire their top prosecutor — essentially their attorney general — because that prosecutor was pursuing an investigation into this energy company in Ukraine that was paying Hunter Biden as a board member, and that the reason why Joe Biden pushed for the firing was to protect Hunter Biden and his employer.

michael barbaro

So the theory is basically that the vice president does a favor for his son in the form of official action in Ukraine.

ken vogel

Correct.

michael barbaro

So where does the story behind that claim begin?

ken vogel

You’ve got to go back to 2014.

archived recording 44-year-old Hunter Biden, Vice President Joe Biden’s youngest son, was discharged from the Navy Reserve.

ken vogel

Hunter Biden, who is a Yale-educated lawyer and had dabbled in various business ventures —

archived recording Biden was given a routine drug test, which he failed.

ken vogel

— had just been discharged from the Navy Reserve after testing positive for cocaine during a drug test.

archived recording “It was the honor of my life to serve in the U.S. Navy, and I deeply regret and am embarrassed that my actions led to my administrative discharge.”

ken vogel

And at this point, he and some partners are starting to explore international opportunities. And one of his partners gets this gig on the board of this Ukrainian gas company that is looking for some Western political connections. And Hunter Biden asks if he can get in on this as well. And he is brought onto the board of this company.

archived recording And a son of the U.S. vise president has joined the board of directors of Ukraine’s largest private gas producer. Hunter Biden was appointed to the board of Burisma Holdings.

ken vogel

This company is called Burisma Holdings. It does primarily natural gas. And it is bringing onto its board a number of folks with big political names in the west. And one of them is Hunter Biden. He is paid as much as $50,000, or even more, in some months, to serve on the board of this company, and, ostensibly, to help it with governance reforms — to introduce Western corporate governance standards into this company.

michael barbaro

And how clear is it, Ken, that the reason why Hunter Biden is coming onto the board is because of his family connection? I mean, is it more or less explicit?

ken vogel

This is definitely the message that everyone in Ukraine and Washington takes away from it, as to why Hunter Biden is brought onto the board. His defenders point out that he had, in fact, served on other boards, including the board of Amtrak, where his dad famously has a lot of connections and clout. But he doesn’t really have much other applicable experience that would suggest that he is otherwise the ideal candidate to serve on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. He doesn’t have any experience in Ukraine or Ukrainian law, or even in energy.

michael barbaro

So what do we need to know about Burisma at this moment, when Hunter Biden arrives on the board?

ken vogel

Burisma has faced allegations of corruption, including many that are embraced by the West and by the State Department, which sees it, in many ways — both the company itself, Burisma, and the oligarch who owns the company as poster children for post-Soviet corruption in Ukraine.

michael barbaro

Hm. Ken, do we know if Hunter Biden understood this when he went on the board?

ken vogel

If he had done any due diligence, you would think that he should have known. There were certainly investigations that were already ongoing both in Ukraine and in the West into the oligarch who owned the company on suspicion of money laundering. And those investigations had support from the United States government. And that is where Joe Biden comes in.

michael barbaro

What do you mean?

archived recording (joe biden) We, the United States, stand with you and all the Ukrainian people.

ken vogel

Well, Joe Biden, at this time, is vice president. And one of his key foreign policy tasks that he takes on at the assignment of President Barack Obama is to help Ukraine stand up to Russian aggression.

archived recording (joe biden) It is not just a foreign policy judgment. It is a personal, it’s an emotional commitment, as well.

ken vogel

And one of the things that is seen as an impediment to Ukraine establishing a stable government is this scourge of corruption that has long plagued it and is seen as limiting its ability to attract international investment and to be a stable government that can mount a response to Russian aggression.

michael barbaro

And when is he given that assignment?

ken vogel

It comes pretty much at about the same time as Hunter Biden is going onto the board of this Ukrainian gas company, in early 2014.

michael barbaro

So that’s kind of complicated.

ken vogel

It is. And it certainly would provide rationale for this Ukrainian gas company and its oligarch owner to want to have a powerful westerner who is seen as having connections to the Obama government, which at this point is pushing Ukraine to clamp down on the very type of corruption that this oligarch and his company is seen as embodying.

michael barbaro

Does anyone raise the question of whether this is not a great idea that Joe Biden is suddenly investigating corruption in Ukraine around the same time that his son is now on the board of a major Ukrainian energy company that is accused of corruption?

ken vogel

Yes. We know that there’s a guy in the State Department by the name of George Kent who had deep experience both in Ukraine and in fighting corruption. He had served as the anti-corruption coordinator in the State Department’s European bureau. And he does raise concerns about Hunter Biden joining the board of Burisma and how Hunter Biden’s position could affect Vice President Biden’s standing as a corruption fighter, or the leader of the U.S. effort to push Ukraine to clamp down on corruption.

michael barbaro

But a decision is made that father and son can simultaneously do these two things.

ken vogel

It actually appears as if the decision was to not make a decision and to not address this. George Kent tried to bring this to the attention of the vice president’s staff and was essentially told that Vice President Biden did not have the bandwidth to address this at a time when he was dealing with other family issues, particularly his son Beau Biden, his other son, struggling with brain cancer.

michael barbaro

So what exactly does Vice President Joe Biden do during this period in his role as the guy in the Obama administration who’s trying to root out corruption in Ukraine? What does it actually look like?

ken vogel

Well, Biden focuses on two areas that are seen in the West as bastions of Ukrainian corruption. One is the energy sector. And the other is the judicial system. The international community has long seen the Ukrainian judicial system, and particularly the prosecutors therein, as one of the key problems that perpetuate Ukrainian corruption. These prosecutors have long been known for using the threat of prosecution to essentially solicit bribes from potential targets of corruption. So they are not only not prosecuting corruption, they are, in fact, participating in their own brand of corruption. This was one of the key things that Joe Biden trained his sights on when he went after Ukrainian corruption.

michael barbaro

Got it. So a company would basically pay off the prosecutor, and the prosecutor, therefore, wouldn’t really prosecute.

ken vogel

Yes. And the guy who was seen as emblematic of this type of corruption is Viktor Shokin. He’s the prosecutor general of Ukraine. It’s essentially like the attorney general of Ukraine. And what makes this complicated, though, is that one of the folks who Shokin is not prosecuting because it is believed he is using the threat of prosecution to solicit bribes from is none other than the oligarch who owns the company Burisma Holdings that is paying Hunter Biden to serve as a board member.

michael barbaro

Ah.

ken vogel

Yeah. And this is why some of the folks in the State Department had flagged this as a potential concern that could undermine Joe Biden’s ability to drive this message and be seen as a credible messenger, when in his own house, under his own roof, there is someone who is working with a potential target of the type of prosecution that Joe Biden is trying to encourage the Ukrainians to pursue.

michael barbaro

So what does Biden ultimately do about Shokin? [APPLAUSE]

archived recording (joe biden) Thank you very much.

ken vogel

Well, Biden privately pressures the then-president of Ukraine to get rid of Shokin. And he actually goes and gives a speech that gets a lot of play before the Ukrainian Parliament —

archived recording (joe biden) But in addition, you also have a battle —

ken vogel

— urging them to clamp down on corruption.

archived recording (joe biden) — against corruption. But it’s not enough to set up a new Anti-Corruption Bureau and establish a special prosecutor fighting corruption. The Office of the General Prosecutor desperately needs reform. The judiciary should be overhauled. The energy sector needs to be competitive, ruled by market principles, not sweetheart deals.

ken vogel

That doesn’t really do the trick. Maybe the Ukrainians are starting to move in this direction, but they don’t actually take the steps necessary to fire Shokin. And what Biden does is, he threatens to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to Ukraine if the then-president doesn’t act to get rid of Shokin.

michael barbaro

So you’re saying that in order for Joe Biden to get rid of this problematic prosecutor, he is threatening to withhold money from Ukraine — which feels like a now-familiar concept.

ken vogel

Yeah, it certainly does have a certain familiar ring to it. But what’s different in what Biden did from what Trump’s team did is that what Biden was doing was actually carrying out the official policy of the United States government, which was to push for this prosecutor’s ouster and to use a combination of diplomatic carrots and sticks in order to achieve that end. And $1 billion in loan guarantees is certainly a rather big carrot or stick, depending on which way you look at it.

michael barbaro

Right. Right. And did it work?

archived recording So on Tuesday, 29th of March, [INAUDIBLE] of Ukraine voted to grant consent by President Petro Poroshenko to dismiss Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin.

ken vogel

Eventually, it did. It’s not totally clear what role Biden and the loan guarantees played in it versus the mounting pressure from the international community and other international, Western lenders.

archived recording [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

ken vogel

But eventually —

archived recording (interpreter) The person who was building the system of corruption in prosecutor’s office cannot reform it. Shokin’s appointment was a mistake.

ken vogel

The then-president does take the steps to get the parliament to officially oust Shokin.

michael barbaro

And what does Shokin’s ouster mean for Burisma — this company that Hunter Biden sits on?

ken vogel

You might think that this would be really bad for Burisma if it is widely regarded as a corrupt company. You’re getting rid of a corrupt prosecutor who could be bought off from bringing prosecutions against targets of corruption — that if you get rid of that guy and bring in someone who is going to be more of an anti-corruption crusader, that the potential targets of corruption prosecutions, like Burisma, might be really in a bad spot. But in fact, it turns out to be a lot more complicated than that.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So Ken, you said that the aftermath of Joe Biden forcing out this prosecutor was more complicated than it seemed for Burisma, this company that employs Biden’s son. So what actually happens?

ken vogel

Well, Burisma actually welcome this new prosecutor and the chance to work with him, because they thought that if this prosecutor subscribed to Western approaches to jurisprudence that they would be able to convince this prosecutor by giving him evidence that, in fact, these allegations against Burisma and its oligarch owner were baseless.

michael barbaro

So you’re saying that Burisma thinks, if we play by normal rules and we have a regular old prosecutor, we can get cleared of these charges because in their minds, they’re not actually corrupt.

ken vogel

Yes. And this is very important to them at the time, because they are trying to expand and pursuing Western investment. And the cloud of these corruption investigations that Shokin had hanging over them was a hindrance to them. So they welcome the chance to have a new prosecutor who they believe they can convince that the allegations against them are off base and should be dropped.

michael barbaro

So what ends up happening to Burisma once this new prosecutor is welcomed in to take a look around?

ken vogel

Well, Burisma sends in a team of very well compensated, very highly regarded American lawyers and PR folks to meet with the new prosecutor. And while the new prosecutor initially takes something of a hard line against Burisma and forces them to pay some back taxes or fines, eventually, after 10 months, the new prosecutor announces that he has fully closed all of the legal proceedings and pending criminal allegations against the oligarch owner of Burisma and his companies. And the new prosecutor announces that the oligarch owner of Burisma is being removed from the wanted list. So the oligarch, who had been in exile, returns to Ukraine.

michael barbaro

So this all ends up pretty well for Burisma — the elimination of this corrupt prosecutor. So should we then assume that Burisma was, perhaps, never corrupt in the first place?

ken vogel

No, I don’t think that we can assume that. In fact, the anti-corruption activists in Ukraine really decried this decision to drop the cases against Burisma and its oligarch owner. So in Ukraine, at least, as well as in some quarters in the State Department, it is not in any way viewed as a clean bill of health for Burisma or its oligarch owner.

michael barbaro

So Ken, I want to summarize everything you just told me and hold it up against President Trump’s theory — the theory that Vice President Biden did what he did as a favor to his son once his son is on the board of Burisma. So in reality, Biden pressures Ukraine to fire somebody who is widely seen as a dirty prosecutor, who seems to be basically holding companies, including Burisma, hostage, and taking bribes in order not to investigate them. And in pushing out that prosecutor, Biden sets in motion a series of events that conclude with an investigation of Burisma coming to an end, even though from everything you’re saying, the company is still seen as corrupt. Do I have all that correct?

ken vogel

Yes.

michael barbaro

So in the end, Biden takes an action that does benefit Burisma, and less directly, his son.

ken vogel

Indirectly, having the new prosecutor does benefit Burisma and its oligarch owner. And Hunter Biden does remain on the board of Burisma until this year. But I think this is where we get into questions of intent. And there is no evidence that it was the intent of Vice President Joe Biden to take this action to benefit Burisma, let alone his son.

michael barbaro

So can we say that this theory that the vice president did what he did in Ukraine to help his son — can we say that it is false?

ken vogel

We can say that there is no evidence that Joe Biden acted corruptly to help his son in Ukraine.

[music]

^ARCHIVED RECORDING (DONALD TRUMP)^” We’re looking for corruption. There’s tremendous corruption. We’re looking for — why should we be giving hundreds of millions of dollars to countries where there’s this kind of corruption? And if you look at my call, I said corruption. I think he said it to me. He’s looking. He got elected on the basis of corruption. And also, by the way —

michael barbaro

I’m struck, Ken, about what we can say definitively here versus what we can say definitively about the president’s first theory about CrowdStrike and Ukraine hacking the D.N.C. servers. That theory draws on fabricated facts and is thoroughly disprovable and has been disproven. The second theory, about the Bidens — it draws on real facts, but there’s no evidence of it. And yet it’s not really disprovable. Does that make sense?

ken vogel

Yeah. It’s a lot more complicated. It’s a lot more nuanced. There are a lot more facts. And there is a fact pattern that did trouble employees in the State Department at the time and then subsequently, as it’s gotten a lot more attention, has troubled ethics experts, who say that the Bidens did not do a good enough job addressing concerns about conflict of interest. Now, all that said, it does not mean that Trump’s theory that Biden acted corruptly to benefit his son is correct. There is no evidence of that, to be 100% clear.

michael barbaro

Right. It seems like both Joe Biden and Hunter Biden put themselves in a position where people could later question their motives and their judgment, because either Hunter Biden should not have been on that board at the same time that his father was taking on corruption in Ukraine, or his father, knowing that his son was on that board, should not have taken on corruption in Ukraine.

ken vogel

Yes, that’s right. And what’s interesting is that the way that the Bidens sought to address this and to avoid these conflicts of interest is by expressly not knowing about what one another were doing. In other words, Joe Biden said he did not want to know anything about what Hunter Biden was doing in the private sector, because how could he be doing anything in his job as vice president to help his son if he did not know what his son’s interests were? Now, there’s an argument to be made that that’s not really a good way to inoculate yourself against these concerns. The way to inoculate yourself is to know about one another are doing so you can avoid these potential areas of overlap.

michael barbaro

So Ken, I wonder, in the end, what is the power of these two theories that the president has pursued here about Ukraine and the D.N.C. and Ukraine and the Bidens in the impeachment inquiry, especially as it enters these final, crucial weeks?

ken vogel

These two theories are why we are in the middle of an impeachment inquiry. The fact that President Trump pressured the Ukrainian government to pursue investigations into these two theories is, for Democrats, a justification for removal from office — the very definition of the type of high crime and misdemeanor that is justification for removal from office. And that’s how Democrats have been talking about these theories, as debunked conspiracy theories, and will continue talking about them as impeachment proceeds.

[music]

And for Republicans, who are trying to defend Trump, he’s making their life more difficult here, because while they see there being some validity in the theories that he’s pushing about the Bidens, they see this theory that it was the Ukrainians and not the Russians who hacked into the D.N.C. servers as totally crazy. Many of them — most of them, I would say, even — privately, they’ll say this — they wished that he would stop talking about it because they think that this dilutes the argument that they can make that there was a legitimate corruption concern that President Trump was urging the Ukrainian government to pursue.

michael barbaro

So they prefer the Biden theory vastly to the D.N.C. server theory.

ken vogel

Yeah, that’s right. And they think that despite the way that the president has misrepresented the Biden theory and ascribed motivations that cannot be substantiated to Joe Biden, that nonetheless, this is a theory that could be politically helpful to the president and politically damaging to Joe Biden. And that is among the reasons why we are going to continue hearing the names Hunter Biden and Joe Biden from Republicans for as long as these impeachment proceedings go.

House Republicans like Representatives Devin Nunes and Jim Jordan seem eager to portray Fusion as co-conspirators with the Ukrainians in some devilish plot to undermine Mr. Trump’s 2016 candidacy. That could not be farther from the truth. None of the information in the so-called Steele dossier came from Ukrainian sources. Zero. And we’ve never met Serhiy Leshchenko , the Ukrainian former legislator and journalist whom Republicans want to blame for the downfall of Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.

That said, our investigation of Donald Trump did get a great boost because of Ukraine, just not in the way Republicans imagine. We began looking into Mr. Trump’s business dealings and ties to Russia in the fall of 2015 with funding from Republicans who wanted to stop his political ascent. The Ukraine alarms went off six months later, when candidate Trump brought into his campaign none other than Mr. Manafort, a man with his own tangled history with Russian oligarchs trying to get their way in Ukraine.

It turns out we already knew a great deal about Mr. Manafort’s activities in Ukraine because we worked on several stories about his work for Russian-backed politicians eight years earlier, when we were both still writing for The Wall Street Journal. That reporting threw a spotlight on how Mr. Manafort, while representing clients involved in fierce geopolitical struggles over Ukraine, had neglected to comply with a lobbying law requiring that he register as a foreign agent — the very law, among others, to which he pleaded guilty of violating.

Those articles triggered years of media coverage exposing Mr. Manafort’s questionable lobbying activities and ties to pro-Russia oligarchs. In the meantime, we left The Journal and went on to found Fusion GPS, a research and strategic intelligence firm, in 2010."

Specifically, the three priorities of security, economy and justice, and our support for Ukrainian democratic resistance to Russian aggression, became overshadowed by a political agenda promoted by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and a cadre of officials operating with a direct channel to the White House.” “Based on questions and statements I’ve heard, some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country — and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did. This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves. The unfortunate truth is that Russia was the foreign power that systematically attacked our democratic institutions in 2016. And I refuse to be part of an effort to legitimize an alternate narrative that the Ukrainian government is a U.S. adversary and that Ukraine, not Russia, attacked us in 2016.” “Although the hold on the security assistance may have been lifted, there are still things they wanted that they weren’t getting, including a meeting with the president in the Oval Office. So — and I think that continues to this day, I think they’re being very careful. They still need us.” “Obviously what Mr. Giuliani was saying was pretty explosive in any case. He was frequently on television making quite incendiary remarks about everyone involved in this, and that he was clearly pushing forward issues and ideas that would, you know, probably come back to haunt us. And, in fact, I think that that’s where we are today.” “We asked Ambassador Sondland about that at his deposition. He indicated you were upset and you were upset with Ambassador Bolton and upset with the way things were going —” “Very unfortunately, I had a bit of a blowup with Ambassador Sondland, and I had a couple of testy encounters with him. He was being involved in a domestic political errand — and we were being involved in national security foreign policy. And those two things had just diverged. But I was irritated with him and angry with him that he wasn’t fully coordinating. And I did say to him, ‘Ambassador Sondland, Gordon, I think this is all going to blow up.’ And here we are.” “You may be aware of some of the attacks on Colonel Vindman suggesting that he has a dual loyalty — that he’s not really loyal to America, he’s loyal to Ukraine. I want to ask you as a fellow immigrant what you think of those kind of accusations when they’re leveled against Colonel Vindman or other Americans?” “This is my country, and the country that I serve. And I know for a fact that every single one of my colleagues, and there were many naturalized citizens in my office and across the National Security Council, felt exactly the same way. I think it’s deeply unfair. And so when I came in, Gordon Sondland was basically saying, well, look, we have a deal here that there will be a meeting, I have a deal here with Chief of Staff Mulvaney, there will be a meeting if the Ukrainians open up or announce these investigations into 2016 and Burisma — and I cut it off immediately there. Because by this point, having heard Mr. Giuliani over and over again on the television, and all of the issues that he was asserting, by this point it was clear that Burisma was code for the Bidens, because Giuliani was laying it out there. I could see why Colonel Vindman was alarmed and he said, this is inappropriate, we’re the National Security Council, we can’t be involved in this.” “Did your boss — Doctor, I mean, Ambassador Bolton, tell you that Giuliani was, quote, ‘a hand grenade’?” “He did, yes.” “What do you think he meant by his characterization of Giuliani as a hand grenade?” “What he meant by this was pretty clear to me in the context of all of the statements that Mr. Giuliani was making publicly — that the investigations that he was promoting, that the storyline he was promoting, the narrative he was promoting, was going to backfire.” “And it’s time for this phase of the publicly announced and proclaimed Democrat coup to end. Thank you for your service. Thanks for being here. And I yield back.” “Could I actually say something? Because we’ve had three —” “Doctor, I was going to — I was going to ask you if you’d like to respond. There have been —” “I yielded back!” “I — gentleman will suspend — Dr. Hill, you may respond.” I think all of us who came here under a legal obligation also felt we had a moral obligation to do so. We came as fact witnesses. We need to be together again in 2020, so the American people can make a choice about the future and about — to make their votes in a presidential election without any fear.”"

Biden Jr. should not take support from African-Americans for granted.

Mr. Biden’s strength with black voters has been a key force in helping him maintain a polling edge in the race, even as the candidacies of Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont ascended among progressives. But on Thursday, both challengers — as well as Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, two black candidates in the race, and other contenders — made explicit appeals about how they would address concerns and priorities of black voters.

Ms. Warren, who is Mr. Biden’s leading rival in many state and national polls, took direct aim at his reliance on black support by delivering one of her biggest speeches of the campaign, describing how governments and powerful corporations use racism and racial injustice as a wedge to divide working-class people. And she argued that it was time for the nation’s policies to include specific correctives to address discrimination.

“Don’t talk about race-neutral laws,” she said at a rally on Thursday evening at Clark Atlanta University, a historically black institution. “The federal government helped create the racial divide in this country through decades of active, state-sponsored discrimination, and that means the federal government has a responsibility to fix it.”"

I remember in history class, must have been a junior, it was during the impeachment process of President Clinton or all the scandal, everything that was going on. And I remember the teacher was just kind of riffing on this, and he said, you know, would anybody here ever want to be president or want to run for office, seeing what a mess and what an ugly place Washington was? And I just — maybe involuntarily, my hand went up. And from then on, it became that the running joke of the class that I’d wind up running for president. And then by the time I got to college, they had this Institute of Politics at Harvard, and every day, there’d be a different speaker who would come through. And I remember when I was there as a freshman, people like Donna Brazile who had just come off managing the Gore campaign and Rick Davis, who had done the same thing for McCain. And the former president of Ecuador, he’d been deposed in a coup. You’d just kind of hang around and watch them and see what they were like. The biggest realization was that they’re just people. These people who were shaping the world, people I was seeing on TV were obviously very impressive people, but they were just people. I think it changed my awareness of the fact that, on some level, I could be part of that world, too. But in a very simple sense, especially coming from Indiana, it seemed that it was a choice. You could be in elected office, or you could be an out gay person, not both, at least not where I was from. From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

Pete Buttigieg. It’s Friday, November 22. So Jeremy Peters, you cover politics for The Times, and you’ve been closely tracking Mayor Buttigieg. And in order to better understand the Democratic field of presidential candidates, we’re trying to figure out the most revealing moments in their lives. So when it comes to Pete Buttigieg, what moment should we focus on?

jeremy peters

Well, Mayor Pete has always been a candidate for whom his story, his biography is very central to his appeal to voters, and he’s got a great story to tell. He’s been elected mayor of this medium-sized town in Indiana before turning 30. He has an Ivy League pedigree. He’s been a Rhodes Scholar. He’s worked at a prestigious consulting firm. He’s gone off to Afghanistan as part of the Navy Reserves. So he has all of these components that you kind of think if you’re a voter, wow, he really stands out. There’s something unique about this guy. But at the same time, for most of his adult life, he had this nagging secret, the secret that he couldn’t confront because he thought that it would mean the end to this political career that he had spent so much time perfecting, basically since he went away to college and decided, hey, you know, I can run for president. And he doesn’t see how it’s possible for the politician with the perfect background, the perfect resume to also be open about their sexuality, in his case. So how he reconciles this inner turmoil with his very public ambition I think is a defining moment in his life, if not the defining moment.

michael barbaro

All right. Welcome to the studio.

pete buttigieg

Thank you.

michael barbaro

You’re going to sit there.

pete buttigieg

All right.

jeremy peters

So that story begins in 1982 in South Bend, Indiana where Peter Buttigieg was born.

michael barbaro

Mayor, tell me about the kind of kid that you were, growing up in Indiana?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think I was, safe to say, a little on the nerdy side. I lived in a neighborhood kind of in the middle of South Bend, close to a park where you would have as much as possible what you’d call a prototypical Midwestern kid’s upbringing, you know, playing in the park with friends, a lot of time in the house. I was really interested in baseball cards, but I was more interested in categorizing them than I was in baseball, I think. I loved science and science fiction. I loved reading, plus I was an only child. So I think it’s safe to say I had a lot of interior life going on in a fairly quiet house where it was a dog and my parents, who were both academics, and me.

michael barbaro

What was your introduction to even the idea of politics?

pete buttigieg

Politics was always in the air in our house just because my parents were very politically passionate. They really cared about what was happening. I can remember the Democratic Convention. It must have been 1988.

archived recording NBC News continues its coverage of America’s convention.

pete buttigieg

I would’ve been six years old and my parents explaining what a convention was. I remember Jesse Jackson giving a speech.

archived recording (jesse jackson) When I look out at this convention, I see the face of America — red, yellow, brown, black, and white. We are all precious in God’s sight, the real rainbow coalition.

pete buttigieg

And I remember my parents thinking it was important to watch the Republican Convention, too. I mean, you would stop — even though I don’t it ever crossed their mind to ever vote for a Republican.

archived recording Now let’s go down to the podium. Here is George Herbert Walker Bush addressing his convention.

pete buttigieg

Everything in the house would kind of stop when it was time to watch what was playing out.

archived recording Thank you.

michael barbaro

At what moment in this early phase of your life did you go from just watching this and maybe finding it very fascinating to feeling really drawn to it?

pete buttigieg

Well, when I got to college, it felt like the Republicans and the Democrats, at the time, it’s crazy to think about now, polarized as we are. But what it felt like when I showed up as a freshman on campus was that the two parties were converging and not necessarily in a good place, that you had this kind of center-right and center-left, both of them very committed to growth in business, but it seemed not very committed at all to some of the questions of how we take care of vulnerable people around the country. And I think there’s a moment for any kind of well-spoken or intelligent young person watching the news when you see a senator or a candidate saying something or doing something and you think, well, that’s not right. I could do that. I could do it different. Now, you might be wrong. They might be way more sophisticated than you are, and you can’t see it. Or you might be right, and it might well be the case that what they’re saying is just not right. But I certainly had that feeling reinforced when I saw these figures come to campus, some of whom were extremely impressive, but none of whom seemed like they were on a different plane of existence. They were just people.

michael barbaro

So at this point, a year or two into Harvard, have you made up your mind that you were probably going to find a way to have a career in politics?

pete buttigieg

I knew I wanted a career that involved policy. I don’t think I’d figured out for sure that that meant running. Plus, you know, when I thought about it, even well before I was coming to terms with the fact that I was gay, I knew that I had no political connections at home. I had an unpronounceable name, and I was a Democrat who lived in Indiana. So it was not obvious that I could overcome some of the obstacles toward running. But I think it’s safe to say by the time I graduated, I had some sense that I could see myself doing it.

michael barbaro

Well, I want to talk to you about that realization of your sexuality in particular. Obviously, your candidacy is historic in a couple of different ways, and among those is the fact you’re the first major party presidential candidate who is openly gay. And so I want to ask you about that part of your identity. When did you sense that you were gay? When did that realization start to dawn on you?

pete buttigieg

I think it depends what you mean by realization, right? There are things you could point to going way back, certainly a fascination I had with a classmate when I was about 12 that, in hindsight, is very obviously a crush. But I was not willing to think of it that way, although some part of me must have — I mean, I wasn’t stupid either, right? So you have this kind of awareness that was definitely there by the time I was hitting middle school. But taking a word like gay and applying it to myself, I was still years away from being able to do that, even in my own mind.

michael barbaro

Well, what did you do with those feelings?

pete buttigieg

I guess I packed them up, yeah.

michael barbaro

Packed them up —

pete buttigieg

Not much would be the best answer.

michael barbaro

Pack them up and put them where?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I don’t know how these things work, even in your own mind. I just didn’t explore them. That’s for sure. First of all, there were not a lot of out gay people that I knew as such growing up. I mean, in high school, it was exactly zero. There was just no sense of gay life or a gay community. And when I got to college, that’s when the kind of internal battle was starting to heat up.

michael barbaro

Why?

pete buttigieg

I think because you just can’t escape it. I mean, my god, you’re in college, right? I mean, any feelings you have, especially in the romantic department, are going to start asserting themselves even more fiercely than they have when you get to college. For a lot of people, it’s a big part of what you spend college on.

michael barbaro

Right. So how did you deal with it?

pete buttigieg

Same way I dealt with it up to then, just packed it away. Dated women, remarkable women. Because I enjoyed these relationships, I think I could defer facing the fact that that wasn’t the same as what it was to be in love with somebody.

michael barbaro

And your political ambition was already solid at that point?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I still didn’t know exactly where it would take me or what it would mean, but I think by then, I knew that there was a good chance I was going to be running for office in my adult life. But at that point, I’m still clinging to some kind of hope, however vanishing, that maybe I’m straight or I’m bisexual and I can just not worry about the gay part. I think when I thought about my career, certainly when I talked about my future and how I was going to be involved, I wasn’t even thinking about the possibility that that would come into contact with this developing side of me. But I’m sure to the extent that I thought what it would mean to come to terms with the fact that I was at very least different and, as became increasingly clear, gay, that one of the things that would have kept that in its corner was the simple fact that that didn’t fit with any of the other things I wanted to do in life, not just a career, but a family. I wanted to get married. I wanted to have kids. From my perspective, you could be married and have kids or you could be gay, not both.

michael barbaro

You graduated in 2004. That — correct me if I’m wrong. That’s the year when Massachusetts —

pete buttigieg

That’s right.

michael barbaro

— legalizes gay marriage.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

archived recording The court today, as you know, in a 4-3 advisory opinion to the Senate has a rule that in a November 18, 2003 decision, they meant marriage. They meant equality. They meant that the Commonwealth may no longer deny marriage rights to same-sex couples, including —

michael barbaro

So I say that only to try to understand, are you falling behind the culture, in a sense? Are you ignoring some of the signs that these things are changing?

archived recording Marriage and only marriage will be enough to satisfy the requirements of the Massachusetts Constitution.

pete buttigieg

Well, the thing is I wasn’t from Massachusetts. I was in Massachusetts for a while, but I never felt like I was from there. And nothing against Massachusetts, but I realized pretty quick after turning up at Harvard that I didn’t belong there either.

michael barbaro

Why not?

pete buttigieg

It was just — it was just a different culture. I didn’t realize that. I didn’t realize that I was Midwestern until I left the Midwest. And just little things, cultural things, the way — I don’t know, the way people interact, what’s expected of you. Once I got there, I realized that socially, I was way more Midwestern than I thought.

michael barbaro

So take me from graduating from Harvard to your decision to join the Navy Reserves.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so it starts with 9/11. Actually, it starts before 9/11. There’s this family tradition of serving in the military. There’s a painting hanging on the wall of my parents’ house of a relative, a great uncle who I kind of idolized in theory. He was an Army Air Corps pilot. And so I had this idea, this maybe romantic idea, of being in the military, and then it never really became real. But I remember on 9/11 thinking, oh, well, war isn’t just a thing that happens in other places or in other periods of history. Like, war has come to my generation, and thinking, at least in the back of my head, that that might mean I would be involved, but not taking any steps to do that. But that turned into more and more of a nagging feeling when some friends of mine started to serve. A friend of mine from college shared with me just before we graduated that he had decided to join the Navy Reserve. I was fascinated. And then when I was talking to someone about applying for the Rhodes Scholarship and how I wanted to talk about my interest in public service and to the faculty member who was giving advice to students, and just said, pointedly, like, you might want to really think about how you’re going to say that, knowing that you’re going to be competing against people from the military academies. Oh yeah, that’s true. Like, my chest thumping about caring about public service feels a lot smaller held up against what others are doing.

michael barbaro

Do you think that was one of the things that might have drawn you to military service, knowing that to get a Rhodes, to be in that world, in that league, you know, it might be a good thing?

pete buttigieg

I think definitely that it was part of how you’re true to a culture of service. And also the Kennedy presidency kind of hangs over certainly the Kennedy School, as you might imagine. And that can’t be separated from his military career.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

I mean, really, it was almost an expectation that you would’ve served, up until roughly the time when I came of age when everything shifted.

michael barbaro

An expectation that you would serve —

pete buttigieg

Well, when you’re looking at the history of the people we were studying —

michael barbaro

Of presidents.

pete buttigieg

— who have made history. Yep, as presidents. And then the thing that put me over the top was this experience knocking on doors in Iowa with a couple of buddies from college who went out. We took a week off and rented a car, and it was the last few days before the Iowa caucuses, and we were volunteers for Obama. They sent us to this very rural area, some of the lowest income counties in Iowa. And it felt like any time I met a young — especially young man — it was somebody who was serving or was about to serve. And I started to realize, we had service that used to be something that bridged people together. Now it’s completely different, that if you were rural or low-income, you were highly likely to serve. If you were from a background like mine, which was middle class economically, but I’d had the chance to go to an institution like Harvard, almost nobody with that background was serving. And I began to feel like it wasn’t just this kind of thing I thought about that I hadn’t gotten around to. It was that I was part of the problem. I was part of the divide. That was the thing that kind of propelled me that last few inches toward being ready to yank open the door of the recruiting office in Indiana and say, hey, how do I sign up?

michael barbaro

I wondered, do you think you joined the military in part because you knew what it would mean for a political career?

pete buttigieg

You know, I wrestled with that because as soon as I get that question, there’s a part of me that thinks, if the answer is yes, does that mean the service wasn’t pure in some way? And I remember at the time asking myself if being in the military was as unpopular as it is today popular, would I still do it? And I want to believe the answer is yes, but there’s no way to go back and prove it. I’m not somebody who thinks that it’s, like, a prerequisite that if you want to run for office you need to have served. But I do think if you have a heart for elected office, one way to put your money where your mouth is to have been in that kind of service, too.

michael barbaro

That strikes me as a very candid answer because of course, you could just say, well, of course I would have done it, even if there was no possible —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

— political benefit.

pete buttigieg

And I want to say that. I just can’t prove it.

michael barbaro

So I want to talk about this run for mayor for just a little bit. Whenever you run for office, your character is on display. And at this point, you are keeping something quite elemental about yourself secret. Did it feel like you were hiding something?

pete buttigieg

Not really. The only time it felt that way was when there was small talk about whether I was dating, and I would crack a joke or something. We’d be sitting in a studio like this one and a radio host would ask a question. And I’d say, well, if anybody listening is into economic policy and long walks on the beach, go ahead and reach out and just kind of play the busy single person, which is what I was, except for the fact that I wasn’t actively looking for love. I was going out of my way to avoid it. But if somebody who is straight up asked me on the record, to this day, I’m not sure what I would have done.

michael barbaro

Do you think that that would have potentially cost you the mayoralty, might have kept you from being mayor or staying mayor?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I think there’s a good chance of it. There’s a reason why no — as far as I know, no out gay person had ever run for mayor of any place in Indiana.

michael barbaro

This is a state with strong Christian values, and —

pete buttigieg

— not known for progressive social outlooks on politics. And here I am, rocking up, 29 years old saying, trust me, support me. Never mind this state legislator who has earned tons of credibility in this community. Never mind this county councilman who’s the party favorite. Go with me instead. If there had been anything that looked like a skeleton or a vulnerability, I think it probably would have sunk me before I got anywhere at all.

michael barbaro

So I want to now move into this notion of you reconciling these things.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so when I first joined the Reserve, the message was kind of you’re pretty much going to go to one of these wars, and we’ll let you know which one. And so I knew that, at a certain point, it was coming. And of course, I didn’t want to take office in South Bend without a plan for this. So we had gamed it out with my team, if I get orders, here’s what you do. And when I received my orders and knew I was going for sure, I don’t think even then it occurred to me that it would have much to do with my sexuality. If anything, I was thankful that I was single, right? The hardest thing for people to deploy is the fact that you’re leaving behind somebody you love, in addition to all the professional complications. But then, the more I started getting mentally ready for going over and really thinking about what it meant, the more it started weighing on me that I didn’t have a — wasn’t coming back to a family, my parents, of course, but I wasn’t coming back to a household. And more than that, I had no idea what it was like to be in love. And the idea that I’m — here I am. I’m a grown-ass man. I own a home. I’m the mayor of my city. I’m a military officer. And if I get killed over there, I will go to my grave not knowing what it’s like to be in love. And that just made me realize how untenable the situation I was in really was. And up until then, it didn’t seem untenable, I guess because I was so busy, and I might have deferred coming out and having a dating life forever, if not for this moment where I’m thinking, shit, I could die.

michael barbaro

You wrote a letter I want to ask you about.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, you know, it’s a thing you do. I assume everybody does it. I don’t know. But it’s the thing you do when you go to war, right? You want to make sure that you have the last word on your life and leave a few instructions. So I wrote up a letter, put an envelope, put just in case on the outside. Put it in the desk drawer, would’ve been pretty easy to find if worse comes to worst. And that’s a real moment, too, because you’re sitting there staring at the screen trying to figure out how to give a short accounting of your life.

michael barbaro

And what did you say?

pete buttigieg

Well, what I said was that I wouldn’t want people to think that I’d been cheated, that obviously it’d be terrible if I didn’t come back, but I also had this amazing life where I have wonderful friendships, and I got to serve my community in a way that very few people get to do, let alone at my age, and that I’d had this very fulfilling life. And of course, it’d be too bad if something happened to me, but to keep that in perspective. But if you’re asking if there was, like, P.S. I’m gay, no.

michael barbaro

That’s kind of what I was asking. So you are deployed.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

You do not die.

pete buttigieg

Right.

michael barbaro

You come back, and you’re mayor.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

And how do you decide that it’s time to come out?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think by the time I hit the ground and I was back, I knew that I was going to come out and then it’s just — it was more how and when. I remember resenting the idea that you’re supposed to have to come out, right? Straight people don’t have to come out. Why do I? And then, while I’m in the process of figuring this out —

We have this explosive controversy over Mike Pence, the Governor Mike Pence and his so-called Religious Freedom bill.

archived recording The Religious Freedom Restoration Act was about religious liberty, not about discrimination.

pete buttigieg

So suddenly, we’re on national television, my state, as the most officially anti-gay state in the country. I’m fighting him on it, of course, because it’s a terrible policy. But now, I’m fighting this terrible, anti-gay policy putatively from the perspective of a straight ally, wondering whether I’m more effective because people don’t know that I’m gay. And at the same time, knowing that this just kind of speeds things up even more that, like, it’s just a really weird position to be in, to be having all these hypothetical arguments about discrimination against gay people, when it really means me. Meanwhile, this is also the period when we realize that soon the Supreme Court is going to weigh in on marriage. I mean, all of this was happening in that early part of 2015 while I’m wrestling with how to do this. And so oddly enough, it was — — as busy as I was as mayor. Military duty actually felt like, kind of almost like a break because it was eight hour days, 40 hour week. I wasn’t used to having that much time, and so is a lot of time to sit and write and think and call friends and get advice.

michael barbaro

So you produce a plan.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, well I produced a letter, an op-ed I guess.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. What was the essential line that I’m sure you remember that you wrote?

pete buttigieg

I remember saying that it’s just part of who I am and that it has no bearing on how I do my job, that the way I do my — did my job either as an officer or as a mayor or in business had nothing to do with the fact that I was gay and that —

michael barbaro

It still sounds a little defensive.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Or maybe a little scared.

pete buttigieg

Probably. Yeah, I mean, you know, I didn’t feel like I was coming out guns blazing. I felt like I — again, part of me was bothered that I had to share this at all. Then part of me knew that it would do some good if I did, I mean, not just in my own life. That I — my main agenda was, personally, I wanted to get out there and start dating. But also that it would mean something, might mean all kinds of things to a whole bunch of different people when I came out and said this.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording A very personal announcement coming from South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg today. In an essay published in today’s South Bend Tribune, the mayor announced he is gay. Currently in the midst of running for a second term, Pete Buttigieg penned an essay in Tuesday’s South Bend Tribune revealing he was gay. A lot of people wondering why he chose to make this announcement now. It comes just months after the state’s religious freedom law thrust the state into the national debate on gay rights. As for the mayor himself, he says nothing is different, nothing has changed, and his focus is on South Bend.

michael barbaro

I want to talk about the timing, the exact moment of the op-ed because my sense is that at this phase of your career, you’re up for re-election, right? You’ve won the primary. And winning the primary, in a sense, means you’re standing a very good shot of winning.

pete buttigieg

Depending on the year, but yeah, in South Bend, it should be.

michael barbaro

So does that mean you deliberately chose a — like, a safe, low-risk time to do this?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I would think that going into a Democratic primary would be a safer time than going into a general election. And I think also the decision to do this came by way of realizing that there is no such thing as a safe time. I was just done with not having the kind of personal life that I wanted to have.

michael barbaro

So once you come out, how does your personal life change?

pete buttigieg

Well, I started dating, and that kind of changes everything. I mean, I still had this very demanding job. You’re the mayor, and so anybody in town that you ask to have a cup of coffee is —

michael barbaro

It’s a thing.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, it’s a thing. It might be misinterpreted. You could cross some line without meaning to. I mean, most of the people I interacted with were either people who needed something from me, people I needed something from or people who worked for me. So it’s not, like, a very healthy pool for dating is what I’m saying. And I remember thinking there were all these kind of city fathers who, early on in my time as mayor, seemed determined to fix me up with their daughters. And I remember just thinking, like, where are you now? Did none of you have, like, a son or a nephew or something? So I did what millennials do. I went online. Turns out there’s apps for all of this. There was O.K. Cupid, Tinder. The one that actually came through for me was called Hinge. And it’s supposed to serve up people that — I don’t know how the algorithm works. But I find this guy, this cute guy with a big smile, and I’m like, I want to know this guy. So we start chatting. Well, I was chatting with a lot of people, but obviously, he’s the one I remember because that was Chasten.

michael barbaro

Your future husband.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

michael barbaro

So your story, to many people, is particularly compelling one, everything we just discussed. You are a Harvard graduate, a Rhodes Scholar, you’re a veteran. You’re gay. You’re religious. And from your own description of yourself, it feels like you have been thinking about politics and preparing, to some degree, to run for president for a very long time, even though you’re quite young. And I’m sure you understand this and have heard this. That has led to this perception of a person kind of, perhaps, orchestrating a political biography. Do you ever question whether that, no matter what your intention, is — could possibly undermine the power of the story itself, however genuine?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I mean, I think we’re conditioned to not like the idea of somebody who sat around thinking all their lives about how to become president. And I don’t view myself that way, although I get that that story has been written around me. Although, I also don’t know what it is we expect, that somebody kind of gets struck by lightning and then they turn into somebody who might become president. We all have these paths, right, that bring us to where we are. And I think anybody in professional life or even social life thinks about the story that you tell about yourself. At the end of the day, I’m not doing this because I have this personal need to be in elected office or to be the president. I’m not coming at the presidency as a thing that I’d like to occupy. I’m coming at it as this way to do something that I think I’m able to do. And I think it’s helpful in the sense that I could also have a very happy life doing something else. And oddly, I think that — that helps prepare me to do what’s required to do this. And this is advice I give talking to students, too. Imagine somebody is being sworn in, an ambitious, talented person kind of in the middle of their career is being sworn in as an assistant secretary in the State Department for the Middle East. And then imagine if that person has got there one of two ways. In kind of universe A, it’s a person who woke up one day in high school and said, I want to be the assistant secretary for the Middle East, and took the right courses and got the right jobs and had the right fellowships and wrote the right papers and did everything in order to occupy that title. And the other person is somebody who said, I — woke up in high school and said, I want to be the person who makes the United States a force toward peace in the Middle East. And they don’t know what that’s going to mean, and maybe it means they start out becoming an activist or maybe they’re an academic or maybe they’re a civil servant or whatever. But by whatever winding path, they wind up in this job, right? Which of those two scenarios is going to lead to somebody who’s better equipped to take that job they’ve been handed? I’ve got to think it’s the latter. And so what I’ve tried to do in my life is to prepare myself to be useful to others. And yes, I think that, in all likelihood, means in a form that involves holding office or seeking office or at least public life where I speak to lots of people, sometimes millions at the same time. But it’s not about, necessarily, having one title or another. And so I think if you overthink it, that’s where you start to lose the fidelity to what it is that would guide you when you actually get what you’ve been chasing for a long time. Jeremy, what do we learn from Mayor Pete Buttigieg about the way he reconciled his political ambition with this essential fact about himself that he feared would endanger that ambition?

jeremy peters

I think we learn a lot about his decision-making process, not just how he internalizes decisions personally, but how he thinks about them in the longer arc of a political career. And he’s been very intentional all along the way about choosing certain endeavors that he thinks would benefit a long-term political career. Now some people would think, on the one hand, that’s too calculating. I don’t want somebody who’s thought about being president since he was a teenager. And, you know, in the era when voters seemed to prize authenticity in their political figures, they could see that as inauthentic. On the other hand, the decision that he made to wait seems to have borne out to his benefit. I mean, here he is, the first openly gay candidate for president of the United States who has a legitimate shot at being his party’s nominee. Look at where he is in the Democratic primary right now. He’s rocketed to the top of the polls. He’s brought in all this money in large part because he’s gay, and that opened a lot of doors with Democratic donors. He’s heading into the Iowa caucuses in the lead by some measures. But we won’t know if his decision to wait actually was the right one until people start voting. So it seems to have worked out well for him right now, but no one’s cast a single vote. And we don’t know how voters in the Democratic primary are going to react. We certainly don’t know how voters in a general election are going to react. So we’re just not going to know until Democratic voters have their say.

michael barbaro

Mayor, when you think back to your younger self —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Not just your teenage self, but even your college self and your post-collegiate self who was so fearful about telling the world that you were gay, what do you kind of wish you could tell that person, that version of Mayor Buttigieg?

pete buttigieg

Well, back then, I would have thought this other fact, if I dared to unpack it, this fact about my life, this way in which I was different, was the thing that could multiply all the other stuff by zero, in terms of the impact I was going to have in the world, that I might very well choose that path, but that the price would be that I wouldn’t get to make a difference in public life. And if you want proof of God having a sense of humor, one of the things I’m seeing now, especially in the interactions I have on the campaign trail and the fact that this campaign is historic in a lot of ways, is that that same fact that I thought would mean never getting to this point might actually be one of the things that makes it matter the most.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

It’s a strange thing to think about that the one thing that I couldn’t control, the one thing that might have meant that it would be better not to have any aspirations related to politics at all could be the very thing that anchors the moral and emotional purpose of this entire campaign.

michael barbaro

Thank you very much.

pete buttigieg

Thanks for having me.

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

michael barbaro

In the latest public testimony before impeachment investigators, Fiona Hill, the former top Russia expert on the National Security Council, recalled her growing frustration with Ambassador Gordon Sondland, as she realized he was pursuing a political agenda in Ukraine on behalf of President Trump.

archived recording (fiona hill) He was being involved in a domestic, political errand, and we were being involved in national security foreign policy and those two things have just diverged.

michael barbaro

Hill testified that when Trump and Sondland pressed Ukraine to investigate the discredited theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, they were playing directly into Russia’s hands, since Russia wants to deflect attention away from its interference.

archived recording (fiona hill) This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves. These fictions are harmful, even if they’re deployed for purely domestic, political purposes.

I remember in history class, must have been a junior, it was during the impeachment process of President Clinton or all the scandal, everything that was going on. And I remember the teacher was just kind of riffing on this, and he said, you know, would anybody here ever want to be president or want to run for office, seeing what a mess and what an ugly place Washington was? And I just — maybe involuntarily, my hand went up. And from then on, it became that the running joke of the class that I’d wind up running for president. And then by the time I got to college, they had this Institute of Politics at Harvard, and every day, there’d be a different speaker who would come through. And I remember when I was there as a freshman, people like Donna Brazile who had just come off managing the Gore campaign and Rick Davis, who had done the same thing for McCain. And the former president of Ecuador, he’d been deposed in a coup. You’d just kind of hang around and watch them and see what they were like. The biggest realization was that they’re just people. These people who were shaping the world, people I was seeing on TV were obviously very impressive people, but they were just people. I think it changed my awareness of the fact that, on some level, I could be part of that world, too. But in a very simple sense, especially coming from Indiana, it seemed that it was a choice. You could be in elected office, or you could be an out gay person, not both, at least not where I was from. From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

michael barbaro

Pete Buttigieg. It’s Friday, November 22. So Jeremy Peters, you cover politics for The Times, and you’ve been closely tracking Mayor Buttigieg. And in order to better understand the Democratic field of presidential candidates, we’re trying to figure out the most revealing moments in their lives. So when it comes to Pete Buttigieg, what moment should we focus on?

jeremy peters

Well, Mayor Pete has always been a candidate for whom his story, his biography is very central to his appeal to voters, and he’s got a great story to tell. He’s been elected mayor of this medium-sized town in Indiana before turning 30. He has an Ivy League pedigree. He’s been a Rhodes Scholar. He’s worked at a prestigious consulting firm. He’s gone off to Afghanistan as part of the Navy Reserves. So he has all of these components that you kind of think if you’re a voter, wow, he really stands out. There’s something unique about this guy. But at the same time, for most of his adult life, he had this nagging secret, the secret that he couldn’t confront because he thought that it would mean the end to this political career that he had spent so much time perfecting, basically since he went away to college and decided, hey, you know, I can run for president. And he doesn’t see how it’s possible for the politician with the perfect background, the perfect resume to also be open about their sexuality, in his case. So how he reconciles this inner turmoil with his very public ambition I think is a defining moment in his life, if not the defining moment.

michael barbaro

All right. Welcome to the studio.

pete buttigieg

Thank you.

michael barbaro

You’re going to sit there.

pete buttigieg

All right.

jeremy peters

So that story begins in 1982 in South Bend, Indiana where Peter Buttigieg was born.

michael barbaro

Mayor, tell me about the kind of kid that you were, growing up in Indiana?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think I was, safe to say, a little on the nerdy side. I lived in a neighborhood kind of in the middle of South Bend, close to a park where you would have as much as possible what you’d call a prototypical Midwestern kid’s upbringing, you know, playing in the park with friends, a lot of time in the house. I was really interested in baseball cards, but I was more interested in categorizing them than I was in baseball, I think. I loved science and science fiction. I loved reading, plus I was an only child. So I think it’s safe to say I had a lot of interior life going on in a fairly quiet house where it was a dog and my parents, who were both academics, and me.

michael barbaro

What was your introduction to even the idea of politics?

pete buttigieg

Politics was always in the air in our house just because my parents were very politically passionate. They really cared about what was happening. I can remember the Democratic Convention. It must have been 1988.

archived recording NBC News continues its coverage of America’s convention.

pete buttigieg

I would’ve been six years old and my parents explaining what a convention was. I remember Jesse Jackson giving a speech.

archived recording (jesse jackson) When I look out at this convention, I see the face of America — red, yellow, brown, black, and white. We are all precious in God’s sight, the real rainbow coalition.

pete buttigieg

And I remember my parents thinking it was important to watch the Republican Convention, too. I mean, you would stop — even though I don’t it ever crossed their mind to ever vote for a Republican.

archived recording Now let’s go down to the podium. Here is George Herbert Walker Bush addressing his convention.

pete buttigieg

Everything in the house would kind of stop when it was time to watch what was playing out.

archived recording Thank you.

michael barbaro

At what moment in this early phase of your life did you go from just watching this and maybe finding it very fascinating to feeling really drawn to it?

pete buttigieg

Well, when I got to college, it felt like the Republicans and the Democrats, at the time, it’s crazy to think about now, polarized as we are. But what it felt like when I showed up as a freshman on campus was that the two parties were converging and not necessarily in a good place, that you had this kind of center-right and center-left, both of them very committed to growth in business, but it seemed not very committed at all to some of the questions of how we take care of vulnerable people around the country. And I think there’s a moment for any kind of well-spoken or intelligent young person watching the news when you see a senator or a candidate saying something or doing something and you think, well, that’s not right. I could do that. I could do it different. Now, you might be wrong. They might be way more sophisticated than you are, and you can’t see it. Or you might be right, and it might well be the case that what they’re saying is just not right. But I certainly had that feeling reinforced when I saw these figures come to campus, some of whom were extremely impressive, but none of whom seemed like they were on a different plane of existence. They were just people.

michael barbaro

So at this point, a year or two into Harvard, have you made up your mind that you were probably going to find a way to have a career in politics?

pete buttigieg

I knew I wanted a career that involved policy. I don’t think I’d figured out for sure that that meant running. Plus, you know, when I thought about it, even well before I was coming to terms with the fact that I was gay, I knew that I had no political connections at home. I had an unpronounceable name, and I was a Democrat who lived in Indiana. So it was not obvious that I could overcome some of the obstacles toward running. But I think it’s safe to say by the time I graduated, I had some sense that I could see myself doing it.

michael barbaro

Well, I want to talk to you about that realization of your sexuality in particular. Obviously, your candidacy is historic in a couple of different ways, and among those is the fact you’re the first major party presidential candidate who is openly gay. And so I want to ask you about that part of your identity. When did you sense that you were gay? When did that realization start to dawn on you?

pete buttigieg

I think it depends what you mean by realization, right? There are things you could point to going way back, certainly a fascination I had with a classmate when I was about 12 that, in hindsight, is very obviously a crush. But I was not willing to think of it that way, although some part of me must have — I mean, I wasn’t stupid either, right? So you have this kind of awareness that was definitely there by the time I was hitting middle school. But taking a word like gay and applying it to myself, I was still years away from being able to do that, even in my own mind.

michael barbaro

Well, what did you do with those feelings?

pete buttigieg

I guess I packed them up, yeah.

michael barbaro

Packed them up —

pete buttigieg

Not much would be the best answer.

michael barbaro

Pack them up and put them where?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I don’t know how these things work, even in your own mind. I just didn’t explore them. That’s for sure. First of all, there were not a lot of out gay people that I knew as such growing up. I mean, in high school, it was exactly zero. There was just no sense of gay life or a gay community. And when I got to college, that’s when the kind of internal battle was starting to heat up.

michael barbaro

Why?

pete buttigieg

I think because you just can’t escape it. I mean, my god, you’re in college, right? I mean, any feelings you have, especially in the romantic department, are going to start asserting themselves even more fiercely than they have when you get to college. For a lot of people, it’s a big part of what you spend college on.

michael barbaro

Right. So how did you deal with it?

pete buttigieg

Same way I dealt with it up to then, just packed it away. Dated women, remarkable women. Because I enjoyed these relationships, I think I could defer facing the fact that that wasn’t the same as what it was to be in love with somebody.

michael barbaro

And your political ambition was already solid at that point?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I still didn’t know exactly where it would take me or what it would mean, but I think by then, I knew that there was a good chance I was going to be running for office in my adult life. But at that point, I’m still clinging to some kind of hope, however vanishing, that maybe I’m straight or I’m bisexual and I can just not worry about the gay part. I think when I thought about my career, certainly when I talked about my future and how I was going to be involved, I wasn’t even thinking about the possibility that that would come into contact with this developing side of me. But I’m sure to the extent that I thought what it would mean to come to terms with the fact that I was at very least different and, as became increasingly clear, gay, that one of the things that would have kept that in its corner was the simple fact that that didn’t fit with any of the other things I wanted to do in life, not just a career, but a family. I wanted to get married. I wanted to have kids. From my perspective, you could be married and have kids or you could be gay, not both.

michael barbaro

You graduated in 2004. That — correct me if I’m wrong. That’s the year when Massachusetts —

pete buttigieg

That’s right.

michael barbaro

— legalizes gay marriage.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

archived recording The court today, as you know, in a 4-3 advisory opinion to the Senate has a rule that in a November 18, 2003 decision, they meant marriage. They meant equality. They meant that the Commonwealth may no longer deny marriage rights to same-sex couples, including —

michael barbaro

So I say that only to try to understand, are you falling behind the culture, in a sense? Are you ignoring some of the signs that these things are changing?

archived recording Marriage and only marriage will be enough to satisfy the requirements of the Massachusetts Constitution.

pete buttigieg

Well, the thing is I wasn’t from Massachusetts. I was in Massachusetts for a while, but I never felt like I was from there. And nothing against Massachusetts, but I realized pretty quick after turning up at Harvard that I didn’t belong there either.

michael barbaro

Why not?

pete buttigieg

It was just — it was just a different culture. I didn’t realize that. I didn’t realize that I was Midwestern until I left the Midwest. And just little things, cultural things, the way — I don’t know, the way people interact, what’s expected of you. Once I got there, I realized that socially, I was way more Midwestern than I thought.

michael barbaro

So take me from graduating from Harvard to your decision to join the Navy Reserves.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so it starts with 9/11. Actually, it starts before 9/11. There’s this family tradition of serving in the military. There’s a painting hanging on the wall of my parents’ house of a relative, a great uncle who I kind of idolized in theory. He was an Army Air Corps pilot. And so I had this idea, this maybe romantic idea, of being in the military, and then it never really became real. But I remember on 9/11 thinking, oh, well, war isn’t just a thing that happens in other places or in other periods of history. Like, war has come to my generation, and thinking, at least in the back of my head, that that might mean I would be involved, but not taking any steps to do that. But that turned into more and more of a nagging feeling when some friends of mine started to serve. A friend of mine from college shared with me just before we graduated that he had decided to join the Navy Reserve. I was fascinated. And then when I was talking to someone about applying for the Rhodes Scholarship and how I wanted to talk about my interest in public service and to the faculty member who was giving advice to students, and just said, pointedly, like, you might want to really think about how you’re going to say that, knowing that you’re going to be competing against people from the military academies. Oh yeah, that’s true. Like, my chest thumping about caring about public service feels a lot smaller held up against what others are doing.

michael barbaro

Do you think that was one of the things that might have drawn you to military service, knowing that to get a Rhodes, to be in that world, in that league, you know, it might be a good thing?

pete buttigieg

I think definitely that it was part of how you’re true to a culture of service. And also the Kennedy presidency kind of hangs over certainly the Kennedy School, as you might imagine. And that can’t be separated from his military career.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

I mean, really, it was almost an expectation that you would’ve served, up until roughly the time when I came of age when everything shifted.

michael barbaro

An expectation that you would serve —

pete buttigieg

Well, when you’re looking at the history of the people we were studying —

michael barbaro

Of presidents.

pete buttigieg

— who have made history. Yep, as presidents. And then the thing that put me over the top was this experience knocking on doors in Iowa with a couple of buddies from college who went out. We took a week off and rented a car, and it was the last few days before the Iowa caucuses, and we were volunteers for Obama. They sent us to this very rural area, some of the lowest income counties in Iowa. And it felt like any time I met a young — especially young man — it was somebody who was serving or was about to serve. And I started to realize, we had service that used to be something that bridged people together. Now it’s completely different, that if you were rural or low-income, you were highly likely to serve. If you were from a background like mine, which was middle class economically, but I’d had the chance to go to an institution like Harvard, almost nobody with that background was serving. And I began to feel like it wasn’t just this kind of thing I thought about that I hadn’t gotten around to. It was that I was part of the problem. I was part of the divide. That was the thing that kind of propelled me that last few inches toward being ready to yank open the door of the recruiting office in Indiana and say, hey, how do I sign up?

I wondered, do you think you joined the military in part because you knew what it would mean for a political career?

pete buttigieg

You know, I wrestled with that because as soon as I get that question, there’s a part of me that thinks, if the answer is yes, does that mean the service wasn’t pure in some way? And I remember at the time asking myself if being in the military was as unpopular as it is today popular, would I still do it? And I want to believe the answer is yes, but there’s no way to go back and prove it. I’m not somebody who thinks that it’s, like, a prerequisite that if you want to run for office you need to have served. But I do think if you have a heart for elected office, one way to put your money where your mouth is to have been in that kind of service, too.

michael barbaro

That strikes me as a very candid answer because of course, you could just say, well, of course I would have done it, even if there was no possible —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

— political benefit.

pete buttigieg

And I want to say that. I just can’t prove it.

michael barbaro

So I want to talk about this run for mayor for just a little bit. Whenever you run for office, your character is on display. And at this point, you are keeping something quite elemental about yourself secret. Did it feel like you were hiding something?

pete buttigieg

Not really. The only time it felt that way was when there was small talk about whether I was dating, and I would crack a joke or something. We’d be sitting in a studio like this one and a radio host would ask a question. And I’d say, well, if anybody listening is into economic policy and long walks on the beach, go ahead and reach out and just kind of play the busy single person, which is what I was, except for the fact that I wasn’t actively looking for love. I was going out of my way to avoid it. But if somebody who is straight up asked me on the record, to this day, I’m not sure what I would have done.

michael barbaro

Do you think that that would have potentially cost you the mayoralty, might have kept you from being mayor or staying mayor?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I think there’s a good chance of it. There’s a reason why no — as far as I know, no out gay person had ever run for mayor of any place in Indiana.

michael barbaro

This is a state with strong Christian values, and —

pete buttigieg

— not known for progressive social outlooks on politics. And here I am, rocking up, 29 years old saying, trust me, support me. Never mind this state legislator who has earned tons of credibility in this community. Never mind this county councilman who’s the party favorite. Go with me instead. If there had been anything that looked like a skeleton or a vulnerability, I think it probably would have sunk me before I got anywhere at all.

michael barbaro

So I want to now move into this notion of you reconciling these things.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so when I first joined the Reserve, the message was kind of you’re pretty much going to go to one of these wars, and we’ll let you know which one. And so I knew that, at a certain point, it was coming. And of course, I didn’t want to take office in South Bend without a plan for this. So we had gamed it out with my team, if I get orders, here’s what you do. And when I received my orders and knew I was going for sure, I don’t think even then it occurred to me that it would have much to do with my sexuality. If anything, I was thankful that I was single, right? The hardest thing for people to deploy is the fact that you’re leaving behind somebody you love, in addition to all the professional complications. But then, the more I started getting mentally ready for going over and really thinking about what it meant, the more it started weighing on me that I didn’t have a — wasn’t coming back to a family, my parents, of course, but I wasn’t coming back to a household. And more than that, I had no idea what it was like to be in love. And the idea that I’m — here I am. I’m a grown-ass man. I own a home. I’m the mayor of my city. I’m a military officer. And if I get killed over there, I will go to my grave not knowing what it’s like to be in love. And that just made me realize how untenable the situation I was in really was. And up until then, it didn’t seem untenable, I guess because I was so busy, and I might have deferred coming out and having a dating life forever, if not for this moment where I’m thinking, shit, I could die.

michael barbaro

You wrote a letter I want to ask you about.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, you know, it’s a thing you do. I assume everybody does it. I don’t know. But it’s the thing you do when you go to war, right? You want to make sure that you have the last word on your life and leave a few instructions. So I wrote up a letter, put an envelope, put just in case on the outside. Put it in the desk drawer, would’ve been pretty easy to find if worse comes to worst. And that’s a real moment, too, because you’re sitting there staring at the screen trying to figure out how to give a short accounting of your life.

michael barbaro

And what did you say?

pete buttigieg

Well, what I said was that I wouldn’t want people to think that I’d been cheated, that obviously it’d be terrible if I didn’t come back, but I also had this amazing life where I have wonderful friendships, and I got to serve my community in a way that very few people get to do, let alone at my age, and that I’d had this very fulfilling life. And of course, it’d be too bad if something happened to me, but to keep that in perspective. But if you’re asking if there was, like, P.S. I’m gay, no.

michael barbaro

That’s kind of what I was asking. So you are deployed.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

You do not die.

pete buttigieg

Right.

michael barbaro

You come back, and you’re mayor.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

And how do you decide that it’s time to come out?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think by the time I hit the ground and I was back, I knew that I was going to come out and then it’s just — it was more how and when. I remember resenting the idea that you’re supposed to have to come out, right? Straight people don’t have to come out. Why do I? And then, while I’m in the process of figuring this out —

archived recording Thank you all for coming. It’s been a tough week here in the Hoosier state, but we’re going to move forward.

pete buttigieg

We have this explosive controversy over Mike Pence, the Governor Mike Pence and his so-called Religious Freedom bill.

archived recording The Religious Freedom Restoration Act was about religious liberty, not about discrimination.

pete buttigieg

So suddenly, we’re on national television, my state, as the most officially anti-gay state in the country. I’m fighting him on it, of course, because it’s a terrible policy. But now, I’m fighting this terrible, anti-gay policy putatively from the perspective of a straight ally, wondering whether I’m more effective because people don’t know that I’m gay. And at the same time, knowing that this just kind of speeds things up even more that, like, it’s just a really weird position to be in, to be having all these hypothetical arguments about discrimination against gay people, when it really means me. Meanwhile, this is also the period when we realize that soon the Supreme Court is going to weigh in on marriage. I mean, all of this was happening in that early part of 2015 while I’m wrestling with how to do this. And so oddly enough, it was — — as busy as I was as mayor. Military duty actually felt like, kind of almost like a break because it was eight hour days, 40 hour week. I wasn’t used to having that much time, and so is a lot of time to sit and write and think and call friends and get advice.

michael barbaro

So you produce a plan.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, well I produced a letter, an op-ed I guess.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. What was the essential line that I’m sure you remember that you wrote?

pete buttigieg

I remember saying that it’s just part of who I am and that it has no bearing on how I do my job, that the way I do my — did my job either as an officer or as a mayor or in business had nothing to do with the fact that I was gay and that —

michael barbaro

It still sounds a little defensive.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Or maybe a little scared.

pete buttigieg

Probably. Yeah, I mean, you know, I didn’t feel like I was coming out guns blazing. I felt like I — again, part of me was bothered that I had to share this at all. Then part of me knew that it would do some good if I did, I mean, not just in my own life. That I — my main agenda was, personally, I wanted to get out there and start dating. But also that it would mean something, might mean all kinds of things to a whole bunch of different people when I came out and said this.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording A very personal announcement coming from South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg today. In an essay published in today’s South Bend Tribune, the mayor announced he is gay. Currently in the midst of running for a second term, Pete Buttigieg penned an essay in Tuesday’s South Bend Tribune revealing he was gay. A lot of people wondering why he chose to make this announcement now. It comes just months after the state’s religious freedom law thrust the state into the national debate on gay rights. As for the mayor himself, he says nothing is different, nothing has changed, and his focus is on South Bend.

michael barbaro

I want to talk about the timing, the exact moment of the op-ed because my sense is that at this phase of your career, you’re up for re-election, right? You’ve won the primary. And winning the primary, in a sense, means you’re standing a very good shot of winning.

pete buttigieg

Depending on the year, but yeah, in South Bend, it should be.

michael barbaro

So does that mean you deliberately chose a — like, a safe, low-risk time to do this?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I would think that going into a Democratic primary would be a safer time than going into a general election. And I think also the decision to do this came by way of realizing that there is no such thing as a safe time. I was just done with not having the kind of personal life that I wanted to have.

michael barbaro

So once you come out, how does your personal life change?

pete buttigieg

Well, I started dating, and that kind of changes everything. I mean, I still had this very demanding job. You’re the mayor, and so anybody in town that you ask to have a cup of coffee is —

michael barbaro

It’s a thing.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, it’s a thing. It might be misinterpreted. You could cross some line without meaning to. I mean, most of the people I interacted with were either people who needed something from me, people I needed something from or people who worked for me. So it’s not, like, a very healthy pool for dating is what I’m saying. And I remember thinking there were all these kind of city fathers who, early on in my time as mayor, seemed determined to fix me up with their daughters. And I remember just thinking, like, where are you now? Did none of you have, like, a son or a nephew or something? So I did what millennials do. I went online. Turns out there’s apps for all of this. There was O.K. Cupid, Tinder. The one that actually came through for me was called Hinge. And it’s supposed to serve up people that — I don’t know how the algorithm works. But I find this guy, this cute guy with a big smile, and I’m like, I want to know this guy. So we start chatting. Well, I was chatting with a lot of people, but obviously, he’s the one I remember because that was Chasten.

michael barbaro

Your future husband.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

michael barbaro

So your story, to many people, is particularly compelling one, everything we just discussed. You are a Harvard graduate, a Rhodes Scholar, you’re a veteran. You’re gay. You’re religious. And from your own description of yourself, it feels like you have been thinking about politics and preparing, to some degree, to run for president for a very long time, even though you’re quite young. And I’m sure you understand this and have heard this. That has led to this perception of a person kind of, perhaps, orchestrating a political biography. Do you ever question whether that, no matter what your intention, is — could possibly undermine the power of the story itself, however genuine?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I mean, I think we’re conditioned to not like the idea of somebody who sat around thinking all their lives about how to become president. And I don’t view myself that way, although I get that that story has been written around me. Although, I also don’t know what it is we expect, that somebody kind of gets struck by lightning and then they turn into somebody who might become president. We all have these paths, right, that bring us to where we are. And I think anybody in professional life or even social life thinks about the story that you tell about yourself. At the end of the day, I’m not doing this because I have this personal need to be in elected office or to be the president. I’m not coming at the presidency as a thing that I’d like to occupy. I’m coming at it as this way to do something that I think I’m able to do. And I think it’s helpful in the sense that I could also have a very happy life doing something else. And oddly, I think that — that helps prepare me to do what’s required to do this. And this is advice I give talking to students, too. Imagine somebody is being sworn in, an ambitious, talented person kind of in the middle of their career is being sworn in as an assistant secretary in the State Department for the Middle East. And then imagine if that person has got there one of two ways. In kind of universe A, it’s a person who woke up one day in high school and said, I want to be the assistant secretary for the Middle East, and took the right courses and got the right jobs and had the right fellowships and wrote the right papers and did everything in order to occupy that title. And the other person is somebody who said, I — woke up in high school and said, I want to be the person who makes the United States a force toward peace in the Middle East. And they don’t know what that’s going to mean, and maybe it means they start out becoming an activist or maybe they’re an academic or maybe they’re a civil servant or whatever. But by whatever winding path, they wind up in this job, right? Which of those two scenarios is going to lead to somebody who’s better equipped to take that job they’ve been handed? I’ve got to think it’s the latter. And so what I’ve tried to do in my life is to prepare myself to be useful to others. And yes, I think that, in all likelihood, means in a form that involves holding office or seeking office or at least public life where I speak to lots of people, sometimes millions at the same time. But it’s not about, necessarily, having one title or another. And so I think if you overthink it, that’s where you start to lose the fidelity to what it is that would guide you when you actually get what you’ve been chasing for a long time. Jeremy, what do we learn from Mayor Pete Buttigieg about the way he reconciled his political ambition with this essential fact about himself that he feared would endanger that ambition?

jeremy peters

I think we learn a lot about his decision-making process, not just how he internalizes decisions personally, but how he thinks about them in the longer arc of a political career. And he’s been very intentional all along the way about choosing certain endeavors that he thinks would benefit a long-term political career. Now some people would think, on the one hand, that’s too calculating. I don’t want somebody who’s thought about being president since he was a teenager. And, you know, in the era when voters seemed to prize authenticity in their political figures, they could see that as inauthentic. On the other hand, the decision that he made to wait seems to have borne out to his benefit. I mean, here he is, the first openly gay candidate for president of the United States who has a legitimate shot at being his party’s nominee. Look at where he is in the Democratic primary right now. He’s rocketed to the top of the polls. He’s brought in all this money in large part because he’s gay, and that opened a lot of doors with Democratic donors. He’s heading into the Iowa caucuses in the lead by some measures. But we won’t know if his decision to wait actually was the right one until people start voting. So it seems to have worked out well for him right now, but no one’s cast a single vote. And we don’t know how voters in the Democratic primary are going to react. We certainly don’t know how voters in a general election are going to react. So we’re just not going to know until Democratic voters have their say.

michael barbaro

Mayor, when you think back to your younger self —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Not just your teenage self, but even your college self and your post-collegiate self who was so fearful about telling the world that you were gay, what do you kind of wish you could tell that person, that version of Mayor Buttigieg?

pete buttigieg

Well, back then, I would have thought this other fact, if I dared to unpack it, this fact about my life, this way in which I was different, was the thing that could multiply all the other stuff by zero, in terms of the impact I was going to have in the world, that I might very well choose that path, but that the price would be that I wouldn’t get to make a difference in public life. And if you want proof of God having a sense of humor, one of the things I’m seeing now, especially in the interactions I have on the campaign trail and the fact that this campaign is historic in a lot of ways, is that that same fact that I thought would mean never getting to this point might actually be one of the things that makes it matter the most.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

It’s a strange thing to think about that the one thing that I couldn’t control, the one thing that might have meant that it would be better not to have any aspirations related to politics at all could be the very thing that anchors the moral and emotional purpose of this entire campaign.

michael barbaro

Thank you very much.

pete buttigieg

Thanks for having me.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (fiona hill) And I did say to him, Ambassador Sondland, Gordon, I think this is all going to blow up, and here we are.

michael barbaro

In the latest public testimony before impeachment investigators, Fiona Hill, the former top Russia expert on the National Security Council, recalled her growing frustration with Ambassador Gordon Sondland, as she realized he was pursuing a political agenda in Ukraine on behalf of President Trump.

archived recording (fiona hill) He was being involved in a domestic, political errand, and we were being involved in national security foreign policy and those two things have just diverged.

michael barbaro

Hill testified that when Trump and Sondland pressed Ukraine to investigate the discredited theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, they were playing directly into Russia’s hands, since Russia wants to deflect attention away from its interference.

archived recording (fiona hill) This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves. These fictions are harmful, even if they’re deployed for purely domestic, political purposes.

He had booked $52,000 in ads, for instance, in Fargo, N.D. and $59,000 in Biloxi, Miss.

Mr. Bloomberg has not officially announced he is running for president, though this week he filed a formal “statement of candidacy” with the Federal Election Commission. He had previously filed to be on the ballot in three states.

His expected entry has injected a new element of uncertainty into the race, highlighting its fluidity as well as the angst among many moderate Democrats that the field has moved too far left, and that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., despite leading in most national polls, is poorly positioned to win. It has also stirred a debate among Democrats about the role of wealth in the primary and accusations from progressive rivals that Mr. Bloomberg is trying to buy the presidency.

“Swell,” Steve Bullock, the governor of Montana who is running a shoestring campaign for president, wrote on Twitter Friday. “Another Billionaire who thinks the Democratic nomination is for sale.”

Campaigning in New Hampshire, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota joked that she would also be announcing a multimillion ad buy.

“No, I’m not,” she said, with a laugh. More seriously, Ms. Klobuchar argued that Mr. Bloomberg’s wealth could turn off some primary voters, who are tired of big money in politics. “They are tired of all the money in our world that’s at the top and I don’t think they want that at the top of our country,” she said.

The ad buy is the latest in a series of steps that Mr. Bloomberg, who has flirted with past presidential runs but has always demurred, has taken before formally declaring his bid."

He asked Mr. Sondland whether he was aware of a series of facts and various allegations about Hunter Biden and Burisma, and about Ukrainians who expressed support for Hillary Clinton or opposition to Mr. Trump.

“So knowing all these facts from high-ranking Ukrainian officials, ambassador, it probably makes a little more sense now as to why the president may think that there’s problems with Ukraine and that Ukraine was out to get him?” Mr. Nunes asked Mr. Sondland.

“I understand your — I understand your point, yes, Mr. Chairman,” Mr. Sondland replied.

But if the premise of Mr. Nunes’s line of questioning was that it was righteous to seek the investigations, a line of questioning that followed, by the Republicans’ top staff lawyer, Stephen R. Castor, pointed to a different conclusion: The important point was that there was no clear proof that Mr. Trump himself was behind the pressure.

Mr. Castor marched Mr. Sondland through a lengthy series of questions to emphasize the point that Mr. Trump never personally told him there was any quid pro quo — highlighting that Mr. Sondland had no clear proof that the president was personally orchestrating anything untoward.

“So the president never told you about any preconditions for aid to be released?” Mr. Castor asked.

“No,” Mr. Sondland replied.

“The president never told you about preconditions for a White House meeting?” Mr. Castor followed up.

“Personally, no,” Mr. Sondland said.

Mr. Sondland said his understanding that Mr. Trump was offering a White House meeting to Mr. Zelensky on the condition that he announce investigations was based on what Mr. Giuliani told him. Pressed on how he could know that, Mr. Sondland replied that Mr. Trump had directed him to talk to Mr. Giuliani about the matter."

So to understand how it’s going to play out, the past is really our best guide. “I think we’re just all in for a really crazy ride.” Collectively, these New York Times reporters have covered U.S. politics for over 150 years. “I’m also a drummer in a band, so …” They’ve reported on past impeachment inquiries. “Yea, I’m lost in Senate wonderland.” And they say that the three we’ve had so far have been full of twists and turns. “The president of the United States is not guilty as charged.” In short, expect the unexpected. First, the process. Impeachment is technically only the initial stage. “Common misconceptions about impeachment are that impeachment by itself means removal from office. It doesn’t. The impeachment part of the process is only the indictment that sets up a trial.” The Constitution describes offenses that are grounds for removing the president from office as bribery, treason and — “They say high crimes and misdemeanors, which, really, is in the eye of the beholder.” “The framers didn’t give us a guidebook to it. They simply said, that the House had the responsibility for impeachment and the Senate had the responsibility for the trial.” One of the things missing from the Constitution? How an impeachment inquiry should start. And that has generally been a source of drama. Basically, anything goes. “In fact, in the Andrew Johnson case they voted to impeach him without even having drafted the articles of impeachment.” For Richard Nixon, his case started with several investigations that led to public hearings. That part of the process went on for two years, and yielded revelation after revelation, connecting Nixon to a politically-motivated burglary at D.N.C. headquarters — “… located in the Watergate office building.” — and its subsequent cover-up. “Mr. Butterfield, are you aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the president?” “I was aware of listening devices. Yes, sir.” “This was a shocker. Everybody in the White House recognized how damaging this could be.” As the House drafted articles of impeachment, Nixon lost the support of his party. “O.K., I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.” “I was asked to write the farewell piece that ran the morning after Nixon resigned. And this is what I wrote: The central question is how a man who won so much could have lost so much.” So for Nixon, it more or less ended after the investigations. But for Bill Clinton, that phase was just the beginning. “This is the information.” An independent counsel’s investigation into his business dealings unexpectedly turned into a very public inquiry about his personal life. “The idea that a president of the United States was having an affair with a White House intern and then a federal prosecutor was looking at that, it was just extraordinary.” That investigation led to public hearings in the House Judiciary Committee. “When the Starr Report was being delivered to Congress it was a little bit like the O.J. chase, only a political one.

And the media plays a huge part in the process. This was definitely true for Clinton. “You know it was just a crazy time. We worked in the Senate press gallery.” “All your colleagues are kind of piled on top of each other.” “We had crummy computers, the fax machine would always break. The printer would always break.” After committee hearings, the House brought formal impeachment charges. “It was very tense. I thought that the Saturday of the impeachment vote in the House was one of the most tense days I’d experienced in Washington.” And it turned out, also, full of surprises. “The day of impeachment arrived, everyone’s making very impassioned speeches about whether Bill Clinton should or should not be impeached and Livingston rises to give an argument for the House Republicans. He started to talk about how Clinton could resign.” “You, sir, may resign your post.” “And all of a sudden people start booing and saying, ‘Resign, resign’!” “So I must set the example.” “He announced he was resigning because he had had extramarital affairs and challenged President Clinton to do the only honorable thing, in his view —” “I hope President Clinton will follow.” “— to resign as well, so there was all this drama unfolding even in the midst of impeachment.” Then it went to the Senate for trial. The Constitution gets a little more specific about this part. “The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is supposed to preside over that trial.” “Rehnquist, he showed up in this robe he had made for himself, which had gold stripes on the sleeves because he liked Gilbert and Sullivan.” “The Senate is the actual jury.” “You will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws. So help you, God.” “This is a copy of the rules of the Senate for handling impeachment. They’re actually very specific.” “Meet six days a week.” “Convene at noon. The senators have to sit at their desks and remain quiet in their role as jurors. And not talk, which trust me, is going to be a problem for some of the senators who are used to talking all the time.” It’s just like a courtroom trial. There are prosecutors who present the case against the president. “That was perjury.” Only, they’re members of the House, and they’re called managers. Then the senators, or the jurors, vote. And things are still, unpredictable. “The options are guilty or not guilty. But there was one senator —” “Arlen Specter, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania.” “Under Scottish law, there are three possible verdicts: guilty, not guilty and not proved.” “— which is not a thing.” “And everybody just looks, you know, how do you even record that vote?” In the end, there were not enough votes to oust Clinton. “What’s amazing about this whole thing to me wasn’t so much the constitutional process. It was that it felt to me like the beginning of really intense partisanship, the weaponization of partisanship.” And here’s the thing: An impeachment charge has never gotten the two-thirds majority it needs in the Senate to actually oust a president from office. “So you could end up having a situation where the president is impeached, acquitted and runs for re-election and wins re-election.” And that would be a first. “This is my ticket to the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. I don’t think you’ll find these on StubHub.”"

So to understand how it’s going to play out, the past is really our best guide. “I think we’re just all in for a really crazy ride.” Collectively, these New York Times reporters have covered U.S. politics for over 150 years. “I’m also a drummer in a band, so …” They’ve reported on past impeachment inquiries. “Yea, I’m lost in Senate wonderland.” And they say that the three we’ve had so far have been full of twists and turns. “The president of the United States is not guilty as charged.” In short, expect the unexpected. First, the process. Impeachment is technically only the initial stage. “Common misconceptions about impeachment are that impeachment by itself means removal from office. It doesn’t. The impeachment part of the process is only the indictment that sets up a trial.” The Constitution describes offenses that are grounds for removing the president from office as bribery, treason and — “They say high crimes and misdemeanors, which, really, is in the eye of the beholder.” “The framers didn’t give us a guidebook to it. They simply said, that the House had the responsibility for impeachment and the Senate had the responsibility for the trial.” One of the things missing from the Constitution? How an impeachment inquiry should start. And that has generally been a source of drama. Basically, anything goes. “In fact, in the Andrew Johnson case they voted to impeach him without even having drafted the articles of impeachment.” For Richard Nixon, his case started with several investigations that led to public hearings. That part of the process went on for two years, and yielded revelation after revelation, connecting Nixon to a politically-motivated burglary at D.N.C. headquarters — “… located in the Watergate office building.” — and its subsequent cover-up. “Mr. Butterfield, are you aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the president?” “I was aware of listening devices. Yes, sir.” “This was a shocker. Everybody in the White House recognized how damaging this could be.” As the House drafted articles of impeachment, Nixon lost the support of his party. “O.K., I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.” “I was asked to write the farewell piece that ran the morning after Nixon resigned. And this is what I wrote: The central question is how a man who won so much could have lost so much.” So for Nixon, it more or less ended after the investigations. But for Bill Clinton, that phase was just the beginning. “This is the information.” An independent counsel’s investigation into his business dealings unexpectedly turned into a very public inquiry about his personal life. “The idea that a president of the United States was having an affair with a White House intern and then a federal prosecutor was looking at that, it was just extraordinary.” That investigation led to public hearings in the House Judiciary Committee. “When the Starr Report was being delivered to Congress it was a little bit like the O.J. chase, only a political one. There were two black cars. They were being filmed live on CNN. They were heading towards the Capitol. We were watching it and a little bit agog.” Public opinion is key. And the media plays a huge part in the process. This was definitely true for Clinton. “You know it was just a crazy time. We worked in the Senate press gallery.” “All your colleagues are kind of piled on top of each other.” “We had crummy computers, the fax machine would always break.

But No One Was Attacked Like Warren.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/opinion/democratic-debate-warren.html,"That criticism, both technical and philosophical, continued in an inevitable segment about Medicare for All with Ms. Warren facing criticism from both her left and right flanks. In previous debates, Ms. Warren avoided saying exactly how she would pay for the tens of trillions in new government spending the health care system she favors would entail. But she recently released both a financing plan and an implementation timeline in which she proposed putting off the push for a full-fledged single-payer system.

That segment opened with Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., touting his own plan, which he calls Medicare for All Who Want It, as a way to avoid the “divisive” step of eliminating most private insurance and forcing most Americans onto a government health care plan. Mr. Biden, similarly, framed his opposition to Ms. Warren’s proposal by saying, “I trust the American people.” Once again, it was an attack not only on Ms. Warren’s plan, but on the political philosophy it represents.

From the other side of the debate, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose Medicare for All bill Ms. Warren backs, implied that he didn’t trust Ms. Warren’s plan to hold off on Medicare for All until late in her first term. Now is the time, he said, practically pounding the podium. “In the first week of my administration, we will introduce Medicare for All.” The message was clear: Warrenism, which would wait until year three to fight for single-payer, was insufficiently devoted to the revolutionary cause.

These exchanges illustrate the Democratic Party’s growing uneasiness with Ms. Warren and her brand of fussy technocratic populism, which can come across as both too radical and too timidly wonky at the same time.

Throughout her campaign, Ms. Warren has attempted to occupy a middle ground between the party’s moderate wing and its progressive base. But her have-it-both-ways strategy may well have backfired. Despite Ms. Warren’s ascension to the primary’s top tier, the steadiness of Mr. Biden’s polling and the recent rise of Mr. Buttigieg in Iowa and New Hampshire — along with the dips in Ms. Warren’s own polling — suggest not only the limits of her strategy but the limitations of the underlying worldview itself."

“There is a scenario where we could have security cooperation as we do with countries around the world,” Mr. Buttigieg said. “Now, I would only order American troops into conflict if there were no other choice, if American lives were on the line and if this was necessary to meet treaty obligations. But we could absolutely be in some kind of partnership role, if and only if it welcomed by our partner south of the border.”

What they’re talking about

Senator Elizabeth Warren claimed that her 2 percent wealth tax on households worth more than $50 million would pay for a sweeping expansion of the nation’s social safety net, providing free child care and college tuition.

What Ms. Warren said:

“We can put $800 billion new federal dollars into all of our public schools. We can make college tuition-free for every kid. We can put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities. And we can cancel student loan debt for 95 percent of the folks who have got it.”

The revenue that Ms. Warren would raise from her tax proposal is a subject of intense debate and it is not clear that her wealth tax could pay for the plans she listed. According to a New York Times analysis, the total cost of Ms. Warren’s plans for universal child care, increased spending on public schools, student debt cancellation and free college would be about $2.9 trillion over a decade. The two Berkeley economists advising her campaign, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, estimate that her wealth tax would generate $2.75 trillion over that period of time. If that is correct, then Ms. Warren would be close to being able to pay for those proposals. (Ms. Warren has recently revised her wealth tax proposal, and Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman have refined their calculations but the general conclusions are the same.)

But other economists disagree, arguing that a wealth tax would spur waves of new loopholes and tax evasion efforts. Lawrence H. Summers, a Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, and Natasha Sarin, a law and finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania, estimated that Ms. Warren’s wealth tax would raise just 40 percent of what her campaign claims."

(Pence’s chief of staff denied this.) Sondland didn’t substantially dispute the closed-door testimony of David Holmes, a senior U.S. Embassy official in Ukraine, who said he overheard a call to Trump that Sondland made on his cellphone. According to Holmes, on the call, made the day after the July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Zelensky for a “favor,” Trump asked Sondland if the Ukrainians were in fact going to pursue investigations. Sondland replied that they’d do whatever the president wanted.

After the call, Holmes testified, Sondland told him that Trump “did not give a [expletive] about Ukraine,” and cared only about what Sondland called “big stuff” that benefits the president. About that call, Sondland testified, “I would have been more surprised if President Trump had not mentioned investigations, particularly given what we were hearing from Mr. Giuliani.”

Further, Sondland testified that Trump didn’t necessarily care about investigations per se, only the public announcement of investigations. Zelensky “had to announce the investigations, he didn’t actually have to do them,” he said. The public announcement, of course, would be sufficient to give Trump material to defame Biden and muddy the waters about Russia’s help in getting Trump elected in the first place.

Speaking of Russia’s role in 2016: A few Republicans have tried to massage Trump’s claims of Ukrainian election interference to make them sound marginally less insane. At Wednesday’s hearing, Nunes accused Ukraine of meddling in America’s election largely through public statements by Ukrainian officials. Among these statements was a 2016 op-ed essay by Valeriy Chaly, then the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, objecting to Trump’s statement that as president he’d consider recognizing Russian-occupied Crimea as Russian, rather than Ukrainian, territory.

Leave aside that there is nothing illicit about public officials expressing their opinions about matters of urgent concern to their own countries. Sondland’s testimony made it plain that such public comments are not what Trump had in mind in calling for investigations into what Ukraine did in 2016. Trump wanted an inquiry into the conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the D.N.C., which is why Sondland repeatedly spoke about proposed investigations involving the “D.N.C. server.” He wanted Ukraine’s help exonerating Russia for its attack on America.

Sondland is not a wholly reliable witness; his insistence that he was ignorant of the connection between Burisma and the Bidens when he pressed Ukraine for investigations is hardly credible. (Volker made the same preposterous claim on Tuesday — both men were likely trying to distance themselves from one of the ugliest aspects of Trump’s shakedown.) Republicans will likely cling to the fact that Sondland said he never heard directly from Trump about a linkage between security aid to Ukraine and investigations; Sondland said he put it together because, as he repeated several times, “two plus two equals four.”"

Biden Jr. for president on Friday, snubbing the city’s mayor, Pete Buttigieg, in a close-to-home example of Mr. Buttigieg’s struggle to attract black support.

The official, Oliver Davis, is a longtime Democratic member of the Common Council.

“In times like these, when the political winds are fiercely blowing across our country, it’s important for us to have an experienced leader who has been through the diverse storms of life to guide our country,” Mr. Davis said in an endorsement released by the Biden campaign.

Mr. Davis has been a frequent critic of Mr. Buttigieg since the mayor took office in 2012, seeking, for example, to tap the brakes on a signature initiative of the mayor’s to demolish or repair 1,000 run-down houses in 1,000 days. In 2016, he voted against the mayor’s effort to hire a diversity officer.

When a white officer from the South Bend Police Department fatally shot a black resident in June, setting off protests and anguished town hall events, the episode exposed deep distrust between the police and some members of South Bend’s minority community. Mr. Davis emerged as a sharp critic of the mayor’s management of the police in the national media."

House Republicans like Representatives Devin Nunes and Jim Jordan seem eager to portray Fusion as co-conspirators with the Ukrainians in some devilish plot to undermine Mr. Trump’s 2016 candidacy. That could not be farther from the truth. None of the information in the so-called Steele dossier came from Ukrainian sources. Zero. And we’ve never met Serhiy Leshchenko , the Ukrainian former legislator and journalist whom Republicans want to blame for the downfall of Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.

That said, our investigation of Donald Trump did get a great boost because of Ukraine, just not in the way Republicans imagine. We began looking into Mr. Trump’s business dealings and ties to Russia in the fall of 2015 with funding from Republicans who wanted to stop his political ascent. The Ukraine alarms went off six months later, when candidate Trump brought into his campaign none other than Mr. Manafort, a man with his own tangled history with Russian oligarchs trying to get their way in Ukraine.

It turns out we already knew a great deal about Mr. Manafort’s activities in Ukraine because we worked on several stories about his work for Russian-backed politicians eight years earlier, when we were both still writing for The Wall Street Journal. That reporting threw a spotlight on how Mr. Manafort, while representing clients involved in fierce geopolitical struggles over Ukraine, had neglected to comply with a lobbying law requiring that he register as a foreign agent — the very law, among others, to which he pleaded guilty of violating.

Those articles triggered years of media coverage exposing Mr. Manafort’s questionable lobbying activities and ties to pro-Russia oligarchs. In the meantime, we left The Journal and went on to found Fusion GPS, a research and strategic intelligence firm, in 2010."

Below are transcripts of parts of the exchange:

BOOKER: I want to turn back to this issue of black voters. I have a lifetime of experience with black voters. I’ve been one since I was 18. Nobody on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African-American voters. Black voters are pissed off, and they’re worried. They’re pissed off because the only time our issues seem to be paid attention to by politicians is when people are looking for a vote. We don’t want to see people miss this opportunity and lose because we are nominating someone that isn’t trusted, doesn’t have authentic connection. And so that’s what’s on the ballot. And issues do matter.

I have a lot of respect for the vice president. He has sworn me into my office and he’s a hero. This week I hear him literally say that “I don’t think we should legalize marijuana.” I thought you might have been high when you said it. And let me tell you, because marijuana — marijuana in our country is already legal for privileged people. And it’s — the war on drugs has been a war on black and brown people. So let me just say this, with more African-Americans under criminal supervision in America than all the slaves since 1850, do not roll up into communities and not talk directly to issues that are going to relate to the liberation of children. Because there are people in Congress right now that admit to smoking marijuana, while there are people — our kids are in jail right now for those drug crimes."

Giuliani who have been charged with violating campaign finance laws, according to people familiar with the investigation.

The subpoenas went to a lobbying firm run by a top fund-raiser for Mr. Trump, Brian Ballard, and to two people who have helped raise money for America First Action, a super PAC created to support the president and allied candidates, the people said.

Four candidates. Four moments. Four episodes. Up first: Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana.

Picking one moment for Buttigieg was difficult. At age 37, he hasn’t had a long political career or much time on the national stage.

Buttigieg is the first openly gay candidate for president of the United States with a chance of becoming his party’s nominee. What if we focused on his coming out story?

We wondered if this angle was too personal. But Jeremy pointed out that, in the case of Buttigieg, his coming out story captured a central tension in his political narrative."

“That is the same thing Ambassador Volker said yesterday,” Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, responded.

That was sort of interesting — in part because it was one of the relatively few times Nunes managed to complete a sentence without crying, “Identify the whistle-blower!” or “Hunter Biden!”

Also because Volker actually said the nickname made him “cringe.” He believes “three amigos” should only refer to the glorious bipartisan Senate trio of John McCain, Joseph Lieberman and Lindsey Graham. Now, of course, McCain has passed away, Lieberman is a lobbyist for a Chinese telecom company and Graham is Donald Trump’s lap puppy. So the cringy thing really could make sense.

The rest of the world thinks about an old so-bad-it’s-good movie with Chevy Chase, Martin Short and Steve Martin. If there’s a remake, who plays the Chevy Chase role? Rick Perry?

Back to Rudy: Sondland said the Trump amigos hated working with Giuliani, but he was the only person who could get President Zelensky a meeting at the White House. The diplomats who testified really did seem concerned about helping Ukraine out. Sure, some of them got the job via a million-dollar political donation and then spent way too much refurbishing their official residence. (Looking at you, Mr. S.) Still.

If Trump wants to change the conversation for a minute, he should definitely turn on Giuliani. Almost everybody has come to realize how horrible Rudy is, although some innocent souls remember him from his glory days running New York City after 9/11."

I remember in history class, must have been a junior, it was during the impeachment process of President Clinton or all the scandal, everything that was going on. And I remember the teacher was just kind of riffing on this, and he said, you know, would anybody here ever want to be president or want to run for office, seeing what a mess and what an ugly place Washington was? And I just — maybe involuntarily, my hand went up. And from then on, it became that the running joke of the class that I’d wind up running for president. And then by the time I got to college, they had this Institute of Politics at Harvard, and every day, there’d be a different speaker who would come through. And I remember when I was there as a freshman, people like Donna Brazile who had just come off managing the Gore campaign and Rick Davis, who had done the same thing for McCain. And the former president of Ecuador, he’d been deposed in a coup. You’d just kind of hang around and watch them and see what they were like. The biggest realization was that they’re just people. These people who were shaping the world, people I was seeing on TV were obviously very impressive people, but they were just people. I think it changed my awareness of the fact that, on some level, I could be part of that world, too. But in a very simple sense, especially coming from Indiana, it seemed that it was a choice. You could be in elected office, or you could be an out gay person, not both, at least not where I was from. From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

Pete Buttigieg. It’s Friday, November 22. So Jeremy Peters, you cover politics for The Times, and you’ve been closely tracking Mayor Buttigieg. And in order to better understand the Democratic field of presidential candidates, we’re trying to figure out the most revealing moments in their lives. So when it comes to Pete Buttigieg, what moment should we focus on?

jeremy peters

Well, Mayor Pete has always been a candidate for whom his story, his biography is very central to his appeal to voters, and he’s got a great story to tell. He’s been elected mayor of this medium-sized town in Indiana before turning 30. He has an Ivy League pedigree. He’s been a Rhodes Scholar. He’s worked at a prestigious consulting firm. He’s gone off to Afghanistan as part of the Navy Reserves. So he has all of these components that you kind of think if you’re a voter, wow, he really stands out. There’s something unique about this guy. But at the same time, for most of his adult life, he had this nagging secret, the secret that he couldn’t confront because he thought that it would mean the end to this political career that he had spent so much time perfecting, basically since he went away to college and decided, hey, you know, I can run for president. And he doesn’t see how it’s possible for the politician with the perfect background, the perfect resume to also be open about their sexuality, in his case. So how he reconciles this inner turmoil with his very public ambition I think is a defining moment in his life, if not the defining moment.

michael barbaro

All right. Welcome to the studio.

pete buttigieg

Thank you.

michael barbaro

You’re going to sit there.

pete buttigieg

All right.

jeremy peters

So that story begins in 1982 in South Bend, Indiana where Peter Buttigieg was born.

michael barbaro

Mayor, tell me about the kind of kid that you were, growing up in Indiana?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think I was, safe to say, a little on the nerdy side. I lived in a neighborhood kind of in the middle of South Bend, close to a park where you would have as much as possible what you’d call a prototypical Midwestern kid’s upbringing, you know, playing in the park with friends, a lot of time in the house. I was really interested in baseball cards, but I was more interested in categorizing them than I was in baseball, I think. I loved science and science fiction. I loved reading, plus I was an only child. So I think it’s safe to say I had a lot of interior life going on in a fairly quiet house where it was a dog and my parents, who were both academics, and me.

michael barbaro

What was your introduction to even the idea of politics?

pete buttigieg

Politics was always in the air in our house just because my parents were very politically passionate. They really cared about what was happening. I can remember the Democratic Convention. It must have been 1988.

archived recording NBC News continues its coverage of America’s convention.

pete buttigieg

I would’ve been six years old and my parents explaining what a convention was. I remember Jesse Jackson giving a speech.

archived recording (jesse jackson) When I look out at this convention, I see the face of America — red, yellow, brown, black, and white. We are all precious in God’s sight, the real rainbow coalition.

pete buttigieg

And I remember my parents thinking it was important to watch the Republican Convention, too. I mean, you would stop — even though I don’t it ever crossed their mind to ever vote for a Republican.

archived recording Now let’s go down to the podium. Here is George Herbert Walker Bush addressing his convention.

pete buttigieg

Everything in the house would kind of stop when it was time to watch what was playing out.

archived recording Thank you.

michael barbaro

At what moment in this early phase of your life did you go from just watching this and maybe finding it very fascinating to feeling really drawn to it?

pete buttigieg

Well, when I got to college, it felt like the Republicans and the Democrats, at the time, it’s crazy to think about now, polarized as we are. But what it felt like when I showed up as a freshman on campus was that the two parties were converging and not necessarily in a good place, that you had this kind of center-right and center-left, both of them very committed to growth in business, but it seemed not very committed at all to some of the questions of how we take care of vulnerable people around the country. And I think there’s a moment for any kind of well-spoken or intelligent young person watching the news when you see a senator or a candidate saying something or doing something and you think, well, that’s not right. I could do that. I could do it different. Now, you might be wrong. They might be way more sophisticated than you are, and you can’t see it. Or you might be right, and it might well be the case that what they’re saying is just not right. But I certainly had that feeling reinforced when I saw these figures come to campus, some of whom were extremely impressive, but none of whom seemed like they were on a different plane of existence. They were just people.

michael barbaro

So at this point, a year or two into Harvard, have you made up your mind that you were probably going to find a way to have a career in politics?

pete buttigieg

I knew I wanted a career that involved policy. I don’t think I’d figured out for sure that that meant running. Plus, you know, when I thought about it, even well before I was coming to terms with the fact that I was gay, I knew that I had no political connections at home. I had an unpronounceable name, and I was a Democrat who lived in Indiana. So it was not obvious that I could overcome some of the obstacles toward running. But I think it’s safe to say by the time I graduated, I had some sense that I could see myself doing it.

michael barbaro

Well, I want to talk to you about that realization of your sexuality in particular. Obviously, your candidacy is historic in a couple of different ways, and among those is the fact you’re the first major party presidential candidate who is openly gay. And so I want to ask you about that part of your identity. When did you sense that you were gay? When did that realization start to dawn on you?

pete buttigieg

I think it depends what you mean by realization, right? There are things you could point to going way back, certainly a fascination I had with a classmate when I was about 12 that, in hindsight, is very obviously a crush. But I was not willing to think of it that way, although some part of me must have — I mean, I wasn’t stupid either, right? So you have this kind of awareness that was definitely there by the time I was hitting middle school. But taking a word like gay and applying it to myself, I was still years away from being able to do that, even in my own mind.

michael barbaro

Well, what did you do with those feelings?

pete buttigieg

I guess I packed them up, yeah.

michael barbaro

Packed them up —

pete buttigieg

Not much would be the best answer.

michael barbaro

Pack them up and put them where?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I don’t know how these things work, even in your own mind. I just didn’t explore them. That’s for sure. First of all, there were not a lot of out gay people that I knew as such growing up. I mean, in high school, it was exactly zero. There was just no sense of gay life or a gay community. And when I got to college, that’s when the kind of internal battle was starting to heat up.

michael barbaro

Why?

pete buttigieg

I think because you just can’t escape it. I mean, my god, you’re in college, right? I mean, any feelings you have, especially in the romantic department, are going to start asserting themselves even more fiercely than they have when you get to college. For a lot of people, it’s a big part of what you spend college on.

michael barbaro

Right. So how did you deal with it?

pete buttigieg

Same way I dealt with it up to then, just packed it away. Dated women, remarkable women. Because I enjoyed these relationships, I think I could defer facing the fact that that wasn’t the same as what it was to be in love with somebody.

michael barbaro

And your political ambition was already solid at that point?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I still didn’t know exactly where it would take me or what it would mean, but I think by then, I knew that there was a good chance I was going to be running for office in my adult life. But at that point, I’m still clinging to some kind of hope, however vanishing, that maybe I’m straight or I’m bisexual and I can just not worry about the gay part. I think when I thought about my career, certainly when I talked about my future and how I was going to be involved, I wasn’t even thinking about the possibility that that would come into contact with this developing side of me. But I’m sure to the extent that I thought what it would mean to come to terms with the fact that I was at very least different and, as became increasingly clear, gay, that one of the things that would have kept that in its corner was the simple fact that that didn’t fit with any of the other things I wanted to do in life, not just a career, but a family. I wanted to get married. I wanted to have kids. From my perspective, you could be married and have kids or you could be gay, not both.

michael barbaro

You graduated in 2004. That — correct me if I’m wrong. That’s the year when Massachusetts —

pete buttigieg

That’s right.

michael barbaro

— legalizes gay marriage.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

archived recording The court today, as you know, in a 4-3 advisory opinion to the Senate has a rule that in a November 18, 2003 decision, they meant marriage. They meant equality. They meant that the Commonwealth may no longer deny marriage rights to same-sex couples, including —

michael barbaro

So I say that only to try to understand, are you falling behind the culture, in a sense? Are you ignoring some of the signs that these things are changing?

archived recording Marriage and only marriage will be enough to satisfy the requirements of the Massachusetts Constitution.

pete buttigieg

Well, the thing is I wasn’t from Massachusetts. I was in Massachusetts for a while, but I never felt like I was from there. And nothing against Massachusetts, but I realized pretty quick after turning up at Harvard that I didn’t belong there either.

michael barbaro

Why not?

pete buttigieg

It was just — it was just a different culture. I didn’t realize that. I didn’t realize that I was Midwestern until I left the Midwest. And just little things, cultural things, the way — I don’t know, the way people interact, what’s expected of you. Once I got there, I realized that socially, I was way more Midwestern than I thought.

michael barbaro

So take me from graduating from Harvard to your decision to join the Navy Reserves.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so it starts with 9/11. Actually, it starts before 9/11. There’s this family tradition of serving in the military. There’s a painting hanging on the wall of my parents’ house of a relative, a great uncle who I kind of idolized in theory. He was an Army Air Corps pilot. And so I had this idea, this maybe romantic idea, of being in the military, and then it never really became real. But I remember on 9/11 thinking, oh, well, war isn’t just a thing that happens in other places or in other periods of history. Like, war has come to my generation, and thinking, at least in the back of my head, that that might mean I would be involved, but not taking any steps to do that. But that turned into more and more of a nagging feeling when some friends of mine started to serve. A friend of mine from college shared with me just before we graduated that he had decided to join the Navy Reserve. I was fascinated. And then when I was talking to someone about applying for the Rhodes Scholarship and how I wanted to talk about my interest in public service and to the faculty member who was giving advice to students, and just said, pointedly, like, you might want to really think about how you’re going to say that, knowing that you’re going to be competing against people from the military academies. Oh yeah, that’s true. Like, my chest thumping about caring about public service feels a lot smaller held up against what others are doing.

michael barbaro

Do you think that was one of the things that might have drawn you to military service, knowing that to get a Rhodes, to be in that world, in that league, you know, it might be a good thing?

pete buttigieg

I think definitely that it was part of how you’re true to a culture of service. And also the Kennedy presidency kind of hangs over certainly the Kennedy School, as you might imagine. And that can’t be separated from his military career.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

I mean, really, it was almost an expectation that you would’ve served, up until roughly the time when I came of age when everything shifted.

michael barbaro

An expectation that you would serve —

pete buttigieg

Well, when you’re looking at the history of the people we were studying —

michael barbaro

Of presidents.

pete buttigieg

— who have made history. Yep, as presidents. And then the thing that put me over the top was this experience knocking on doors in Iowa with a couple of buddies from college who went out. We took a week off and rented a car, and it was the last few days before the Iowa caucuses, and we were volunteers for Obama. They sent us to this very rural area, some of the lowest income counties in Iowa. And it felt like any time I met a young — especially young man — it was somebody who was serving or was about to serve. And I started to realize, we had service that used to be something that bridged people together. Now it’s completely different, that if you were rural or low-income, you were highly likely to serve. If you were from a background like mine, which was middle class economically, but I’d had the chance to go to an institution like Harvard, almost nobody with that background was serving. And I began to feel like it wasn’t just this kind of thing I thought about that I hadn’t gotten around to. It was that I was part of the problem. I was part of the divide. That was the thing that kind of propelled me that last few inches toward being ready to yank open the door of the recruiting office in Indiana and say, hey, how do I sign up?

michael barbaro

I wondered, do you think you joined the military in part because you knew what it would mean for a political career?

pete buttigieg

You know, I wrestled with that because as soon as I get that question, there’s a part of me that thinks, if the answer is yes, does that mean the service wasn’t pure in some way? And I remember at the time asking myself if being in the military was as unpopular as it is today popular, would I still do it? And I want to believe the answer is yes, but there’s no way to go back and prove it. I’m not somebody who thinks that it’s, like, a prerequisite that if you want to run for office you need to have served. But I do think if you have a heart for elected office, one way to put your money where your mouth is to have been in that kind of service, too.

michael barbaro

That strikes me as a very candid answer because of course, you could just say, well, of course I would have done it, even if there was no possible —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

— political benefit.

pete buttigieg

And I want to say that. I just can’t prove it.

michael barbaro

So I want to talk about this run for mayor for just a little bit. Whenever you run for office, your character is on display. And at this point, you are keeping something quite elemental about yourself secret. Did it feel like you were hiding something?

pete buttigieg

Not really. The only time it felt that way was when there was small talk about whether I was dating, and I would crack a joke or something. We’d be sitting in a studio like this one and a radio host would ask a question. And I’d say, well, if anybody listening is into economic policy and long walks on the beach, go ahead and reach out and just kind of play the busy single person, which is what I was, except for the fact that I wasn’t actively looking for love. I was going out of my way to avoid it. But if somebody who is straight up asked me on the record, to this day, I’m not sure what I would have done.

michael barbaro

Do you think that that would have potentially cost you the mayoralty, might have kept you from being mayor or staying mayor?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I think there’s a good chance of it. There’s a reason why no — as far as I know, no out gay person had ever run for mayor of any place in Indiana.

michael barbaro

This is a state with strong Christian values, and —

pete buttigieg

— not known for progressive social outlooks on politics. And here I am, rocking up, 29 years old saying, trust me, support me. Never mind this state legislator who has earned tons of credibility in this community. Never mind this county councilman who’s the party favorite. Go with me instead. If there had been anything that looked like a skeleton or a vulnerability, I think it probably would have sunk me before I got anywhere at all.

michael barbaro

So I want to now move into this notion of you reconciling these things.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so when I first joined the Reserve, the message was kind of you’re pretty much going to go to one of these wars, and we’ll let you know which one. And so I knew that, at a certain point, it was coming. And of course, I didn’t want to take office in South Bend without a plan for this. So we had gamed it out with my team, if I get orders, here’s what you do. And when I received my orders and knew I was going for sure, I don’t think even then it occurred to me that it would have much to do with my sexuality. If anything, I was thankful that I was single, right? The hardest thing for people to deploy is the fact that you’re leaving behind somebody you love, in addition to all the professional complications. But then, the more I started getting mentally ready for going over and really thinking about what it meant, the more it started weighing on me that I didn’t have a — wasn’t coming back to a family, my parents, of course, but I wasn’t coming back to a household. And more than that, I had no idea what it was like to be in love. And the idea that I’m — here I am. I’m a grown-ass man. I own a home. I’m the mayor of my city. I’m a military officer. And if I get killed over there, I will go to my grave not knowing what it’s like to be in love. And that just made me realize how untenable the situation I was in really was. And up until then, it didn’t seem untenable, I guess because I was so busy, and I might have deferred coming out and having a dating life forever, if not for this moment where I’m thinking, shit, I could die.

michael barbaro

You wrote a letter I want to ask you about.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, you know, it’s a thing you do. I assume everybody does it. I don’t know. But it’s the thing you do when you go to war, right? You want to make sure that you have the last word on your life and leave a few instructions. So I wrote up a letter, put an envelope, put just in case on the outside. Put it in the desk drawer, would’ve been pretty easy to find if worse comes to worst. And that’s a real moment, too, because you’re sitting there staring at the screen trying to figure out how to give a short accounting of your life.

michael barbaro

And what did you say?

pete buttigieg

Well, what I said was that I wouldn’t want people to think that I’d been cheated, that obviously it’d be terrible if I didn’t come back, but I also had this amazing life where I have wonderful friendships, and I got to serve my community in a way that very few people get to do, let alone at my age, and that I’d had this very fulfilling life. And of course, it’d be too bad if something happened to me, but to keep that in perspective. But if you’re asking if there was, like, P.S. I’m gay, no.

michael barbaro

That’s kind of what I was asking. So you are deployed.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

You do not die.

pete buttigieg

Right.

michael barbaro

You come back, and you’re mayor.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

And how do you decide that it’s time to come out?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think by the time I hit the ground and I was back, I knew that I was going to come out and then it’s just — it was more how and when. I remember resenting the idea that you’re supposed to have to come out, right? Straight people don’t have to come out. Why do I? And then, while I’m in the process of figuring this out —

archived recording Thank you all for coming. It’s been a tough week here in the Hoosier state, but we’re going to move forward.

pete buttigieg

We have this explosive controversy over Mike Pence, the Governor Mike Pence and his so-called Religious Freedom bill.

archived recording The Religious Freedom Restoration Act was about religious liberty, not about discrimination.

pete buttigieg

So suddenly, we’re on national television, my state, as the most officially anti-gay state in the country. I’m fighting him on it, of course, because it’s a terrible policy. But now, I’m fighting this terrible, anti-gay policy putatively from the perspective of a straight ally, wondering whether I’m more effective because people don’t know that I’m gay. And at the same time, knowing that this just kind of speeds things up even more that, like, it’s just a really weird position to be in, to be having all these hypothetical arguments about discrimination against gay people, when it really means me. Meanwhile, this is also the period when we realize that soon the Supreme Court is going to weigh in on marriage. I mean, all of this was happening in that early part of 2015 while I’m wrestling with how to do this. And so oddly enough, it was — — as busy as I was as mayor. Military duty actually felt like, kind of almost like a break because it was eight hour days, 40 hour week. I wasn’t used to having that much time, and so is a lot of time to sit and write and think and call friends and get advice.

michael barbaro

So you produce a plan.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, well I produced a letter, an op-ed I guess.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. What was the essential line that I’m sure you remember that you wrote?

pete buttigieg

I remember saying that it’s just part of who I am and that it has no bearing on how I do my job, that the way I do my — did my job either as an officer or as a mayor or in business had nothing to do with the fact that I was gay and that —

michael barbaro

It still sounds a little defensive.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Or maybe a little scared.

pete buttigieg

Probably. Yeah, I mean, you know, I didn’t feel like I was coming out guns blazing. I felt like I — again, part of me was bothered that I had to share this at all. Then part of me knew that it would do some good if I did, I mean, not just in my own life. That I — my main agenda was, personally, I wanted to get out there and start dating. But also that it would mean something, might mean all kinds of things to a whole bunch of different people when I came out and said this.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording A very personal announcement coming from South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg today. In an essay published in today’s South Bend Tribune, the mayor announced he is gay. Currently in the midst of running for a second term, Pete Buttigieg penned an essay in Tuesday’s South Bend Tribune revealing he was gay. A lot of people wondering why he chose to make this announcement now. It comes just months after the state’s religious freedom law thrust the state into the national debate on gay rights. As for the mayor himself, he says nothing is different, nothing has changed, and his focus is on South Bend.

michael barbaro

I want to talk about the timing, the exact moment of the op-ed because my sense is that at this phase of your career, you’re up for re-election, right? You’ve won the primary. And winning the primary, in a sense, means you’re standing a very good shot of winning.

pete buttigieg

Depending on the year, but yeah, in South Bend, it should be.

michael barbaro

So does that mean you deliberately chose a — like, a safe, low-risk time to do this?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I would think that going into a Democratic primary would be a safer time than going into a general election. And I think also the decision to do this came by way of realizing that there is no such thing as a safe time. I was just done with not having the kind of personal life that I wanted to have.

michael barbaro

So once you come out, how does your personal life change?

pete buttigieg

Well, I started dating, and that kind of changes everything. I mean, I still had this very demanding job. You’re the mayor, and so anybody in town that you ask to have a cup of coffee is —

michael barbaro

It’s a thing.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, it’s a thing. It might be misinterpreted. You could cross some line without meaning to. I mean, most of the people I interacted with were either people who needed something from me, people I needed something from or people who worked for me. So it’s not, like, a very healthy pool for dating is what I’m saying. And I remember thinking there were all these kind of city fathers who, early on in my time as mayor, seemed determined to fix me up with their daughters. And I remember just thinking, like, where are you now? Did none of you have, like, a son or a nephew or something? So I did what millennials do. I went online. Turns out there’s apps for all of this. There was O.K. Cupid, Tinder. The one that actually came through for me was called Hinge. And it’s supposed to serve up people that — I don’t know how the algorithm works. But I find this guy, this cute guy with a big smile, and I’m like, I want to know this guy. So we start chatting. Well, I was chatting with a lot of people, but obviously, he’s the one I remember because that was Chasten.

Your future husband.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

michael barbaro

So your story, to many people, is particularly compelling one, everything we just discussed. You are a Harvard graduate, a Rhodes Scholar, you’re a veteran. You’re gay. You’re religious. And from your own description of yourself, it feels like you have been thinking about politics and preparing, to some degree, to run for president for a very long time, even though you’re quite young. And I’m sure you understand this and have heard this. That has led to this perception of a person kind of, perhaps, orchestrating a political biography. Do you ever question whether that, no matter what your intention, is — could possibly undermine the power of the story itself, however genuine?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I mean, I think we’re conditioned to not like the idea of somebody who sat around thinking all their lives about how to become president. And I don’t view myself that way, although I get that that story has been written around me. Although, I also don’t know what it is we expect, that somebody kind of gets struck by lightning and then they turn into somebody who might become president. We all have these paths, right, that bring us to where we are. And I think anybody in professional life or even social life thinks about the story that you tell about yourself. At the end of the day, I’m not doing this because I have this personal need to be in elected office or to be the president. I’m not coming at the presidency as a thing that I’d like to occupy. I’m coming at it as this way to do something that I think I’m able to do. And I think it’s helpful in the sense that I could also have a very happy life doing something else. And oddly, I think that — that helps prepare me to do what’s required to do this. And this is advice I give talking to students, too. Imagine somebody is being sworn in, an ambitious, talented person kind of in the middle of their career is being sworn in as an assistant secretary in the State Department for the Middle East. And then imagine if that person has got there one of two ways. In kind of universe A, it’s a person who woke up one day in high school and said, I want to be the assistant secretary for the Middle East, and took the right courses and got the right jobs and had the right fellowships and wrote the right papers and did everything in order to occupy that title. And the other person is somebody who said, I — woke up in high school and said, I want to be the person who makes the United States a force toward peace in the Middle East. And they don’t know what that’s going to mean, and maybe it means they start out becoming an activist or maybe they’re an academic or maybe they’re a civil servant or whatever. But by whatever winding path, they wind up in this job, right? Which of those two scenarios is going to lead to somebody who’s better equipped to take that job they’ve been handed? I’ve got to think it’s the latter. And so what I’ve tried to do in my life is to prepare myself to be useful to others. And yes, I think that, in all likelihood, means in a form that involves holding office or seeking office or at least public life where I speak to lots of people, sometimes millions at the same time. But it’s not about, necessarily, having one title or another. And so I think if you overthink it, that’s where you start to lose the fidelity to what it is that would guide you when you actually get what you’ve been chasing for a long time. Jeremy, what do we learn from Mayor Pete Buttigieg about the way he reconciled his political ambition with this essential fact about himself that he feared would endanger that ambition?

jeremy peters

I think we learn a lot about his decision-making process, not just how he internalizes decisions personally, but how he thinks about them in the longer arc of a political career. And he’s been very intentional all along the way about choosing certain endeavors that he thinks would benefit a long-term political career. Now some people would think, on the one hand, that’s too calculating. I don’t want somebody who’s thought about being president since he was a teenager. And, you know, in the era when voters seemed to prize authenticity in their political figures, they could see that as inauthentic. On the other hand, the decision that he made to wait seems to have borne out to his benefit. I mean, here he is, the first openly gay candidate for president of the United States who has a legitimate shot at being his party’s nominee. Look at where he is in the Democratic primary right now. He’s rocketed to the top of the polls. He’s brought in all this money in large part because he’s gay, and that opened a lot of doors with Democratic donors. He’s heading into the Iowa caucuses in the lead by some measures. But we won’t know if his decision to wait actually was the right one until people start voting. So it seems to have worked out well for him right now, but no one’s cast a single vote. And we don’t know how voters in the Democratic primary are going to react. We certainly don’t know how voters in a general election are going to react. So we’re just not going to know until Democratic voters have their say.

michael barbaro

Mayor, when you think back to your younger self —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Not just your teenage self, but even your college self and your post-collegiate self who was so fearful about telling the world that you were gay, what do you kind of wish you could tell that person, that version of Mayor Buttigieg?

pete buttigieg

Well, back then, I would have thought this other fact, if I dared to unpack it, this fact about my life, this way in which I was different, was the thing that could multiply all the other stuff by zero, in terms of the impact I was going to have in the world, that I might very well choose that path, but that the price would be that I wouldn’t get to make a difference in public life. And if you want proof of God having a sense of humor, one of the things I’m seeing now, especially in the interactions I have on the campaign trail and the fact that this campaign is historic in a lot of ways, is that that same fact that I thought would mean never getting to this point might actually be one of the things that makes it matter the most.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

It’s a strange thing to think about that the one thing that I couldn’t control, the one thing that might have meant that it would be better not to have any aspirations related to politics at all could be the very thing that anchors the moral and emotional purpose of this entire campaign.

michael barbaro

Thank you very much.

pete buttigieg

Thanks for having me.

We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (fiona hill) And I did say to him, Ambassador Sondland, Gordon, I think this is all going to blow up, and here we are.

michael barbaro

In the latest public testimony before impeachment investigators, Fiona Hill, the former top Russia expert on the National Security Council, recalled her growing frustration with Ambassador Gordon Sondland, as she realized he was pursuing a political agenda in Ukraine on behalf of President Trump.

archived recording (fiona hill) He was being involved in a domestic, political errand, and we were being involved in national security foreign policy and those two things have just diverged.

michael barbaro

Hill testified that when Trump and Sondland pressed Ukraine to investigate the discredited theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, they were playing directly into Russia’s hands, since Russia wants to deflect attention away from its interference.

archived recording (fiona hill) This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves. These fictions are harmful, even if they’re deployed for purely domestic, political purposes.

“That is the same thing Ambassador Volker said yesterday,” Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, responded.

That was sort of interesting — in part because it was one of the relatively few times Nunes managed to complete a sentence without crying, “Identify the whistle-blower!” or “Hunter Biden!”

Also because Volker actually said the nickname made him “cringe.” He believes “three amigos” should only refer to the glorious bipartisan Senate trio of John McCain, Joseph Lieberman and Lindsey Graham. Now, of course, McCain has passed away, Lieberman is a lobbyist for a Chinese telecom company and Graham is Donald Trump’s lap puppy. So the cringy thing really could make sense.

Back to Rudy: Sondland said the Trump amigos hated working with Giuliani, but he was the only person who could get President Zelensky a meeting at the White House. The diplomats who testified really did seem concerned about helping Ukraine out. Sure, some of them got the job via a million-dollar political donation and then spent way too much refurbishing their official residence. (Looking at you, Mr. S.) Still.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: In the phone call at the center of the impeachment inquiry, President Trump asked Ukraine for two different investigations. Scott Shane on the unexpected story behind one of them. It’s Tuesday, November 26.

archived recording We are joined right now — it is our great pleasure to welcome the president of the United States, Donald Trump, calling in. Mr. Trump, good morning to you. archived recording (donald trump) Good morning. archived recording Good to have you on “Fox & Friends” today. As you —

scott shane

So on Friday, President Trump called in to “Fox & Friends,” one of his favorite shows on Fox News, and what ensued was, really, a 53-minute stream of consciousness.

archived recording (donald trump) This was spying on my campaign, something that has never been done in the history of our country. They thought I was going to win, and they said, how could we stop him? You know, a lot of people say, deep state. I don’t like to use the word deep state. I just say they’re really bad, sick people. archived recording Mr. President, you said —

scott shane

And one of the things he talked about was a theory that’s really at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.

archived recording (donald trump) It’s very interesting, they have the server, right, from the D.N.C., Democratic National Committee. archived recording Who has the server? archived recording (donald trump) The F.B.I. went in, and they told him, get out of here. You’re not getting it. We’re not giving it to you. They gave the server to CrowdStrike or whatever it’s called, which is a company owned by a very wealthy Ukrainian.

scott shane

And it was the same theory that he brought up with the president of Ukraine, President Zelensky, in this famous phone call on July 25. The theory, the false theory, is that Ukraine, and not Russia, was responsible for the hacking of the 2016 election, and that Ukraine was assisted in this by a company called CrowdStrike.

michael barbaro

Scott, what would make the president believe this theory and mention this company by name?

scott shane

Well, let’s start with the undisputed facts. Back in the spring of 2016, of course it was the middle of the presidential race, and the Democratic National Committee discovers that its computers have been hacked. So they call their cybersecurity contractor, CrowdStrike. And CrowdStrike is a California company that was co-founded by a fellow who immigrated as a child from Russia, and, really, one of the top cybersecurity companies out there. And the Democratic National Committee asked them to come to Washington and examine these computers and basically do what any cybersecurity company does, which is kick out the hackers, kind of clean up the computer servers, and make sure the organization can keep functioning. So essentially, CrowdStrike and the D.N.C. report this to the F.B.I. Hacking is, of course, a crime, so the F.B.I. begins its own investigation. And CrowdStrike is in communication the whole time with the F.B.I. And so they’re essentially working alongside each other and zeroing in, in part, on who did it by looking at, essentially, the fingerprints of the burglars who broke into the computer system, the sort of telltale signs that particular hacking groups leave behind. And all those telltale signs were pointing to Russia, and, in particular, to hackers who work for the Russian government. And they did it, American intelligence agencies conclude, to assist Donald Trump and especially to damage Hillary Clinton in this presidential race.

michael barbaro

So where does this Trump theory that he talks about on Fox News, that becomes part of impeachment inquiry, where does that intersect with the story that you just laid out, the undisputed fact story?

scott shane

Well, President Trump takes the players that exist in real life, but in each case sort of distorts the facts. And the main purpose of the distortions seems to be to bring Ukraine in at each point. So he says that CrowdStrike, this California company, is Ukrainian, owned by a rich Ukrainian. Not true. He says the F.B.I. dropped the ball on this investigation and turned everything over to CrowdStrike and let them essentially take over. Not true. And he says that as a result of CrowdStrike taking over, because he thinks CrowdStrike is a Ukrainian company, the server, the D.N.C. server that he’s very focused on, has somehow ended up in Ukraine. It’s hidden in Ukraine. So the gist of what he’s saying to the American public is, you can’t believe what the F.B.I. told you about the hacking of the 2016 election. In fact, the F.B.I. messed up this investigation, and all signs point not to Russia, but to Ukraine.

michael barbaro

So this is a pretty unified theory that CrowdStrike is Ukrainian, CrowdStrike gets the computer servers, CrowdStrike places them in Ukraine. But none of it is true.

scott shane

Exactly.

michael barbaro

Why does Trump want Ukraine to be involved and not Russia?

scott shane

So Trump first mentioned this false theory about Ukraine and CrowdStrike back in April of 2017. It was in the middle of an interview with the Associated Press. It was the early months of his presidency. And I think in some ways he was still smarting from the implication that he had had Russian help and that maybe his victory was not legitimate. And I think he’s very worried about that. You see lots of signs of his concern about that. So if he can somehow disprove or divert attention from the notion that Russia helped him win, he’s psychologically and politically a lot better off. And Ukraine is sort of the perfect fall guy in this story. Russia and Ukraine are at war, and Ukraine, while I don’t think it’s fair to say that Ukraine interfered in the election, it is true that a few Ukrainian officials criticized Trump on the campaign trail, things that he was saying, and in some cases, praised Hillary Clinton. So if he can shift the blame from Russia to Ukraine, he can essentially burnish his victory and remove this cloud over his presidency and make the claim that his victory is all the greater, because not only did no foreign actor help him, but he had to overcome interference by these hostile Ukrainians, who, as he put it once, “tried to take me down.”

michael barbaro

So in this theory, which, as you just said, is not true, but in this theory, he’s not the beneficiary of an election surreptitiously aided by Russia. He is the victor over an obstacle course laid out by Ukraine?

scott shane

Exactly. So it wasn’t until this same false theory about CrowdStrike in Ukraine turned up in the White House reconstruction of his July call to the president of Ukraine that everybody began focusing on it. So everybody asked, why did Trump come to believe that Ukraine and not Russia was somehow involved in the hacking? And where did this bogus theory come from? But I couldn’t find the origin of that story. And so it remained a little bit of a mystery. And then new evidence came to light. And it turned out that its origin was even more nefarious than we had imagined. [MUSIC]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So Scott, what have you found out about where this theory actually came from?

scott shane

So Trump’s false theory came, it turns out, not from some wacky website or from Twitter. It may have actually originated with the Russians.

michael barbaro

Wow. How would that have worked?

scott shane

So we learned this new information from F.B.I. documents obtained by BuzzFeed, the news organization, under the Freedom of Information Act. And it turns out that Trump heard from his campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, that Ukraine and not Russia might be responsible for the hacking. And Manafort, apparently, according to these new F.B.I. documents, heard this from Konstantin Kilimnik, who was an associate of his, who was a dual Russian-Ukrainian national with very close ties to Russian intelligence.

michael barbaro

So a man with ties to Russian intelligence who works closely with Paul Manafort, Donald Trump’s campaign manager in 2016, gives the information to Manafort, and, our understanding goes, Manafort would have then passed that on to Trump. And if what we know about Russia and the way it handles information is true, this would have potentially been a deliberate misinformation campaign?

scott shane

That’s right, because it was certainly in Russia’s interest to shift the blame for interference in the 2016 election away from its intelligence agencies — to anywhere, but to its enemy, Ukraine, that’s all the better.

michael barbaro

And why would Manafort believe this man who’s telling him that it’s Ukraine, not Russia, behind this meddling?

scott shane

Well, Manafort, folks might remember, was a longtime political operative in Ukraine, but he was working Ukraine on behalf of a pro-Russia political party. So his political sympathies were on the Russian side. So in that sense, it would make sense for him to try to turn the Ukrainians into a scapegoat for Russia’s hacking.

michael barbaro

So everyone in this chain of information has some motivation to support this theory. The Russians, of course — they want to distract from what they’ve just done. This man who gives it to Manafort, because he works with the Russians. Manafort, because he works for Ukrainian businesspeople who support Russia, and, finally, Donald Trump, who wants anyone other than the Russians to be responsible for this.

scott shane

Exactly. I think we don’t know whether any of these parties actually believes any of this stuff in their heart of hearts. But it’s certainly in their political interest to pass it along.

michael barbaro

Scott, were you surprised that two years after President Trump first publicly raises this theory about Ukraine, he brings it up in a phone call with a foreign leader, despite all of the evidence that it wasn’t true?

scott shane

Yes, I was, because there had been a very important development.

archived recording (rod rosenstein) Good afternoon. Today, a grand jury in the District of Columbia returned an indictment presented by the special counsel’s office. The indictment charges 12 Russian military officers by name for conspiring to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.

scott shane

And that was the indictment by Robert Mueller’s investigators of a number of Russian military intelligence officers.

archived recording (rod rosenstein) The defendants worked for two units of the main intelligence directorate of the Russian general staff.

scott shane

And this indictment was exquisitely detailed, down to the point of, like, what they googled before they carried out the hacking.

archived recording (rod rosenstein) First, they used a scheme known as spear phishing, which involves sending misleading email messages and tricking the users into disclosing their passwords and security information.

scott shane

And it had their names, it had their ranks, it had their locations.

archived recording (rod rosenstein) And we need to keep moving forward to preserve our values, protect against future interference, and defend America.

scott shane

So it seemed to remove all doubts about the role not only of Russians, but of specific Russian intelligence officers and the Russian state in carrying out that operation. And nevertheless, here the president was, once again reviving the notion that somehow Ukraine had carried out the hack, and presenting this theory of his not just to anyone, but to the president of Ukraine, and essentially trying to pressure the president of Ukraine into launching an investigation into this completely baseless theory.

michael barbaro

So of course, this pressure that the president puts on Ukraine’s president becomes central to the impeachment inquiry. So how has this theory factored into and been talked about in the public hearings of the impeachment inquiry?

archived recording (adam schiff) Today, we are joined by Dr. Fiona Hill and David Holmes.

scott shane

So there was really a standoff between the diplomatic professionals and the real experts on Russia and Ukraine and the Republicans on the committee.

archived recording (fiona hill) Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Nunes, and members of the committee, thank you for inviting me to testify before you today. I have a short opening statement. Based on questions and statements I’ve heard, some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country, and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did.

scott shane

The professionals, in particular Fiona Hill, the former top Russia expert on the National Security Council —

archived recording (fiona hill) This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.

scott shane

— were emphatic that there was absolutely no truth to the idea that Ukraine was somehow responsible for the hack.

archived recording (adam schiff) [GAVEL BANG] Committee will turn to order. Mr. Jordan, you’re recognized for five minutes. archived recording (jim jordan) Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ambassador, thank you for being here —

scott shane

But the Republicans on the committee, while not entirely embracing Trump’s theory, kept trying to open the door to it.

archived recording (jim jordan) Ambassador, should ambassadors ever try to influence host country elections? archived recording (fiona hill) No.

scott shane

Representative Jim Jordan, one of the most aggressive defenders of the president, said, well —

archived recording (jim jordan) But that’s exactly what happened in 2016. In August of 2016, the very month you went to Ukraine as our ambassador, the Ukrainian ambassador here in the United States, Ambassador Chaly, wrote an op-ed in The Hill, said this, “Trump’s comments send wrong message.”

scott shane

Wasn’t it true that there were some Ukrainian politicians who had criticized Trump? In other words, isn’t it possible that some Ukrainians were trying to, as the president said, take him down?

He continued to insist that it’s all a little bit fuzzy, it’s a little murky, we don’t really know.

archived recording (john kennedy) We don’t know if Ukraine did that. We don’t know to what extent, because they won’t let the president offer his evidence. And that’s —

scott shane

In other words, we’ve left behind the crystal clarity of the Mueller indictment last year that said exactly who was responsible for the hacking, and we’ve entered this sort of twilight zone, where we don’t really know what’s true and what’s untrue. And that sort of is a license for President Trump to say whatever he wants.

michael barbaro

Scott, what have we learned from the journey of this conspiracy theory? And just how many people seem to be willing to tolerate it?

scott shane

Well, I mean, first of all, this conspiracy theory concerns something of really the utmost importance, which is the biggest interference by a foreign power in American democracy in history. And so it would seem very important that we get the facts straight and keep them straight. But what we’ve learned from the durability of this conspiracy theory is that when false beliefs arise and linger, not on the fringes of the internet but right inside the Oval Office, and you have the president of the United States repeatedly stating them from the biggest bully pulpit in the world, it becomes a sort of force field that warps everything around it. And the politics of the impeachment are such that Trump’s Republican allies see their own political futures as very much tied to his, so they can’t confront him and say, Mr. President, what you’re saying is not true. So this false conspiracy theory lingers. And the president keeps talking about it. [MUSIC]

Facts that cut against his position have been declared false. Witnesses who have questioned his motives have been declared dishonest. Critics of his behavior are part of a corrupt, shadowy effort aiming to damage him.

And, as he likes to put it, his own actions are always, to one degree or another, “perfect.”

That approach — which proved effective when Mr. Trump faced off against the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III — is about to face a formidable test as the impeachment process moves forward.

The White House and congressional Republicans allied with Mr. Trump are preparing for a Senate trial in which they will not only declare Mr. Trump’s innocence but also present a version of events that portray him as the victim of a broad plot to undermine his presidency even before it began.

That narrative will include claims that Ukrainians meddled in the 2016 election instead of the Russians — an unfounded allegation refuted by the administration’s own intelligence agencies as recently as this week — and that Hunter Biden, the younger son of Vice President Joseph R.

His expected entry has injected a new element of uncertainty into the race, highlighting its fluidity as well as the angst among many moderate Democrats that the field has moved too far left, and that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., despite leading in most national polls, is poorly positioned to win. It has also stirred a debate among Democrats about the role of wealth in the primary and accusations from progressive rivals that Mr. Bloomberg is trying to buy the presidency.

“Swell,” Steve Bullock, the governor of Montana who is running a shoestring campaign for president, wrote on Twitter Friday. “Another Billionaire who thinks the Democratic nomination is for sale.”

“No, I’m not,” she said, with a laugh. More seriously, Ms. Klobuchar argued that Mr. Bloomberg’s wealth could turn off some primary voters, who are tired of big money in politics. “They are tired of all the money in our world that’s at the top and I don’t think they want that at the top of our country,” she said.

The official, Oliver Davis, is a longtime Democratic member of the Common Council.

“In times like these, when the political winds are fiercely blowing across our country, it’s important for us to have an experienced leader who has been through the diverse storms of life to guide our country,” Mr. Davis said in an endorsement released by the Biden campaign.

Mr. Davis has been a frequent critic of Mr. Buttigieg since the mayor took office in 2012, seeking, for example, to tap the brakes on a signature initiative of the mayor’s to demolish or repair 1,000 run-down houses in 1,000 days. In 2016, he voted against the mayor’s effort to hire a diversity officer.

When a white officer from the South Bend Police Department fatally shot a black resident in June, setting off protests and anguished town hall events, the episode exposed deep distrust between the police and some members of South Bend’s minority community. Mr. Davis emerged as a sharp critic of the mayor’s management of the police in the national media."

And I just — maybe involuntarily, my hand went up. And from then on, it became that the running joke of the class that I’d wind up running for president. And then by the time I got to college, they had this Institute of Politics at Harvard, and every day, there’d be a different speaker who would come through. And I remember when I was there as a freshman, people like Donna Brazile who had just come off managing the Gore campaign and Rick Davis, who had done the same thing for McCain. And the former president of Ecuador, he’d been deposed in a coup. You’d just kind of hang around and watch them and see what they were like. The biggest realization was that they’re just people. These people who were shaping the world, people I was seeing on TV were obviously very impressive people, but they were just people. I think it changed my awareness of the fact that, on some level, I could be part of that world, too. But in a very simple sense, especially coming from Indiana, it seemed that it was a choice.

Pete Buttigieg. It’s Friday, November 22. So Jeremy Peters, you cover politics for The Times, and you’ve been closely tracking Mayor Buttigieg. And in order to better understand the Democratic field of presidential candidates, we’re trying to figure out the most revealing moments in their lives. So when it comes to Pete Buttigieg, what moment should we focus on?

jeremy peters

Well, Mayor Pete has always been a candidate for whom his story, his biography is very central to his appeal to voters, and he’s got a great story to tell. He’s been elected mayor of this medium-sized town in Indiana before turning 30. He has an Ivy League pedigree. He’s been a Rhodes Scholar. He’s worked at a prestigious consulting firm. He’s gone off to Afghanistan as part of the Navy Reserves. So he has all of these components that you kind of think if you’re a voter, wow, he really stands out. There’s something unique about this guy. But at the same time, for most of his adult life, he had this nagging secret, the secret that he couldn’t confront because he thought that it would mean the end to this political career that he had spent so much time perfecting, basically since he went away to college and decided, hey, you know, I can run for president. And he doesn’t see how it’s possible for the politician with the perfect background, the perfect resume to also be open about their sexuality, in his case. So how he reconciles this inner turmoil with his very public ambition I think is a defining moment in his life, if not the defining moment.

michael barbaro

All right. Welcome to the studio.

pete buttigieg

Thank you.

michael barbaro

You’re going to sit there.

pete buttigieg

All right.

jeremy peters

So that story begins in 1982 in South Bend, Indiana where Peter Buttigieg was born.

michael barbaro

Mayor, tell me about the kind of kid that you were, growing up in Indiana?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think I was, safe to say, a little on the nerdy side. I lived in a neighborhood kind of in the middle of South Bend, close to a park where you would have as much as possible what you’d call a prototypical Midwestern kid’s upbringing, you know, playing in the park with friends, a lot of time in the house. I was really interested in baseball cards, but I was more interested in categorizing them than I was in baseball, I think. I loved science and science fiction. I loved reading, plus I was an only child. So I think it’s safe to say I had a lot of interior life going on in a fairly quiet house where it was a dog and my parents, who were both academics, and me.

michael barbaro

What was your introduction to even the idea of politics?

pete buttigieg

Politics was always in the air in our house just because my parents were very politically passionate. They really cared about what was happening. I can remember the Democratic Convention. It must have been 1988.

archived recording NBC News continues its coverage of America’s convention.

pete buttigieg

I would’ve been six years old and my parents explaining what a convention was. I remember Jesse Jackson giving a speech.

archived recording (jesse jackson) When I look out at this convention, I see the face of America — red, yellow, brown, black, and white. We are all precious in God’s sight, the real rainbow coalition.

pete buttigieg

And I remember my parents thinking it was important to watch the Republican Convention, too. I mean, you would stop — even though I don’t it ever crossed their mind to ever vote for a Republican.

archived recording Now let’s go down to the podium. Here is George Herbert Walker Bush addressing his convention.

pete buttigieg

Everything in the house would kind of stop when it was time to watch what was playing out.

archived recording Thank you.

michael barbaro

At what moment in this early phase of your life did you go from just watching this and maybe finding it very fascinating to feeling really drawn to it?

pete buttigieg

Well, when I got to college, it felt like the Republicans and the Democrats, at the time, it’s crazy to think about now, polarized as we are. But what it felt like when I showed up as a freshman on campus was that the two parties were converging and not necessarily in a good place, that you had this kind of center-right and center-left, both of them very committed to growth in business, but it seemed not very committed at all to some of the questions of how we take care of vulnerable people around the country. And I think there’s a moment for any kind of well-spoken or intelligent young person watching the news when you see a senator or a candidate saying something or doing something and you think, well, that’s not right. I could do that. I could do it different. Now, you might be wrong. They might be way more sophisticated than you are, and you can’t see it. Or you might be right, and it might well be the case that what they’re saying is just not right. But I certainly had that feeling reinforced when I saw these figures come to campus, some of whom were extremely impressive, but none of whom seemed like they were on a different plane of existence. They were just people.

michael barbaro

So at this point, a year or two into Harvard, have you made up your mind that you were probably going to find a way to have a career in politics?

pete buttigieg

I knew I wanted a career that involved policy. I don’t think I’d figured out for sure that that meant running. Plus, you know, when I thought about it, even well before I was coming to terms with the fact that I was gay, I knew that I had no political connections at home. I had an unpronounceable name, and I was a Democrat who lived in Indiana. So it was not obvious that I could overcome some of the obstacles toward running. But I think it’s safe to say by the time I graduated, I had some sense that I could see myself doing it.

michael barbaro

Well, I want to talk to you about that realization of your sexuality in particular. Obviously, your candidacy is historic in a couple of different ways, and among those is the fact you’re the first major party presidential candidate who is openly gay. And so I want to ask you about that part of your identity. When did you sense that you were gay? When did that realization start to dawn on you?

pete buttigieg

I think it depends what you mean by realization, right? There are things you could point to going way back, certainly a fascination I had with a classmate when I was about 12 that, in hindsight, is very obviously a crush. But I was not willing to think of it that way, although some part of me must have — I mean, I wasn’t stupid either, right? So you have this kind of awareness that was definitely there by the time I was hitting middle school. But taking a word like gay and applying it to myself, I was still years away from being able to do that, even in my own mind.

michael barbaro

Well, what did you do with those feelings?

pete buttigieg

I guess I packed them up, yeah.

michael barbaro

Packed them up —

pete buttigieg

Not much would be the best answer.

michael barbaro

Pack them up and put them where?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I don’t know how these things work, even in your own mind. I just didn’t explore them. That’s for sure. First of all, there were not a lot of out gay people that I knew as such growing up. I mean, in high school, it was exactly zero. There was just no sense of gay life or a gay community. And when I got to college, that’s when the kind of internal battle was starting to heat up.

michael barbaro

Why?

pete buttigieg

I think because you just can’t escape it. I mean, my god, you’re in college, right? I mean, any feelings you have, especially in the romantic department, are going to start asserting themselves even more fiercely than they have when you get to college. For a lot of people, it’s a big part of what you spend college on.

michael barbaro

Right. So how did you deal with it?

pete buttigieg

Same way I dealt with it up to then, just packed it away. Dated women, remarkable women. Because I enjoyed these relationships, I think I could defer facing the fact that that wasn’t the same as what it was to be in love with somebody.

michael barbaro

And your political ambition was already solid at that point?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I still didn’t know exactly where it would take me or what it would mean, but I think by then, I knew that there was a good chance I was going to be running for office in my adult life. But at that point, I’m still clinging to some kind of hope, however vanishing, that maybe I’m straight or I’m bisexual and I can just not worry about the gay part. I think when I thought about my career, certainly when I talked about my future and how I was going to be involved, I wasn’t even thinking about the possibility that that would come into contact with this developing side of me. But I’m sure to the extent that I thought what it would mean to come to terms with the fact that I was at very least different and, as became increasingly clear, gay, that one of the things that would have kept that in its corner was the simple fact that that didn’t fit with any of the other things I wanted to do in life, not just a career, but a family. I wanted to get married. I wanted to have kids. From my perspective, you could be married and have kids or you could be gay, not both.

michael barbaro

You graduated in 2004. That — correct me if I’m wrong. That’s the year when Massachusetts —

pete buttigieg

That’s right.

michael barbaro

— legalizes gay marriage.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

archived recording The court today, as you know, in a 4-3 advisory opinion to the Senate has a rule that in a November 18, 2003 decision, they meant marriage. They meant equality. They meant that the Commonwealth may no longer deny marriage rights to same-sex couples, including —

michael barbaro

So I say that only to try to understand, are you falling behind the culture, in a sense? Are you ignoring some of the signs that these things are changing?

archived recording Marriage and only marriage will be enough to satisfy the requirements of the Massachusetts Constitution.

pete buttigieg

Well, the thing is I wasn’t from Massachusetts. I was in Massachusetts for a while, but I never felt like I was from there. And nothing against Massachusetts, but I realized pretty quick after turning up at Harvard that I didn’t belong there either.

michael barbaro

Why not?

pete buttigieg

It was just — it was just a different culture. I didn’t realize that. I didn’t realize that I was Midwestern until I left the Midwest. And just little things, cultural things, the way — I don’t know, the way people interact, what’s expected of you. Once I got there, I realized that socially, I was way more Midwestern than I thought.

michael barbaro

So take me from graduating from Harvard to your decision to join the Navy Reserves.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so it starts with 9/11. Actually, it starts before 9/11. There’s this family tradition of serving in the military. There’s a painting hanging on the wall of my parents’ house of a relative, a great uncle who I kind of idolized in theory. He was an Army Air Corps pilot. And so I had this idea, this maybe romantic idea, of being in the military, and then it never really became real. But I remember on 9/11 thinking, oh, well, war isn’t just a thing that happens in other places or in other periods of history. Like, war has come to my generation, and thinking, at least in the back of my head, that that might mean I would be involved, but not taking any steps to do that. But that turned into more and more of a nagging feeling when some friends of mine started to serve. A friend of mine from college shared with me just before we graduated that he had decided to join the Navy Reserve. I was fascinated. And then when I was talking to someone about applying for the Rhodes Scholarship and how I wanted to talk about my interest in public service and to the faculty member who was giving advice to students, and just said, pointedly, like, you might want to really think about how you’re going to say that, knowing that you’re going to be competing against people from the military academies. Oh yeah, that’s true. Like, my chest thumping about caring about public service feels a lot smaller held up against what others are doing.

michael barbaro

Do you think that was one of the things that might have drawn you to military service, knowing that to get a Rhodes, to be in that world, in that league, you know, it might be a good thing?

pete buttigieg

I think definitely that it was part of how you’re true to a culture of service. And also the Kennedy presidency kind of hangs over certainly the Kennedy School, as you might imagine. And that can’t be separated from his military career.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

I mean, really, it was almost an expectation that you would’ve served, up until roughly the time when I came of age when everything shifted.

michael barbaro

An expectation that you would serve —

pete buttigieg

Well, when you’re looking at the history of the people we were studying —

michael barbaro

Of presidents.

pete buttigieg

— who have made history. Yep, as presidents. And then the thing that put me over the top was this experience knocking on doors in Iowa with a couple of buddies from college who went out. We took a week off and rented a car, and it was the last few days before the Iowa caucuses, and we were volunteers for Obama. They sent us to this very rural area, some of the lowest income counties in Iowa. And it felt like any time I met a young — especially young man — it was somebody who was serving or was about to serve. And I started to realize, we had service that used to be something that bridged people together. Now it’s completely different, that if you were rural or low-income, you were highly likely to serve. If you were from a background like mine, which was middle class economically, but I’d had the chance to go to an institution like Harvard, almost nobody with that background was serving. And I began to feel like it wasn’t just this kind of thing I thought about that I hadn’t gotten around to. It was that I was part of the problem. I was part of the divide. That was the thing that kind of propelled me that last few inches toward being ready to yank open the door of the recruiting office in Indiana and say, hey, how do I sign up?

michael barbaro

I wondered, do you think you joined the military in part because you knew what it would mean for a political career?

pete buttigieg

You know, I wrestled with that because as soon as I get that question, there’s a part of me that thinks, if the answer is yes, does that mean the service wasn’t pure in some way? And I remember at the time asking myself if being in the military was as unpopular as it is today popular, would I still do it? And I want to believe the answer is yes, but there’s no way to go back and prove it. I’m not somebody who thinks that it’s, like, a prerequisite that if you want to run for office you need to have served. But I do think if you have a heart for elected office, one way to put your money where your mouth is to have been in that kind of service, too.

michael barbaro

That strikes me as a very candid answer because of course, you could just say, well, of course I would have done it, even if there was no possible —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

— political benefit.

pete buttigieg

And I want to say that. I just can’t prove it.

michael barbaro

So I want to talk about this run for mayor for just a little bit. Whenever you run for office, your character is on display. And at this point, you are keeping something quite elemental about yourself secret. Did it feel like you were hiding something?

pete buttigieg

Not really. The only time it felt that way was when there was small talk about whether I was dating, and I would crack a joke or something. We’d be sitting in a studio like this one and a radio host would ask a question. And I’d say, well, if anybody listening is into economic policy and long walks on the beach, go ahead and reach out and just kind of play the busy single person, which is what I was, except for the fact that I wasn’t actively looking for love. I was going out of my way to avoid it. But if somebody who is straight up asked me on the record, to this day, I’m not sure what I would have done.

michael barbaro

Do you think that that would have potentially cost you the mayoralty, might have kept you from being mayor or staying mayor?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I think there’s a good chance of it. There’s a reason why no — as far as I know, no out gay person had ever run for mayor of any place in Indiana.

michael barbaro

This is a state with strong Christian values, and —

pete buttigieg

— not known for progressive social outlooks on politics. And here I am, rocking up, 29 years old saying, trust me, support me. Never mind this state legislator who has earned tons of credibility in this community. Never mind this county councilman who’s the party favorite. Go with me instead. If there had been anything that looked like a skeleton or a vulnerability, I think it probably would have sunk me before I got anywhere at all.

michael barbaro

So I want to now move into this notion of you reconciling these things.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, so when I first joined the Reserve, the message was kind of you’re pretty much going to go to one of these wars, and we’ll let you know which one. And so I knew that, at a certain point, it was coming. And of course, I didn’t want to take office in South Bend without a plan for this. So we had gamed it out with my team, if I get orders, here’s what you do. And when I received my orders and knew I was going for sure, I don’t think even then it occurred to me that it would have much to do with my sexuality. If anything, I was thankful that I was single, right? The hardest thing for people to deploy is the fact that you’re leaving behind somebody you love, in addition to all the professional complications. But then, the more I started getting mentally ready for going over and really thinking about what it meant, the more it started weighing on me that I didn’t have a — wasn’t coming back to a family, my parents, of course, but I wasn’t coming back to a household. And more than that, I had no idea what it was like to be in love. And the idea that I’m — here I am. I’m a grown-ass man. I own a home. I’m the mayor of my city. I’m a military officer. And if I get killed over there, I will go to my grave not knowing what it’s like to be in love. And that just made me realize how untenable the situation I was in really was. And up until then, it didn’t seem untenable, I guess because I was so busy, and I might have deferred coming out and having a dating life forever, if not for this moment where I’m thinking, shit, I could die.

michael barbaro

You wrote a letter I want to ask you about.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, you know, it’s a thing you do. I assume everybody does it. I don’t know. But it’s the thing you do when you go to war, right? You want to make sure that you have the last word on your life and leave a few instructions. So I wrote up a letter, put an envelope, put just in case on the outside. Put it in the desk drawer, would’ve been pretty easy to find if worse comes to worst. And that’s a real moment, too, because you’re sitting there staring at the screen trying to figure out how to give a short accounting of your life.

michael barbaro

And what did you say?

pete buttigieg

Well, what I said was that I wouldn’t want people to think that I’d been cheated, that obviously it’d be terrible if I didn’t come back, but I also had this amazing life where I have wonderful friendships, and I got to serve my community in a way that very few people get to do, let alone at my age, and that I’d had this very fulfilling life. And of course, it’d be too bad if something happened to me, but to keep that in perspective. But if you’re asking if there was, like, P.S. I’m gay, no.

michael barbaro

That’s kind of what I was asking. So you are deployed.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

You do not die.

pete buttigieg

Right.

michael barbaro

You come back, and you’re mayor.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

And how do you decide that it’s time to come out?

pete buttigieg

Well, I think by the time I hit the ground and I was back, I knew that I was going to come out and then it’s just — it was more how and when. I remember resenting the idea that you’re supposed to have to come out, right? Straight people don’t have to come out. Why do I? And then, while I’m in the process of figuring this out —

archived recording Thank you all for coming. It’s been a tough week here in the Hoosier state, but we’re going to move forward.

pete buttigieg

We have this explosive controversy over Mike Pence, the Governor Mike Pence and his so-called Religious Freedom bill.

archived recording The Religious Freedom Restoration Act was about religious liberty, not about discrimination.

pete buttigieg

So suddenly, we’re on national television, my state, as the most officially anti-gay state in the country. I’m fighting him on it, of course, because it’s a terrible policy. But now, I’m fighting this terrible, anti-gay policy putatively from the perspective of a straight ally, wondering whether I’m more effective because people don’t know that I’m gay. And at the same time, knowing that this just kind of speeds things up even more that, like, it’s just a really weird position to be in, to be having all these hypothetical arguments about discrimination against gay people, when it really means me. Meanwhile, this is also the period when we realize that soon the Supreme Court is going to weigh in on marriage. I mean, all of this was happening in that early part of 2015 while I’m wrestling with how to do this. And so oddly enough, it was — — as busy as I was as mayor. Military duty actually felt like, kind of almost like a break because it was eight hour days, 40 hour week. I wasn’t used to having that much time, and so is a lot of time to sit and write and think and call friends and get advice.

michael barbaro

So you produce a plan.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, well I produced a letter, an op-ed I guess.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. What was the essential line that I’m sure you remember that you wrote?

pete buttigieg

I remember saying that it’s just part of who I am and that it has no bearing on how I do my job, that the way I do my — did my job either as an officer or as a mayor or in business had nothing to do with the fact that I was gay and that —

michael barbaro

It still sounds a little defensive.

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Or maybe a little scared.

pete buttigieg

Probably. Yeah, I mean, you know, I didn’t feel like I was coming out guns blazing. I felt like I — again, part of me was bothered that I had to share this at all. Then part of me knew that it would do some good if I did, I mean, not just in my own life. That I — my main agenda was, personally, I wanted to get out there and start dating. But also that it would mean something, might mean all kinds of things to a whole bunch of different people when I came out and said this.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

archived recording A very personal announcement coming from South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg today. In an essay published in today’s South Bend Tribune, the mayor announced he is gay. Currently in the midst of running for a second term, Pete Buttigieg penned an essay in Tuesday’s South Bend Tribune revealing he was gay. A lot of people wondering why he chose to make this announcement now. It comes just months after the state’s religious freedom law thrust the state into the national debate on gay rights. As for the mayor himself, he says nothing is different, nothing has changed, and his focus is on South Bend.

michael barbaro

I want to talk about the timing, the exact moment of the op-ed because my sense is that at this phase of your career, you’re up for re-election, right? You’ve won the primary. And winning the primary, in a sense, means you’re standing a very good shot of winning.

pete buttigieg

Depending on the year, but yeah, in South Bend, it should be.

michael barbaro

So does that mean you deliberately chose a — like, a safe, low-risk time to do this?

pete buttigieg

I don’t know. I would think that going into a Democratic primary would be a safer time than going into a general election. And I think also the decision to do this came by way of realizing that there is no such thing as a safe time. I was just done with not having the kind of personal life that I wanted to have.

michael barbaro

So once you come out, how does your personal life change?

pete buttigieg

Well, I started dating, and that kind of changes everything. I mean, I still had this very demanding job. You’re the mayor, and so anybody in town that you ask to have a cup of coffee is —

michael barbaro

It’s a thing.

pete buttigieg

Yeah, it’s a thing. It might be misinterpreted. You could cross some line without meaning to. I mean, most of the people I interacted with were either people who needed something from me, people I needed something from or people who worked for me. So it’s not, like, a very healthy pool for dating is what I’m saying. And I remember thinking there were all these kind of city fathers who, early on in my time as mayor, seemed determined to fix me up with their daughters. And I remember just thinking, like, where are you now? Did none of you have, like, a son or a nephew or something? So I did what millennials do. I went online. Turns out there’s apps for all of this. There was O.K. Cupid, Tinder. The one that actually came through for me was called Hinge. And it’s supposed to serve up people that — I don’t know how the algorithm works. But I find this guy, this cute guy with a big smile, and I’m like, I want to know this guy. So we start chatting. Well, I was chatting with a lot of people, but obviously, he’s the one I remember because that was Chasten.

michael barbaro

Your future husband.

pete buttigieg

Yes.

michael barbaro

So your story, to many people, is particularly compelling one, everything we just discussed. You are a Harvard graduate, a Rhodes Scholar, you’re a veteran. You’re gay. You’re religious. And from your own description of yourself, it feels like you have been thinking about politics and preparing, to some degree, to run for president for a very long time, even though you’re quite young. And I’m sure you understand this and have heard this. That has led to this perception of a person kind of, perhaps, orchestrating a political biography. Do you ever question whether that, no matter what your intention, is — could possibly undermine the power of the story itself, however genuine?

pete buttigieg

Yeah, I mean, I think we’re conditioned to not like the idea of somebody who sat around thinking all their lives about how to become president. And I don’t view myself that way, although I get that that story has been written around me. Although, I also don’t know what it is we expect, that somebody kind of gets struck by lightning and then they turn into somebody who might become president. We all have these paths, right, that bring us to where we are. And I think anybody in professional life or even social life thinks about the story that you tell about yourself. At the end of the day, I’m not doing this because I have this personal need to be in elected office or to be the president. I’m not coming at the presidency as a thing that I’d like to occupy. I’m coming at it as this way to do something that I think I’m able to do. And I think it’s helpful in the sense that I could also have a very happy life doing something else. And oddly, I think that — that helps prepare me to do what’s required to do this. And this is advice I give talking to students, too. Imagine somebody is being sworn in, an ambitious, talented person kind of in the middle of their career is being sworn in as an assistant secretary in the State Department for the Middle East. And then imagine if that person has got there one of two ways. In kind of universe A, it’s a person who woke up one day in high school and said, I want to be the assistant secretary for the Middle East, and took the right courses and got the right jobs and had the right fellowships and wrote the right papers and did everything in order to occupy that title. And the other person is somebody who said, I — woke up in high school and said, I want to be the person who makes the United States a force toward peace in the Middle East. And they don’t know what that’s going to mean, and maybe it means they start out becoming an activist or maybe they’re an academic or maybe they’re a civil servant or whatever. But by whatever winding path, they wind up in this job, right? Which of those two scenarios is going to lead to somebody who’s better equipped to take that job they’ve been handed? I’ve got to think it’s the latter. And so what I’ve tried to do in my life is to prepare myself to be useful to others. And yes, I think that, in all likelihood, means in a form that involves holding office or seeking office or at least public life where I speak to lots of people, sometimes millions at the same time. But it’s not about, necessarily, having one title or another. And so I think if you overthink it, that’s where you start to lose the fidelity to what it is that would guide you when you actually get what you’ve been chasing for a long time. Jeremy, what do we learn from Mayor Pete Buttigieg about the way he reconciled his political ambition with this essential fact about himself that he feared would endanger that ambition?

jeremy peters

I think we learn a lot about his decision-making process, not just how he internalizes decisions personally, but how he thinks about them in the longer arc of a political career. And he’s been very intentional all along the way about choosing certain endeavors that he thinks would benefit a long-term political career. Now some people would think, on the one hand, that’s too calculating. I don’t want somebody who’s thought about being president since he was a teenager. And, you know, in the era when voters seemed to prize authenticity in their political figures, they could see that as inauthentic. On the other hand, the decision that he made to wait seems to have borne out to his benefit. I mean, here he is, the first openly gay candidate for president of the United States who has a legitimate shot at being his party’s nominee. Look at where he is in the Democratic primary right now. He’s rocketed to the top of the polls. He’s brought in all this money in large part because he’s gay, and that opened a lot of doors with Democratic donors. He’s heading into the Iowa caucuses in the lead by some measures. But we won’t know if his decision to wait actually was the right one until people start voting. So it seems to have worked out well for him right now, but no one’s cast a single vote. And we don’t know how voters in the Democratic primary are going to react. We certainly don’t know how voters in a general election are going to react. So we’re just not going to know until Democratic voters have their say.

michael barbaro

Mayor, when you think back to your younger self —

pete buttigieg

Yeah.

michael barbaro

Not just your teenage self, but even your college self and your post-collegiate self who was so fearful about telling the world that you were gay, what do you kind of wish you could tell that person, that version of Mayor Buttigieg?

pete buttigieg

Well, back then, I would have thought this other fact, if I dared to unpack it, this fact about my life, this way in which I was different, was the thing that could multiply all the other stuff by zero, in terms of the impact I was going to have in the world, that I might very well choose that path, but that the price would be that I wouldn’t get to make a difference in public life. And if you want proof of God having a sense of humor, one of the things I’m seeing now, especially in the interactions I have on the campaign trail and the fact that this campaign is historic in a lot of ways, is that that same fact that I thought would mean never getting to this point might actually be one of the things that makes it matter the most.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

pete buttigieg

It’s a strange thing to think about that the one thing that I couldn’t control, the one thing that might have meant that it would be better not to have any aspirations related to politics at all could be the very thing that anchors the moral and emotional purpose of this entire campaign.

In the latest public testimony before impeachment investigators, Fiona Hill, the former top Russia expert on the National Security Council, recalled her growing frustration with Ambassador Gordon Sondland, as she realized he was pursuing a political agenda in Ukraine on behalf of President Trump.

archived recording (fiona hill) He was being involved in a domestic, political errand, and we were being involved in national security foreign policy and those two things have just diverged.

michael barbaro

Hill testified that when Trump and Sondland pressed Ukraine to investigate the discredited theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, they were playing directly into Russia’s hands, since Russia wants to deflect attention away from its interference.

Though Mr. Trump insisted Mr. Holmes’s account was wrong, Mr. Sondland said Wednesday in congressional testimony that he had “no reason” to doubt it, though he could not recall precise details of their conversation.

“It’s true that the president speaks loudly at times, and it’s also true — I think we primarily discussed ASAP Rocky,” Mr. Sondland said, referring to the American rapper who was charged with assault in Sweden around that time.

“Actually, actually, I would have been more surprised if President Trump had not mentioned investigations, particularly given what we were hearing from Mr. Giuliani about the president’s concerns,” he said, referring to Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer. “However, I have no recollection of discussing Vice President Biden or his son on that call or after the call ended.”

What Was Said

“This was an Obama person. Wouldn’t — didn’t want to hang my picture in the embassy.”

This lacks evidence. The president was referring to Marie L. Yovanovitch, a career diplomat who served as the United States ambassador to Ukraine until he recalled her this spring. She had come under intense criticism from allies of Mr. Trump, including Mr. Giuliani and Donald Trump Jr., who helped spread accusations that Ms. Yovanovitch was insufficiently loyal to the president. She has become a witness in the impeachment inquiry.

Mr. Trump’s remark about his portrait may have been drawn from an exchange between Representative Lee M. Zeldin, Republican of New York, and Mr. Holmes during closed congressional testimony last week."

That was sort of interesting — in part because it was one of the relatively few times Nunes managed to complete a sentence without crying, “Identify the whistle-blower!” or “Hunter Biden!”

Also because Volker actually said the nickname made him “cringe.” He believes “three amigos” should only refer to the glorious bipartisan Senate trio of John McCain, Joseph Lieberman and Lindsey Graham. Now, of course, McCain has passed away, Lieberman is a lobbyist for a Chinese telecom company and Graham is Donald Trump’s lap puppy. So the cringy thing really could make sense.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: In the phone call at the center of the impeachment inquiry, President Trump asked Ukraine for two different investigations. Scott Shane on the unexpected story behind one of them. It’s Tuesday, November 26.

archived recording We are joined right now — it is our great pleasure to welcome the president of the United States, Donald Trump, calling in. Mr. Trump, good morning to you. archived recording (donald trump) Good morning. archived recording Good to have you on “Fox & Friends” today. As you —

scott shane

So on Friday, President Trump called in to “Fox & Friends,” one of his favorite shows on Fox News, and what ensued was, really, a 53-minute stream of consciousness.

archived recording (donald trump) This was spying on my campaign, something that has never been done in the history of our country. They thought I was going to win, and they said, how could we stop him? You know, a lot of people say, deep state. I don’t like to use the word deep state. I just say they’re really bad, sick people. archived recording Mr. President, you said —

scott shane

And one of the things he talked about was a theory that’s really at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.

archived recording (donald trump) It’s very interesting, they have the server, right, from the D.N.C., Democratic National Committee. archived recording Who has the server? archived recording (donald trump) The F.B.I. went in, and they told him, get out of here. You’re not getting it. We’re not giving it to you. They gave the server to CrowdStrike or whatever it’s called, which is a company owned by a very wealthy Ukrainian.

scott shane

And it was the same theory that he brought up with the president of Ukraine, President Zelensky, in this famous phone call on July 25. The theory, the false theory, is that Ukraine, and not Russia, was responsible for the hacking of the 2016 election, and that Ukraine was assisted in this by a company called CrowdStrike.

michael barbaro

Scott, what would make the president believe this theory and mention this company by name?

scott shane

Well, let’s start with the undisputed facts. Back in the spring of 2016, of course it was the middle of the presidential race, and the Democratic National Committee discovers that its computers have been hacked. So they call their cybersecurity contractor, CrowdStrike. And CrowdStrike is a California company that was co-founded by a fellow who immigrated as a child from Russia, and, really, one of the top cybersecurity companies out there. And the Democratic National Committee asked them to come to Washington and examine these computers and basically do what any cybersecurity company does, which is kick out the hackers, kind of clean up the computer servers, and make sure the organization can keep functioning. So essentially, CrowdStrike and the D.N.C. report this to the F.B.I. Hacking is, of course, a crime, so the F.B.I. begins its own investigation. And CrowdStrike is in communication the whole time with the F.B.I. And so they’re essentially working alongside each other and zeroing in, in part, on who did it by looking at, essentially, the fingerprints of the burglars who broke into the computer system, the sort of telltale signs that particular hacking groups leave behind. And all those telltale signs were pointing to Russia, and, in particular, to hackers who work for the Russian government. And they did it, American intelligence agencies conclude, to assist Donald Trump and especially to damage Hillary Clinton in this presidential race.

michael barbaro

So where does this Trump theory that he talks about on Fox News, that becomes part of impeachment inquiry, where does that intersect with the story that you just laid out, the undisputed fact story?

scott shane

Well, President Trump takes the players that exist in real life, but in each case sort of distorts the facts. And the main purpose of the distortions seems to be to bring Ukraine in at each point. So he says that CrowdStrike, this California company, is Ukrainian, owned by a rich Ukrainian. Not true. He says the F.B.I. dropped the ball on this investigation and turned everything over to CrowdStrike and let them essentially take over. Not true. And he says that as a result of CrowdStrike taking over, because he thinks CrowdStrike is a Ukrainian company, the server, the D.N.C. server that he’s very focused on, has somehow ended up in Ukraine. It’s hidden in Ukraine. So the gist of what he’s saying to the American public is, you can’t believe what the F.B.I. told you about the hacking of the 2016 election. In fact, the F.B.I. messed up this investigation, and all signs point not to Russia, but to Ukraine.

michael barbaro

So this is a pretty unified theory that CrowdStrike is Ukrainian, CrowdStrike gets the computer servers, CrowdStrike places them in Ukraine. But none of it is true.

scott shane

Exactly.

michael barbaro

Why does Trump want Ukraine to be involved and not Russia?

scott shane

So Trump first mentioned this false theory about Ukraine and CrowdStrike back in April of 2017. It was in the middle of an interview with the Associated Press. It was the early months of his presidency. And I think in some ways he was still smarting from the implication that he had had Russian help and that maybe his victory was not legitimate. And I think he’s very worried about that. You see lots of signs of his concern about that. So if he can somehow disprove or divert attention from the notion that Russia helped him win, he’s psychologically and politically a lot better off. And Ukraine is sort of the perfect fall guy in this story. Russia and Ukraine are at war, and Ukraine, while I don’t think it’s fair to say that Ukraine interfered in the election, it is true that a few Ukrainian officials criticized Trump on the campaign trail, things that he was saying, and in some cases, praised Hillary Clinton. So if he can shift the blame from Russia to Ukraine, he can essentially burnish his victory and remove this cloud over his presidency and make the claim that his victory is all the greater, because not only did no foreign actor help him, but he had to overcome interference by these hostile Ukrainians, who, as he put it once, “tried to take me down.”

michael barbaro

So in this theory, which, as you just said, is not true, but in this theory, he’s not the beneficiary of an election surreptitiously aided by Russia. He is the victor over an obstacle course laid out by Ukraine?

scott shane

Exactly. So it wasn’t until this same false theory about CrowdStrike in Ukraine turned up in the White House reconstruction of his July call to the president of Ukraine that everybody began focusing on it. So everybody asked, why did Trump come to believe that Ukraine and not Russia was somehow involved in the hacking? And where did this bogus theory come from? But I couldn’t find the origin of that story. And so it remained a little bit of a mystery. And then new evidence came to light. And it turned out that its origin was even more nefarious than we had imagined. [MUSIC]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So Scott, what have you found out about where this theory actually came from?

scott shane

So Trump’s false theory came, it turns out, not from some wacky website or from Twitter. It may have actually originated with the Russians.

michael barbaro

Wow. How would that have worked?

scott shane

So we learned this new information from F.B.I. documents obtained by BuzzFeed, the news organization, under the Freedom of Information Act. And it turns out that Trump heard from his campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, that Ukraine and not Russia might be responsible for the hacking. And Manafort, apparently, according to these new F.B.I. documents, heard this from Konstantin Kilimnik, who was an associate of his, who was a dual Russian-Ukrainian national with very close ties to Russian intelligence.

michael barbaro

So a man with ties to Russian intelligence who works closely with Paul Manafort, Donald Trump’s campaign manager in 2016, gives the information to Manafort, and, our understanding goes, Manafort would have then passed that on to Trump. And if what we know about Russia and the way it handles information is true, this would have potentially been a deliberate misinformation campaign?

scott shane

That’s right, because it was certainly in Russia’s interest to shift the blame for interference in the 2016 election away from its intelligence agencies — to anywhere, but to its enemy, Ukraine, that’s all the better.

michael barbaro

And why would Manafort believe this man who’s telling him that it’s Ukraine, not Russia, behind this meddling?

scott shane

Well, Manafort, folks might remember, was a longtime political operative in Ukraine, but he was working Ukraine on behalf of a pro-Russia political party. So his political sympathies were on the Russian side. So in that sense, it would make sense for him to try to turn the Ukrainians into a scapegoat for Russia’s hacking.

michael barbaro

So everyone in this chain of information has some motivation to support this theory. The Russians, of course — they want to distract from what they’ve just done. This man who gives it to Manafort, because he works with the Russians. Manafort, because he works for Ukrainian businesspeople who support Russia, and, finally, Donald Trump, who wants anyone other than the Russians to be responsible for this.

scott shane

Exactly. I think we don’t know whether any of these parties actually believes any of this stuff in their heart of hearts. But it’s certainly in their political interest to pass it along.

michael barbaro

Scott, were you surprised that two years after President Trump first publicly raises this theory about Ukraine, he brings it up in a phone call with a foreign leader, despite all of the evidence that it wasn’t true?

scott shane

Yes, I was, because there had been a very important development.

archived recording (rod rosenstein) Good afternoon. Today, a grand jury in the District of Columbia returned an indictment presented by the special counsel’s office. The indictment charges 12 Russian military officers by name for conspiring to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.

scott shane

And that was the indictment by Robert Mueller’s investigators of a number of Russian military intelligence officers.

archived recording (rod rosenstein) The defendants worked for two units of the main intelligence directorate of the Russian general staff.

scott shane

And this indictment was exquisitely detailed, down to the point of, like, what they googled before they carried out the hacking.

archived recording (rod rosenstein) First, they used a scheme known as spear phishing, which involves sending misleading email messages and tricking the users into disclosing their passwords and security information.

scott shane

And it had their names, it had their ranks, it had their locations.

archived recording (rod rosenstein) And we need to keep moving forward to preserve our values, protect against future interference, and defend America.

scott shane

So it seemed to remove all doubts about the role not only of Russians, but of specific Russian intelligence officers and the Russian state in carrying out that operation. And nevertheless, here the president was, once again reviving the notion that somehow Ukraine had carried out the hack, and presenting this theory of his not just to anyone, but to the president of Ukraine, and essentially trying to pressure the president of Ukraine into launching an investigation into this completely baseless theory.

michael barbaro

So of course, this pressure that the president puts on Ukraine’s president becomes central to the impeachment inquiry. So how has this theory factored into and been talked about in the public hearings of the impeachment inquiry?

archived recording (adam schiff) Today, we are joined by Dr. Fiona Hill and David Holmes.

scott shane

So there was really a standoff between the diplomatic professionals and the real experts on Russia and Ukraine and the Republicans on the committee.

archived recording (fiona hill) Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Nunes, and members of the committee, thank you for inviting me to testify before you today. I have a short opening statement. Based on questions and statements I’ve heard, some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country, and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did.

scott shane

The professionals, in particular Fiona Hill, the former top Russia expert on the National Security Council —

archived recording (fiona hill) This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.

scott shane

— were emphatic that there was absolutely no truth to the idea that Ukraine was somehow responsible for the hack.

archived recording (adam schiff) [GAVEL BANG] Committee will turn to order. Mr. Jordan, you’re recognized for five minutes. archived recording (jim jordan) Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ambassador, thank you for being here —

scott shane

But the Republicans on the committee, while not entirely embracing Trump’s theory, kept trying to open the door to it.

archived recording (jim jordan) Ambassador, should ambassadors ever try to influence host country elections? archived recording (fiona hill) No.

scott shane

Representative Jim Jordan, one of the most aggressive defenders of the president, said, well —

archived recording (jim jordan) But that’s exactly what happened in 2016. In August of 2016, the very month you went to Ukraine as our ambassador, the Ukrainian ambassador here in the United States, Ambassador Chaly, wrote an op-ed in The Hill, said this, “Trump’s comments send wrong message.”

scott shane

Wasn’t it true that there were some Ukrainian politicians who had criticized Trump? In other words, isn’t it possible that some Ukrainians were trying to, as the president said, take him down?

archived recording (jim jordan) You see why maybe, maybe the president was a little concerned about what went on in Ukraine?

scott shane

They weren’t completely embracing his theory, but they were bolstering it as well as they could.

archived recording (chris wallace) Louisiana Senator John Kennedy, a Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Senator, welcome back to Fox News Sunday. archived recording (john kennedy) Thank you, Chris.

scott shane

And this has actually continued after the last testimony at the hearings. You had Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana, who, when pressed by Chris Wallace of Fox News —

archived recording (chris wallace) Senator Kennedy, who do you believe was responsible for hacking the D.N.C. and Clinton campaign computers, their emails? Was it Russia or Ukraine? archived recording (john kennedy) I don’t know, nor do you, nor do any of us.

scott shane

— said, well, I don’t know, and you don’t know.

archived recording (chris wallace) Let me just interrupt to say, the entire intelligence community says it was Russia. archived recording (john kennedy) Right, but it could also be Ukraine. I’m not saying that I know one way or the other. I’m saying that Ms. Hill is entitled to her opinion. But no rebuttal evidence was allowed to be offered.

scott shane

He continued to insist that it’s all a little bit fuzzy, it’s a little murky, we don’t really know.

archived recording (john kennedy) We don’t know if Ukraine did that. We don’t know to what extent, because they won’t let the president offer his evidence. And that’s —

scott shane

In other words, we’ve left behind the crystal clarity of the Mueller indictment last year that said exactly who was responsible for the hacking, and we’ve entered this sort of twilight zone, where we don’t really know what’s true and what’s untrue. And that sort of is a license for President Trump to say whatever he wants.

michael barbaro

Scott, what have we learned from the journey of this conspiracy theory? And just how many people seem to be willing to tolerate it?

scott shane

Well, I mean, first of all, this conspiracy theory concerns something of really the utmost importance, which is the biggest interference by a foreign power in American democracy in history. And so it would seem very important that we get the facts straight and keep them straight. But what we’ve learned from the durability of this conspiracy theory is that when false beliefs arise and linger, not on the fringes of the internet but right inside the Oval Office, and you have the president of the United States repeatedly stating them from the biggest bully pulpit in the world, it becomes a sort of force field that warps everything around it. And the politics of the impeachment are such that Trump’s Republican allies see their own political futures as very much tied to his, so they can’t confront him and say, Mr. President, what you’re saying is not true. So this false conspiracy theory lingers. And the president keeps talking about it. [MUSIC]

michael barbaro

Scott, thank you very much.

scott shane

Thank you, Michael.

archived recording (john kennedy) The only evidence I have, and I think it’s overwhelming, is that it was Russia who tried to hack the D.N.C. computer. I’ve seen no indication that Ukraine tried to do it.

michael barbaro

On Monday night, during an interview on CNN, Republican Senator John Kennedy backtracked on his comments about Ukraine, saying he was wrong to suggest that Ukraine might have hacked the D.N.C. servers.

archived recording (chris cuomo) Let me stop you for a second. You just did something we’ve never heard this president do, which was say, hey, I know I said that. I was wrong. So good, let’s check a big honking box. You don’t think Ukraine was the one to look at the server. Then why do you think the president keeps saying something that he also knows is not true?

michael barbaro

But Kennedy insisted, without evidence, that Ukraine tried to interfere in the 2016 election.

archived recording (john kennedy) Well, here’s why. There is a lot of evidence, proven and unproven, everybody’s got an opinion, that Ukraine did try to interfere, along with Russia and probably others in the 2016 election. archived recording (chris cuomo) What evidence? archived recording (john kennedy) In January —

Now, Mr. Biden’s campaign is racing to improve his standing in the state — hosting several campaign events with the Vilsacks over the weekend, and planning an eight-day swing by bus through the state after Thanksgiving and a return later in December.

Mr. Biden’s team argues that his presence in the state is comparable to that of his rivals: The campaign claims 26 offices across the state, more than 100 staff members, and it plans to continue adding staff and resources. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s campaign claims more than 20 offices, and Mr. Buttigieg’s has 29 with more to come; both cite roughly the same number of paid staffers as Mr. Biden.

Mr. Biden’s bus tour is expected to include both town hall-style events and activities with volunteers and precinct captains, like visits to phone banks and perhaps some door knocking. The counties he will visit , many of them largely rural , are home to working-class voters who often connect with Mr. Biden, and Mr. Biden will need to overperform in those areas on Feb. 3. The campaign is also closely focused on ensuring Mr. Biden hits the threshold for accruing delegates across the state.

“We need to candidly be able to keep pace, we feel like we’re going to be able to do that,” Pete Kavanaugh, Mr. Biden’s deputy campaign manager, said. “You can tell where campaigns are focusing based on where their candidates are. And, you know, we’re going to have a pretty heavy schedule here in December, starting with the bus tour and heading into January and February.”

Mr. Biden’s team argues that the former vice president, who is stronger in later-voting and more diverse states, has been trying hard to prevail in Iowa but also sees multiple paths to the nomination. Still, some advisers and allies are aware that a poor showing in Iowa could be crushing to a campaign that is premised on the notion that Mr. Biden is the most electable candidate against President Trump. Because New Hampshire, which follows Iowa in the primary calendar, historically favors candidates from neighboring states, the pressure is on here."

Conversely, believing him, a compulsive liar, happens by default.

For instance, poll results published last month by Monmouth University found that 67 percent of self-identified Republicans and Republican-leaning voters believe Trump’s baseless claim that Joe Biden probably did pressure Ukrainian officials to keep them from investigating his son’s business interests there, while just 16 percent said Trump made promises or put pressure on Ukraine’s president to investigate Biden, even though Trump had already admitted it and the partial transcript confirms it.

This is both confounding and frightening. How is a democracy supposed to survive when this many people deny a basic common set of facts? How does one engage in political debate with someone lost in a world of lies?

And of course, this is just as Trump wants it. He has spent his entire life bending the truth and flat-out lying. It was one thing when he did it as a private citizen, to puff up his chest and inflate his wealth. There were no real consequences for the country in the telling of those lies.

But now he has brought his “lie loudly” tactic to the White House, and he has realized that there is a section of America hungry for a show, willing to believe anything the carnival barker says and be thoroughly entertained by it.

Trump realized something that few people are willing to acknowledge: That politics is theater first. It is about appearance and performance to a disturbing degree. People want a story, a vision, a fascinating protagonist. Politics loves a star.

The derisive cliché, “Washington is Hollywood for ugly people,” coined by Democratic strategist Paul Begala, has lasted so long because there is a grain of truth in it. It’s simply another version of Hollywood, where great tales are packaged and sold, where great actors teach people to believe in ephemera."

Critics of his behavior are part of a corrupt, shadowy effort aiming to damage him.

And, as he likes to put it, his own actions are always, to one degree or another, “perfect.”

That approach — which proved effective when Mr. Trump faced off against the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III — is about to face a formidable test as the impeachment process moves forward.

The White House and congressional Republicans allied with Mr. Trump are preparing for a Senate trial in which they will not only declare Mr. Trump’s innocence but also present a version of events that portray him as the victim of a broad plot to undermine his presidency even before it began.

That narrative will include claims that Ukrainians meddled in the 2016 election instead of the Russians — an unfounded allegation refuted by the administration’s own intelligence agencies as recently as this week — and that Hunter Biden, the younger son of Vice President Joseph R.

Let’s get right to it.

A surprisingly subdued debate

There weren’t a lot of sparks in this week’s debate, the fifth of the Democratic primary. But in the absence of a clear front-runner, several lower-polling candidates were able to break through — at least for one news cycle.

Senators Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey all had strong nights. So did Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who did not face nearly as many attacks as expected in his first appearance since he shot to the top of the field in Iowa.

Good news and bad news for Buttigieg

Mr. Buttigieg has had a remarkable rise in Iowa, rocketing from 9 percent (fourth place) in a CNN/Des Moines Register poll in September to 25 percent (first place) in one released last weekend. Between that and a Monmouth University poll four days earlier also showing him in first place, it is clear that Mr. Buttigieg has become a serious contender there."

The military aid to Ukraine was withheld in July and released on Sept. 11, but neither Mr. Trump nor his aides have specified what corruption improvements had been made in Kyiv in those two months.

What Was Said

“How about the guy with the telephone? How about that one? I guarantee you that never took place.”

This is disputed. David Holmes, the political counselor at the United States Embassy in Ukraine, testified on Thursday that he had overheard a cellphone call between Mr. Trump and Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, in July. During the call, Mr. Holmes said, Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Sondland about Ukrainian investigations into his political rivals. Mr. Holmes testified that he provided an account of the call to his boss immediately afterward and also informed other colleagues at the embassy in Kyiv.

Though Mr. Trump insisted Mr. Holmes’s account was wrong, Mr. Sondland said Wednesday in congressional testimony that he had “no reason” to doubt it, though he could not recall precise details of their conversation.

“It’s true that the president speaks loudly at times, and it’s also true — I think we primarily discussed ASAP Rocky,” Mr. Sondland said, referring to the American rapper who was charged with assault in Sweden around that time.

“Actually, actually, I would have been more surprised if President Trump had not mentioned investigations, particularly given what we were hearing from Mr. Giuliani about the president’s concerns,” he said, referring to Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer. “However, I have no recollection of discussing Vice President Biden or his son on that call or after the call ended.”

What Was Said

“This was an Obama person. Wouldn’t — didn’t want to hang my picture in the embassy.”

This lacks evidence. The president was referring to Marie L. Yovanovitch, a career diplomat who served as the United States ambassador to Ukraine until he recalled her this spring. She had come under intense criticism from allies of Mr. Trump, including Mr. Giuliani and Donald Trump Jr., who helped spread accusations that Ms. Yovanovitch was insufficiently loyal to the president. She has become a witness in the impeachment inquiry.

Mr. Trump’s remark about his portrait may have been drawn from an exchange between Representative Lee M. Zeldin, Republican of New York, and Mr. Holmes during closed congressional testimony last week."

Mr. Bloomberg’s message, at the start, is leaning heavily into his biography as a business executive and as the mayor of New York City starting in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. His advisers acknowledge that he is far less known to voters than the leading Democratic candidates. His debut television commercial stressed his credentials as a self-made executive — “a middle-class kid who made good” — and his political advocacy on core Democratic concerns like gun control and climate change, as well as on economic development and public health issues like smoking. Those issues, his advisers say, will all be central to his candidacy.

While Mr. Bloomberg is a political moderate, his opening message also borrowed in some respects from the anti-Washington rhetoric of the Democratic Party’s populist wing, led by progressives like Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. “I know how to take on the powerful special interests that corrupt Washington,” Mr. Bloomberg said in his statement on Sunday. “And I know how to win.”

Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island, who helms the Democratic Governors Association, said she had spoken recently with Mr. Bloomberg and saw him as a strong candidate despite the late hour. Ms. Raimondo said the former mayor recognized he faced “long odds” in the primary, but she suggested Mr. Bloomberg could be well positioned in a general election to take on Mr. Trump’s perceived credentials as a businessman.

“Trump’s a fraud. He’s a business failure. His economic policies have failed,” Ms. Raimondo said. “He’s bad for America, and I think Bloomberg can go toe-to-toe with him on that score, and he should.”"

But she said Mr. Biden and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who has also proposed a public option, are more appealing to her because they are more realistic about long-term spending.

“They’re great ideals,” Ms. Downing said of the Warren and Sanders’ “Medicare for all” plans, “but I’m just not sure we can pay for it.”

The public option plans offered by Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg would require much less federal spending than Ms. Warren’s $20.5 trillion proposal to provide generous health benefits, at no cost, to all Americans. Mr. Biden has estimated his plan would cost $750 billion over 10 years; Mr. Buttigieg has said his version, which he likes to call “Medicare for all who want it,” would cost $1.5 trillion.

Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg ’s plans would automatically enroll uninsured Americans in the new government health plan and allow anyone else to opt in if they wished. Both candidates would offer more generous premium subsidies than the Affordable Care Act provides and cap people’s premium costs at 8.5 percent of their income. People with premium subsidies would have deductibles of roughly $1,000 or less. Mr. Buttigieg’s plan would go a step further, retroactively enrolling anyone who had remained uninsured but ended up sick.

Although most of the other Democrats who qualified for Wednesday’s debate support the idea of a public option, few have released detailed proposals. Some candidates, like Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Andrew Yang, an entrepreneur, say they hope a public option would lead to “Medicare for all;” others, like Ms. Klobuchar and Tom Steyer, a former hedge fund investor and a billionaire, consider it an end in itself.

The public option that Ms. Warren has proposed as a bridge to her “Medicare for all” plan would go further. It would be free for all children and for households with incomes at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, which is currently about $51,000 for a family of four. For people who earn more, premiums would be capped at 5 percent of income; there would be no deductibles and “modest” out-of-pocket costs. Ms. Warren has not said how much this public option plan would cost the government, but it would be considerably less than “Medicare for all;” during Wednesday’s debate she said it would cover 135 million people — about 40 percent of the population — for free."

Now, Mr. Biden’s campaign is racing to improve his standing in the state — hosting several campaign events with the Vilsacks over the weekend, and planning an eight-day swing by bus through the state after Thanksgiving and a return later in December.

Mr. Biden’s team argues that his presence in the state is comparable to that of his rivals: The campaign claims 26 offices across the state, more than 100 staff members, and it plans to continue adding staff and resources. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s campaign claims more than 20 offices, and Mr. Buttigieg’s has 29 with more to come; both cite roughly the same number of paid staffers as Mr. Biden.

Mr. Biden’s bus tour is expected to include both town hall-style events and activities with volunteers and precinct captains, like visits to phone banks and perhaps some door knocking. The counties he will visit , many of them largely rural , are home to working-class voters who often connect with Mr. Biden, and Mr. Biden will need to overperform in those areas on Feb. 3. The campaign is also closely focused on ensuring Mr. Biden hits the threshold for accruing delegates across the state.

“We need to candidly be able to keep pace, we feel like we’re going to be able to do that,” Pete Kavanaugh, Mr. Biden’s deputy campaign manager, said. “You can tell where campaigns are focusing based on where their candidates are. And, you know, we’re going to have a pretty heavy schedule here in December, starting with the bus tour and heading into January and February.”

Mr. Biden’s team argues that the former vice president, who is stronger in later-voting and more diverse states, has been trying hard to prevail in Iowa but also sees multiple paths to the nomination. Still, some advisers and allies are aware that a poor showing in Iowa could be crushing to a campaign that is premised on the notion that Mr. Biden is the most electable candidate against President Trump. Because New Hampshire, which follows Iowa in the primary calendar, historically favors candidates from neighboring states, the pressure is on here."

The 20-year-old Spelman College student had just attended a “Black Women’s Breakfast” featuring Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate and the second black woman elected to the United States Senate . And speaker after speaker had explicitly argued that black women should support Ms. Harris and leap at the opportunity to elevate someone with their lived experience.

But after the event on Thursday, as Beyoncé’s “Brown Skin Girl” played in the background, Ms. Hester made a sheepish admission: Ms. Harris was not her preferred choice. There were policy reasons — Ms. Harris has not rolled out a proposal on student debt cancellation, which is Ms. Hester’s top issue. But there was also something else. Even at the historically black all-women’s college that Ms. Hester attends, supporting Ms. Harris was a particularly uncool thing to do.

“It’s hard, you know. On social media, there’s a different meme about her every day,” Ms. Hester said. “A lot of young people don’t support her.”

“Why aren’t black voters supporting the black presidential candidates?” is an overly simplistic question. Like all voting blocs, black voters have diverse priorities that crisscross the ideological spectrum, creating fault lines across regions, generations and economic class.

This is both confounding and frightening. How is a democracy supposed to survive when this many people deny a basic common set of facts? How does one engage in political debate with someone lost in a world of lies?

And of course, this is just as Trump wants it. He has spent his entire life bending the truth and flat-out lying. It was one thing when he did it as a private citizen, to puff up his chest and inflate his wealth. There were no real consequences for the country in the telling of those lies.

But now he has brought his “lie loudly” tactic to the White House, and he has realized that there is a section of America hungry for a show, willing to believe anything the carnival barker says and be thoroughly entertained by it.

Trump realized something that few people are willing to acknowledge: That politics is theater first. It is about appearance and performance to a disturbing degree. People want a story, a vision, a fascinating protagonist. Politics loves a star.

The derisive cliché, “Washington is Hollywood for ugly people,” coined by Democratic strategist Paul Begala, has lasted so long because there is a grain of truth in it.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Yesterday, we looked at the origin of President Trump’s theory that Ukraine, not Russia, meddled in the 2016 election — one of the two theories that he asked Ukraine’s president to investigate. Today: Trump’s second theory. It’s Wednesday, November 27.

ken vogel

So when Trump goes on Fox and Friends on Friday for this long stream-of-conscious phone interview, he reiterates his theory — totally debunked theory about the Ukrainians and not the Russians hacking into the D.N.C. servers. And then he also brings up this other theory.

archived recording So, Mr. President, the accusation is this — that you’re using aid, taxpayer dollars, to attack a political opponent in Joe Biden.

ken vogel

And that has to do with Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden, and their work in Ukraine.

michael barbaro

Ken Vogel is a Washington correspondent for The Times.

archived recording (donald trump) And I will tell you this about Joe Biden I never said it specifically on him. But I watched Joe Biden with the prosecutor, who a lot of people said was a great prosecutor, and they took him off. And he was prosecuting that company. And the kid, who never made $0.10 in his life and all of a sudden is making millions of dollars the day he —

michael barbaro

Ken, what exactly is the president’s second theory here about the Bidens?

ken vogel

What Trump alleges is that Joe Biden, during his time as vice president, pressured the Ukrainian government to fire their top prosecutor — essentially their attorney general — because that prosecutor was pursuing an investigation into this energy company in Ukraine that was paying Hunter Biden as a board member, and that the reason why Joe Biden pushed for the firing was to protect Hunter Biden and his employer.

michael barbaro

So the theory is basically that the vice president does a favor for his son in the form of official action in Ukraine.

ken vogel

Correct.

michael barbaro

So where does the story behind that claim begin?

ken vogel

You’ve got to go back to 2014.

archived recording 44-year-old Hunter Biden, Vice President Joe Biden’s youngest son, was discharged from the Navy Reserve.

ken vogel

Hunter Biden, who is a Yale-educated lawyer and had dabbled in various business ventures —

archived recording Biden was given a routine drug test, which he failed.

ken vogel

— had just been discharged from the Navy Reserve after testing positive for cocaine during a drug test.

archived recording “It was the honor of my life to serve in the U.S. Navy, and I deeply regret and am embarrassed that my actions led to my administrative discharge.”

ken vogel

And at this point, he and some partners are starting to explore international opportunities. And one of his partners gets this gig on the board of this Ukrainian gas company that is looking for some Western political connections. And Hunter Biden asks if he can get in on this as well. And he is brought onto the board of this company.

archived recording And a son of the U.S. vise president has joined the board of directors of Ukraine’s largest private gas producer. Hunter Biden was appointed to the board of Burisma Holdings.

ken vogel

This company is called Burisma Holdings. It does primarily natural gas. And it is bringing onto its board a number of folks with big political names in the west. And one of them is Hunter Biden. He is paid as much as $50,000, or even more, in some months, to serve on the board of this company, and, ostensibly, to help it with governance reforms — to introduce Western corporate governance standards into this company.

michael barbaro

And how clear is it, Ken, that the reason why Hunter Biden is coming onto the board is because of his family connection? I mean, is it more or less explicit?

ken vogel

This is definitely the message that everyone in Ukraine and Washington takes away from it, as to why Hunter Biden is brought onto the board. His defenders point out that he had, in fact, served on other boards, including the board of Amtrak, where his dad famously has a lot of connections and clout. But he doesn’t really have much other applicable experience that would suggest that he is otherwise the ideal candidate to serve on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. He doesn’t have any experience in Ukraine or Ukrainian law, or even in energy.

michael barbaro

So what do we need to know about Burisma at this moment, when Hunter Biden arrives on the board?

ken vogel

Burisma has faced allegations of corruption, including many that are embraced by the West and by the State Department, which sees it, in many ways — both the company itself, Burisma, and the oligarch who owns the company as poster children for post-Soviet corruption in Ukraine.

michael barbaro

Hm. Ken, do we know if Hunter Biden understood this when he went on the board?

ken vogel

If he had done any due diligence, you would think that he should have known. There were certainly investigations that were already ongoing both in Ukraine and in the West into the oligarch who owned the company on suspicion of money laundering. And those investigations had support from the United States government. And that is where Joe Biden comes in.

michael barbaro

What do you mean?

archived recording (joe biden) We, the United States, stand with you and all the Ukrainian people.

ken vogel

Well, Joe Biden, at this time, is vice president. And one of his key foreign policy tasks that he takes on at the assignment of President Barack Obama is to help Ukraine stand up to Russian aggression.

archived recording (joe biden) It is not just a foreign policy judgment. It is a personal, it’s an emotional commitment, as well.

ken vogel

And one of the things that is seen as an impediment to Ukraine establishing a stable government is this scourge of corruption that has long plagued it and is seen as limiting its ability to attract international investment and to be a stable government that can mount a response to Russian aggression.

michael barbaro

And when is he given that assignment?

ken vogel

It comes pretty much at about the same time as Hunter Biden is going onto the board of this Ukrainian gas company, in early 2014.

michael barbaro

So that’s kind of complicated.

ken vogel

It is. And it certainly would provide rationale for this Ukrainian gas company and its oligarch owner to want to have a powerful westerner who is seen as having connections to the Obama government, which at this point is pushing Ukraine to clamp down on the very type of corruption that this oligarch and his company is seen as embodying.

michael barbaro

Does anyone raise the question of whether this is not a great idea that Joe Biden is suddenly investigating corruption in Ukraine around the same time that his son is now on the board of a major Ukrainian energy company that is accused of corruption?

ken vogel

Yes. We know that there’s a guy in the State Department by the name of George Kent who had deep experience both in Ukraine and in fighting corruption. He had served as the anti-corruption coordinator in the State Department’s European bureau. And he does raise concerns about Hunter Biden joining the board of Burisma and how Hunter Biden’s position could affect Vice President Biden’s standing as a corruption fighter, or the leader of the U.S. effort to push Ukraine to clamp down on corruption.

michael barbaro

But a decision is made that father and son can simultaneously do these two things.

ken vogel

It actually appears as if the decision was to not make a decision and to not address this. George Kent tried to bring this to the attention of the vice president’s staff and was essentially told that Vice President Biden did not have the bandwidth to address this at a time when he was dealing with other family issues, particularly his son Beau Biden, his other son, struggling with brain cancer.

michael barbaro

So what exactly does Vice President Joe Biden do during this period in his role as the guy in the Obama administration who’s trying to root out corruption in Ukraine? What does it actually look like?

ken vogel

Well, Biden focuses on two areas that are seen in the West as bastions of Ukrainian corruption. One is the energy sector. And the other is the judicial system. The international community has long seen the Ukrainian judicial system, and particularly the prosecutors therein, as one of the key problems that perpetuate Ukrainian corruption. These prosecutors have long been known for using the threat of prosecution to essentially solicit bribes from potential targets of corruption. So they are not only not prosecuting corruption, they are, in fact, participating in their own brand of corruption. This was one of the key things that Joe Biden trained his sights on when he went after Ukrainian corruption.

michael barbaro

Got it. So a company would basically pay off the prosecutor, and the prosecutor, therefore, wouldn’t really prosecute.

ken vogel

Yes. And the guy who was seen as emblematic of this type of corruption is Viktor Shokin. He’s the prosecutor general of Ukraine. It’s essentially like the attorney general of Ukraine. And what makes this complicated, though, is that one of the folks who Shokin is not prosecuting because it is believed he is using the threat of prosecution to solicit bribes from is none other than the oligarch who owns the company Burisma Holdings that is paying Hunter Biden to serve as a board member.

michael barbaro

Ah.

ken vogel

Yeah. And this is why some of the folks in the State Department had flagged this as a potential concern that could undermine Joe Biden’s ability to drive this message and be seen as a credible messenger, when in his own house, under his own roof, there is someone who is working with a potential target of the type of prosecution that Joe Biden is trying to encourage the Ukrainians to pursue.

michael barbaro

So what does Biden ultimately do about Shokin? [APPLAUSE]

archived recording (joe biden) Thank you very much.

ken vogel

Well, Biden privately pressures the then-president of Ukraine to get rid of Shokin. And he actually goes and gives a speech that gets a lot of play before the Ukrainian Parliament —

archived recording (joe biden) But in addition, you also have a battle —

ken vogel

— urging them to clamp down on corruption.

archived recording (joe biden) — against corruption. But it’s not enough to set up a new Anti-Corruption Bureau and establish a special prosecutor fighting corruption. The Office of the General Prosecutor desperately needs reform. The judiciary should be overhauled. The energy sector needs to be competitive, ruled by market principles, not sweetheart deals.

ken vogel

That doesn’t really do the trick. Maybe the Ukrainians are starting to move in this direction, but they don’t actually take the steps necessary to fire Shokin. And what Biden does is, he threatens to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to Ukraine if the then-president doesn’t act to get rid of Shokin.

michael barbaro

So you’re saying that in order for Joe Biden to get rid of this problematic prosecutor, he is threatening to withhold money from Ukraine — which feels like a now-familiar concept.

ken vogel

Yeah, it certainly does have a certain familiar ring to it. But what’s different in what Biden did from what Trump’s team did is that what Biden was doing was actually carrying out the official policy of the United States government, which was to push for this prosecutor’s ouster and to use a combination of diplomatic carrots and sticks in order to achieve that end. And $1 billion in loan guarantees is certainly a rather big carrot or stick, depending on which way you look at it.

ken vogel

But eventually —

archived recording (interpreter) The person who was building the system of corruption in prosecutor’s office cannot reform it. Shokin’s appointment was a mistake.

ken vogel

The then-president does take the steps to get the parliament to officially oust Shokin.

michael barbaro

And what does Shokin’s ouster mean for Burisma — this company that Hunter Biden sits on?

ken vogel

You might think that this would be really bad for Burisma if it is widely regarded as a corrupt company. You’re getting rid of a corrupt prosecutor who could be bought off from bringing prosecutions against targets of corruption — that if you get rid of that guy and bring in someone who is going to be more of an anti-corruption crusader, that the potential targets of corruption prosecutions, like Burisma, might be really in a bad spot. But in fact, it turns out to be a lot more complicated than that.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So Ken, you said that the aftermath of Joe Biden forcing out this prosecutor was more complicated than it seemed for Burisma, this company that employs Biden’s son. So what actually happens?

ken vogel

Well, Burisma actually welcome this new prosecutor and the chance to work with him, because they thought that if this prosecutor subscribed to Western approaches to jurisprudence that they would be able to convince this prosecutor by giving him evidence that, in fact, these allegations against Burisma and its oligarch owner were baseless.

michael barbaro

So you’re saying that Burisma thinks, if we play by normal rules and we have a regular old prosecutor, we can get cleared of these charges because in their minds, they’re not actually corrupt.

ken vogel

Yes. And this is very important to them at the time, because they are trying to expand and pursuing Western investment. And the cloud of these corruption investigations that Shokin had hanging over them was a hindrance to them. So they welcome the chance to have a new prosecutor who they believe they can convince that the allegations against them are off base and should be dropped.

michael barbaro

So what ends up happening to Burisma once this new prosecutor is welcomed in to take a look around?

ken vogel

Well, Burisma sends in a team of very well compensated, very highly regarded American lawyers and PR folks to meet with the new prosecutor. And while the new prosecutor initially takes something of a hard line against Burisma and forces them to pay some back taxes or fines, eventually, after 10 months, the new prosecutor announces that he has fully closed all of the legal proceedings and pending criminal allegations against the oligarch owner of Burisma and his companies. And the new prosecutor announces that the oligarch owner of Burisma is being removed from the wanted list. So the oligarch, who had been in exile, returns to Ukraine.

michael barbaro

So this all ends up pretty well for Burisma — the elimination of this corrupt prosecutor. So should we then assume that Burisma was, perhaps, never corrupt in the first place?

ken vogel

No, I don’t think that we can assume that. In fact, the anti-corruption activists in Ukraine really decried this decision to drop the cases against Burisma and its oligarch owner. So in Ukraine, at least, as well as in some quarters in the State Department, it is not in any way viewed as a clean bill of health for Burisma or its oligarch owner.

michael barbaro

So Ken, I want to summarize everything you just told me and hold it up against President Trump’s theory — the theory that Vice President Biden did what he did as a favor to his son once his son is on the board of Burisma. So in reality, Biden pressures Ukraine to fire somebody who is widely seen as a dirty prosecutor, who seems to be basically holding companies, including Burisma, hostage, and taking bribes in order not to investigate them. And in pushing out that prosecutor, Biden sets in motion a series of events that conclude with an investigation of Burisma coming to an end, even though from everything you’re saying, the company is still seen as corrupt. Do I have all that correct?

ken vogel

Yes.

michael barbaro

So in the end, Biden takes an action that does benefit Burisma, and less directly, his son.

ken vogel

Indirectly, having the new prosecutor does benefit Burisma and its oligarch owner. And Hunter Biden does remain on the board of Burisma until this year. But I think this is where we get into questions of intent. And there is no evidence that it was the intent of Vice President Joe Biden to take this action to benefit Burisma, let alone his son.

michael barbaro

So can we say that this theory that the vice president did what he did in Ukraine to help his son — can we say that it is false?

ken vogel

We can say that there is no evidence that Joe Biden acted corruptly to help his son in Ukraine.

[music]

^ARCHIVED RECORDING (DONALD TRUMP)^” We’re looking for corruption. There’s tremendous corruption. We’re looking for — why should we be giving hundreds of millions of dollars to countries where there’s this kind of corruption? And if you look at my call, I said corruption. I think he said it to me. He’s looking. He got elected on the basis of corruption. And also, by the way —

michael barbaro

I’m struck, Ken, about what we can say definitively here versus what we can say definitively about the president’s first theory about CrowdStrike and Ukraine hacking the D.N.C. servers. That theory draws on fabricated facts and is thoroughly disprovable and has been disproven. The second theory, about the Bidens — it draws on real facts, but there’s no evidence of it. And yet it’s not really disprovable. Does that make sense?

ken vogel

Yeah. It’s a lot more complicated. It’s a lot more nuanced. There are a lot more facts. And there is a fact pattern that did trouble employees in the State Department at the time and then subsequently, as it’s gotten a lot more attention, has troubled ethics experts, who say that the Bidens did not do a good enough job addressing concerns about conflict of interest. Now, all that said, it does not mean that Trump’s theory that Biden acted corruptly to benefit his son is correct. There is no evidence of that, to be 100% clear.

michael barbaro

Right. It seems like both Joe Biden and Hunter Biden put themselves in a position where people could later question their motives and their judgment, because either Hunter Biden should not have been on that board at the same time that his father was taking on corruption in Ukraine, or his father, knowing that his son was on that board, should not have taken on corruption in Ukraine.

ken vogel

Yes, that’s right. And what’s interesting is that the way that the Bidens sought to address this and to avoid these conflicts of interest is by expressly not knowing about what one another were doing. In other words, Joe Biden said he did not want to know anything about what Hunter Biden was doing in the private sector, because how could he be doing anything in his job as vice president to help his son if he did not know what his son’s interests were? Now, there’s an argument to be made that that’s not really a good way to inoculate yourself against these concerns. The way to inoculate yourself is to know about one another are doing so you can avoid these potential areas of overlap.

michael barbaro

So Ken, I wonder, in the end, what is the power of these two theories that the president has pursued here about Ukraine and the D.N.C. and Ukraine and the Bidens in the impeachment inquiry, especially as it enters these final, crucial weeks?

ken vogel

These two theories are why we are in the middle of an impeachment inquiry. The fact that President Trump pressured the Ukrainian government to pursue investigations into these two theories is, for Democrats, a justification for removal from office — the very definition of the type of high crime and misdemeanor that is justification for removal from office. And that’s how Democrats have been talking about these theories, as debunked conspiracy theories, and will continue talking about them as impeachment proceeds.

[music]

And for Republicans, who are trying to defend Trump, he’s making their life more difficult here, because while they see there being some validity in the theories that he’s pushing about the Bidens, they see this theory that it was the Ukrainians and not the Russians who hacked into the D.N.C. servers as totally crazy. Many of them — most of them, I would say, even — privately, they’ll say this — they wished that he would stop talking about it because they think that this dilutes the argument that they can make that there was a legitimate corruption concern that President Trump was urging the Ukrainian government to pursue.

michael barbaro

So they prefer the Biden theory vastly to the D.N.C. server theory.

ken vogel

Yeah, that’s right. And they think that despite the way that the president has misrepresented the Biden theory and ascribed motivations that cannot be substantiated to Joe Biden, that nonetheless, this is a theory that could be politically helpful to the president and politically damaging to Joe Biden. And that is among the reasons why we are going to continue hearing the names Hunter Biden and Joe Biden from Republicans for as long as these impeachment proceedings go.

“I am a Democrat who thinks that President Obama’s remarks were spot on. I am terrified that Democrats will lose the next election if we have a left-wing candidate in 2020. I think some Democrats and most independents will not be willing to vote for someone on the left wing of the Democratic Party. They just might decide to not vote at all.” — Julia Gibson, The Woodlands, Texas

“I think he was wrong. People know much of what politicians say when running for office is aspirational. We know they can’t waive a magic wand and make it so. We also know that on several fronts, including the environment especially, we are running out of time. This is a time for bold policy ideas, not incrementalism.” — Mark Burnham, Cranston, R.I.

“I’m here in rural Wisconsin. I think he’s right that people aren’t ready for such dramatic change. It does not seem timely to expect voters to swerve so dramatically left now, when they need to be coaxed back into trusting a Democratic Party that will show up for an average American who is neither far left or far right.” — Sharon LaCour, Amery, Wis.

The discussions, which took place via email in August , came after the hold on the $391 million had already been put in place. Mr. Mulvaney also asked the officials at the Office of Management and Budget how long the aid could be withheld, three people familiar with the review said.

The emails, which were first reported by The Washington Post on Sunday, were surfaced during a review by the White House Counsel’s Office that is examining the events surrounding the Ukraine call. They raise the question of whether Mr. Mulvaney was seeking after the fact to justify the hold, which is central to Democrats’ impeachment investigation into whether Mr. Trump abused his office for political gain, or whether his request was routine.

Taken together, they depict a strategy clearly aimed at leveraging information from politically powerful but legally vulnerable foreign citizens.

In the case of Mr. Firtash, an energy tycoon with deep ties to the Kremlin who is facing extradition to the United States on bribery and racketeering charges, one of Mr. Giuliani’s associates has described offering the oligarch help with his Justice Department problems — if Mr. Firtash hired two lawyers who were close to President Trump and were already working with Mr. Giuliani on his dirt-digging mission. Mr. Firtash said the offer was made in late June when he met with Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, both Soviet-born businessmen involved in Mr. Giuliani’s Ukraine pursuit.

Mr. Parnas’s lawyer, Joseph A. Bondy, confirmed that account and added that his client had met with Mr. Firtash at Mr. Giuliani’s direction and encouraged the oligarch to help in the hunt for compromising information “as part of any potential resolution to his extradition matter.”

Mr. Firtash’s relationship to the Trump-allied lawyers — Victoria Toensing and Joseph diGenova — has led to intense speculation that he is, at least indirectly, helping to finance Mr. Giuliani’s campaign. But until now he has stayed silent, and many of the details of how and why he came to hire the lawyers have remained murky.

In the interview, Mr. Firtash said he had no information about the Bidens and had not financed the search for it. “Without my will and desire,” he said, “I was sucked into this internal U.S. fight.” But to help his legal case, he said, he had paid his new lawyers $1.2 million to date, with a portion set aside as something of a referral fee for Mr. Parnas."

Mr. Bloomberg’s message, at the start, is leaning heavily into his biography as a business executive and as the mayor of New York City starting in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. His advisers acknowledge that he is far less known to voters than the leading Democratic candidates. His debut television commercial stressed his credentials as a self-made executive — “a middle-class kid who made good” — and his political advocacy on core Democratic concerns like gun control and climate change, as well as on economic development and public health issues like smoking. Those issues, his advisers say, will all be central to his candidacy.

While Mr. Bloomberg is a political moderate, his opening message also borrowed in some respects from the anti-Washington rhetoric of the Democratic Party’s populist wing, led by progressives like Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. “I know how to take on the powerful special interests that corrupt Washington,” Mr. Bloomberg said in his statement on Sunday. “And I know how to win.”

Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island, who helms the Democratic Governors Association, said she had spoken recently with Mr. Bloomberg and saw him as a strong candidate despite the late hour. Ms. Raimondo said the former mayor recognized he faced “long odds” in the primary, but she suggested Mr. Bloomberg could be well positioned in a general election to take on Mr. Trump’s perceived credentials as a businessman.

“Trump’s a fraud. He’s a business failure. His economic policies have failed,” Ms. Raimondo said. “He’s bad for America, and I think Bloomberg can go toe-to-toe with him on that score, and he should.”"

But she said Mr. Biden and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who has also proposed a public option, are more appealing to her because they are more realistic about long-term spending.

“They’re great ideals,” Ms. Downing said of the Warren and Sanders’ “Medicare for all” plans, “but I’m just not sure we can pay for it.”

The public option plans offered by Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg would require much less federal spending than Ms. Warren’s $20.5 trillion proposal to provide generous health benefits, at no cost, to all Americans. Mr. Biden has estimated his plan would cost $750 billion over 10 years; Mr. Buttigieg has said his version, which he likes to call “Medicare for all who want it,” would cost $1.5 trillion.

Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg ’s plans would automatically enroll uninsured Americans in the new government health plan and allow anyone else to opt in if they wished. Both candidates would offer more generous premium subsidies than the Affordable Care Act provides and cap people’s premium costs at 8.5 percent of their income. People with premium subsidies would have deductibles of roughly $1,000 or less. Mr. Buttigieg’s plan would go a step further, retroactively enrolling anyone who had remained uninsured but ended up sick.

Although most of the other Democrats who qualified for Wednesday’s debate support the idea of a public option, few have released detailed proposals. Some candidates, like Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Andrew Yang, an entrepreneur, say they hope a public option would lead to “Medicare for all;” others, like Ms. Klobuchar and Tom Steyer, a former hedge fund investor and a billionaire, consider it an end in itself.

The public option that Ms. Warren has proposed as a bridge to her “Medicare for all” plan would go further. It would be free for all children and for households with incomes at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, which is currently about $51,000 for a family of four. For people who earn more, premiums would be capped at 5 percent of income; there would be no deductibles and “modest” out-of-pocket costs. Ms. Warren has not said how much this public option plan would cost the government, but it would be considerably less than “Medicare for all;” during Wednesday’s debate she said it would cover 135 million people — about 40 percent of the population — for free."

“We will not allow the president or others to drag this out for months on end in the courts,” Mr. Schiff wrote on Monday, expressing confidence in the case in hand.

His committee has already collected dozens of hours of testimony supporting the underlying allegation at the center of the impeachment inquiry: that the president used the powers of his office to pressure Ukraine to discredit his political rivals by announcing investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and an unsupported theory that Democrats conspired with Ukraine to interfere in the 2016 election.

“As the evidence conclusively shows, President Trump conditioned official acts — a White House meeting desperately desired by the new Ukrainian president and critical U.S. military assistance — on Ukraine announcing sham, politically motivated investigations that would help President Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign,” Mr. Schiff said, encapsulating what is likely to be the core of the Democrats’ report.

Mr. Schiff did not put a precise date on the delivery of his report to the Judiciary Committee, but the rough timeline he outlined would put Democrats on track to vote on impeachment articles by the end of the year, barring unexpected complications or a collapse in support within their caucus. If they are successful, a trial to determine whether Mr. Trump will be acquitted or removed from office would follow in the Senate.

At this point, Democrats expect to get little to no Republican support in the House. The president’s allies have united firmly behind him to argue either that the facts laid out by senior diplomats and administration officials are incorrect or that they simply do not merit impeachment.

The Judiciary Committee is expected in the coming days to announce public impeachment hearings to take place next week to hear the evidence on Ukraine and to begin to draft and debate impeachment articles, which are roughly analogous to charges in a courtroom trial. They could also convene sessions with expert witnesses to define impeachable offenses and offer Mr. Trump and his legal team a chance to present a defense or exculpatory evidence."

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Yesterday, we looked at the origin of President Trump’s theory that Ukraine, not Russia, meddled in the 2016 election — one of the two theories that he asked Ukraine’s president to investigate. Today: Trump’s second theory. It’s Wednesday, November 27.

ken vogel

So when Trump goes on Fox and Friends on Friday for this long stream-of-conscious phone interview, he reiterates his theory — totally debunked theory about the Ukrainians and not the Russians hacking into the D.N.C. servers. And then he also brings up this other theory.

archived recording So, Mr. President, the accusation is this — that you’re using aid, taxpayer dollars, to attack a political opponent in Joe Biden.

ken vogel

And that has to do with Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden, and their work in Ukraine.

michael barbaro

Ken Vogel is a Washington correspondent for The Times.

archived recording (donald trump) And I will tell you this about Joe Biden I never said it specifically on him. But I watched Joe Biden with the prosecutor, who a lot of people said was a great prosecutor, and they took him off. And he was prosecuting that company. And the kid, who never made $0.10 in his life and all of a sudden is making millions of dollars the day he —

michael barbaro

Ken, what exactly is the president’s second theory here about the Bidens?

ken vogel

What Trump alleges is that Joe Biden, during his time as vice president, pressured the Ukrainian government to fire their top prosecutor — essentially their attorney general — because that prosecutor was pursuing an investigation into this energy company in Ukraine that was paying Hunter Biden as a board member, and that the reason why Joe Biden pushed for the firing was to protect Hunter Biden and his employer.

michael barbaro

So the theory is basically that the vice president does a favor for his son in the form of official action in Ukraine.

ken vogel

Correct.

michael barbaro

So where does the story behind that claim begin?

ken vogel

You’ve got to go back to 2014.

archived recording 44-year-old Hunter Biden, Vice President Joe Biden’s youngest son, was discharged from the Navy Reserve.

ken vogel

Hunter Biden, who is a Yale-educated lawyer and had dabbled in various business ventures —

archived recording Biden was given a routine drug test, which he failed.

ken vogel

— had just been discharged from the Navy Reserve after testing positive for cocaine during a drug test.

archived recording “It was the honor of my life to serve in the U.S. Navy, and I deeply regret and am embarrassed that my actions led to my administrative discharge.”

ken vogel

And at this point, he and some partners are starting to explore international opportunities. And one of his partners gets this gig on the board of this Ukrainian gas company that is looking for some Western political connections. And Hunter Biden asks if he can get in on this as well. And he is brought onto the board of this company.

archived recording And a son of the U.S. vise president has joined the board of directors of Ukraine’s largest private gas producer. Hunter Biden was appointed to the board of Burisma Holdings.

ken vogel

This company is called Burisma Holdings. It does primarily natural gas. And it is bringing onto its board a number of folks with big political names in the west. And one of them is Hunter Biden. He is paid as much as $50,000, or even more, in some months, to serve on the board of this company, and, ostensibly, to help it with governance reforms — to introduce Western corporate governance standards into this company.

michael barbaro

And how clear is it, Ken, that the reason why Hunter Biden is coming onto the board is because of his family connection? I mean, is it more or less explicit?

ken vogel

This is definitely the message that everyone in Ukraine and Washington takes away from it, as to why Hunter Biden is brought onto the board. His defenders point out that he had, in fact, served on other boards, including the board of Amtrak, where his dad famously has a lot of connections and clout. But he doesn’t really have much other applicable experience that would suggest that he is otherwise the ideal candidate to serve on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. He doesn’t have any experience in Ukraine or Ukrainian law, or even in energy.

michael barbaro

So what do we need to know about Burisma at this moment, when Hunter Biden arrives on the board?

ken vogel

Burisma has faced allegations of corruption, including many that are embraced by the West and by the State Department, which sees it, in many ways — both the company itself, Burisma, and the oligarch who owns the company as poster children for post-Soviet corruption in Ukraine.

michael barbaro

Hm. Ken, do we know if Hunter Biden understood this when he went on the board?

ken vogel

If he had done any due diligence, you would think that he should have known. There were certainly investigations that were already ongoing both in Ukraine and in the West into the oligarch who owned the company on suspicion of money laundering. And those investigations had support from the United States government. And that is where Joe Biden comes in.

michael barbaro

What do you mean?

archived recording (joe biden) We, the United States, stand with you and all the Ukrainian people.

ken vogel

Well, Joe Biden, at this time, is vice president. And one of his key foreign policy tasks that he takes on at the assignment of President Barack Obama is to help Ukraine stand up to Russian aggression.

archived recording (joe biden) It is not just a foreign policy judgment. It is a personal, it’s an emotional commitment, as well.

ken vogel

And one of the things that is seen as an impediment to Ukraine establishing a stable government is this scourge of corruption that has long plagued it and is seen as limiting its ability to attract international investment and to be a stable government that can mount a response to Russian aggression.

michael barbaro

And when is he given that assignment?

ken vogel

It comes pretty much at about the same time as Hunter Biden is going onto the board of this Ukrainian gas company, in early 2014.

michael barbaro

So that’s kind of complicated.

ken vogel

It is. And it certainly would provide rationale for this Ukrainian gas company and its oligarch owner to want to have a powerful westerner who is seen as having connections to the Obama government, which at this point is pushing Ukraine to clamp down on the very type of corruption that this oligarch and his company is seen as embodying.

michael barbaro

Does anyone raise the question of whether this is not a great idea that Joe Biden is suddenly investigating corruption in Ukraine around the same time that his son is now on the board of a major Ukrainian energy company that is accused of corruption?

ken vogel

Yes. We know that there’s a guy in the State Department by the name of George Kent who had deep experience both in Ukraine and in fighting corruption. He had served as the anti-corruption coordinator in the State Department’s European bureau. And he does raise concerns about Hunter Biden joining the board of Burisma and how Hunter Biden’s position could affect Vice President Biden’s standing as a corruption fighter, or the leader of the U.S. effort to push Ukraine to clamp down on corruption.

michael barbaro

But a decision is made that father and son can simultaneously do these two things.

ken vogel

It actually appears as if the decision was to not make a decision and to not address this. George Kent tried to bring this to the attention of the vice president’s staff and was essentially told that Vice President Biden did not have the bandwidth to address this at a time when he was dealing with other family issues, particularly his son Beau Biden, his other son, struggling with brain cancer.

michael barbaro

So what exactly does Vice President Joe Biden do during this period in his role as the guy in the Obama administration who’s trying to root out corruption in Ukraine? What does it actually look like?

ken vogel

Well, Biden focuses on two areas that are seen in the West as bastions of Ukrainian corruption. One is the energy sector. And the other is the judicial system. The international community has long seen the Ukrainian judicial system, and particularly the prosecutors therein, as one of the key problems that perpetuate Ukrainian corruption. These prosecutors have long been known for using the threat of prosecution to essentially solicit bribes from potential targets of corruption. So they are not only not prosecuting corruption, they are, in fact, participating in their own brand of corruption. This was one of the key things that Joe Biden trained his sights on when he went after Ukrainian corruption.

michael barbaro

Got it. So a company would basically pay off the prosecutor, and the prosecutor, therefore, wouldn’t really prosecute.

ken vogel

Yes. And the guy who was seen as emblematic of this type of corruption is Viktor Shokin. He’s the prosecutor general of Ukraine. It’s essentially like the attorney general of Ukraine. And what makes this complicated, though, is that one of the folks who Shokin is not prosecuting because it is believed he is using the threat of prosecution to solicit bribes from is none other than the oligarch who owns the company Burisma Holdings that is paying Hunter Biden to serve as a board member.

michael barbaro

Ah.

ken vogel

Yeah. And this is why some of the folks in the State Department had flagged this as a potential concern that could undermine Joe Biden’s ability to drive this message and be seen as a credible messenger, when in his own house, under his own roof, there is someone who is working with a potential target of the type of prosecution that Joe Biden is trying to encourage the Ukrainians to pursue.

michael barbaro

So what does Biden ultimately do about Shokin? [APPLAUSE]

archived recording (joe biden) Thank you very much.

ken vogel

Well, Biden privately pressures the then-president of Ukraine to get rid of Shokin. And he actually goes and gives a speech that gets a lot of play before the Ukrainian Parliament —

archived recording (joe biden) But in addition, you also have a battle —

ken vogel

— urging them to clamp down on corruption.

archived recording (joe biden) — against corruption. But it’s not enough to set up a new Anti-Corruption Bureau and establish a special prosecutor fighting corruption. The Office of the General Prosecutor desperately needs reform. The judiciary should be overhauled. The energy sector needs to be competitive, ruled by market principles, not sweetheart deals.

ken vogel

That doesn’t really do the trick. Maybe the Ukrainians are starting to move in this direction, but they don’t actually take the steps necessary to fire Shokin. And what Biden does is, he threatens to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to Ukraine if the then-president doesn’t act to get rid of Shokin.

michael barbaro

So you’re saying that in order for Joe Biden to get rid of this problematic prosecutor, he is threatening to withhold money from Ukraine — which feels like a now-familiar concept.

ken vogel

Yeah, it certainly does have a certain familiar ring to it. But what’s different in what Biden did from what Trump’s team did is that what Biden was doing was actually carrying out the official policy of the United States government, which was to push for this prosecutor’s ouster and to use a combination of diplomatic carrots and sticks in order to achieve that end. And $1 billion in loan guarantees is certainly a rather big carrot or stick, depending on which way you look at it.

michael barbaro

Right. Right. And did it work?

archived recording So on Tuesday, 29th of March, [INAUDIBLE] of Ukraine voted to grant consent by President Petro Poroshenko to dismiss Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin.

ken vogel

Eventually, it did. It’s not totally clear what role Biden and the loan guarantees played in it versus the mounting pressure from the international community and other international, Western lenders.

archived recording [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

ken vogel

But eventually —

archived recording (interpreter) The person who was building the system of corruption in prosecutor’s office cannot reform it. Shokin’s appointment was a mistake.

ken vogel

The then-president does take the steps to get the parliament to officially oust Shokin.

michael barbaro

And what does Shokin’s ouster mean for Burisma — this company that Hunter Biden sits on?

ken vogel

You might think that this would be really bad for Burisma if it is widely regarded as a corrupt company. You’re getting rid of a corrupt prosecutor who could be bought off from bringing prosecutions against targets of corruption — that if you get rid of that guy and bring in someone who is going to be more of an anti-corruption crusader, that the potential targets of corruption prosecutions, like Burisma, might be really in a bad spot. But in fact, it turns out to be a lot more complicated than that.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So Ken, you said that the aftermath of Joe Biden forcing out this prosecutor was more complicated than it seemed for Burisma, this company that employs Biden’s son. So what actually happens?

ken vogel

Well, Burisma actually welcome this new prosecutor and the chance to work with him, because they thought that if this prosecutor subscribed to Western approaches to jurisprudence that they would be able to convince this prosecutor by giving him evidence that, in fact, these allegations against Burisma and its oligarch owner were baseless.

michael barbaro

So you’re saying that Burisma thinks, if we play by normal rules and we have a regular old prosecutor, we can get cleared of these charges because in their minds, they’re not actually corrupt.

ken vogel

Yes. And this is very important to them at the time, because they are trying to expand and pursuing Western investment. And the cloud of these corruption investigations that Shokin had hanging over them was a hindrance to them. So they welcome the chance to have a new prosecutor who they believe they can convince that the allegations against them are off base and should be dropped.

michael barbaro

So what ends up happening to Burisma once this new prosecutor is welcomed in to take a look around?

ken vogel

Well, Burisma sends in a team of very well compensated, very highly regarded American lawyers and PR folks to meet with the new prosecutor. And while the new prosecutor initially takes something of a hard line against Burisma and forces them to pay some back taxes or fines, eventually, after 10 months, the new prosecutor announces that he has fully closed all of the legal proceedings and pending criminal allegations against the oligarch owner of Burisma and his companies. And the new prosecutor announces that the oligarch owner of Burisma is being removed from the wanted list. So the oligarch, who had been in exile, returns to Ukraine.

michael barbaro

So this all ends up pretty well for Burisma — the elimination of this corrupt prosecutor. So should we then assume that Burisma was, perhaps, never corrupt in the first place?

ken vogel

No, I don’t think that we can assume that. In fact, the anti-corruption activists in Ukraine really decried this decision to drop the cases against Burisma and its oligarch owner. So in Ukraine, at least, as well as in some quarters in the State Department, it is not in any way viewed as a clean bill of health for Burisma or its oligarch owner.

michael barbaro

So Ken, I want to summarize everything you just told me and hold it up against President Trump’s theory — the theory that Vice President Biden did what he did as a favor to his son once his son is on the board of Burisma. So in reality, Biden pressures Ukraine to fire somebody who is widely seen as a dirty prosecutor, who seems to be basically holding companies, including Burisma, hostage, and taking bribes in order not to investigate them. And in pushing out that prosecutor, Biden sets in motion a series of events that conclude with an investigation of Burisma coming to an end, even though from everything you’re saying, the company is still seen as corrupt. Do I have all that correct?

ken vogel

Yes.

michael barbaro

So in the end, Biden takes an action that does benefit Burisma, and less directly, his son.

ken vogel

Indirectly, having the new prosecutor does benefit Burisma and its oligarch owner. And Hunter Biden does remain on the board of Burisma until this year. But I think this is where we get into questions of intent. And there is no evidence that it was the intent of Vice President Joe Biden to take this action to benefit Burisma, let alone his son.

michael barbaro

So can we say that this theory that the vice president did what he did in Ukraine to help his son — can we say that it is false?

ken vogel

We can say that there is no evidence that Joe Biden acted corruptly to help his son in Ukraine.

[music]

^ARCHIVED RECORDING (DONALD TRUMP)^” We’re looking for corruption. There’s tremendous corruption. We’re looking for — why should we be giving hundreds of millions of dollars to countries where there’s this kind of corruption? And if you look at my call, I said corruption. I think he said it to me. He’s looking. He got elected on the basis of corruption. And also, by the way —

michael barbaro

I’m struck, Ken, about what we can say definitively here versus what we can say definitively about the president’s first theory about CrowdStrike and Ukraine hacking the D.N.C. servers. That theory draws on fabricated facts and is thoroughly disprovable and has been disproven. The second theory, about the Bidens — it draws on real facts, but there’s no evidence of it. And yet it’s not really disprovable. Does that make sense?

ken vogel

Yeah. It’s a lot more complicated. It’s a lot more nuanced. There are a lot more facts. And there is a fact pattern that did trouble employees in the State Department at the time and then subsequently, as it’s gotten a lot more attention, has troubled ethics experts, who say that the Bidens did not do a good enough job addressing concerns about conflict of interest. Now, all that said, it does not mean that Trump’s theory that Biden acted corruptly to benefit his son is correct. There is no evidence of that, to be 100% clear.

michael barbaro

Right. It seems like both Joe Biden and Hunter Biden put themselves in a position where people could later question their motives and their judgment, because either Hunter Biden should not have been on that board at the same time that his father was taking on corruption in Ukraine, or his father, knowing that his son was on that board, should not have taken on corruption in Ukraine.

ken vogel

Yes, that’s right. And what’s interesting is that the way that the Bidens sought to address this and to avoid these conflicts of interest is by expressly not knowing about what one another were doing. In other words, Joe Biden said he did not want to know anything about what Hunter Biden was doing in the private sector, because how could he be doing anything in his job as vice president to help his son if he did not know what his son’s interests were? Now, there’s an argument to be made that that’s not really a good way to inoculate yourself against these concerns. The way to inoculate yourself is to know about one another are doing so you can avoid these potential areas of overlap.

michael barbaro

So Ken, I wonder, in the end, what is the power of these two theories that the president has pursued here about Ukraine and the D.N.C. and Ukraine and the Bidens in the impeachment inquiry, especially as it enters these final, crucial weeks?

ken vogel

These two theories are why we are in the middle of an impeachment inquiry. The fact that President Trump pressured the Ukrainian government to pursue investigations into these two theories is, for Democrats, a justification for removal from office — the very definition of the type of high crime and misdemeanor that is justification for removal from office. And that’s how Democrats have been talking about these theories, as debunked conspiracy theories, and will continue talking about them as impeachment proceeds.

[music]

And for Republicans, who are trying to defend Trump, he’s making their life more difficult here, because while they see there being some validity in the theories that he’s pushing about the Bidens, they see this theory that it was the Ukrainians and not the Russians who hacked into the D.N.C. servers as totally crazy. Many of them — most of them, I would say, even — privately, they’ll say this — they wished that he would stop talking about it because they think that this dilutes the argument that they can make that there was a legitimate corruption concern that President Trump was urging the Ukrainian government to pursue.

michael barbaro

So they prefer the Biden theory vastly to the D.N.C. server theory.

ken vogel

Yeah, that’s right. And they think that despite the way that the president has misrepresented the Biden theory and ascribed motivations that cannot be substantiated to Joe Biden, that nonetheless, this is a theory that could be politically helpful to the president and politically damaging to Joe Biden. And that is among the reasons why we are going to continue hearing the names Hunter Biden and Joe Biden from Republicans for as long as these impeachment proceedings go.

The emails, which were first reported by The Washington Post on Sunday, were surfaced during a review by the White House Counsel’s Office that is examining the events surrounding the Ukraine call.

Mr. Parnas’s lawyer, Joseph A. Bondy, confirmed that account and added that his client had met with Mr. Firtash at Mr. Giuliani’s direction and encouraged the oligarch to help in the hunt for compromising information “as part of any potential resolution to his extradition matter.”

Mr. Firtash’s relationship to the Trump-allied lawyers — Victoria Toensing and Joseph diGenova — has led to intense speculation that he is, at least indirectly, helping to finance Mr. Giuliani’s campaign. But until now he has stayed silent, and many of the details of how and why he came to hire the lawyers have remained murky.

In the interview, Mr. Firtash said he had no information about the Bidens and had not financed the search for it. “Without my will and desire,” he said, “I was sucked into this internal U.S. fight.” But to help his legal case, he said, he had paid his new lawyers $1.2 million to date, with a portion set aside as something of a referral fee for Mr. Parnas."

It wasn’t an easy thing to do. As a Republican, I didn’t enjoy breaking with my party or my president. As an elected official and practical politician, I didn’t particularly enjoy the implications of turning against someone who had comfortably carried Washington State just two years earlier. None of it was pleasant, but I believed it was the right thing to do on the facts and on the merits.

John Adams said, “Facts are stubborn things.” Forty-five years after Mr. Nixon resigned before he could be impeached by the House, the facts should be the focus of every elected official, Republican or Democrat, as they decide what to do about another president facing impeachment and a possible Senate trial.

To my fellow Republicans, I give this grave and genuine warning: It’s not enough merely to dismiss the Ukraine investigation as a partisan witch hunt or to hide behind attacks against the “deep state,” or to try to find some reason to denounce every witness who steps forward, from decorated veterans to Trump megadonors.

Democrats have made clear that they are unwilling to wait for that process to play out, meaning their inquiry may simply never benefit from any information that may come to light.

“We will not allow the president or others to drag this out for months on end in the courts,” Mr. Schiff wrote on Monday, expressing confidence in the case in hand.

His committee has already collected dozens of hours of testimony supporting the underlying allegation at the center of the impeachment inquiry: that the president used the powers of his office to pressure Ukraine to discredit his political rivals by announcing investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and an unsupported theory that Democrats conspired with Ukraine to interfere in the 2016 election.

“As the evidence conclusively shows, President Trump conditioned official acts — a White House meeting desperately desired by the new Ukrainian president and critical U.S. military assistance — on Ukraine announcing sham, politically motivated investigations that would help President Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign,” Mr. Schiff said, encapsulating what is likely to be the core of the Democrats’ report.

Mr. Schiff did not put a precise date on the delivery of his report to the Judiciary Committee, but the rough timeline he outlined would put Democrats on track to vote on impeachment articles by the end of the year, barring unexpected complications or a collapse in support within their caucus. If they are successful, a trial to determine whether Mr. Trump will be acquitted or removed from office would follow in the Senate.

At this point, Democrats expect to get little to no Republican support in the House. The president’s allies have united firmly behind him to argue either that the facts laid out by senior diplomats and administration officials are incorrect or that they simply do not merit impeachment.

The Judiciary Committee is expected in the coming days to announce public impeachment hearings to take place next week to hear the evidence on Ukraine and to begin to draft and debate impeachment articles, which are roughly analogous to charges in a courtroom trial. They could also convene sessions with expert witnesses to define impeachable offenses and offer Mr. Trump and his legal team a chance to present a defense or exculpatory evidence."

“If we have a nominee that supports Medicare for all at the top of the ticket, our majority in the House is in serious jeopardy, not to mention a potential majority in the Senate,” said Mr. Jones, who is unaffiliated with a presidential campaign after advising former Representative Beto O’Rourke. “That is not a smart strategy.”

Liberal supporters of Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren offer a different political analysis of the party’s 2016 loss, saying that it was the failure to energize voters with a bold new vision that cost Democrats the presidency. They argue that polices like Medicare for all, can create a winning coalition by motivating independents who feel alienated by the political system and by energizing Democrats.

On the campaign trail and in debates, Ms. Warren pitches her health care plan by arguing that the current system is failing many Americans, even those who have health coverage, because of high costs. She says she’s asking corporations and the richest Americans to pay more to create a system in which people would no longer face the risk of financial ruin because of medical bills.

While she shies away from offering the kind of explicit political analysis frequently used by her rivals, Ms. Warren argues that the more Democrats talk about what’s broken with the system, the more support for Medicare for all will build. Aides point to polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation showing that a majority of all Democrats and about half of independents favor a national Medicare for all plan.

Ms. Warren’s tax is overwhelmingly popular ( 86 percent support ) with Democratic voters who have graduate degrees. Among voters with a high school diploma or less, the policy is still popular, but meaningfully less so, drawing 75 percent support.

Accordingly, less-educated voters are also less likely to say they favor Ms. Warren on the economy. That fits with other polling that has found the Massachusetts senator struggling to win over voters without a college degree.

Strikingly for a candidate who has put so much emphasis on the economy, Ms. Warren is viewed with caution by voters who care the most about the economy, and by those who are most worried about it. Among Democrats who say they are “very concerned” about losing their job, for example, 15 percent say they would trust Ms. Warren most on the economy out of all the Democratic candidates, compared with 23 percent of other Democratic voters.

Those struggles for Ms. Warren may partly reflect another important divide in the Democratic electorate: race. Black and Hispanic voters tend to rate the economy more highly as an issue than their white counterparts. They are also less likely to trust Ms. Warren on the economy.

Black and Hispanic voters are more likely to choose former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as the candidate they would trust on the economy. So are voters who say they are concerned about their jobs or their economic prospects. But voters’ preferences don’t fall neatly along ideological lines: Those same groups also tend to give high ratings to Mr. Sanders, who is closer to Ms. Warren than to Mr. Biden on most policy matters."

This weakness and Biden’s strength with these same voters are obvious reasons to doubt the case for Bernie as the unifier, Bernie as the eventual nominee.

Especially since Sanders has thus far ignored my advice (I know, the nerve) that he reassure skeptics by telling them that he has a record as a dealmaker, that he can moderate on certain issues, so they can feel safe supporting him even if they aren’t ready for the revolution.

But still: If you are a wavering Democrat concerned about both party unity and ultimate electability, about exciting all the diverse factions of your base while also competing for the disaffected, both the relative breadth of Bernie’s primary coalition and his decent polling among non-voters and Obama-Trump voters are reasons to give him another look.

That decent polling, I suspect, reflects a sense among voters drawn to populism that Bernie is different from not only the more centrist candidates — latecomers Michael Bloomberg and Deval Patrick especially, but Buttigieg as well — but also from his fellow left-winger, Warren, who has fully embraced the culture-war breadth of the new progressivism while Sanders remains, fundamentally, an economic-policy monomaniac.

He’s still a social liberal, of course, and he isn’t in the culturally conservative/economic populist quadrant where so many unrepresented voters reside. But for the kind of American who is mostly with the Democrats on economics but wary of progressivism’s zest for culture war, Sanders’s socialism might be strangely reassuring — as a signal of what he actually cares about, and what battles he might eschew for the sake of his anti-plutocratic goals. (At the very least he’s no more radical on an issue like abortion than a studied moderate like Mayor Pete.)

This is why, despite technically preferring a moderate like Biden or Amy Klobuchar, I keep coming back to the conservative’s case for Bernie — which rests on the perhaps-wrong but still attractive supposition that he’s the liberal most likely to spend all his time trying to tax the rich and leave cultural conservatives alone.

Ms. Warren’s tax is overwhelmingly popular ( 86 percent support ) with Democratic voters who have graduate degrees. Among voters with a high school diploma or less, the policy is still popular, but meaningfully less so, drawing 75 percent support.

Accordingly, less-educated voters are also less likely to say they favor Ms. Warren on the economy. That fits with other polling that has found the Massachusetts senator struggling to win over voters without a college degree.

Strikingly for a candidate who has put so much emphasis on the economy, Ms. Warren is viewed with caution by voters who care the most about the economy, and by those who are most worried about it. Among Democrats who say they are “very concerned” about losing their job, for example, 15 percent say they would trust Ms. Warren most on the economy out of all the Democratic candidates, compared with 23 percent of other Democratic voters.

Those struggles for Ms. Warren may partly reflect another important divide in the Democratic electorate: race. Black and Hispanic voters tend to rate the economy more highly as an issue than their white counterparts. They are also less likely to trust Ms. Warren on the economy.

Black and Hispanic voters are more likely to choose former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as the candidate they would trust on the economy. So are voters who say they are concerned about their jobs or their economic prospects. But voters’ preferences don’t fall neatly along ideological lines: Those same groups also tend to give high ratings to Mr. Sanders, who is closer to Ms. Warren than to Mr. Biden on most policy matters."
