* After a couple of difficult months, Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) presidential campaign needed some good news, and a $25.3 million fundraising haul in the third quarter definitely counts as good news for the senator. The total is up from the Vermonter’s $18 million tally from the second quarter.

* Pete Buttigieg also announced third-quarter fundraising totals, and it looks like the mayor raised more than $19.1 million between June and August. That’s down from $24.8 million in the second quarter, but it nevertheless leaves Buttigieg in a strong financial position for the next phase in the race.

* Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) also announced his third-quarter tally: more than $6 million. That’s his best quarter to date, and it’s enough to keep him in the race.

* Sen. Kamala Harris’ (D-Calif.) presidential campaign isn’t where she wants it to be, so the senator is “shaking up the top ranks” of her operation. The change includes moving two top aides from Harris’ Senate staff to her campaign staff.

* The latest Republican National Committee solicitation looks an awful lot like official census materials, which is the sort of misleading scheme partisans are supposed to avoid.

* To the disappointment of Democrats who expected him to lose badly, Corey Lewandowski, Donald Trump’s controversial former campaign manager, conceded this morning that it’s “fair to say” he’s reconsidering plans to run for the U.S. Senate in New Hampshire next year.

* The Atlanta Journal Constitution reports today that new voters in Georgia “have registered in droves” since last year’s elections, and “many of the new voters are racial minorities or under age 30, both groups that are more likely to support Democrats than Republicans.”

* And former Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) wrote a new op-ed, published yesterday, arguing that Trump’s actions “warrant impeachment,” and urging his Republican brethren to end their support for the scandal-plagued president’s re-election."

* Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was hospitalized yesterday in Las Vegas and “underwent a significant medical procedure after a blockage was found in one of his arteries.” As NBC News’ report added, “Sanders, who is 78, has canceled all of his campaign events ‘until further notice.’”

* Buoyed by African-American support, Joe Biden leads the Democratic presidential field in South Carolina according to the latest Winthrop University poll. The former vice president has 37% support, followed by Elizabeth Warren at 17%. Bernie Sanders is third with 8%, followed by Kamala Harris at 7%.

* Speaking of the Palmetto State, some South Carolina Republicans, including former Rep. Bob Inglis, sued the state Republican Party this week “over its decision to cancel its GOP presidential primary next year.”

* As difficult as this may seem to believe, Andrew Yang, a Democratic presidential candidate running for elected office for the first time, raised $10 million in the third quarter. That’s “more than triple the $2.8 million Yang raised in the second quarter.”

* Kamala Harris, meanwhile, raised $11.6 million between July and September, which is awfully close to the $11.8 million she raised in the second quarter.

* Former Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.), whose 2020 presidential campaign has struggled to gain traction, has reportedly lost four key aides, including his state directors in Iowa and New Hampshire.

* Joe Biden’s campaign released a new plan on gun policy today, which includes an assault-weapons ban. Under the blueprint, those Americans who already own assault weapons would be required to either register the weapons or sell them to the government.

* Speaking of new 2020 plans, Elizabeth Warren’s campaign unveiled a new proposal this morning that would tax lobbying: “Under her proposal, companies that spend between $500,000 and $1 million a year on lobbying would pay a 35% tax on their expenditures. The rate would increase to 60% for spending of more than $1 million, and to 75% above $5 million.”

* And finally, Donald Trump last week told a rather detailed story about CNN building a multi-million-dollar studio in North Carolina’s 9th congressional district, which he said the network intended to keep up “for weeks” if the Democratic candidate won in a recent special election. Like so many of the president’s bizarre anecdotes, the story was completely made up and had no basis in reality."

KAMALA HARRIS CALLS FOR SUSPENSION OF TRUMP'S TWITTER ACCOUNT AMID WHISTLEBLOWER TWEETS

Really, she's not going to help herself by ""de-tweeting"" Trump. If anything, that might help him. He'd just launch his own message board, and the media would cover that even more breathlessly.

Without Trump’s asides, the media would have to start covering real news, which actually takes work. Besides, we'd all resent Harris for taking away one of the most striking phenomena in political history: a leader who communicates directly with the people, cutting out the middleman known as ""us,"" the media.

Obnoxious or not, it’s the most transparent advancement in politics. It’s the opposite of choreographed interviews between politicians and hacks that allowed both phonies to prosper.

No wonder Harris hates it. She's terrible at being authentic. She's as real as spandex. As credible as a gas station chili dog. I've never seen a candidate so uncomfortable in her own pantsuit. Well, maybe …

There's a weird reflex among liberals these days not to engage in dialogue, but to simply suppress it. Instead of debating each other, dump the interesting voices. Instead of listening to the other side, call them ""despicable"" or ""deplorable.""

Instead of accepting an election, resist it and call it illegitimate. What do all these tactics have in common? They only work if you know you're a loser.

KAMALA HARRIS CALLS FOR SUSPENSION OF TRUMP'S TWITTER ACCOUNT AMID WHISTLEBLOWER TWEETS

The California Democrat initially called for Trump to be suspended on Monday in reaction to his attacks on the whistleblower who shed a light on his communications with Ukraine.

""The president's tweets and his behaviors about this are just further evidence of the fact that he uses his power in a way that is designed to beat people down instead of lift people up,"" Harris said on CNN.

""Should Donald Trump be banned from Twitter?"" a reporter asked. Warren laughed and said simply, ""No.""

The comment came after Harris sent a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey on Tuesday, accusing the president of violating the company's terms of service. ""I believe the president's recent tweets rise to the level that Twitter should consider suspending his account. When this kind of abuse is being spewed from the most powerful office in the United States, the stakes are too high to do nothing,"" she said.

She specifically pointed to tweets in which the president attacked House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and suggested there would be ""big consequences"" for the whistleblower who reported on his call with Ukraine.

Harris also flagged a tweet in which Trump accused Democrats of engaging in a ""coup."" ""Hey @jack. Time to do something about this,"" Harris tweeted, using the Twitter CEO's handle.

That prompted a clash among media figures as Five Thirty-Eight founder Nate Silver pushed back on removing Trump from his favored platform.

“Twitter is endangering the world and breaking its own terms of service to do it. Trump or Jack must go,” Resistance San Francisco said at the beginning of 2018.

In a blog post around that time, Twitter put the kibosh on banning world leaders from the platform. ""Twitter is here to serve and help advance the global, public conversation.

TRUMP DEMANDS SCHIFF RESIGN OVER 'PARODY' READING OF UKRAINE CALL

Democrats recently announced a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump over a whistleblower's claim that the president, who'd put a freeze on millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, improperly pushed that country's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, during a July phone call to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

Hunter Biden served on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma as his father was leading the Obama administration’s diplomatic dealings with Kiev. Trump has claimed that Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to shut down a corruption investigation of Burisma. The former vice president has denied doing anything wrong.

Gabbard had been reluctant to join Democrats in supporting impeachment.

She reversed her position a few days later.

“…After looking carefully at the transcript of the conversation with Ukraine’s president, the whistleblower complaint, the inspector general memo, and President Trump’s comments about the issue, unfortunately, I believe that if we do not proceed with the inquiry, it will set a very dangerous precedent,"" she said.

The Democratic National Committee (DNC) on Wednesday announced the lineup for their Oct. 15 fourth-round presidential primary debate, and as expected, 12 candidates have qualified, meeting the polling and fundraising criteria.

That means the showdown will be the largest in presidential primary history, topping the 11 Republicans who faced off in a primary debate in September 2015, according to political research from Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a political newsletter and website.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

The dozen Democratic White House contenders who made the cut are – in alphabetical order – former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; businessman and environmental advocate Tom Steyer; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

The first two rounds of debates in June and July – with lower qualifying thresholds – were held over two consecutive nights with 10 candidates on the stage each evening. The thresholds were raised for the third-round debate, resulting in 10 candidates facing off on one night.

The DNC announced last week that the fourth-round debate would also be held on a single night. The 10 contenders who faced off in September automatically qualified for the October debate. And Gabbard and Steyer, who narrowly missed the September cut, reached the thresholds to qualify for the upcoming showdown by Tuesday’s deadline.

2020 DEMOCRATIC FIELD POISED FOR NEW PURGE WITH KEY DEADLINES APPROACHING

Twelve candidates on the same stage at the same time could make for an unwieldy debate and a lot of jockeying for time and attention.

Steyer told Fox News on Wednesday that “the DNC makes decisions and I try not to think about them.”

He emphasized that “the debates are a huge opportunity and that’s how I hope to use them,” but he also acknowledged that “if there are more people on the stage, then it’s harder, and I just have to deal with that.”

The Oct. 15 debate will be held at Otterbein University, a liberal arts institution in Westerville, Ohio. The DNC’s media partners for the showdown are CNN and The New York Times."

The massive fundraising figure is up more than $7 million from his second-quarter numbers.

Pete Buttigieg’s campaign also reported early Tuesday morning that the South Bend, Indiana mayor raised $19.1 million the past three months. While impressive, the candidate’s fundraising haul is down from the $24.8 million he brought in during the second quarter, which was the highest among the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls during the April-June quarter.

Sen. Kamala Harris announced raising $11.6 million over the past three months.

The California Democrat's third quarter figure is slightly behind the $11.8 million she brought in during the second quarter and the $12 million she hauled in during the January-March first quarter of fundraising.

Sen. Cory Booker also revealed his third-quarter fundraising figures on Tuesday.

The Democrat from New Jersey's presidential campaign said they raised more than $6 million in July-September period, their best quarter of fundraising to date.

President Trump’s re-election campaign reported on Tuesday that they and the Republican National Committee combined hauled in a massive $125 million in the third quarter. That’s up from their combined $105 million raised during the second quarter.

Unlike some of his rivals for the nomination – such as former Vice President Joe Biden, Buttigieg and Harris – Sanders eschews big donor fundraisers and instead relies solely on grassroots donations. The campaign announced it received 1.4 million donations the past three months.

Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement that ""Bernie is proud to be the only candidate running to defeat Donald Trump who is 100 percent funded by grassroots donations – both in the primary and in the general.""

News of Sanders’ cash haul comes as the populist independent senator from Vermont has faded in many recent polls to third place behind Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who along with Sanders is the other progressive standard-bearer in the 2020 Democratic nomination race.

Shakir argued that “media elites and professional pundits have tried repeatedly to dismiss this campaign, and yet working-class Americans keep saying loudly and clearly that they want a political revolution.""

The Sanders campaign announced that its average individual contribution was $19 and that more than 99.9 percent of contributors have not maxed out and are able to donate again to the campaign.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

The Buttigieg campaign highlighted that they’ve now raised more than $51 million since the beginning of the year. They said that 182,000 new people contributed to the campaign in the third quarter, bringing the total number of donors this year to 580,000. The campaign also reported that the average contribution the past three months was $32.

Buttigieg, a one-time long-shot for the nomination, soared in the spring to near top-tier status. While he's continued to haul in large amounts of campaign cash and build up a formidable team in the crucial early voting states, his poll numbers stagnated during the summer.

The Harris campaign, in reporting their fundraising figures, noted that they plan to double their organizing staff in Iowa and South Carolina - the first southern primary - in October and November.

Harris has seen her poll numbers deteriorate over the past two months, but campaign manager Juan Rodriguez pledged that ""this is a campaign that is growing, expanding, and built to win this primary.""

Booker's campaign said that a third of their campaign haul the past three months came during the last 10 days of September, after the candidate announced if he didn't bring in $1.7 million by end of the month, he'd likely drop his White House bid.

Booker's campaign said they'd use their new infusion of campaign cash to hire 40 more staff at headquarters and across the country and open more offices in the early voting states.

Tuesday was the first day campaigns could announce their third-quarter numbers, but they have until Oct. 15 to officially file their fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission.

Campaign cash is a crucial barometer of a candidate’s appeal and popularity and of his or her campaign’s strength. The third-quarter fundraising figures of the Democratic presidential candidates will be heavily analyzed and scrutinized. Fundraising dollars can be used by the candidates to pay for campaign staff and grassroots outreach efforts, travel, and ads."

That’s more than triple the $2.8 million the tech-entrepreneur raised during the April-June second quarter of fundraising and more evidence – along with his rise in public opinion polling – that the long-shot for the White House has surged over the summer.

YANG TELLS FOX NEWS 'I WOULD NEVER WISH FOR' A RECESSION

Yang’s campaign also reported $6.3 million cash on hand as of the end of September and noted that the funds will go towards building up staff and infrastructure in the early voting primary and caucus states.

""Andrew Yang is the only contender showing exponential growth in the third quarter, more than tripling his fundraising number from last quarter,"" campaign manager Zach Graumann touted. ""This grassroots fundraising total, with over $6m in the bank, ensures this campaign will have the funding to compete and outperform expectations through Super Tuesday and beyond.""

Yang has become a serious contender for the Democratic nomination thanks to the popularity of his so-called ""Freedom Dividend."" That’s Yang’s universal basic income proposal to give each adult American $1,000 a month to ease the economic pain stemming from lost jobs due to automation and artificial intelligence. He says he’ll pay for the program by implementing a national value-added tax.

YANG'S CAMPAIGN CASH GIVEAWAYS RAISE LEGAL CONCERNS

He's also built a strong and devout base of grassroots supporters and donors, known as the Yang Gang. Thanks to his fundraising prowess and polling, Yang has made the stage for all the Democratic primary debates to date, something that some better-known governors and senators failed to do.

Yang closed out the third quarter of fundraising by headlining a rally in Los Angeles that drew some 5,000 people, according to his campaign. And they noted that Yang raised $2.28 million in the last ten days of September.

""Wow, we ended the quarter on the biggest rush of donations ever!"" Yang tweeted on Tuesday night. ""Thank you to everyone who worked your heart out to exceed our goal - you all are amazing!""

SANDERS HAULS IN A WHOPPING $25.3 MILLION IN THIRD QUARTER

The campaign cash figure from Yang, while impressive, paled in comparison to the whopping $25.3 million Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont hauled in during the third quarter. The Sanders campaign announced its fundraising figures early Tuesday morning.

South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg brought in $19.1 million over the past three months. Sen. Kamala Harris of California reported bringing in $11.6 million, with Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey raising over $6 million.

President Trump’s re-election team announced that they and the Republican National Committee combined hauled in a massive $125 million in the third quarter.

TRUMP'S RECORD-BREAKING $125 MILLION FUNDRAISING HAUL

Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado also released his fundraising figures on Wednesday. The long-shot contender for the nomination reported raising $2.1 million over the past three months, with $1.8 million cash on hand. The campaign noted that 86 percent of contributions were $25 or less.

“Our strategy to run a lean, strong campaign in early states is working, and we have the resources to compete and win. We’re continuing to run TV, rural radio, and digital ads and build out our infrastructure and staff,” Bennet campaign spokesperson Shannon Beckham emphasized.

Bennet didn’t make the cut for last month’s Democratic nomination debate and failed to qualify for this month’s showdown as well. That has not discouraged Bennet's campaign.

""Instead of allowing the DNC’s flawed debate criteria to dictate this race, we’re communicating directly with voters and caucusgoers,” Beckham said, taking aim at the Democratic National Committee’s thresholds to qualify for the debate."

Former President Barack Obama and the Democratic National Committee raised just over $70 million in the third quarter of 2011.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN, GOP RAKE IN MILLIONS IN 24 HOURS AFTER PELOSI ANNOUNCES IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

“President Trump has built a juggernaut of a campaign, raising record amounts of money at a record pace,” said Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale.

Republican insiders say that the impeachment effort against Trump could be a fundraising boon for the GOP.

WinRed, the new GOP online fundraising platform designed to compete for small-dollar campaign donations, reported raising a little more than $30 million in the third fundraising quarter, which began in July and ended Monday.

The online platform is used to raise money for President Trump’s re-election, campaign committees and various Republican candidates across the country.

WinRed President Gerrit Lansing said the Democrats’ moves to ramp up impeachment efforts against Trump “helped a lot,” saying fundraising numbers “spiked” after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s announcement of a formal inquiry last week.

WinRed has raised more than $13.7 million from over 276,000 contributors since the announcement by Pelosi, he said.

“It just poured gas on the situation where there is a ton of money being raised in all levels and all campaigns,” Lansing said.

RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel also credited Democratic attacks on Trump for motivating supporters to donate in record numbers.

“We are investing millions on the airwaves and on the ground to hold House Democrats accountable, highlight their obstruction, and take back the House and reelect President Trump in 2020,” she said.

The fundraising announcement comes as the pro-Trump groups launched their first major advertising campaign of the cycle. Trump’s team aims to devote $1 billion to his reelection.

However, Democrats are also putting up big fundraising numbers – albeit not as large as Trump’s campaign.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders hauled in a whopping $25.3 million during the third quarter of fundraising, up more than $7 million from his second-quarter numbers.

Pete Buttigieg’s campaign also reported Tuesday that the South Bend, Indiana mayor raised $19.1 million over the past three months. While impressive, the candidate’s fundraising haul is down from the $24.8 million he brought in during the second quarter, which was the highest among the record-setting field of Democratic White House hopefuls during the April-June quarter.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California said she had raised $11.6 million over the past three months. That figure is slightly behind the $11.8 million she brought in during the second quarter and the $12 million she hauled in during the January-March first quarter of fundraising.

Sen. Cory Booker also revealed his third-quarter fundraising figures on Tuesday. The Democrat from New Jersey's presidential campaign said they raised more than $6 million between July 1 and Sept. 30, their best quarter of fundraising to date.

Appearing on ""Fox & Friends,"" Lahren said that state officials pushing Gov. Gavin Newsom to declare a state of emergency are right to do so, but she's not so sure they're listening.

""We don't have a homeless problem in California; we have a homeless epidemic and anyone who lives here can see that very clearly,"" Lahren said.

JOE, HUNTER BIDEN SEEN GOLFING WITH UKRAINE GAS COMPANY EXEC BACK IN 2014, PHOTO SHOWS

Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas and Councilman Joe Buscaino drafted a proposal urging Newsom to declare the state of emergency, which could redirect state and federal funds generally reserved for natural disasters like wildfires and earthquakes. It would also suspend some legal red tape that has halted affordable housing and shelter projects.

“Homelessness has ballooned into a crisis of seismic proportions outside of the control of the City of Los Angeles and the cities of the State of California,” wrote Buscaino. “The plight of individuals living on the streets jeopardizes the public health and safety of those individuals and imperils the broader citizenry of the State of California.”

Newsom said in a recent statement that “homelessness is a national emergency that demands more than just words, it demands action.""

In June he signed off on a $214.8 billion dollar budget, allocating $2.4 billion to address the state's housing and homelessness crisis.

However, a report to local lawmakers earlier in the year revealed that Los Angeles alone saw a 16 percent increase in its homeless population over the last year — a blow to Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and other officials working to combat the crisis.

""Throwing money at the problem does not solve the problem. We spent, in Los Angeles alone, $619 million dollars on the homeless epidemic last year. And, that's gotten us nowhere,"" said Lahren. ""Obviously, this is mismanagement of funds. This is failed leadership. And people think by just throwing money at the problem, it will solve the problem. But, it won't.""

""I have been really taking inventory of our leaders and those representatives in these districts,"" she said. ""And, I've been looking at their tweets. They tweet about 10 to 15 times a day.""

Lahren cited specific Twitter accounts including those of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, Rep. Maxine Waters, Rep. Ted Lieu, Rep. Karen Bass, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein.

""Overwhelmingly, it's been about what? About Trump's impeachment!"" she exclaimed.

""Shout out to all of the millennials for staying woke and supporting me all this time I've been warning Congress about Trump and why we needed to impeach him. Remember what I've always said: If you fight, you can win,"" Rep. Waters tweeted last Friday.

Lahren said Waters and her colleagues are doing a ""disservice"" to their constituents.

""Not a single word about something that's happening right here...Something that they should really be coming back to their districts and their state to take inventory of,"" she said. ""And yet, they're on tweeting about how much they hate Donald Trump!"""

""It's going to be hard because the reality is that Republicans are going to cheat. They're going to try to keep people away from the polls, they're going to move polling places, they're going to do a whole variety of things,"" he told ""The Breakfast Club"" radio show.

Holder went on to argue that Republicans were able to suppress voting because of the Supreme Court's decision to strike down part of the Voting Rights Act in 2013.

“Sad, but not surprising, to see that disgraced former Attorney General Eric Holder has taken a break from threatening to 'kick' Republicans to leveling outlandish and baseless accusations against Republicans,” RNC spokesman Steve Guest told Fox News.

Holder's comments echoed those of Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams, who has repeatedly indicated she unfairly lost her gubernatorial race in 2018.

KAMALA HARRIS CLAIMS DEMOCRATS GILLUM, ABRAMS WOULD HAVE WON IN 2018 'WITHOUT VOTER SUPPRESSION'

""For the first time since 1981, the RNC will be allowed to cheat and lie and go into polling places and scare voters, particularly voters of color,"" Abrams said in August, citing the end of a consent decree related to voting.

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel blasted Abrams' comment as a ""flat-out lie."" RNC communications director Michael Ahrens responded by calling Abrams' statements ""totally baseless,"" and claiming that the RNC tried to increase voter turnout.

“What she’s saying is totally baseless and irresponsible,"" he previously said in a statement to Fox News. ""The RNC’s job is getting more people to vote, not less. If Abrams actually cared about the integrity of elections, she’d finally concede the governor’s race she lost by 55,000 votes. Even liberal election law experts have dismissed her claims as irresponsible and without merit.""

Holder has been outspoken since his former boss, President Obama, left office in 2017. He previously provoked Trump's ire when he suggested former First Lady Michelle Obama was too tame in her call to ""go high"" when the GOP goes ""low.""

""No. When they go low, we kick 'em,"" he said. He's also criticized Trump's 2016 campaign slogan and claimed the president could easily face prosecution after leaving office.

During his interview with ""The Breakfast Club"" on Monday, Holder suggested that Trump might try to stay in office to avoid jail time. ""As I've thought about it, I'm thinking ... I think he loses and then it'll be interesting between say November and January when he would have to start packing.""

He added that he wondered whether Trump would attempt to pardon himself. ""I don't think you can do that,"" Holder added, ""but no one's even thought about doing something like that."""

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joe Biden.

The new survey, conducted by the Saint Anselm College Survey Center and released Tuesday, also shows Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont – who crushed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 New Hampshire primary – in a distant third place.

Warren, the populist senator who’s pushed out one progressive policy proposal after another, stands at 25 percent in the survey. Biden, the front-runner in most polls of voters nationwide and in early primary and caucus states since before announced his candidacy in late April, is at 24 percent. The margin between Warren and Biden is well within the poll's margin of error of 4.8 percentage points.

WARREN EDGES BIDEN, SANDERS SLIPS, IN NEW NH PRIMARY POLL

“There remain several months before New Hampshire Democrats cast their primary ballots, but Warren and Biden have clearly separated themselves from the rest of the field,” New Hampshire Institute of Politics executive director Neil Levesque emphasized.

“If the dynamic of Warren as the candidate that best expresses Democratic voters’ policy preferences and Biden as the one who has the best chance of beating Trump sets in with voters, this is likely turning into a two-person race absent a big shake-up,” he added.

Sanders, the populist independent senator, stands at 11 percent in the survey, with South Bend, Ind. Mayor Buttigieg a point back at 10 percent. Sen. Kamala Harris of California registers at 5 percent in the survey to round out the top five.

The poll’s release comes hours after Sanders reported raising a whopping $25.3 million during the July-September third quarter of fundraising, with Buttigieg hauling in $19.1 million and Harris bringing in $11.6 million.

SANDERS HAULS IN AN EYE-POPPING $25 MILLION JULY-SEPT. CAMPAIGN CASH HAUL

Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii are each at 3 percent in the survey. Businessman and billionaire environmental and progressive activist Tom Steyer and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang are each at 2 percent, with Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey at 1 percent. Everyone else sampled came in at less than 1 percent, with 9 percent undecided with just over four months to go until primary day.

Levesque highlighted that “there is still some fluidity in this race, as 65 percent of Warren supporters, 72 percent of Biden supporters, 56 percent of Sanders supporters, and 73 percent of Buttigieg voters indicate that they expect that their choice could change between now and the primary election.”

Among voters who were not firm in their choice of candidate, was the second choice of 26 percent, followed by Biden (12 percent), Buttigieg (11 percent), Sanders and Harris (7 percent each)

Warren also topped the field of candidates on the question of who would make the best president (27 percent, compared to 19 percent who picked Biden). But Biden came out on top when voters were asked who would be the strongest nominee to take on Republican President Donald Trump in next year’s general election (37 percent, compared to 26 percent who picked Warren).

A Monmouth University survey suggests that Biden – one of the co-frontrunners in the Democratic race to face off next year against the president – could suffer some political damage from the Ukrainian allegations that sparked the Democrat-controlled House to formally launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump.

POLL SUGGESTS SUPPORT FOR IMPEACHMENT GROWS, WITH AMERICANS NOW SPLIT

The survey, released Wednesday, indicates that a plurality of voters believed Trump’s accusations against Biden on that issue.

Trump and Biden each face a distinct set of allegations with regard to Ukraine. Trump is under fire from Democrats over his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he urged Zelensky to investigate the Biden family over their dealings in Ukraine. A whistleblower, along with Democrats, argue Trump in essence was asking a foreign country to potentially interfere in a U.S. election.

Trump has denied any wrongdoing and has repeatedly described his phone call with the Ukrainian leader as “perfect.”

At the same time, the president has sought to turn the tables on Biden by highlighting allegations against the former vice president and his son that he wanted investigated.

Biden’s son Hunter served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how Biden pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor – who had been widely accused of overlooking corruption in his own office – was later dismissed. Trump’s re-election campaign last week launched a new TV and digital ad targeting Biden over his alleged actions.

The Monmouth poll indicates that 43 percent of registered voters believe Trump’s claim that Biden did pressure Ukrainian officials to keep them from investigating his son’s business ties, with 37 percent not buying the president’s allegations and one in five unsure.

Among crucial self-identified independent voters, 39 percent believe that Biden pressured Ukrainian officials, with 27 percent disagreeing and a third unsure.

“The fact that 4-in-10 independents are inclined to believe what they have heard from Trump is a warning sign for the Biden campaign. How the candidate fights back against this charge will be crucial to his argument of electability,” Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray said in a statement.

Biden's allies maintain he intervened in Ukraine over corruption concerns, not because of his son's work.

And Biden once again emphasized on Wednesday that ""there’s zero, zero evidence, of any assertion made.""

The survey also spells trouble for Trump, with just four in 10 registered voters continuing to say that the president should be re-elected, compared with 57 percent who say it’s time to have someone new in the White House.

“Trump’s base is sticking with him, but these results suggest that the president remains particularly weak among voting blocs that were crucial to putting him over the top in 2016,” Murray said.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

The survey is also the latest to indicate the race for the Democratic nomination is turning into a two-candidate battle between Biden and progressive champion Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

Warren stands at 28 percent support among self-identified Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent voters, with the former vice president at 25 percent. Warren’s advantage is within the survey’s sampling error.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, the populist independent senator from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House run, stands at 15 percent. Biden, Sanders and Warren were all tied in Monmouth’s previous poll, conducted in August.

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is at 5 percent in the survey, along with Sen. Kamala Harris of California. Tech-entrepreneur Andrew Yang and best-selling spiritual author Marianne Williamson are at 2 percent in the poll, with 11 other contenders in the record-setting Democratic field registering at 1 percent or less.

SANDERS OFF THE TRAIL WITH HEART PROBLEMS

AP: “Bernie Sanders’ campaign says the Democratic presidential candidate has had a heart procedure for a blocked artery. The Vermont senator is canceling events and appearances ‘until further notice.’ The campaign says the 78-year-old Sanders experienced chest discomfort during an event Tuesday and sought medical evaluation. The campaign says two stents were ‘successfully inserted’ and that Sanders ‘is conversing and in good spirits.’ His campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, was on a telephone call with supporters Tuesday night but didn’t mention any health concerns about the candidate. Shakir said the ‘state of the campaign is strong’ and he played up Sanders’ strong fundraising total for the third quarter. Sanders recently canceled some appearances in South Carolina because he lost his voice. The campaign said at the time he felt fine.”



Biden still strong in South Carolina - Greenville [S.C.] News: “The latest Winthrop Poll results are out and South Carolina democratic voters strongly support former Vice President Joe Biden for the presidency, according to the results. Biden drew 37% of the votes among those surveyed. Among African American democrats and democratic-leaning African Americans, Biden earned 46% of the votes, according to the poll. This is the first Winthrop Poll looking at the 2020 primary candidates. Sen. Elizabeth Warren earned 17%, Sen. Bernie Sanders 8%, Sen. Kamala Harris 7% and the remaining 15 candidates each earned less than 5% support in the poll. … The Winthrop Poll is among the list of qualifying polls [for debate qualifications]. Of the remaining 15 candidates, only South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Cory Booker earned at least 3% approval.”



Warren, Biden neck in neck in New Hampshire - WMUR: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren is now in a virtual dead heat with former Vice President Joe Biden in the first-in-the-nation Democratic presidential primary campaign, according to a new poll. The latest Saint Anselm College Center Survey Center poll shows that Warren’s overall upward trajectory is evident in New Hampshire, as it has been recently in national polls. … Sen. Bernie Sanders, the landslide winner of the 2016 Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire, is in third place with 11 percent, essentially tied with South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who was backed by 10 percent of those polled. … Sen. Kamala Harris was the top choice of 5 percent, while U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Sen. Amy Klobuchar received 3 percent each. Philanthropist/activist Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang each received support from 2 percent of those polled, while Sen. Cory Booker was backed by 1 percent.”



Yang brings in big bucks with free money plan - Axios: “2020 candidate Andrew Yang's campaign says it raised $10 million in 2019's third quarter, according to Politico. Why it matters: Yang's Q3 report is more than triple the $2.8 million he raised in the second quarter — a push powered by some strong debate performances that elevated his national profile. The state of play: Yang outpaced Sen. Cory Booker’s $6 million and came close to Sen. Kamala Harris’ $11.6 million. … Yang's campaign said nearly 300,000 people have donated — almost double the threshold required to qualify for the November debate. … Yang's campaign told Politico that it received $1 million in the 72 hours after the September debate in which he announced that he was giving away $120,000 to 10 families over a year to promote signature campaign proposal: universal basic income, branded by Yang as the ‘freedom dividend.’”



HUGE CASH HAUL FOR TRUMP

AP: “President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee raised $125 million in the third quarter of the year, a presidential fundraising record. The pro-Trump effort said Tuesday that it has raised more than $308 million in 2019 and has more than $156 million in the bank. Republicans aim to use the fundraising haul to fight off Democrats’ impeachment effort. Former President Barack Obama and the DNC raised just over $70 million in the third quarter of 2011. ‘President Trump has built a juggernaut of a campaign, raising record amounts of money at a record pace,’ said Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale. RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel credited Democratic attacks on Trump for motivating supporters to donate in record numbers.”



GOP moves to stifle dissent in Charlotte - NYT: “President Trump’s political advisers have concluded a monthslong effort to tighten the rules for choosing delegates to the Republican National Convention, all but ensuring there are no dissenting speeches at the gathering of party officials in Charlotte next year. On Tuesday, state Republican parties submitted to the national committee their delegate allocation plans, the methods by which they will choose and bind delegates who attend the convention as their representatives. In 37 states and territories, there have been changes to the rules that will all but stamp out the possibility of any raucous divide on the convention floor. … The new delegate guidelines are the culmination of a 10-month effort by Trump advisers to strengthen the president’s grip on the Republican Party ahead of the general election. It means that even if the three candidates challenging Mr. Trump in the Republican primary gain vote shares, they almost certainly won’t translate into speeches or jeers from supporters of these candidates when the convention is taking place.”



South Carolina Republicans sue over nixed primary - The [Charleston, S.C.] Post and Courier: “Two Republicans, one of them former congressman Bob Inglis, have sued the S.C. Republican Party over its decision to cancel its GOP presidential primary next year. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in state court in Richland County, alleges the party scrapped its 2020 election contest illegally and violated party rules and state election law. The suit further contends the near-unanimous decision made by the party’s Executive Committee deprives Inglis, of Greenville, and fellow plaintiff Frank Heindel of Mount Pleasant, of their right to vote for the candidate of their choosing in a primary. … The suit comes after the Executive Committee met Sept. 7 in Columbia and voted to forgo a presidential primary. The move effectively cleared the way for Republican incumbent President Donald Trump to receive all of the state’s nominating delegates without contest.”



THE RULEBOOK: POPULISM 101

“By a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 10



TIME OUT: WHAT A BUNCH OF CRETANS

NatGeo: “Deep inside the Labyrinth on the island of Crete lived a Minotaur, a monster half man, half bull. … The story of the Minotaur has thrilled people for thousands of years and inspired myriad works of art: pottery, poetry, plays, the art of Picasso, operas, movies, and video games. Although the myth can be enjoyed as a satisfying tale, archaeologists now know that its fabulous qualities have roots deep in real events in the Bronze Age. The bull-headed man in Minos’s maze embodies several traits found in the culture of Crete and ancient Minoan civilization. Bulls and maze motifs are found throughout Minoan culture, which dominated the Mediterranean from about 3000 B.C. to about 1100 B.C. In confronting and overcoming the bull—a symbol of Crete—Theseus, the legendary founder of Athens, reflects the flowering of Aegean civilizations beginning in the middle of the second millennium B.C., as mainland Greece replaced Crete as the dominant power.”

TRUMP’S TEAM EMBRACES ‘COUP’ CLAIM

Mediaite: “President Donald Trump decried the House of Representatives’ impeachment inquiry as a ‘coup,’ and it looks like his campaign is embracing that rhetoric to blast Democrats. Trump echoed similar comments made on Fox News in the past few days, including from trade advisor Peter Navarro this week. And now Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted this afternoon Democrats should be working on policies ‘that help America instead of trying to overthrow our government with a coup’ And the Trump campaign has a new ad out today — called ‘Coup’ — accusing Democrats of orchestrating ‘nothing short of a coup’ against the president.”



Senate GOP could take up impeachment only to drop it - NYT: “Senator Mitch McConnell’s comment this week that the Senate would be forced to ‘take up’ articles of impeachment from the House had the capital in a swirl, bracing for a full-blown Senate trial of President Trump. But as things now stand, any trial would likely be swift, ending in dismissal of the accusations. While the focus was on the statement by Mr. McConnell, the majority leader, that the Senate would have ‘no choice’ but to begin an impeachment proceeding, it was his next line that might have been more telling: ‘How long you are on it is a whole different matter.’ The fusty rules of the Senate make clear that Republicans could not unilaterally stonewall articles of impeachment of Mr. Trump as they did the Supreme Court nomination of Merrick B. Garland. But Mr. McConnell’s declaration suggests the Republican-controlled Senate could move expeditiously to toss them out if Republicans conclude the House impeachment is meritless, or a strictly partisan affair.”



Steyer PAC spends big to target Republican senators on impeachment - WaPo: “A group pushing for the impeachment of President Trump is launching a $3.1 million ad campaign targeting Republican senators over the coming weeks as pro-impeachment activists turn their fire away from Democratic holdouts and toward members of the president’s own party. The group, Need to Impeach, is funded mainly by billionaire Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer. Top executives said Tuesday that more than half of the ad campaign money will go toward television spots, with the rest underwriting digital ads. The campaign will focus on Republican Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Cory Gardner (Colo.) and Martha McSally (Ariz.), all of whom are seeking reelection next year and could cast votes in the coming months on whether Trump should be removed from office.”



Cheney sends House Republicans home with talking points - WashEx: “Republican leaders in the House of Representatives sent the rank-and-file home with one overriding message to deliver to voters in their districts: There is no evidence that warrants an impeachment inquiry into President Trump. The bulleted talking points, prepared by Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, also attack House Democrats as disorganized and the impeachment process as illegitimate, primarily because Nancy Pelosi declined to hold a floor vote on whether to open the inquiry. Cheney argues in her messaging guidance that Democrats have been intent on impeaching Trump for more than two years. An investigation into Trump's harmless telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, she asserts, is just the Democrats' latest excuse to justify their attempt to undo the 2016 election.”



PETE SESSIONS GOES DISTRICT SHOPPING

Texas Tribune: “Former Republican U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions appears poised to make a comeback attempt — but not in his old Dallas-based district. Sessions, who lost reelection last year, plans to announce Thursday he's running for the seat being vacated by retiring U.S. Rep. Bill Flores, according to McLennan County GOP Chairman Jon R. Ker. The announcement will be at the county party headquarters in Waco, added Ker, who said he spoke with Sessions on Tuesday. Sessions' anticipated run is a surprise development after he spent months publicly flirting with running for his previous 32nd District seat, which is about 80 miles north of Flores' more Republican 17th District. The initial reaction ‘has not been positive,’ Flores told The Texas Tribune late Tuesday. ‘Pete is a friend of mine, but I wish he'd called me first,’ said Flores, R-Bryan. ‘I could have provided some valuable feedback to him.’”



Tenney signs up for rematch to reclaim seat - Roll Call: “Former Rep. Claudia Tenney, one of President Donald Trump’s most vocal supporters last Congress, announced Tuesday she will run for her old seat in New York’s 22nd District. Tenney lost by less than 2 percentage points in the 2018 midterms to Democratic Rep. Anthony Brindisi despite running one of the most pro-Trump campaigns of any vulnerable House Republican. The president carried New York’s 22nd District by 15 percentage points in 2016. ‘Upstate New York deserves a representative who will fight for their values in Congress, someone who will work to deliver actual results, not resistance,’ Tenney said in a press release Tuesday.”



Lewandowski shies from Senate run - Politico: “Corey Lewandowski told a local radio host Tuesday ‘it’s fair’ to say he is reconsidering a Senate run in order to defend President Donald Trump from impeachment and help him get reelected. ‘As much as I think I would be a great fighter for the people of New Hampshire, and one U.S. senator can make a difference, it is my priority to make sure the president of United States is reelected,’ Lewandowski said on the radio show, ‘New Hampshire Today with Jack Heath.’ ‘That's a top priority.’ The president's brash and outspoken former campaign manager would have to go up against three other Republicans looking to unseat Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.”

“You don't really want to identify with anybody on that show. The only character with any kind of moral purity to them is Gary, the body guy. But it's not like you really want to be him.” – Mayor Pete Buttigieg when asked which character from HBO’s Veep he relate most to during an interview with the Hollywood Reporter.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Just curious about the railroad spike on the trophy plaque behind you.” – Martin Jarvis, Wright City, Mo.



[Ed. note: Now that’s what I call observant viewership, Mr. Jarvis! Other viewers of our show on Fox Nation may have seen that simple wooden board with a rusty railroad spike behind me. It is from the Monongha Mine in Marion County, W.Va., the scene of the worst mine disaster in American history. On Dec. 6, 1907 at least 362 men were killed when the poorly-ventilated mine filled with methane gas, which exploded with terrible force, killing almost all instantly. Any effort to evacuate the mine would have been badly complicated by a language barrier. The lion’s share of the miners were Italian immigrants, but there would have been Hungarians, Czechs and other non-English speakers working in crews of their own, making it hard for English-speaking foremen to direct an escape as the inferno spread from section to section. The blast collapsed much of the roof and destroyed the rail lines in and out of the mine. That spike came from one of those shattered rail ties and was given long ago to my father, a coal salesman, by a West Virginia coal operator whose own father had saved it after the explosion. I love the way it looks and it goes along with some other ancient mine memorabilia in my office, including a carbide lamp miner’s helmet. But I also love it as a memento of how much I have to be thankful for. My work here in this comfortable, air-conditioned office is safe, well-compensated and personally rewarding. It’s a far cry from the coal pits where so many men toiled and sometimes died. That little spike reminds me of who I am, where I’m from, my dear old dad and, most of all, to be grateful.]

DANA PERINO WANTED FOR QUESTIONING

CBS12: “A man in Fort Lauderdale is accused of tampering with dozens of electric scooters. Authorities have been investigating the vandalism of more than 140 scooters since April. One incident is caught on surveillance video, which police released to the public in an effort to identify a suspect. The investigation led to the arrest of 59-year-old Randall Thomas Williams. Police said they found 20 scooters nearby with severed brake lines. Police say Williams is the one who cut the brake lines on the scooters. He faces criminal mischief charges. Investigators have not revealed a motive. Police are asking anyone who finds an electric scooter that appears to have been tampered with to contact the vendor.”

He was shot and killed Friday after he stopped a vehicle with two people inside at around 12:45 p.m. One of the occupants was able to leave the vehicle, approach the deputy from behind and shoot him at least twice — ""basically just shot him in a very ruthless, cold-blooded way,"" Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said.

Robert Solis, 47, has been charged with capital murder in Dhaliwal's death, police said.

SUPPORT FOR IMPEACHMENT JUMPS 10 POINTS

Quinnipiac University: “American voters are divided on impeaching and removing President Trump from office, 47 - 47 percent - closing a 20 point gap from less than a week ago, according to a Quinnipiac University Poll released [Monday]. In the poll released on September 25th, voters said that the president should not be impeached and removed 57 - 37 percent. Among the political party subgroups, Democrats showed the greatest change from the last poll. [Monday], they show a virtual consensus on impeaching Trump, 90 - 5 percent, while last week they said Trump should be impeached 73 - 21 percent. … While voters are split on impeaching and removing President Trump from office, a slim majority of registered voters do approve of the impeachment inquiry opened by the U.S. House of Representatives 52 - 45 percent. Approval includes half of independents, who are split 50 - 45 percent on the inquiry.”



No change in job approval - Monmouth University: “President Donald Trump’s approval rating has remained steady in the wake of an official impeachment inquiry launched last week, although support for impeachment has ticked up slightly. In a two year Monmouth University Poll trend on impeachment opinion the current findings are not out of line with some prior results. … Trump’s overall job rating stands at 41% approve and 53% disapprove, which is similar to his 40% to 53% rating in August. … At this time, 44% of Americans feel that Trump should be impeached and compelled to leave the presidency, while 52% disagree with this course of action. These numbers mark a shift from Monmouth’s prior poll in August (35% supported impeachment and 59% did not), but it is not the first time these results have been found in the two years Monmouth has been asking this question.”



The war room is the Oval Office - Politico: “A week after House Democrats jump-started their impeachment inquiry, the White House has yet to converge on any single plan, strategy or even unified messaging to fight back. All the talk about setting up a so-called war room inside the West Wing, similar to the approach of the Clinton White House, has gone nowhere. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, other top aides, lawyers and Trump advisers have been jockeying among their own internal factions for control of the approach or messaging. … The infighting over the fate of a war room reflects the long-standing operational styles of the Trump White House and 2016 campaign over the past four years, during which personnel battles often overshadowed any well-honed strategy. The president has always preferred to run his White House with a team-of-rivals approach, with aides fighting over various policies or political options and Trump alone as the decider at the center of the action. The impeachment battle may be no different.”



Giuliani called to testify - Fox News: “The chairmen of three House committees subpoenaed President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani on Monday for key documents related to the Ukraine controversy as part of their formal impeachment inquiry against Trump. ‘Pursuant to the House of Representatives’ impeachment inquiry, we are hereby transmitting a subpoena that compels you to produce the documents set forth in the accompanying schedule by October 15, 2019,’ Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel and Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, all Democrats, wrote. … The committee chairs subpoenaed Giuliani after claiming he admitted to being ‘in possession of evidence — in the form of text messages, phone records, and other communications — indicating that you were not acting alone and that other Trump administration officials may have been involved in this scheme.’”

Pittsburgh Quarterly: “It’s generally regarded as the most famous sports photo in the world. The truth is, it’s a great photo that just happens to be about sports. It hangs in the Smithsonian. It hangs in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. And at the National Press Photographers Association headquarters at the University of Georgia journalism school, it hangs in a place of special honor with four other photos of epic moments in history­ — President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signing the declaration of war in 1941; Huey Long, the controversial Louisiana politician, making a campaign speech; the skeletal Hindenberg being consumed in a hellish inferno, and Marines raising the flag at Iwo Jima. How could a photo like this not win a Pulitzer? Because the Post-​Gazette didn’t run it. And how could any paper not publish a photo of this magnitude? There are various stories on that. This is the true story.”

BERNIE BANKS BIG CASH, BUT BUTTIGIEG WOWS

WaPo: “Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) raised $25.3 million during the past three months for his White House bid, his campaign said Tuesday, fueled by an army of low-dollar donors to post the largest quarterly haul so far this year among the Democratic presidential contenders. Sanders transferred an additional $2.6 million from his other federal campaign accounts, the campaign said. The third-quarter figures announced by the campaign rival his $26 million haul at this point in the primary campaign in 2015, when he stunned the Democratic field by nearly matching the total of his opponent, Hillary Clinton, with an infusion of money from donors giving less than $200. Yet this time, he is facing more than a dozen opponents. One of them, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, announced early Tuesday that his campaign raised more than $19.1 million in the third quarter — less than Sanders did but an amount that gives him staying power in a crowded field.”



Harris shuffles staff as candidacy flounders - Politico: “Kamala Harris is shaking up the top ranks of her presidential campaign, the latest sign her once-promising bid is failing to meet expectations. The staff moves amount to a significant reorganization for a campaign that’s dropped so far in polls that it risks becoming a postscript in the Democratic primary. Harris’ light early-state schedule, hiccups on the trail and lack of consistency in delivering her message have consumed much of the attention and blame for her mounting struggles. Behind the scenes, aides said a lack of clarity among staff surrounding the roles of Campaign Manager Juan Rodriguez and Campaign Chair Maya Harris, the candidate’s sister, and inexperience across the organization are feeding a growing sense of indecision and aimlessness inside the campaign. … The campaign did not start holding regular senior staff meetings until September — nine months after launching — leading to a lack of coordination across departments.”



GOP FUNDRAISING PLATFORM OPENS BIG

Fox News: “WinRed, the new GOP online fundraising platform designed to compete with Democrats in the battle for small-dollar campaign donations, has raised more than $30 million since launching three months ago, with top officials crediting the Democrats’ impeachment push for a big spike in fundraising over the last week, Fox News has learned. WinRed raised just over $30 million in the third fundraising quarter, which began in July and ended Monday. The online platform is used to raise money for President Trump’s re-election, campaign committees and various Republican candidates across the country. In an interview, WinRed's president, Gerrit Lansing, said the Democrats’ moves to ramp up impeachment efforts against Trump ‘helped a lot,’ saying fundraising numbers ‘spiked’ after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s announcement of a formal inquiry last week. WinRed has raised over $13.7 million from over 276,000 contributors since the announcement from Pelosi, D-Calif., he said.”



ZUCK TELLS WORKERS HE’D BATTLE WARREN

Fox News: “Leaked audio comments from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly include him saying that the tech company would likely have no choice but to sue the U.S. government to stave off being broken up if Elizabeth Warren becomes president. The comments, obtained by The Verge, span a wide range of topics and deep insight into Zuckerberg's thinking, going much further than the usually stoic CEO appears in public. ‘You have someone like Elizabeth Warren thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies … I mean, if she gets elected president then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,’ Zuckerberg is quoted as saying in two Q&A sessions with Facebook employees during July.”



Court upholds 2017 ruling cancelling net neutrality rules - WaPo: “A federal appeals court on Tuesday affirmed that the Federal Communications Commission acted lawfully when it scrapped the U.S. government’s net neutrality rules in 2017, but it opened the door for state and local governments to introduce their own regulations designed to treat all web traffic equally. … In a nearly 200-page opinion, judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals largely sided with the Federal Communications Commission and its Republican chairman, Ajit Pai. While the agency must return to the drawing board on some elements of its repeal, the court upheld the breadth of its work, finding that net neutrality supporters had made ‘unconvincing’ arguments in their efforts to override the FCC’s deregulation of companies such as AT&T, Comcast and Verizon.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“‘….you might even find some historians with strong feelings about what happened to old Andy Johnson.’ I’m one of those historians. His impeachment in 1868 was purely political because the radical republicans didn’t like a Democrat who didn’t share their views on implementing a harsh Reconstruction on the Old Confederacy. In fact one of the 11 articles of impeachment included a notation that he was unable to get along with the Congress (or words to that effect). All the other impeachments – Nixon, Clinton – involved criminal activity by the President. Now it appears we have another Johnsonian impeachment looming. The only thing that saved Johnson was the lobbying by Thomas Ewing Jr. of Kansas Senator Edmund Ross. Ewing was a well-known lobbyist in Washington after the war and had defended several of the Lincoln conspirators (Dr. Mudd). Ross was a radical republican who ended up being the key vote against impeachment. Ewing was Ross’ old commanding officer in the 11th Kansas Infantry during the Civil War.” – Ron Smith, Larned, Kan.



[Ed. note: I knew you were out there somewhere, Mr. Smith! Thank you for sharing that fabulous Kansas fact. I would only quibble with your assessment to say this: All impeachments are political. It is the nature of the enterprise. Now, I certainly agree that what the radical Republicans did to Johnson was pretty shoddy, he was also a spectacularly terrible president. He did not need to take the bait that Congress put out in front of him. Our point in discussing impeachment is that many presidents have done rotten things and not been impeached for them and a few presidents have done rotten things and been impeached for them. It is an entirely subjective decision.]



“Thank you for your 9/26/19 article regarding your plan to cover the politics at play in the upcoming impeachment inquiry, in an unbiased manner. As a long time reader, I've always appreciated your fairness when reporting on events that are very charged with emotion for much of us. I am a liberal Democrat, so clearly I'm not a supporter of President Trump. So it is very easy to get drawn into the ‘echo chamber’ at times, even though I try my best to resist. Your newsletter certainly helps me to be able to appreciate the views on both sides, even if I don't agree. I look forward to your upcoming articles, during what is sure to be a very painful and frustrating period for both ‘teams.’” – Holly Stilo, Lawrenceville, Ga.



[Ed. note: Thank you so much for your kind words, Ms. Stilo. It is quite pleasant to not be a “team” player at times like this. I wish for the health of the republic and all good things for my countrymen, but we have reached a saturation point with the negative partisanship that pervades our system. It’s time for the teams to fight it out. We will be here to watch the festivities and will endeavor to keep a level head throughout.]



“…I get tired of hearing everybody blaming the current political dysfunction on Trump. They are missing the point. In 2016 the Cubs won the World Series, irreparably damaging the space-time continuum and creating chaos in the universe and calling into question the meaning of life itself. Shortly thereafter, Trump was elected President of the United States. I leave it to you: Trump or the Cubs?” – George Fuller, St. Louis

AP: “Motorists traveling through a Detroit suburb were stunned to see a pornographic video playing on an electronic billboard. Auburn Hills police say the video played on the billboard along Interstate 75 in Oakland County for about 30 minutes Saturday night before the images were removed. Many people called 911. Chuck McMahon says he saw the video and wondered if the billboard was advertising for a strip club. Investigators tell WDIV-TV that two people apparently broke into a small building at the site and loaded porn on a laptop that’s connected to the billboard. Two men wearing hooded sweatshirts were spotted on security video. Police are asking the public to help identify them. Dr. Justin Kammo also saw the video. He says he immediately assumed that ‘someone had hacked it.’”

NEW YORK – October 1, 2019 – FOX News Channel (FNC) finished the third quarter of 2019 marking 71 consecutive quarters as the most-watched cable news network in total day and primetime among total viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. During 3Q’19, FNC averaged 1.4 million viewers and 230,000 with A25-54 in total day. In primetime, FNC delivered 2.4 million viewers and 366,000 in the 25-54 demographic, notching 46 consecutive quarters as the top-rated cable news channel in prime with A25-54 and besting MSNBC and CNN across the board.

Once again, FNC had double-digit percent advantages over MSNBC and CNN in both categories, as well as triple-digit percent advantages over CNN in primetime total viewers. Notably, among all of basic cable, FNC was the most-watched network across both total day and primetime, marking 13 consecutive quarters in the top spot in total day.

In September, FNC continued to rank number one with cable news in total day with 1.4 million viewers and primetime with 2.4 million viewers for the 213th consecutive month. Additionally, FNC finished September as the highest-rated network in all of cable for the 39th month in a row in total viewers and landed the top spot in total viewers for primetime.

In third quarter 2019, the network claimed 10 of the top 15 cable news programs in total viewers and 10 of the top 15 in the 25-54 demo. Notching four of the top five shows in cable news in both categories, FNC’s evening and primetime programs dominated the quarter, including Hannity (9PM/ET) as the number one program in all of cable news among total viewers and the demo with 3.3 million and 510,000 viewers, respectively. On MSNBC, The Rachel Maddow Show at 9PM/ET ranked 4th place for the quarter, marking her lowest-rated demo since 2Q’16 and lowest-rated viewership since 1Q’17. At 8PM/ET, Tucker Carlson Tonight came in second place with 3.1 million viewers and 494,000 in the 25-54 demo, outpacing the competition combined in total viewers.

Continuing to dominate CNN’s New Day, which marked its lowest-rated demo since 3Q’ 2015, FOX & Friends more than tripled the failing New Day with Alisyn Camerota & John Berman for the 2nd quarter in a row. Furthermore, FOX & Friends defeated New Day and Morning Joe combined with A25-54.

At 1PM/ET, Outnumbered Overtime anchored by Harris Faulkner averaged 1.3 million viewers and 211,000 in the 25-54 demo, beating ABC’s GMA3 in total viewers a record 25 times over the course of the entire quarter and beat the broadcast show most often over the last several weeks after they added a third new cohost. Most notably, August 21st marked the first time ever that Faulkner topped the broadcast show, which just underwent its third name change, in both categories with a 26 percent advantage in total viewers and notching 271,000 in the demo vs. ABC’s 270,000.

“As of October 1, there were 19 Alabama residents under investigation. Of the 19 reports, 4 cases have been identified and 9 other reports are still under investigation in Alabama; 3 have been identified as probable cases; 1 confirmed case (the deceased), of lung disease associated with vaping,” officials with the state’s health department said in a news release.

“The use of any tobacco product is unsafe. While this current outbreak is being investigated, the safest option is to refrain from using any e-cigarette or vape product. Furthermore, there is no situation in which these devices should be used by pregnant women or youths,” said State Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris, in a statement.

To date, there have been 15 vaping-linked deaths in the U.S. Federal health officials – namely those with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) – are still investigating the cause behind the 805 vaping-related lung illness cases reported across 46 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

MOM LEFT WITH GAPING HOLE IN FOOT AFTER SUSPECTED WART REVEALED TO BE CANCER

Late last week, the CDC described a possible link between the current outbreak of vaping-related lung injuries and the use of THC-containing vaping products.

The CDC’s findings indicated that out of 514 patients with suspected vaping-related illnesses, 77 reported that they had been using products containing THC, or using both nicotine- and THC-containing products.

Additionally, a recent Washington Post investigation concluded that the illnesses affecting hundreds of Americans may be linked to black-market vaping products, some of which are allegedly cut with vitamin E acetate.

However, federal health officials have not yet linked the illnesses to a specific product, substance or additive.

The news of the Alabama resident’s death comes after New Jersey and Nebraska health officials announced the first deaths linked to vaping in their respective states."

A grand jury indictment -- it was unsealed in Los Angeles on Wednesday -- accuses the men of conspiring and distributing cocaine and oxycodone pills laced with fentanyl. The drugs are thought to have caused Miller’s death in September 2018.

Cameron Pettit, 28, of West Hollywood, Calif.; Stephen Walter, 46, of Los Angeles; and Ryan Reavis, 36, of Lake Havasu City, Ariz., were previously charged with drug-related offenses. Wednesday’s charges add the allegation that their drugs led to the performer's death.

MAC MILLER DIED FROM MIX OF FENTANYL, COCAINE AND ETHANOL, CORONER SAYS

All have been arrested in recent weeks and remain in custody. None have entered a plea.

Miller -- his real name was Malcolm James Myers McCormick -- died of an accidental overdose of the powerful opioid fentanyl, along with cocaine and alcohol. He was 26.

The indictment alleges that Walter supplied the fentanyl and cocaine that Pettit sold to Miller, and that Reavis, who lived in the Los Angeles area until earlier this year, acted as a middleman for the fentanyl sale.

RAPPER MAC MILLER DEAD AT 26

According to the indictment, on Sept. 5, 2018, Pettit allegedly sold Miller cocaine, Xanax and 10 blue pills -- reportedly oxycodone, but also containing fentanyl -- after the two had exchanged text messages a day earlier.

Two days later, Miller’s assistant found him dead at his Los Angeles home.

Walter’s attorney, William S. Harris, told The Associated Press he was reviewing the indictment and other elements of the case, and could not immediately comment. An attorney for Pettit did not immediately respond to an email from AP seeking comment. According to the outlet, it’s unclear whether Reavis has secured a lawyer.

Pettit and Walter -- who, per AP, was also charged with being a felon in possession of ammunition -- are scheduled to be arraigned on the new charges on Oct. 10. Reavis, who was arrested last week in Arizona, does not yet have an arraignment date.

The men face a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in federal prison and the potential for life without parole if convicted of either of the charges related to Miller’s death.

The 37-year-old actress wasted no time explaining to reporters during the Television Critics Association summer press tour just how influential Tom Cruise was showing her the ropes in the stunt world as she prepared for her role in the exciting, high-action police drama “Stumptown.”

COBIE SMULDERS REVEALS SHE HAD OVARIAN CANCER AT AGE 25

“Yeah, I mean when I worked with Tom [Cruise] on '[Jack] Reacher,' that was when I learned the most I had up until then about training, about fighting, about stunts, about how to do everything safely because he was such a pro at just doing everything correctly and really well,” Smulders said about acting alongside the “Top Gun” franchise star in “Jack Reacher: Never Go Back.”

The longtime Marvel mainstay, who portrayed S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria Hill in six Marvel Cinematic Universe films, beginning with the “Avengers,” said her “Stumptown” role was perfect for her, especially considering her character Dex Parios is a quick-witted army veteran-turned-private investigator.

“Everything about her challenges me but that's what excites me,” Smulders told reporters. “It doesn't make me afraid. I mean, it's physically wearing but you're not really getting hurt. If you if you're getting hurt, someone's not doing their job right.”

Smulders, 37, whose husband comedian and actor Taran Killam, 37, is a series regular on fellow ABC show “Single Parents,” said she was even more drawn to Dex because of her willingness to fearlessly say what’s on her mind.

COBIE SMULDERS EXPLAINS WHY SHE POSED TOPLESS

“I just like her. I like the way that she rolls with however she's feeling, you know,” Smulders explained. “I like playing sort of a sexually ambiguous woman on network television. I like that she's sort of her own boss. I like that she just doesn't really have – there are no rules for her. So that excited me.”

The “How I Met Your Mother” alum continued: “We're still trying to figure out the tone of this right because there is a certain, you know, P.I. way of talking, you know. Kind of like this sassy one-liner, which I don't think kind of – it doesn't fit quite right but there is a moment and a place for it or to take that rhythm and modernize it.”

“So it's usually her humor is coming situationally. But I think that there will be opportunities. For there's a lot of physical comedy but then also just really funny lines,” she added.

But for Smulders – it was the quality of life she sought and, in becoming an executive producer on the graphic-novel-adapted series, Smulders is happy that she can spend more time with her family.

COBIE SMULDERS SHARES HER STAY-FIT TRICKS

""First of all, it's such a blessing I was on 'How I Met Your Mother' for so long and that's shot in Los Angeles and I was allowed to have a life in the city,” she said. “And I've been off of it for five years now and traveling so much, I just feel that it takes a hit to a family. But it's so nice – there are going to be really long hours and it's going to be really physically draining but I get to go and sleep in my own bed and my child will probably come at 6 a.m. into that bed.”

Smulders told reporters she looks forward to her daughters Shaelyn, 10, and Janita, 4, being able to witness their mother in her element and even said she’s teaching them how to perform stunts of their own just in case the rough-housing gets a little out of hand.

“There are certainly sacrifices, but also it excites me I have two girls and it's exciting for them to see their mother having a career and having dreams and fulfilling goals,"" she said. ""That's what I tell myself anyways to sleep at night. You do your best and I'm a very hands-on parent and everybody who's involved in this project knows that and has been extremely accommodating thus far.""

When asked how her daughters usually react to seeing their mother fake being battered and bruised after an intense fight scene, Smulders added: “I walk them through how to do stunts, how to make it look real but it's not really.”

CLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM

“Quite honestly, they don't watch a lot of television,” she continued. “I don't think they've seen an episode of 'How I Met Your Mother' or anything from the 'Avengers.' They're still really little and they don't see that on me in person. So I try to explain sort of the choreography involved and that actually is kind of – like it's funny to them.”

“Stumptown,” which also stars Michael Ealy as Det. Miles Hoffman and Smulders’ love interest, airs Wednesdays at 10 p.m. EST on ABC."

* Kamala Harris, meanwhile, raised $11.6 million between July and September, which is awfully close to the $11.8 million she raised in the second quarter.

* Former Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.), whose 2020 presidential campaign has struggled to gain traction, has reportedly lost four key aides, including his state directors in Iowa and New Hampshire.

* Joe Biden’s campaign released a new plan on gun policy today, which includes an assault-weapons ban. Under the blueprint, those Americans who already own assault weapons would be required to either register the weapons or sell them to the government.

* Speaking of new 2020 plans, Elizabeth Warren’s campaign unveiled a new proposal this morning that would tax lobbying: “Under her proposal, companies that spend between $500,000 and $1 million a year on lobbying would pay a 35% tax on their expenditures. The rate would increase to 60% for spending of more than $1 million, and to 75% above $5 million.”

* And finally, Donald Trump last week told a rather detailed story about CNN building a multi-million-dollar studio in North Carolina’s 9th congressional district, which he said the network intended to keep up “for weeks” if the Democratic candidate won in a recent special election. Like so many of the president’s bizarre anecdotes, the story was completely made up and had no basis in reality."

WARREN LAUGHS OFF HARRIS SUGGESTION TO BOOT TRUMP FROM TWITTER

And Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts offered a simple ""no"" when asked by reporters if she thought the Republican president should be booted from Twitter. The Massachusetts Democrat chuckled as she gave her one-word answer on Wednesday.

Harris called this week for the president’s Twitter account to be shut down. This followed a storm of tweets by Trump critical of the whistleblower who filed a complaint against him over the Ukraine controversy. That controversy has spurred a House impeachment inquiry.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Trump, in a tweet, also questioned whether House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff should be arrested for “treason.” And on Wednesday he called the House Democrats' investigation “BULLS---"" in one tweet and a ""COUP"" in another.

“The words of a president matter. Trump has again shown he is irresponsible and endangering others with his tweets. He should lose the privilege to be on Twitter,” Harris wrote on Twitter on Monday.

She urged Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to take action.

Gabbard's comments weren't the first time she's disagreed with Harris.

The two candidates clashed in a viral moment at July’s Democratic primary debate, when Gabbard took aim at the former California attorney general over her record as a prosecutor.

Asked if her pushback against Harris’ suggestion to suspend Trump from Twitter was personal, Gabbard quickly answered, “No. I don’t know why anyone would think that.”"

KAMALA HARRIS CALLS FOR SUSPENSION OF TRUMP'S TWITTER ACCOUNT AMID WHISTLEBLOWER TWEETS

The California Democrat initially called for Trump to be suspended on Monday in reaction to his attacks on the whistleblower who shed a light on his communications with Ukraine.

""The president's tweets and his behaviors about this are just further evidence of the fact that he uses his power in a way that is designed to beat people down instead of lift people up,"" Harris said on CNN.

Biden’s haul is a drop of more than $6 million from the $21.5 million he raised in the April-June second quarter of fundraising, and is far behind the $25.3 million that nomination rival Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont brought in the past three months. It’s also less than the $19.1 million that South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg raised in the third quarter.

SANDERS HAULS IN AN EYE-POPPING $25.3 MILLION IN THIRD QUARTER

Highlighting the numbers, Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz noted that “today’s fundraising totals put the campaign in a strong position as we enter the fall. The question any campaign faces at this point is whether or not you have the resources to compete in early states and sustain your efforts beyond. Our campaign unequivocally does, and builds on our strength each week.”

The Biden camp emphasized that 98 percent of all donations were from grassroots donors giving $200 or less, and that 56 percent of contributors in the past three months were new to the campaign.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California reported bringing in $11.6 million in the third quarter, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang hauling in $10 million, triple what he raised in the second quarter. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey announced he raised over $6 million.

Best-selling spiritual author Marianne Williamson said she raised over $3 million and Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado reported raising $2.1 million.

Among those yet to report third-quarter fundraising figures is Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is tied with Biden for the lead position in most the recent national and early-voting-state Democratic nomination polls.

President Trump’s reelection team announced that it and the Republican National Committee combined had brought in a massive $125 million in the third quarter.

The Democratic National Committee (DNC) on Wednesday announced the lineup for their Oct. 15 fourth-round presidential primary debate, and as expected, 12 candidates have qualified, meeting the polling and fundraising criteria.

That means the showdown will be the largest in presidential primary history, topping the 11 Republicans who faced off in a primary debate in September 2015, according to political research from Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a political newsletter and website.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

The dozen Democratic White House contenders who made the cut are – in alphabetical order – former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; businessman and environmental advocate Tom Steyer; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

The first two rounds of debates in June and July – with lower qualifying thresholds – were held over two consecutive nights with 10 candidates on the stage each evening. The thresholds were raised for the third-round debate, resulting in 10 candidates facing off on one night.

The DNC announced last week that the fourth-round debate would also be held on a single night. The 10 contenders who faced off in September automatically qualified for the October debate. And Gabbard and Steyer, who narrowly missed the September cut, reached the thresholds to qualify for the upcoming showdown by Tuesday’s deadline.

Twelve candidates on the same stage at the same time could make for an unwieldy debate and a lot of jockeying for time and attention.

Steyer told Fox News on Wednesday that “the DNC makes decisions and I try not to think about them.”

He emphasized that “the debates are a huge opportunity and that’s how I hope to use them,” but he also acknowledged that “if there are more people on the stage, then it’s harder, and I just have to deal with that.”

The Oct. 15 debate will be held at Otterbein University, a liberal arts institution in Westerville, Ohio. The DNC’s media partners for the showdown are CNN and The New York Times."

Christopher P. Hasson, 50, admitted to all four charges against him -- illegally possessing unregistered silencers, illegally possessing unserialized silencers, possession of a firearm by an unlawful user or addict of a controlled substance and illegal possession of a controlled substance -- in federal court in Greenbelt, Md.

He was not charged with any terror-related crimes.

The Coast Guard lieutenant was arrested in February in his Silver Spring, Md., home, where authorities said they found a stockpile of weapons, including 15 guns, smoke grenades, silencers and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, the opioid painkiller Tramadol and other items.

Federal prosecutors allege Hasson compiled a spreadsheet of names he planned to target and claimed the self-described white nationalist was hell-bent on the ""murder [of] innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country.""

COAST GUARD OFFICER ORDERED TO JAIL, ACCUSED OF BEING 'DOMESTIC TERRORIST'

After Thursday's hearing, Hasson's public defender said the case had been “mischaracterized and sensationalized.”

Liz Oyer said Hasson “was not plotting a terrorist attack or any of the abhorrent acts that the prosecution has repeatedly speculated about but never actually charged.”

Some of the prominent figures whose names were listed on Hasson's spreadsheet included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.; Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.; and Democratic presidential hopefuls Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris.

Several cable TV personalities, including MSNBC's Chris Hayes and Joe Scarborough and CNN's Chris Cuomo and Van Jones were also mentioned.

Investigators said Hasson searched for Scarborough’s home address in January and Googled “best place in dc to see congress people” and “civil war if trump impeached,"" according to The Washington Post.

Prosecutors said he also targeted two unidentified Supreme Court justices and two social media executives and also searched for their home addresses online.

Investigators said Hasson appeared to be inspired by Anders Behring Breivik, a Norwegian right-wing extremist who killed 77 people in a 2011 bomb attack and shooting rampage.

His lawyers filed a request last week to bar prosecutors from introducing evidence linking him to white supremacist views or associations. In 2017, Hasson wrote to a Nazi leader where he advocated for ""'focused violence' in order to establish a white homeland,"" according to prosecutors.

Hasson, who had served in the Marines, worked at Coast Guard headquarters in Washington as an acquisition officer to acquire advanced new cutters for the agency. He faces up to 31 years in prison when he is sentenced Jan. 31.

Yang’s campaign also reported $6.3 million cash on hand as of the end of September and noted that the funds will go towards building up staff and infrastructure in the early voting primary and caucus states.

""Andrew Yang is the only contender showing exponential growth in the third quarter, more than tripling his fundraising number from last quarter,"" campaign manager Zach Graumann touted. ""This grassroots fundraising total, with over $6m in the bank, ensures this campaign will have the funding to compete and outperform expectations through Super Tuesday and beyond.""

Yang has become a serious contender for the Democratic nomination thanks to the popularity of his so-called ""Freedom Dividend."" That’s Yang’s universal basic income proposal to give each adult American $1,000 a month to ease the economic pain stemming from lost jobs due to automation and artificial intelligence. He says he’ll pay for the program by implementing a national value-added tax.

YANG'S CAMPAIGN CASH GIVEAWAYS RAISE LEGAL CONCERNS

He's also built a strong and devout base of grassroots supporters and donors, known as the Yang Gang. Thanks to his fundraising prowess and polling, Yang has made the stage for all the Democratic primary debates to date, something that some better-known governors and senators failed to do.

Yang closed out the third quarter of fundraising by headlining a rally in Los Angeles that drew some 5,000 people, according to his campaign. And they noted that Yang raised $2.28 million in the last ten days of September.

""Wow, we ended the quarter on the biggest rush of donations ever!"" Yang tweeted on Tuesday night. ""Thank you to everyone who worked your heart out to exceed our goal - you all are amazing!""

SANDERS HAULS IN A WHOPPING $25.3 MILLION IN THIRD QUARTER

The campaign cash figure from Yang, while impressive, paled in comparison to the whopping $25.3 million Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont hauled in during the third quarter. The Sanders campaign announced its fundraising figures early Tuesday morning.

South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg brought in $19.1 million over the past three months. Sen. Kamala Harris of California reported bringing in $11.6 million, with Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey raising over $6 million.

President Trump’s re-election team announced that they and the Republican National Committee combined hauled in a massive $125 million in the third quarter.

TRUMP'S RECORD-BREAKING $125 MILLION FUNDRAISING HAUL

Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado also released his fundraising figures on Wednesday. The long-shot contender for the nomination reported raising $2.1 million over the past three months, with $1.8 million cash on hand. The campaign noted that 86 percent of contributions were $25 or less.

“Our strategy to run a lean, strong campaign in early states is working, and we have the resources to compete and win. We’re continuing to run TV, rural radio, and digital ads and build out our infrastructure and staff,” Bennet campaign spokesperson Shannon Beckham emphasized.

Bennet didn’t make the cut for last month’s Democratic nomination debate and failed to qualify for this month’s showdown as well. That has not discouraged Bennet's campaign.

""Instead of allowing the DNC’s flawed debate criteria to dictate this race, we’re communicating directly with voters and caucusgoers,” Beckham said, taking aim at the Democratic National Committee’s thresholds to qualify for the debate."

Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas and Councilman Joe Buscaino drafted a proposal urging Newsom to declare the state of emergency, which could redirect state and federal funds generally reserved for natural disasters like wildfires and earthquakes. It would also suspend some legal red tape that has halted affordable housing and shelter projects.

“Homelessness has ballooned into a crisis of seismic proportions outside of the control of the City of Los Angeles and the cities of the State of California,” wrote Buscaino. “The plight of individuals living on the streets jeopardizes the public health and safety of those individuals and imperils the broader citizenry of the State of California.”

Newsom said in a recent statement that “homelessness is a national emergency that demands more than just words, it demands action.""

In June he signed off on a $214.8 billion dollar budget, allocating $2.4 billion to address the state's housing and homelessness crisis.

However, a report to local lawmakers earlier in the year revealed that Los Angeles alone saw a 16 percent increase in its homeless population over the last year — a blow to Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and other officials working to combat the crisis.

""Throwing money at the problem does not solve the problem. We spent, in Los Angeles alone, $619 million dollars on the homeless epidemic last year. And, that's gotten us nowhere,"" said Lahren. ""Obviously, this is mismanagement of funds. This is failed leadership. And people think by just throwing money at the problem, it will solve the problem. But, it won't.""

""I have been really taking inventory of our leaders and those representatives in these districts,"" she said. ""And, I've been looking at their tweets. They tweet about 10 to 15 times a day.""

Lahren cited specific Twitter accounts including those of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, Rep. Maxine Waters, Rep. Ted Lieu, Rep. Karen Bass, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein.

""Overwhelmingly, it's been about what? About Trump's impeachment!"" she exclaimed.

""Not a single word about something that's happening right here...Something that they should really be coming back to their districts and their state to take inventory of,"" she said. ""And yet, they're on tweeting about how much they hate Donald Trump!"""

What’s happening now, he tweeted, is not impeachment, “it is a COUP, intended to take away the Power of the People, their VOTE, their Freedoms, their Second Amendment, Religion, Military, Border Wall, and their God-given rights as a Citizen of The United States of America!”

Leaving aside all the terrible things he says would follow his ouster, let’s be clear: This is not a coup.

Impeachment is a remedy contained in the Constitution after considerable debate by Alexander Hamilton and the other founders. Impeaching Donald Trump, especially on a party-line vote, may be dumb, reckless, blindly partisan or downright suicidal. But it is not a coup, even of the bloodless variety.

ALL THE PRESIDENT’S MEN NOW BEING DRAGGED INTO THE IMPEACHMENT DRAMA

The president isn’t the only one using intemperate language. Maxine Waters, the left-wing Democratic congresswoman, responded to his “filthy talk” by declaring, “Impeachment is not good enough for Trump. He needs to be imprisoned & placed in solitary confinement.”

So much for due process or the formality of a trial. Waters is already picking out his jail cell.

I had barely finished writing these words when the president tweeted about the “Do Nothing Democrats,” saying they are “wasting everyone’s time and energy on [BS.”] Except he spelled it out.

Look, it’s hardly surprising that rhetoric is getting way overheated with the Democrats wielding a weapon that’s only been used against Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. But words matter, in political discourse as in life. And “coup” was no accident.

Trump obviously has every incentive to rouse his supporters by painting himself as the victim of dark forces, including the media and the Deep State.

And the critics can retire to their fainting couches when he retweets a phrase like “civil war.” Journalists use the term all the time, talking about a Republican civil war or Democratic civil war or some other war.

But coup is different, and so is calling for a congressman’s arrest. Trump yesterday called Adam Schiff a “lowlife” who should resign, saying he couldn’t carry Mike Pompeo’s “blank-strap.” (Suddenly jock is a dirty word?) He’s also ended a tweet about the House Intel chairman with: “Arrest for Treason?” (The supposed treason is that Schiff exaggerated Trump’s comments on the Ukraine call in what he said was a parody.)

Kamala Harris, trying to break into the news, is demanding that Twitter suspend the president’s account. There is zero chance of that happening, as the senator well knows. Can you imagine the backlash against the company, already accused of leaning left, for banning a commander-in-chief with 63 million followers?

Harris pointed to Trump’s postings in which he likened the intelligence whistle-blower to a spy and mentioned the word treason. “These tweets represent a clear intent to baselessly discredit the whistleblower and officials in our government who are following the proper channels to report allegations of presidential impropriety,” she wrote Twitter chief Jack Dorsey.

As for the fourth estate, the president told reporters he is largely dropping “fake” and will refer to them as the “corrupt media.”

Trump was teeing off on the Washington Post, but he was mistaken; the focus of his ire was a new book by two New York Times reporters, Michael Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis.

The Times story based on the book said that in private meetings Trump “often talked about fortifying a border wall with a water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators, prompting aides to seek a cost estimate. He wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh. After publicly suggesting that soldiers shoot migrants if they threw rocks, the president backed off when his staff told him that was illegal. But later in a meeting, aides recalled, he suggested that they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down. That’s not allowed either, they told him.”

Trump ridiculed the story as a lie and said it was “stupid” to ask whether he’d ever said such things. (Davis tweeted that the White House did not deny the account when twice presented with the details.)

The president then declared that he would largely retire his “fake news” formulation in favor of “corrupt news”—which, he added for good measure, is “truly the enemy of the people.”

That’s the latest sign of Trump’s frustration, after years of negative coverage, in the midst of an impeachment inquiry.

But here’s the kicker. When Fox’s John Roberts asked Trump about a just posted New York Times story that the whistle-blower told Schiff’s staff about his complaint days before filing it, he said he couldn’t believe the paper had written it and that maybe it’s getting better. When the president views a story as more favorable, he miraculously upgrades his opinion of the press."

A Monmouth University survey suggests that Biden – one of the co-frontrunners in the Democratic race to face off next year against the president – could suffer some political damage from the Ukrainian allegations that sparked the Democrat-controlled House to formally launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump.

POLL SUGGESTS SUPPORT FOR IMPEACHMENT GROWS, WITH AMERICANS NOW SPLIT

The survey, released Wednesday, indicates that a plurality of voters believed Trump’s accusations against Biden on that issue.

Trump and Biden each face a distinct set of allegations with regard to Ukraine. Trump is under fire from Democrats over his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he urged Zelensky to investigate the Biden family over their dealings in Ukraine. A whistleblower, along with Democrats, argue Trump in essence was asking a foreign country to potentially interfere in a U.S. election.

Trump has denied any wrongdoing and has repeatedly described his phone call with the Ukrainian leader as “perfect.”

At the same time, the president has sought to turn the tables on Biden by highlighting allegations against the former vice president and his son that he wanted investigated.

Biden’s son Hunter served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how Biden pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor – who had been widely accused of overlooking corruption in his own office – was later dismissed. Trump’s re-election campaign last week launched a new TV and digital ad targeting Biden over his alleged actions.

The Monmouth poll indicates that 43 percent of registered voters believe Trump’s claim that Biden did pressure Ukrainian officials to keep them from investigating his son’s business ties, with 37 percent not buying the president’s allegations and one in five unsure.

Among crucial self-identified independent voters, 39 percent believe that Biden pressured Ukrainian officials, with 27 percent disagreeing and a third unsure.

“The fact that 4-in-10 independents are inclined to believe what they have heard from Trump is a warning sign for the Biden campaign. How the candidate fights back against this charge will be crucial to his argument of electability,” Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray said in a statement.

Biden's allies maintain he intervened in Ukraine over corruption concerns, not because of his son's work.

And Biden once again emphasized on Wednesday that ""there’s zero, zero evidence, of any assertion made.""

The survey also spells trouble for Trump, with just four in 10 registered voters continuing to say that the president should be re-elected, compared with 57 percent who say it’s time to have someone new in the White House.

“Trump’s base is sticking with him, but these results suggest that the president remains particularly weak among voting blocs that were crucial to putting him over the top in 2016,” Murray said.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

The survey is also the latest to indicate the race for the Democratic nomination is turning into a two-candidate battle between Biden and progressive champion Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

Warren stands at 28 percent support among self-identified Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent voters, with the former vice president at 25 percent. Warren’s advantage is within the survey’s sampling error.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, the populist independent senator from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House run, stands at 15 percent. Biden, Sanders and Warren were all tied in Monmouth’s previous poll, conducted in August.

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is at 5 percent in the survey, along with Sen. Kamala Harris of California. Tech-entrepreneur Andrew Yang and best-selling spiritual author Marianne Williamson are at 2 percent in the poll, with 11 other contenders in the record-setting Democratic field registering at 1 percent or less.

The Monmouth University poll was conducted Sept. 23-29, with 1,161 people questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s overall margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points."

On the roster: Sanders off the trail with heart problems - Huge cash haul for trump - Trump’s team embraces ‘coup’ claim - Pete Sessions goes district shopping - Dana Perino wanted for questioning

SANDERS OFF THE TRAIL WITH HEART PROBLEMS

AP: “Bernie Sanders’ campaign says the Democratic presidential candidate has had a heart procedure for a blocked artery. The Vermont senator is canceling events and appearances ‘until further notice.’ The campaign says the 78-year-old Sanders experienced chest discomfort during an event Tuesday and sought medical evaluation. The campaign says two stents were ‘successfully inserted’ and that Sanders ‘is conversing and in good spirits.’ His campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, was on a telephone call with supporters Tuesday night but didn’t mention any health concerns about the candidate. Shakir said the ‘state of the campaign is strong’ and he played up Sanders’ strong fundraising total for the third quarter. Sanders recently canceled some appearances in South Carolina because he lost his voice. The campaign said at the time he felt fine.”



Biden still strong in South Carolina - Greenville [S.C.] News: “The latest Winthrop Poll results are out and South Carolina democratic voters strongly support former Vice President Joe Biden for the presidency, according to the results. Biden drew 37% of the votes among those surveyed. Among African American democrats and democratic-leaning African Americans, Biden earned 46% of the votes, according to the poll. This is the first Winthrop Poll looking at the 2020 primary candidates. Sen. Elizabeth Warren earned 17%, Sen. Bernie Sanders 8%, Sen. Kamala Harris 7% and the remaining 15 candidates each earned less than 5% support in the poll. … The Winthrop Poll is among the list of qualifying polls [for debate qualifications]. Of the remaining 15 candidates, only South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Cory Booker earned at least 3% approval.”



Warren, Biden neck in neck in New Hampshire - WMUR: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren is now in a virtual dead heat with former Vice President Joe Biden in the first-in-the-nation Democratic presidential primary campaign, according to a new poll. The latest Saint Anselm College Center Survey Center poll shows that Warren’s overall upward trajectory is evident in New Hampshire, as it has been recently in national polls. … Sen. Bernie Sanders, the landslide winner of the 2016 Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire, is in third place with 11 percent, essentially tied with South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who was backed by 10 percent of those polled. … Sen. Kamala Harris was the top choice of 5 percent, while U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Sen. Amy Klobuchar received 3 percent each. Philanthropist/activist Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang each received support from 2 percent of those polled, while Sen. Cory Booker was backed by 1 percent.”



Yang brings in big bucks with free money plan - Axios: “2020 candidate Andrew Yang's campaign says it raised $10 million in 2019's third quarter, according to Politico. Why it matters: Yang's Q3 report is more than triple the $2.8 million he raised in the second quarter — a push powered by some strong debate performances that elevated his national profile. The state of play: Yang outpaced Sen. Cory Booker’s $6 million and came close to Sen. Kamala Harris’ $11.6 million. … Yang's campaign said nearly 300,000 people have donated — almost double the threshold required to qualify for the November debate. … Yang's campaign told Politico that it received $1 million in the 72 hours after the September debate in which he announced that he was giving away $120,000 to 10 families over a year to promote signature campaign proposal: universal basic income, branded by Yang as the ‘freedom dividend.’”



HUGE CASH HAUL FOR TRUMP

AP: “President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee raised $125 million in the third quarter of the year, a presidential fundraising record. The pro-Trump effort said Tuesday that it has raised more than $308 million in 2019 and has more than $156 million in the bank. Republicans aim to use the fundraising haul to fight off Democrats’ impeachment effort. Former President Barack Obama and the DNC raised just over $70 million in the third quarter of 2011. ‘President Trump has built a juggernaut of a campaign, raising record amounts of money at a record pace,’ said Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale. RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel credited Democratic attacks on Trump for motivating supporters to donate in record numbers.”



GOP moves to stifle dissent in Charlotte - NYT: “President Trump’s political advisers have concluded a monthslong effort to tighten the rules for choosing delegates to the Republican National Convention, all but ensuring there are no dissenting speeches at the gathering of party officials in Charlotte next year. On Tuesday, state Republican parties submitted to the national committee their delegate allocation plans, the methods by which they will choose and bind delegates who attend the convention as their representatives. In 37 states and territories, there have been changes to the rules that will all but stamp out the possibility of any raucous divide on the convention floor. … The new delegate guidelines are the culmination of a 10-month effort by Trump advisers to strengthen the president’s grip on the Republican Party ahead of the general election. It means that even if the three candidates challenging Mr. Trump in the Republican primary gain vote shares, they almost certainly won’t translate into speeches or jeers from supporters of these candidates when the convention is taking place.”



South Carolina Republicans sue over nixed primary - The [Charleston, S.C.] Post and Courier: “Two Republicans, one of them former congressman Bob Inglis, have sued the S.C. Republican Party over its decision to cancel its GOP presidential primary next year. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in state court in Richland County, alleges the party scrapped its 2020 election contest illegally and violated party rules and state election law. The suit further contends the near-unanimous decision made by the party’s Executive Committee deprives Inglis, of Greenville, and fellow plaintiff Frank Heindel of Mount Pleasant, of their right to vote for the candidate of their choosing in a primary. … The suit comes after the Executive Committee met Sept. 7 in Columbia and voted to forgo a presidential primary. The move effectively cleared the way for Republican incumbent President Donald Trump to receive all of the state’s nominating delegates without contest.”



THE RULEBOOK: POPULISM 101

“By a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 10



TIME OUT: WHAT A BUNCH OF CRETANS

NatGeo: “Deep inside the Labyrinth on the island of Crete lived a Minotaur, a monster half man, half bull. … The story of the Minotaur has thrilled people for thousands of years and inspired myriad works of art: pottery, poetry, plays, the art of Picasso, operas, movies, and video games. Although the myth can be enjoyed as a satisfying tale, archaeologists now know that its fabulous qualities have roots deep in real events in the Bronze Age. The bull-headed man in Minos’s maze embodies several traits found in the culture of Crete and ancient Minoan civilization. Bulls and maze motifs are found throughout Minoan culture, which dominated the Mediterranean from about 3000 B.C. to about 1100 B.C. In confronting and overcoming the bull—a symbol of Crete—Theseus, the legendary founder of Athens, reflects the flowering of Aegean civilizations beginning in the middle of the second millennium B.C., as mainland Greece replaced Crete as the dominant power.”

TRUMP’S TEAM EMBRACES ‘COUP’ CLAIM

Mediaite: “President Donald Trump decried the House of Representatives’ impeachment inquiry as a ‘coup,’ and it looks like his campaign is embracing that rhetoric to blast Democrats. Trump echoed similar comments made on Fox News in the past few days, including from trade advisor Peter Navarro this week. And now Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted this afternoon Democrats should be working on policies ‘that help America instead of trying to overthrow our government with a coup’ And the Trump campaign has a new ad out today — called ‘Coup’ — accusing Democrats of orchestrating ‘nothing short of a coup’ against the president.”



Senate GOP could take up impeachment only to drop it - NYT: “Senator Mitch McConnell’s comment this week that the Senate would be forced to ‘take up’ articles of impeachment from the House had the capital in a swirl, bracing for a full-blown Senate trial of President Trump. But as things now stand, any trial would likely be swift, ending in dismissal of the accusations. While the focus was on the statement by Mr. McConnell, the majority leader, that the Senate would have ‘no choice’ but to begin an impeachment proceeding, it was his next line that might have been more telling: ‘How long you are on it is a whole different matter.’ The fusty rules of the Senate make clear that Republicans could not unilaterally stonewall articles of impeachment of Mr. Trump as they did the Supreme Court nomination of Merrick B. Garland. But Mr. McConnell’s declaration suggests the Republican-controlled Senate could move expeditiously to toss them out if Republicans conclude the House impeachment is meritless, or a strictly partisan affair.”



Steyer PAC spends big to target Republican senators on impeachment - WaPo: “A group pushing for the impeachment of President Trump is launching a $3.1 million ad campaign targeting Republican senators over the coming weeks as pro-impeachment activists turn their fire away from Democratic holdouts and toward members of the president’s own party. The group, Need to Impeach, is funded mainly by billionaire Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer. Top executives said Tuesday that more than half of the ad campaign money will go toward television spots, with the rest underwriting digital ads. The campaign will focus on Republican Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Cory Gardner (Colo.) and Martha McSally (Ariz.), all of whom are seeking reelection next year and could cast votes in the coming months on whether Trump should be removed from office.”



Cheney sends House Republicans home with talking points - WashEx: “Republican leaders in the House of Representatives sent the rank-and-file home with one overriding message to deliver to voters in their districts: There is no evidence that warrants an impeachment inquiry into President Trump. The bulleted talking points, prepared by Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, also attack House Democrats as disorganized and the impeachment process as illegitimate, primarily because Nancy Pelosi declined to hold a floor vote on whether to open the inquiry. Cheney argues in her messaging guidance that Democrats have been intent on impeaching Trump for more than two years. An investigation into Trump's harmless telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, she asserts, is just the Democrats' latest excuse to justify their attempt to undo the 2016 election.”



PETE SESSIONS GOES DISTRICT SHOPPING

Texas Tribune: “Former Republican U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions appears poised to make a comeback attempt — but not in his old Dallas-based district. Sessions, who lost reelection last year, plans to announce Thursday he's running for the seat being vacated by retiring U.S. Rep. Bill Flores, according to McLennan County GOP Chairman Jon R. Ker. The announcement will be at the county party headquarters in Waco, added Ker, who said he spoke with Sessions on Tuesday. Sessions' anticipated run is a surprise development after he spent months publicly flirting with running for his previous 32nd District seat, which is about 80 miles north of Flores' more Republican 17th District. The initial reaction ‘has not been positive,’ Flores told The Texas Tribune late Tuesday. ‘Pete is a friend of mine, but I wish he'd called me first,’ said Flores, R-Bryan. ‘I could have provided some valuable feedback to him.’”



Tenney signs up for rematch to reclaim seat - Roll Call: “Former Rep. Claudia Tenney, one of President Donald Trump’s most vocal supporters last Congress, announced Tuesday she will run for her old seat in New York’s 22nd District. Tenney lost by less than 2 percentage points in the 2018 midterms to Democratic Rep. Anthony Brindisi despite running one of the most pro-Trump campaigns of any vulnerable House Republican. The president carried New York’s 22nd District by 15 percentage points in 2016. ‘Upstate New York deserves a representative who will fight for their values in Congress, someone who will work to deliver actual results, not resistance,’ Tenney said in a press release Tuesday.”



Lewandowski shies from Senate run - Politico: “Corey Lewandowski told a local radio host Tuesday ‘it’s fair’ to say he is reconsidering a Senate run in order to defend President Donald Trump from impeachment and help him get reelected. ‘As much as I think I would be a great fighter for the people of New Hampshire, and one U.S. senator can make a difference, it is my priority to make sure the president of United States is reelected,’ Lewandowski said on the radio show, ‘New Hampshire Today with Jack Heath.’ ‘That's a top priority.’ The president's brash and outspoken former campaign manager would have to go up against three other Republicans looking to unseat Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.”



AUDIBLE: POOR GARY

“You don't really want to identify with anybody on that show. The only character with any kind of moral purity to them is Gary, the body guy. But it's not like you really want to be him.” – Mayor Pete Buttigieg when asked which character from HBO’s Veep he relate most to during an interview with the Hollywood Reporter.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Just curious about the railroad spike on the trophy plaque behind you.” – Martin Jarvis, Wright City, Mo.



[Ed. note: Now that’s what I call observant viewership, Mr. Jarvis! Other viewers of our show on Fox Nation may have seen that simple wooden board with a rusty railroad spike behind me. It is from the Monongha Mine in Marion County, W.Va., the scene of the worst mine disaster in American history. On Dec. 6, 1907 at least 362 men were killed when the poorly-ventilated mine filled with methane gas, which exploded with terrible force, killing almost all instantly. Any effort to evacuate the mine would have been badly complicated by a language barrier. The lion’s share of the miners were Italian immigrants, but there would have been Hungarians, Czechs and other non-English speakers working in crews of their own, making it hard for English-speaking foremen to direct an escape as the inferno spread from section to section. The blast collapsed much of the roof and destroyed the rail lines in and out of the mine. That spike came from one of those shattered rail ties and was given long ago to my father, a coal salesman, by a West Virginia coal operator whose own father had saved it after the explosion. I love the way it looks and it goes along with some other ancient mine memorabilia in my office, including a carbide lamp miner’s helmet. But I also love it as a memento of how much I have to be thankful for. My work here in this comfortable, air-conditioned office is safe, well-compensated and personally rewarding. It’s a far cry from the coal pits where so many men toiled and sometimes died. That little spike reminds me of who I am, where I’m from, my dear old dad and, most of all, to be grateful.]

DANA PERINO WANTED FOR QUESTIONING

CBS12: “A man in Fort Lauderdale is accused of tampering with dozens of electric scooters. Authorities have been investigating the vandalism of more than 140 scooters since April. One incident is caught on surveillance video, which police released to the public in an effort to identify a suspect. The investigation led to the arrest of 59-year-old Randall Thomas Williams. Police said they found 20 scooters nearby with severed brake lines. Police say Williams is the one who cut the brake lines on the scooters. He faces criminal mischief charges. Investigators have not revealed a motive. Police are asking anyone who finds an electric scooter that appears to have been tampered with to contact the vendor.”

“I had a pet turtle. My brother had a parakeet. Both came to unfortunate ends. My turtle fell behind a radiator and was not discovered until too late. And the parakeet, God bless him, flew out a window once, never to be seen again.

Guy Benson [00:00:00] We continue it's the Guy Benson show. Thanks for being here. Guy Benson show dot.com. Joining me now is Congressman Dan Crenshaw a Republican from Texas the 2nd Congressional District in the Lone Star State the Houston area. He's a former Navy SEAL and a repeat guest here on the program we always appreciate having him.

Guy Benson: Hello Congressman.

Rep. Crenshaw: Hey Guy It's great to be with you.

Guy Benson: Let's start with the soundbite today from the president at the White House cut 16 talking about Biden and investigations and foreign countries. This is a triple down. Have a listen.

TRUMP: China should start an investigation into the Biden's because what happened to China. Is just about as bad as what happened with. With. Ukraine. So I would say that president Zelensky if it were me I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Biden's because nobody has any doubt that they weren't crooked. That was a crooked deal 100 present.

Guy Benson: All right Congressman so there's the president. We remember what he said about Russia and hacking in 2016. Here he goes again saying that the Chinese and the Ukrainians should be investigating the Bidens. Your reaction to that is that's something the president ought to be saying.

Rep. Crenshaw: Well what we should be saying is listen the public does have an interest in knowing this.

Rep. Crenshaw: Former Vice President Biden had a serious conflict of interest that he was advocating for this Ukrainian prosecutor fired when he knew the prosecutor was investigating the company that his son was a board member. And there is a public interest in knowing that. And so you know that the president uses very loose language every time he speaks. He's talked about investigating. I'm not sure any of where the illegal on regarding Ukraine. It wasn't illegal according to Ukrainian law. All right. Any legal part of Ukrainian law. What I care about is whether there was legitimate conflict of interest and just on the facts we have it would appear that there was whether that's illegal is another question whether it really warrants a so-called investigation. Is Another question. And it really is a political calculation if they do it. Do we trust someone who so blatantly had a conflict of interest and they recuse themselves that the facts we have or are frankly involved and just getting to the core of the current debate about about Trump's transcripts. I I will say that I will defend the idea that the public does have an interest in knowing about these things it's not out of the ordinary for the future.

Rep. Crenshaw: The current president to be asking about wrongdoing of U.S. officials.I think the public does have an interest in that.

Guy Benson: There is a public interest certainly but do you try to deputize a foreign government to do the digging in the course of practicing U.S. foreign policy when you're the president. Right. I think that's an important distinction about who's doing the digging who's asking whom to do the digging and when it comes to Biden Ukraine. I'm not saying that his hands are clean but it looks like the prosecutor that he was pushing to get fired was in fact extremely corrupt was not investigating Hunter Biden at the time. I just feel like there's there's a lot of assertions being made all over the place. Congressman I'm not saying you I'm just saying all over the place on both sides of the aisle that I'm not sure that we're following the facts necessarily.

Rep. Crenshaw: Perhaps I like I said whether it's illegal or not and it's kind of irrelevant. I think it's obvious that there was a conflict of interest. It would have been appropriate for the vice president to recuse himself on that. Whether you take any more action on that subject after after that is more questionable. But to your point about listen is it ever appropriate to ask another country to investigate some kind of wrongdoing. I'm not so sure I see a problem with that. It depends on what the investigation is about. Is it official wrongdoing by U.S. officials. Yeah I don't think it's inappropriate to be signaling to other countries of which we've done in the past with that forget that just a year ago there was a letter signed to the Ukrainian government by three Democrat senators asking them to investigate. TRUMP So this is this is this is clearly not unprecedented and we didn't raise any issues back then in 2018. So those again and just normal diplomatic affairs isn't actually out of the ordinary. Trump has the ability to make everything seem out of the ordinary by the way he speaks but we do have to pay attention to the substance of what he's actually saying and the precedent that's already set.

Guy Benson: Sure in the context and what exactly he's requesting and is there an explicit quid pro quo. I think people are getting out over their skis as usual in their criticism of him. I just I don't know Congressman I feel like if if you are looking at a president or asking a foreign government to investigate that president's domestic political rival in the context of any conversation about foreign aid I think that's the type of thing that should not be done and should be avoided. I'm not saying it's impeachable I'm not saying it's illegal I just think it's not a correct use of one's public office do you. Do you disagree with that.

Rep. Crenshaw: Yeah you're making a style of it it's it's a question of style right.

Rep. Crenshaw: It's a question of whether it's appropriate for that phone call.

Rep. Crenshaw: Well it's an extremely important distinction like whether it's illegal and certainly whether it's unprecedent. And I think we have to be we have to be to think coherently about this is if you're asking a foreign government to investigate somebody's personal life because they're your political rival. Well that's a very different thing than saying that hey we have questions about what happened when this person was in office. You don't get it. You don't get a pass just because you're now running against the current president. Right. Imagine if that was the case imagine so you have to do is run against the current political leadership in all your past wrongs would never be questioned as a result because it would be somehow inappropriate to ask another government about that. I think that's crazy. So again like I like I started out with there is a public interest in knowing about about why the vice president was so involved in this one prosecutor in a foreign country when it just so happens that his son that there was a connection with the son. And why why he wasn't recused from that why the State Department wasn't taking lead on that. I think there's real questions there. OK. Trump was asking him to investigate my personal life. Would that be a different story. Right so I distinguish between those factors.

Guy Benson: I am not arguing that Biden is immune here I also think that you can look at something and say that's a misuse of power and not say well that's a crime and let's throw someone out of office. And I think what we've seen and this is where the Democrats start to come into some trouble they many of them have been saying they want to impeach the president since before he even took office. And one of the public faces of that push who has been I think pretty reckless and irresponsible and dishonest all along the path has been the chairman of the Intelligence Committee in the house Adam Schiff. And now there's a move among GOP leadership to have him censured in the house. Where do you stand on the leadership of Chairman Schiff and this censure resolution.

Rep. Crenshaw: Well he clearly one of the most dishonest members of Congress that we know of with what the Russian probe him claiming and evidence that he did not.

Rep. Crenshaw: It's now coming out that he was he was well aware of this whistleblower and the complaints being made before it was made public even though it was planned otherwise. You know his his parody account in an official hearing at a congressional hearing was supposed to act like adults.

Rep. Crenshaw: This man does a Shakespearean parody account of what the actual transcript was between Trump and and Ukrainian president. I mean it's just disgusting behavior. This man is a liar you should not be trusted that he runs a very powerful and important committee that was ever meant to be so politicized. By the way did the intelligence committee was never meant to be in the public eye. The way it is it is supposed to be a bipartisan way to conduct official national security matters in the country.

Rep. Crenshaw: And it is not what he is capable of doing and it's just it's it's sad to see that.

Guy Benson: You know one of your colleagues on the Republican side who I think is a pretty smart and serious person is at Elise Stefanik from New York. She's not someone given to spasms of insane partisanship and she's come out in the last 24 hours and said that Schiff needs to step down as the chairman of that committee I think the chances of that are nil. Pelosi is going to go to bat for her chairman but I almost wonder does that politically speaking almost help the president because Schiff has such a credibility problem if he's out there as the tip of the spear on this impeachment stuff that might not be terribly helpful to the Democrats who want to at least put on a somber serious face as they go down this path.

Rep. Crenshaw: Yeah I mean that's exactly right. A ton of respect for her. And that's exactly right.

Rep. Crenshaw: She doesn't. She takes a very objective look at people's behavior and policy as I had a do I and now she's calling for that there's some substance to it she's obviously no that committe she deals with this every day and you know should take her at her word. And to your point yeah there's a there's a real credibility problem. OK. Adam Schiff has lied to us for years about about the Russia Collusion Hoax the evidence he had lying to us again you know and again to into your last point prior about you know whether it's wrong or appropriate but not illegal.

Rep. Crenshaw: You know I would I would still push back in this case because we're assuming that there was some quid pro quo but it turns out after we get the transcript there's really no evidence of that. And that's a really important distinction to make. If if there was an obvious political quid pro quo our view on this should change. But the evidence is just not there. And the media narrative seems to be operating on that premise and it's a false premise.

Guy Benson: Congressman last question we have about a minute left. We've seen Elizabeth Warren propose in the last few days taxing speech. Kamala Harris writing to Twitter saying that the president's Twitter feed should be shut down. And of course the ongoing spat with better raw who's out there talking about gun confiscation. I mean first and second amendments I'm a little nervous about this crowd over there.

Rep. Crenshaw: Yeah they really like the Bill of Rights. I think they've made that very clear and and that's it. If you want to understand who Democrats are they believe in pure democracy in a pure democracy 51 percent the population can can can can club the rest of the 49 percent.

Rep. Crenshaw: They can change what they can tell them what they think what to do what they can own what they can't own what they can say what they can't say. Democrats believe that it's in the name then Democrat Republicans believe.

Guy Benson: Yes and thankfully Congressman we have a republic if we can keep it. Congressman Dan Crenshaw of Texas. Always a pleasure sir. We gotta go. Taking a break. Back next on THE GUY BENSON show."

TEAM TRUMP CONSIDERS APPEALING TO DEMS IN GOP DISTRICTS

WaPo: “White House officials intent on stopping the House from impeaching President Trump are considering appealing to moderate Democrats in Republican districts to stand with the president, a pursuit at odds with fresh political attacks from the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee. The nascent outreach campaign would target some of the 31 Democrats from congressional districts Trump won in 2016, many of whom ran on rebuilding infrastructure, improving trade deals and lowering the cost of prescription drugs, according to multiple officials familiar with the strategy. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk freely, said the appeal would be based on these Democrats’ 2018 election promises to work with the president — accompanied with a warning that impeachment would hamper possible legislative victories.”



Impeachment vets urge caution - AP: “But the Republicans who carried out President Bill Clinton’s impeachment in 1998 are unanimous in urging caution and restraint as Congress embarks on yet another impeachment struggle, this time over accusations that President Donald Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and Biden’s son. The impeachment veterans of two decades ago were thrust into a seismic political event that was sober and circus-like at the same time. So began a new, angry chapter of American politics that strained Washington institutions that were stronger then than now. … Today, those Clinton impeachment Republicans are urging a pause in the tribalism of the Trump era. … The best-known is Lindsey Graham, a former Air Force prosecutor who was among those most aggressively gunning for Clinton. … The most senior of two Clinton prosecutor remaining in the House is Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin... Clinton impeachment manager Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, wasn’t eager to take a walk down memory lane when encountered in the Capitol last week…”



Kraushaar: The impeachment bellwethers - National Journal: “All told, the numbers suggest that while the politics of impeachment hearings now favor the Democrats, the prospect of building enough bipartisan support to remove Trump from office remains remote. … It’s easy to expect the Republican base remaining solidly behind the president regardless of new information, but it’s hard to see how the broader politics improve for Trump or his party. Despite the partisanship, there are still many members of Congress whose perspective on impeachment going forward will be worth watching closely. They’re the bellwethers, the swing votes whose forthcoming reactions will reflect the mood of the country. There are four categories of members I’m closely watching: the swing-state Republicans, the red-state Democrats, the Republican retirees, and the swing-district freshman Democrats with national security experience.”



Jim Geraghty: Don’t obsess over whistleblower - National Review: “Here’s an assessment sure to be unpopular: When the story of the impeachment effort against President Trump is written, the whistleblower will be an afterthought or a minor player in the overall story at most. Either the whistleblower’s claims are accurate, or they aren’t. Impeachment will hinge upon whether President Trump’s actions strike lawmakers as an effort to effectively blackmail Ukraine into finding dirt on Joe Biden, or whether it’s just Trump being Trump, wanting the facts on Biden strong-arming a foreign government to fire a prosecutor who might have been investigating a company that employed his son. The vast majority of lawmakers’ conclusions on this will just happen to align with their partisan affiliations.”



Schumer continues to press McConnell - Politico: “Chuck Schumer wants Senate Democrats to keep the pressure on Mitch McConnell to hold a fair trial if impeachment of President Donald Trump comes to the Senate — but he also wants to keep whacking the majority leader for presiding over a ‘legislative graveyard.’ The Senate minority leader convened a conference call with his caucus on Wednesday to stay focused on its double-barreled messaging tactics while his 47 members are scattered across the country in the middle of a two-week recess, according to three people familiar with the call. … Schumer (D-N.Y.) urged his colleagues to not act partisan amid the impeachment inquiry and pressure McConnell (R-Ky.) to commit to a fair process if the House impeaches the president, according to a Democratic aide briefed on the call. … A second Democrat briefed on the call said some in the party are anxious for more strategic guidance from party leaders.”



The Judge’s Ruling: Trump attacks his own presidency - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano explains the Democrats’ evidence against President Trump and why he should present a principled defense if he has one: “Federal law defines as criminal the solicitation of aid – anything of value – for a political campaign from a foreign national or foreign government, whether the thing of value arrives or not. Federal law also prohibits bribery and attempted bribery, which is defined as withholding the performance of an official duty conditioned upon the personal receipt of a thing of value, whether the thing of value arrives or not. The law further prohibits intimidating witnesses, which is defined as the use of language designed to deter witnesses from giving testimony, whether the intimidation is successful or not.” More here.

TIME OUT: THE TECH BEHIND MUSIC

Smithsonian: “With its cheery singles, theatrical medley and iconic cover, The Beatles’ 11th studio album, ‘Abbey Road,’ holds a special place in the hearts of the band’s fans. But as the album celebrates its 50th anniversary, few may realize just how groundbreaking its tracks were for the band. In [William D. Moylan’s] forthcoming book, ‘Recording Analysis: How the Record Shapes the Song,’ [he shows] how the recording process can enhance the artistry of songs, and ‘Abbey Road’ is one of the albums [he highlights]. Beginning with 1965’s ‘Rubber Soul,’ The Beatles started exploring new sounds. This quest continued in ‘Abbey Road,’ where the band was able to deftly incorporate emerging recording technology in a way that set the album apart from everything they had previously done. … ‘Abbey Road’ … shows how a song can be poetically written and an instrument deftly played. But the way a track is recorded can be the artist’s final stamp on the song.”

DEMS GRUMBLE OVER LARGE DEBATE STAGE

Politico: “The next Democratic presidential primary debate will likely be historic — but probably not for the reason Democrats were hoping. The Democratic National Committee announced Wednesday that 12 candidates have qualified for the Oct. 15 debate in Westerville, Ohio. And unlike the previous rounds, when the stage was limited to 10 candidates, which resulted in the first two debates being split into two consecutive nights, all 12 are set to share one stage on Oct. 15.This would make it the largest presidential primary debate ever, Republican or Democrat… Invited to the debate are: Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julián Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O’Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang. If none of the candidates drop out between now and the debate — and Sanders participates in the debate after his recent heart procedure — it will surpass the previous record of 11 candidates on a primary debate stage, set by Republicans during the 2016 cycle. The crowded stage is leading to some grumbling from Democrats, who are already conscious about their speaking time.”



Biden tries to fashion a Super Tuesday firewall - Politico: “Joe Biden’s campaign is ramping up its investment in Super Tuesday states, anticipating a Democratic race that narrows to two candidates by early March. The increase in staffing across the 14 states that will vote March 3 comes as Biden’s polling figures have declined and Elizabeth Warren’s have surged, particularly in states like Iowa and New Hampshire where she’s heavily invested in field organization. The former vice president’s campaign is still counting on strong finishes in the four early nominating states. But in the event of weaker-than-expected performances, a built-out Super Tuesday organization would provide a fail-safe for Biden. Many of the states on the Super Tuesday map — which includes a handful of Southern and Border states — play to his strengths among African-American voters and more moderate Democrats.”



Molly Ball: Harris remains an enigma to voters - Time: “Perhaps, in these days of brutal ideological combat, that kind of pragmatism could be sold as refreshing. But in Harris’ case it seems to be having the opposite effect. Some of the attendees at her events in Iowa told me they don’t think she’s progressive enough; others said she strikes them as too far left. ‘She hasn’t gone far enough to get the activists behind her, but she’s gone too far for some of the moderates,’ says Larry Gerston, a professor emeritus of political science at San Jose State University. ‘So she’s in kind of a no-person’s-land in terms of having a good base.’ And yet, polls indicate that Democratic voters still want to like her–if only they can figure out what she’s about. The race is far from over. Iowa voters are notorious for shopping around until the end.”



Klobuchar leans on family’s Iron Range roots - Roll Call: “If there’s proof of Klobuchar’s strengths as a candidate, it’s her margins in conservative parts of Minnesota. Despite Trump winning the 8th District — home to the Iron Range — by 16 points in 2016, and Democrats losing the seat last fall, Klobuchar carried it by more than 10 points in her 2018 reelection. But as Democrats have seen slippage in the Midwest, so has Klobuchar. Her margins last year in some conservative congressional districts were significantly lower than in 2012. Before she can try to extend that Minnesota success nationwide, she has to win over the Democratic Party base. ‘It would be unlikely,’ [University of Minnesota professor Larry] Jacobs said. ‘But I never give up on Amy Klobuchar. No one is going to outwork her.’”

“There are different ways to bake the cake, depending on what sort of cake you want. Different flavoring, different temperatures, different ingredients yield different types of cake, and the president as the master baker is testing recipes and deciding what type of cake he wants.” – A senior White House official talking to the WaPo about President Trump’s freestyle solo approach to impeachment messaging.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I do enjoy reading the Halftime report and especially the From the Bleachers section where I can see how others are reacting to what they read. Your responses are usually spot on but [on Tuesday] I took umbrage to your calling the impeachment process ‘festivities’. While politics in general tends to resemble Battlebots and political conventions are certainly festive the gravity of what is taking place in Washington now should be handled with more seriousness. The potential removal of a duly elected president regardless of the outcome will leave wounds on this country that will take a long time to heal. We may not recognize our Republic when all is said and done due to the scars left behind. One can only hope that later generations can learn where we failed to, so that Impeachment, or the threat of it, is not used as a political tool every 4 years and never becomes something resembling a festival.” – Dave Fischer, Memphis, Tenn.



[Ed. note: I know that it’s very tempting to think the worst, Mr. Fischer. It not only seems more dramatic and historic than being optimistic, it also fits into the nation’s dour mood these days. I know it’s also tempting to take umbrage. In fact, umbrage taking has become sort of our new national pastime. The outrage olympics have overtaken our politics in a profound way. And while I do feel bad that you were offended at my jocularity, I am going to continue to decline to take politics so seriously. The issues at stake are too important to hang on every word of politicians. There’s no way around the partisan conflict ahead, but I still tend to think that there’s something better waiting on the other side. I’m grateful for your readership and hope you can stick with us despite my commitment to due flippancy.]



“Some are saying in the Senate trial, assuming the president is impeached, that the president’s attorneys will have the opportunity to subpoena and question anyone. By anyone, they’re suggesting Comey, Strzok, Page, Ohr, Holder, Lynch, Steele, Brennan, Clapper, not to mention Hilary Clinton… quite literally, anyone. It’s difficult to imagine that this is so, but, if it is, well, the country’s in for a tantalizing, and surely painful, show…” – B. A. Street, Colorado Springs, Colo.



[Ed. note: The Senate gets to make up its own trial rules. How long, how many witnesses, in what order, etc. would all be up for grabs if the House impeaches. I think the scenario you describe – weeks of confusing testimony going down alternate narratives, etc. – would be a bipartisan nightmare. Instead, I expect senators would prefer tight, concise presentations.]

Brady said the pads are light enough and offer him the right amount of protection and still allow him to move around. He said he worked with then-Michigan equipment manager Jon Falk to get the right fit.

Of the 19 reports, 4 cases have been identified and 9 other reports are still under investigation in Alabama; 3 have been identified as probable cases; 1 confirmed case (the deceased), of lung disease associated with vaping,” officials with the state’s health department said in a news release.

“The use of any tobacco product is unsafe. While this current outbreak is being investigated, the safest option is to refrain from using any e-cigarette or vape product. Furthermore, there is no situation in which these devices should be used by pregnant women or youths,” said State Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris, in a statement.

To date, there have been 15 vaping-linked deaths in the U.S. Federal health officials – namely those with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) – are still investigating the cause behind the 805 vaping-related lung illness cases reported across 46 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Additionally, a recent Washington Post investigation concluded that the illnesses affecting hundreds of Americans may be linked to black-market vaping products, some of which are allegedly cut with vitamin E acetate.

Cameron Pettit, 28, of West Hollywood, Calif.; Stephen Walter, 46, of Los Angeles; and Ryan Reavis, 36, of Lake Havasu City, Ariz., were previously charged with drug-related offenses. Wednesday’s charges add the allegation that their drugs led to the performer's death.

MAC MILLER DIED FROM MIX OF FENTANYL, COCAINE AND ETHANOL, CORONER SAYS

All have been arrested in recent weeks and remain in custody. None have entered a plea.

Miller -- his real name was Malcolm James Myers McCormick -- died of an accidental overdose of the powerful opioid fentanyl, along with cocaine and alcohol. He was 26.

The indictment alleges that Walter supplied the fentanyl and cocaine that Pettit sold to Miller, and that Reavis, who lived in the Los Angeles area until earlier this year, acted as a middleman for the fentanyl sale.

RAPPER MAC MILLER DEAD AT 26

According to the indictment, on Sept. 5, 2018, Pettit allegedly sold Miller cocaine, Xanax and 10 blue pills -- reportedly oxycodone, but also containing fentanyl -- after the two had exchanged text messages a day earlier.

Two days later, Miller’s assistant found him dead at his Los Angeles home.

Walter’s attorney, William S. Harris, told The Associated Press he was reviewing the indictment and other elements of the case, and could not immediately comment. An attorney for Pettit did not immediately respond to an email from AP seeking comment. According to the outlet, it’s unclear whether Reavis has secured a lawyer.

Pettit and Walter -- who, per AP, was also charged with being a felon in possession of ammunition -- are scheduled to be arraigned on the new charges on Oct. 10. Reavis, who was arrested last week in Arizona, does not yet have an arraignment date.

The men face a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in federal prison and the potential for life without parole if convicted of either of the charges related to Miller’s death.

The admission puts the mayor on a long line of corrupt leadership in the city, which has been riddled with chronic budget problems.

Frank Gillam Jr. told the judge he stole funds raised from donors in Atlantic City and Philadelphia for the Atlantic City Starz for personal expenses between 2013 and 2018. He was elected mayor in 2017 after serving as a City Councilman.

He was released after posting a $100,000 bond with the court, but New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and other elected officials quickly called for him to resign. Plans were already being made for the City Council president to assume Gillam’s position.

Gillam, 49, faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted in his trial, which is set for Jan. 7. Half of the money he stole was recovered from his home when FBI agents raided it in December, and he’s agreed to pay restitution for the fraud.

According to prosecutors, Gillam used the money for personal expenses such as luxury clothing, expensive meals and trips. He had solicited the donations using his political office under the false pretense they were for the youth basketball team or for school supplies for underprivileged children.

“When a scheme depletes (a) charity for children, it's unconscionable,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Gregory Ehrie. “But when the fraud is perpetrated by someone the public trusts, it damages the community's confidence in their public servants. This defendant betrayed the trust of his community and of people who wanted to improve the lives of children.”

WARREN, GABBARD KNOCK HARRIS' BID TO BAN TRUMP FROM TWITTER

Gillam’s lawyer, Harry Rimm, issued a defense that Gillam only admitted misusing private funds, not public money, which he argued made the mayor better than many of his predecessors. The city was on the brink of bankruptcy when Gillam took office in 2017 as its casino industry struggled.

As of 2007, four of the city's last eight mayors had been arrested on corruption charges and one-third of the nine-member City Council was either in prison or under house arrest.

Robert Levey, mayor of the city from 2006-2007, admitted in court to falsifying his military record to receive $25,000 worth of benefits.

The 37-year-old actress wasted no time explaining to reporters during the Television Critics Association summer press tour just how influential Tom Cruise was showing her the ropes in the stunt world as she prepared for her role in the exciting, high-action police drama “Stumptown.”

COBIE SMULDERS REVEALS SHE HAD OVARIAN CANCER AT AGE 25

“Yeah, I mean when I worked with Tom [Cruise] on '[Jack] Reacher,' that was when I learned the most I had up until then about training, about fighting, about stunts, about how to do everything safely because he was such a pro at just doing everything correctly and really well,” Smulders said about acting alongside the “Top Gun” franchise star in “Jack Reacher: Never Go Back.”

The longtime Marvel mainstay, who portrayed S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria Hill in six Marvel Cinematic Universe films, beginning with the “Avengers,” said her “Stumptown” role was perfect for her, especially considering her character Dex Parios is a quick-witted army veteran-turned-private investigator.

“Everything about her challenges me but that's what excites me,” Smulders told reporters. “It doesn't make me afraid. I mean, it's physically wearing but you're not really getting hurt. If you if you're getting hurt, someone's not doing their job right.”

Smulders, 37, whose husband comedian and actor Taran Killam, 37, is a series regular on fellow ABC show “Single Parents,” said she was even more drawn to Dex because of her willingness to fearlessly say what’s on her mind.

COBIE SMULDERS EXPLAINS WHY SHE POSED TOPLESS

“I just like her. I like the way that she rolls with however she's feeling, you know,” Smulders explained. “I like playing sort of a sexually ambiguous woman on network television. I like that she's sort of her own boss. I like that she just doesn't really have – there are no rules for her. So that excited me.”

The “How I Met Your Mother” alum continued: “We're still trying to figure out the tone of this right because there is a certain, you know, P.I. way of talking, you know. Kind of like this sassy one-liner, which I don't think kind of – it doesn't fit quite right but there is a moment and a place for it or to take that rhythm and modernize it.”

“So it's usually her humor is coming situationally. But I think that there will be opportunities. For there's a lot of physical comedy but then also just really funny lines,” she added.

But for Smulders – it was the quality of life she sought and, in becoming an executive producer on the graphic-novel-adapted series, Smulders is happy that she can spend more time with her family.

COBIE SMULDERS SHARES HER STAY-FIT TRICKS

""First of all, it's such a blessing I was on 'How I Met Your Mother' for so long and that's shot in Los Angeles and I was allowed to have a life in the city,” she said. “And I've been off of it for five years now and traveling so much, I just feel that it takes a hit to a family. But it's so nice – there are going to be really long hours and it's going to be really physically draining but I get to go and sleep in my own bed and my child will probably come at 6 a.m. into that bed.”

Smulders told reporters she looks forward to her daughters Shaelyn, 10, and Janita, 4, being able to witness their mother in her element and even said she’s teaching them how to perform stunts of their own just in case the rough-housing gets a little out of hand.

“There are certainly sacrifices, but also it excites me I have two girls and it's exciting for them to see their mother having a career and having dreams and fulfilling goals,"" she said. ""That's what I tell myself anyways to sleep at night. You do your best and I'm a very hands-on parent and everybody who's involved in this project knows that and has been extremely accommodating thus far.""

When asked how her daughters usually react to seeing their mother fake being battered and bruised after an intense fight scene, Smulders added: “I walk them through how to do stunts, how to make it look real but it's not really.”

“Quite honestly, they don't watch a lot of television,” she continued. “I don't think they've seen an episode of 'How I Met Your Mother' or anything from the 'Avengers.' They're still really little and they don't see that on me in person. So I try to explain sort of the choreography involved and that actually is kind of – like it's funny to them.”

“Stumptown,” which also stars Michael Ealy as Det. Miles Hoffman and Smulders’ love interest, airs Wednesdays at 10 p.m. EST on ABC."

WARREN LAUGHS OFF HARRIS SUGGESTION TO BOOT TRUMP FROM TWITTER

And Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts offered a simple ""no"" when asked by reporters if she thought the Republican president should be booted from Twitter. The Massachusetts Democrat chuckled as she gave her one-word answer on Wednesday.

Harris called this week for the president’s Twitter account to be shut down. This followed a storm of tweets by Trump critical of the whistleblower who filed a complaint against him over the Ukraine controversy. That controversy has spurred a House impeachment inquiry.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Trump, in a tweet, also questioned whether House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff should be arrested for “treason.” And on Wednesday he called the House Democrats' investigation “BULLS---"" in one tweet and a ""COUP"" in another.

“The words of a president matter. Trump has again shown he is irresponsible and endangering others with his tweets. He should lose the privilege to be on Twitter,” Harris wrote on Twitter on Monday.

She urged Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to take action.

Gabbard's comments weren't the first time she's disagreed with Harris.

The two candidates clashed in a viral moment at July’s Democratic primary debate, when Gabbard took aim at the former California attorney general over her record as a prosecutor.

Asked if her pushback against Harris’ suggestion to suspend Trump from Twitter was personal, Gabbard quickly answered, “No. I don’t know why anyone would think that.”"

The Democratic senator from California slammed the president on Twitter Thursday, while also defending Biden's honor.

""Mr. President, telling lies about Joe Biden won't protect you from the truth. Joe has more patriotism in his pinky finger than you'll ever have,"" Harris wrote. ""You violate your oath and undermine American values when you urge foreign nations to do your dirty work. We will hold you accountable.""

WARREN LAUGHS OFF SUGGESTION THAT TWITTER BAN TRUMP AFTER HARRIS' CALL FOR SUSPENSION

The 2020 presidential contender has been on a warpath recently over her call to have the president suspended from Twitter, which began on Monday after Trump attacked the whistleblower who shed a light on his communications with Ukraine.

""The president's tweets and his behaviors about this are just further evidence of the fact that he uses his power in a way that is designed to beat people down instead of lift people up,"" Harris said on CNN.

On the roster: Trump offers no off-ramps for Republicans - Time Out: Bon appétit, y’all - Warren, Sanders lap Biden in third quarter fundraising - The real reason the chicken crossed the road



TRUMP OFFERS NO OFF-RAMPS FOR REPUBLICANS

The news these days is pretty grim for the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress.



The central claim of the whistleblower who came forward to authorities was that President Trump was pressuring America’s Ukrainian allies for dirt on Trump’s chief political rival, Joe Biden.



It has not only been proven true, the president is now doing it right out in the open. He’s even added China to the list of foreign powers he wants to provide opposition research on the Democratic front runner.



Worse, newly revealed texts between American diplomats show that senior State Department officials believed that Trump was conditioning U.S. aid to the long-beleaguered former Soviet republic on the provision of anti-Biden goodies.



But in potentially the worst development so far, it is now alleged that Trump’s personal defense attorney was dangling the promise of an official diplomatic visit to the White House for the Ukrainian president in exchange for a public statement from the Ukrainian leader to investigate Biden and his family’s business dealings in Kyiv.



Team Trump is having some success in deflecting attention, discrediting the California Democrat in charge of the House Intelligence Committee (who’s doing a pretty good job of discrediting himself) and bringing increased attention to the younger Biden’s super-swampy business model.



But the damage is already done. Trump has admitted that the central allegations are true. He has been and is using his office for his own political advantage. All presidents do in more innocuous ways — Air Force One as campaign prop, “official” events as rallies, the White House as an extension of the campaign — but dragging diplomats and involving one of the most potentially dangerous parts of the globe is new.



For Trump loyalists who are in the shoot-‘em-on-Fifth-Avenue club, this is not a problem. They agree with the president that his conduct was “perfect.” They are also convinced that Trump’s predecessor did as bad or worse but was protected by the media. But for those who are not acolytes of Trumpism, including the persuadable voters he desperately needs to win back for re-election, this is turning toxic.



Add in news of an increasingly slouchy economy and you have perhaps the worst political run for this administration yet.



That’s not to say that it’s likely that Trump would ever be removed by the Republican-held Senate. The idea that 20 Republican senators would join Democrats in ousting Trump still sounds laughable.



But the president is certainly not helping his cause with a scorched earth strategy that provides no shelter for his less-fanatically-devoted allies.



Trump’s stance is that he did nothing wrong — again “perfect” — and that anyone who says so is part of the cabal trying to drive him from office.



That’s not going to cut it for lawmakers, especially for vulnerable Senate Republicans, as the 2020 election approaches. They need a space in between: Denunciation of dragging other countries into American politics while still saying Trump’s behavior doesn’t merit removal from office.



Bill Clinton’s team in 1998 knew they had to give Democrats a chance to denounce the president’s scuzzy behavior. Those denunciations actually strengthened Clinton’s standing in the Senate and with voters. He was being punished, formally and informally, and so wasn’t getting away with it. It helped turn him into a sympathetic figure.



Trump and his party are right now a long way from anything like that.

A must for his menu: wild pig. … Hall compares the meat with beef. ‘It’s a lot darker because it’s an animal that moves around a lot, so there’s more blood in its muscles.

WARREN, SANDERS LAP BIDEN IN THIRD QUARTER FUNDRAISING

Politico: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign said Friday that it raised $24.6 million in the third quarter and has $25.7 million cash on hand, further solidifying her rise to the top tier in the Democratic primary. The haul bests the $19 million Warren raised last quarter but trails progressive rival Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose third-quarter total of $25.3 million is the biggest one so far from the Democratic presidential hopefuls. Despite neither candidate holding traditional high-dollar fundraisers, Warren and Sanders both significantly outraised former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg ($19.1 million), former Vice President Joe Biden ($15.2 million) and Sen. Kamala Harris ($11.6 million). Warren’s team was alone among those campaigns to disclose its exact cash on hand. … [Campaign manager Roger] Lau wrote that Warren added over 300,000 new donors in the third quarter, bringing her total to about 750,000 donors over the course of the campaign. Sanders' campaign said in September that it had accrued more than 1 million donors.”



Dem front-runners’ ages show larger issue for party - Politico: “Bernie Sanders’ hospitalization with a blocked artery this week finally forced the Democratic Party to confront a lingering fact: All three of its presidential front-runners are septuagenarians, and two are older than Donald Trump… For Sanders, the immediate effect of the incident — a blockage requiring two stents — was to sideline the 78-year-old senator until further notice… But the broader implications were also thrust into plain view: In a Democratic primary that was once expected to break along generational lines, a whole crop of younger contenders has fallen so far back that — even with an aging, top-tier contender laid up — it would take an upset for the party to mount a generational argument against Trump next year. Biden, Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren — the youngest of the three at 70 — are pulling nearly three-quarters of the primary electorate’s support in national polling. And even if Sanders stumbles, no younger alternative is likely to benefit. Instead, it is Sanders’ friend and fellow progressive, Warren, who might be poised to gain.”



Harris struggles to gain ground in home state - LAT: “When Kamala Harris launched her presidential bid, she counted California as a major asset. … But rather than serving as a foundation, California is exposing the cracks in her troubled campaign. Recent polling shows Harris mired in a distant fourth place, with support from fewer than 1 in 10 of those surveyed. … In part, the poor standing reflects problems that have plagued Harris nationwide: uneven debate performances, a shifting stance on issues and, perhaps above all, the lack of a clear and compelling message. But part of the explanation is California itself. The state is physically immense… It’s also astronomically expensive to advertise, and that makes it exceedingly difficult for a politician — even one elected three times to statewide office like Harris — to become well known, much less revered. In short, as other presidential hopefuls have painfully learned, there is no such thing in California as a home-state advantage.”



Walter Shapiro: Pete Buttigieg’s undeniable allure - New Republic: “Four months before the Iowa caucuses, it is time to reckon with the reality that Buttigieg probably has a better chance to be the Democratic nominee than anyone aside from Biden and the surging Warren. With Sanders ailing and Kamala Harris sputtering, Buttigieg has enough money to go the distance (he has raised $44 million in the last six months) and enough polling support to guarantee his place on every debate stage. Whatever happens next, this youthful candidate with a long resume (Harvard, Rhodes Scholar, McKinsey analyst, failed statewide candidate, mayor, and intelligence officer in Afghanistan) has already emerged as the political surprise of 2019. And that raises a new question: Is Buttigieg, who would be four years younger than JFK if he were inaugurated in 2021, ready for the White House?”

THE REAL REASON THE CHICKEN CROSSED THE ROAD

Bangor [Maine] Daily News: “It all started around two weeks ago when [Kate] McCormick returned home from a day at Common Ground Fair… ‘I was really tired and I just wanted to go to bed,’ she said. ‘I lifted up the throw pillows [on my bed], and there was an egg under them.’ McCormick said all she could do at the time was laugh, and look for the nearest suspect. In this case, her 7-year-old German Shepherd-Labrador Retriever mix Jake. … Further investigation, however, revealed the culprit. ‘I started walking around my house and found little piles of chicken poo,’ McCormick said. … The next morning … McCormick was able to witness the hen’s antics first hand. ‘I was awake and the back door was open and before I knew it, I could hear a chicken walking up the stairs in my house,’ she said. … The entire process took around 15 minutes, McCormick said, since the chicken took the time to arrange the blankets and pillows into a sort of nest into which she laid the egg.”

Hackers targeted 241 accounts in total, including those linked to the presidential campaign, government officials, media figures and prominent Iranian expatriates. Four accounts were penetrated successfully. Sources familiar with the operation told Reuters the Trump campaign was not among those successfully penetrated.

The announcement is the latest alarm that foreign governments may be looking for ways to influence the 2020 election. It comes less than a week after Iran’s foreign minister denied Iran was interfering in the 2020 presidential election, but ominously stated that “there is a cyberwar going on” in an interview with NBC.

IRAN PREPARES FOR CYBERWR AMID RISING TENSIONS, BOASTS THOUSANDS OF CYBER BATTALIONS

“The United States started that cyberwar, with attacking our nuclear facilities in a very dangerous, irresponsible way that could’ve killed millions of people. You remember Stuxnet?” Foreign Minister Javad Zarif told Chuck Todd on “Meet the Press.” “So there is a cyberwar … and Iran is engaged in that cyberwar.""

He further declared that ""any war that the United States starts, it won’t be able to finish.”

Tensions between the U.S. and Iran have been steadily rising in recent months after President Trump angered that foreign nation’s leadership by pulling out of a 2015 deal intended to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions and ramping up sanctions. Iran could be hoping to usher in a 2020 U.S. president who will look more kindly upon it.

In the 2016 election, Russian government hackers worked to infiltrate U.S. election infrastructure, and may have identified vulnerabilities ripe for exploitation in future elections. Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller warned in July that “many more countries are developing capabilities to replicate” Moscow’s activities.

The latest attacks occurred during a 30-day period between August and September, perpetrated by a group Microsoft calls Phosphorus. Keepers of the four compromised accounts have been notified and the Department of Homeland Security said it was working with Microsoft to “assess and mitigate impacts.”

Microsoft’s Tom Burt said the hackers used password reset and account recovery features to try to take over the accounts. Some 2,700 attempts were made to identify email addresses that belonged to Microsoft customers.

Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for Trump's 2020 reelection campaign, said Friday there was ""no indication that any of our campaign infrastructure was targeted."" The campaigns of Sen. Kamala Harris, Michael Bennet and Pete Buttigieg told The Associated Press they had not been targeted either.

On Friday, Fox News learned that the Islamic Republic of Iran has been beefing up its cyberintelligence forces. “Iran has been aggressive over the past several years when it comes to cyberattacks. Its back is against the wall, and it has less to lose from a cyberwar with the United States,” said David Kennedy, founder and CEO of TrustedSec and a onetime military intelligence analyst.

FAKE WEBSITE WITH IRANIAN TIES TARGETS US VETERANS, REPORT SAYS

On Sept. 27 it was announced that hackers thought to be linked to Iran were targeting servicemen and veterans, trying to infiltrate military networks. The hackers ran a fake veterans job site, hoping one of their targets would use a Department of Defense system to download and run the malware, a Homeland Security cybersecurity analyst said.

Christopher P. Hasson, 50, admitted to all four charges against him -- illegally possessing unregistered silencers, illegally possessing unserialized silencers, possession of a firearm by an unlawful user or addict of a controlled substance and illegal possession of a controlled substance -- in federal court in Greenbelt, Md.

He was not charged with any terror-related crimes.

The Coast Guard lieutenant was arrested in February in his Silver Spring, Md., home, where authorities said they found a stockpile of weapons, including 15 guns, smoke grenades, silencers and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, the opioid painkiller Tramadol and other items.

Federal prosecutors allege Hasson compiled a spreadsheet of names he planned to target and claimed the self-described white nationalist was hell-bent on the ""murder [of] innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country.""

COAST GUARD OFFICER ORDERED TO JAIL, ACCUSED OF BEING 'DOMESTIC TERRORIST'

After Thursday's hearing, Hasson's public defender said the case had been “mischaracterized and sensationalized.”

Liz Oyer said Hasson “was not plotting a terrorist attack or any of the abhorrent acts that the prosecution has repeatedly speculated about but never actually charged.”

Some of the prominent figures whose names were listed on Hasson's spreadsheet included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.; Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.; and Democratic presidential hopefuls Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris.

Several cable TV personalities, including MSNBC's Chris Hayes and Joe Scarborough and CNN's Chris Cuomo and Van Jones were also mentioned.

Investigators said Hasson searched for Scarborough’s home address in January and Googled “best place in dc to see congress people” and “civil war if trump impeached,"" according to The Washington Post.

Prosecutors said he also targeted two unidentified Supreme Court justices and two social media executives and also searched for their home addresses online.

Investigators said Hasson appeared to be inspired by Anders Behring Breivik, a Norwegian right-wing extremist who killed 77 people in a 2011 bomb attack and shooting rampage.

His lawyers filed a request last week to bar prosecutors from introducing evidence linking him to white supremacist views or associations. In 2017, Hasson wrote to a Nazi leader where he advocated for ""'focused violence' in order to establish a white homeland,"" according to prosecutors.

Hasson, who had served in the Marines, worked at Coast Guard headquarters in Washington as an acquisition officer to acquire advanced new cutters for the agency. He faces up to 31 years in prison when he is sentenced Jan. 31.

Elizabeth Warren raked in $24.6 million during the July-September fundraising quarter, blowing past former Vice President Joe Biden and coming close to Sen. Bernie Sanders' field-leading haul.

The figure affirms the momentum Warren has appeared to be gaining in recent weeks and months, as polls show her now battling Biden – once the unrivaled front-runner – for the primary lead.

While Sanders remains in third position in many polls, his fundraising is unmatched, totaling $25.3 million in the third quarter.

BIDEN RAISES $15.2 MILLION IN THIRD QUARTER, DOWN $6 MILLION FROM APRIL-JUNE HAUL

But Warren's campaign cash number comes close — and is far ahead of the $15.2 million raised by Biden in the last quarter.

Warren and Biden are essentially tied for the lead position in most recent national and early-voting-state Democratic nomination polls.

The Massachusetts senator, who’s produced one progressive policy proposal after another, announced her fundraising figures on Twitter, saying, “I’m grateful down to my toes for every grassroots supporter who chipped in.”

“Together, we’re building a movement that’s going to put power back in the hands of the people,” she pledged.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Warren’s third-quarter haul is up nearly $6 million from what she raised during the April-June quarter.

Her campaign announced that they received 943,000 contributions from more than a half-million individual donors, with 300,000 of those donors giving for the first time. And they reported that the average contribution to Warren was $26.

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg reported raising $19.1 million this quarter.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California reported bringing in $11.6 million in the third quarter, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang hauling in $10 million, triple what he raised in the second quarter. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey announced he raised over $6 million.

Best-selling spiritual author Marianne Williamson said she raised over $3 million and Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado reported raising $2.1 million.

President Trump’s reelection team, meanwhile, blew past all of them. The campaign announced that it and the Republican National Committee combined had brought in a massive $125 million in the third quarter.

Asked Thursday during a campaign stop in California how she could compete with Trump's massive war chest if she reaches the general election, Warren touted her ""grassroots movement"" and highlighted ""that's going to be our comparative advantage to win in November 2020.""

Tuesday was the first day campaigns could announce their third-quarter numbers, but they have until Oct. 15 to file their fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission.

Campaign cash is a crucial barometer of a candidate’s appeal and popularity and of his or her campaign’s strength. Fundraising dollars can be used by the candidates to pay for campaign staff and grassroots outreach efforts, travel and ads.

What’s happening now, he tweeted, is not impeachment, “it is a COUP, intended to take away the Power of the People, their VOTE, their Freedoms, their Second Amendment, Religion, Military, Border Wall, and their God-given rights as a Citizen of The United States of America!”

Leaving aside all the terrible things he says would follow his ouster, let’s be clear: This is not a coup.

Impeachment is a remedy contained in the Constitution after considerable debate by Alexander Hamilton and the other founders. Impeaching Donald Trump, especially on a party-line vote, may be dumb, reckless, blindly partisan or downright suicidal. But it is not a coup, even of the bloodless variety.

ALL THE PRESIDENT’S MEN NOW BEING DRAGGED INTO THE IMPEACHMENT DRAMA

The president isn’t the only one using intemperate language. Maxine Waters, the left-wing Democratic congresswoman, responded to his “filthy talk” by declaring, “Impeachment is not good enough for Trump. He needs to be imprisoned & placed in solitary confinement.”

So much for due process or the formality of a trial. Waters is already picking out his jail cell.

I had barely finished writing these words when the president tweeted about the “Do Nothing Democrats,” saying they are “wasting everyone’s time and energy on [BS.”] Except he spelled it out.

Look, it’s hardly surprising that rhetoric is getting way overheated with the Democrats wielding a weapon that’s only been used against Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. But words matter, in political discourse as in life. And “coup” was no accident.

Trump obviously has every incentive to rouse his supporters by painting himself as the victim of dark forces, including the media and the Deep State.

And the critics can retire to their fainting couches when he retweets a phrase like “civil war.” Journalists use the term all the time, talking about a Republican civil war or Democratic civil war or some other war.

But coup is different, and so is calling for a congressman’s arrest. Trump yesterday called Adam Schiff a “lowlife” who should resign, saying he couldn’t carry Mike Pompeo’s “blank-strap.” (Suddenly jock is a dirty word?) He’s also ended a tweet about the House Intel chairman with: “Arrest for Treason?” (The supposed treason is that Schiff exaggerated Trump’s comments on the Ukraine call in what he said was a parody.)

Kamala Harris, trying to break into the news, is demanding that Twitter suspend the president’s account. There is zero chance of that happening, as the senator well knows. Can you imagine the backlash against the company, already accused of leaning left, for banning a commander-in-chief with 63 million followers?

Harris pointed to Trump’s postings in which he likened the intelligence whistle-blower to a spy and mentioned the word treason. “These tweets represent a clear intent to baselessly discredit the whistleblower and officials in our government who are following the proper channels to report allegations of presidential impropriety,” she wrote Twitter chief Jack Dorsey.

As for the fourth estate, the president told reporters he is largely dropping “fake” and will refer to them as the “corrupt media.”

Trump was teeing off on the Washington Post, but he was mistaken; the focus of his ire was a new book by two New York Times reporters, Michael Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis.

The Times story based on the book said that in private meetings Trump “often talked about fortifying a border wall with a water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators, prompting aides to seek a cost estimate. He wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh. After publicly suggesting that soldiers shoot migrants if they threw rocks, the president backed off when his staff told him that was illegal. But later in a meeting, aides recalled, he suggested that they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down. That’s not allowed either, they told him.”

Trump ridiculed the story as a lie and said it was “stupid” to ask whether he’d ever said such things. (Davis tweeted that the White House did not deny the account when twice presented with the details.)

The president then declared that he would largely retire his “fake news” formulation in favor of “corrupt news”—which, he added for good measure, is “truly the enemy of the people.”

That’s the latest sign of Trump’s frustration, after years of negative coverage, in the midst of an impeachment inquiry.

But here’s the kicker. When Fox’s John Roberts asked Trump about a just posted New York Times story that the whistle-blower told Schiff’s staff about his complaint days before filing it, he said he couldn’t believe the paper had written it and that maybe it’s getting better. When the president views a story as more favorable, he miraculously upgrades his opinion of the press."

Yang, whose hallmark campaign promise is to hand out $1,000 a month to every American, said at several New Hampshire campaign stops that he's ""peeling off"" disaffected Trump voters by the tens of thousands. However, New Hampshire Republicans were quick to dispute that.

""Just like his math and his policies,"" N.H. GOP communications director Joe Sweeney said, ""that's a big joke.""

But the candidate who emerged from obscurity last year is piquing the interest of at least a handful of Trump supporters that have shown up at his New Hampshire events in recent weeks.

ANDREW YANG KNOCKS CNN, MSNBC FOR SNUBBING HIS $10M FROM DEM FUNDRAISING COVERAGE

""I voted for Trump in 2016 and honestly, I'll probably vote for him again if Yang doesn't make it through,"" New Hampshire voter Anthony Hegstrom said, adding that the politics the rest of the Democratic ticket is selling don't appeal to him. ""Most of what's there right now is way too far left or too typical mainstream. Biden's just the same old story and I voted for Trump for the idea that it's something different.""

The Yang campaign is generating more enthusiasm and money than a handful of his Democratic rivals as well. The campaign announced earlier this week that it had raised $10 million, beating out New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, and closing in on California Sen. Kamala Harris' fundraising numbers. Each candidate will only go as far in the race as their donation dollars will stretch.

""Many working Americans do not feel like Democrats are speaking to them,"" Yang told Fox News at a campaign stop in Nashua, N.H. ""Just the fact that I'm focused on some of the economic issues that they're seeing in their communities, makes them at least receptive.""

With Former Vice President Joe Biden still leading in a handful of polls, voters like Russell Peterson, a lifelong conservative and Trump voter, converted into a 'Yang gang' devotee, think the Democrats could see a repeat of 2016.

""If the DNC was smart they would wise up,"" said Peterson, who is from North Carolina. ""There's nobody talking like Andrew Yang is talking.""

WITH HELP OF ‘YANG GANG,’ ANDREW YANG ELBOWS HIS WAY TO DEM DEBATE STAGE

Peterson, his wife Elasa, and his toddler Zephaniah have been driving around in the country following Yang and vlogging the experience on his Youtube channel. He said he represents the forgotten ""broke folk vote,"" arguing that Yang is the first candidate to propose solutions to rampant automation.

""It makes sense to me that it's not immigrants, it's automation that's taking the jobs in America,"" Peterson said after a Yang rally in Cambridge, Mass. ""You walk into a Walmart, and where there used to be 20 registers, now you have one person managing all these self-checkouts.""

But while Yang has been able to enthuse people who show up at his rallies, he still has a long way to go to the top of the Democratic ticket. A St. Anselm College poll released this week has Yang scraping up just 2 percent of likely New Hampshire primary voters.

Southern New Hampshire political science professor Dean Spiliotes said that with his small but loyal base, Yang is the type of candidate that will stay in the race to the end.

""There is a tendency to write him off as a little bit of a curiosity,"" Spiliotes said. ""But I do think it's instructive for other candidates to stop and think what is it about his message that is appealing to this group of voters who might not typically vote Democratic.""

Another right-leaning New Hampshire voter, Chester Deorocki II, likes his message around automation – he just isn't sure $1,000-a-month promise is a smart move.

""He's got to come around to my generation,"" said Deorocki, 65, who manages a trucking company. ""He's got to blend his ideas. They can't be all one-sided. [...] Giveaways weren't in my generation.""

Among the other Democrats in the field, Deorocki said the constant Trump-bashing could end up backfiring.

""I think they got to stop bashing Trump and telling me what they want to do,"" Deorocki said. ""Because otherwise, they'll help to elect him."""

Its back is against the wall, and it has less to lose from a cyberwar with the United States,” said David Kennedy, founder and CEO of TrustedSec and a onetime military intelligence analyst.

On Sept. 27 it was announced that hackers thought to be linked to Iran were targeting servicemen and veterans, trying to infiltrate military networks. The hackers ran a fake veterans job site, hoping one of their targets would use a Department of Defense system to download and run the malware, a Homeland Security cybersecurity analyst said.

Guy Benson [00:00:00] We continue it's the Guy Benson show. Thanks for being here. Guy Benson show dot.com. Joining me now is Congressman Dan Crenshaw a Republican from Texas the 2nd Congressional District in the Lone Star State the Houston area. He's a former Navy SEAL and a repeat guest here on the program we always appreciate having him.

Guy Benson: Hello Congressman.

Rep. Crenshaw: Hey Guy It's great to be with you.

Guy Benson: Let's start with the soundbite today from the president at the White House cut 16 talking about Biden and investigations and foreign countries. This is a triple down. Have a listen.

TRUMP: China should start an investigation into the Biden's because what happened to China. Is just about as bad as what happened with. With. Ukraine. So I would say that president Zelensky if it were me I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Biden's because nobody has any doubt that they weren't crooked. That was a crooked deal 100 present.

Guy Benson: All right Congressman so there's the president. We remember what he said about Russia and hacking in 2016. Here he goes again saying that the Chinese and the Ukrainians should be investigating the Bidens. Your reaction to that is that's something the president ought to be saying.

Rep. Crenshaw: Well what we should be saying is listen the public does have an interest in knowing this.

Rep. Crenshaw: Former Vice President Biden had a serious conflict of interest that he was advocating for this Ukrainian prosecutor fired when he knew the prosecutor was investigating the company that his son was a board member. And there is a public interest in knowing that. And so you know that the president uses very loose language every time he speaks. He's talked about investigating. I'm not sure any of where the illegal on regarding Ukraine. It wasn't illegal according to Ukrainian law. All right. Any legal part of Ukrainian law. What I care about is whether there was legitimate conflict of interest and just on the facts we have it would appear that there was whether that's illegal is another question whether it really warrants a so-called investigation. Is Another question. And it really is a political calculation if they do it. Do we trust someone who so blatantly had a conflict of interest and they recuse themselves that the facts we have or are frankly involved and just getting to the core of the current debate about about Trump's transcripts. I I will say that I will defend the idea that the public does have an interest in knowing about these things it's not out of the ordinary for the future.

Rep. Crenshaw: The current president to be asking about wrongdoing of U.S. officials.I think the public does have an interest in that.

Guy Benson: There is a public interest certainly but do you try to deputize a foreign government to do the digging in the course of practicing U.S. foreign policy when you're the president. Right. I think that's an important distinction about who's doing the digging who's asking whom to do the digging and when it comes to Biden Ukraine. I'm not saying that his hands are clean but it looks like the prosecutor that he was pushing to get fired was in fact extremely corrupt was not investigating Hunter Biden at the time. I just feel like there's there's a lot of assertions being made all over the place. Congressman I'm not saying you I'm just saying all over the place on both sides of the aisle that I'm not sure that we're following the facts necessarily.

Rep. Crenshaw: Perhaps I like I said whether it's illegal or not and it's kind of irrelevant. I think it's obvious that there was a conflict of interest. It would have been appropriate for the vice president to recuse himself on that. Whether you take any more action on that subject after after that is more questionable. But to your point about listen is it ever appropriate to ask another country to investigate some kind of wrongdoing. I'm not so sure I see a problem with that. It depends on what the investigation is about. Is it official wrongdoing by U.S. officials. Yeah I don't think it's inappropriate to be signaling to other countries of which we've done in the past with that forget that just a year ago there was a letter signed to the Ukrainian government by three Democrat senators asking them to investigate. TRUMP So this is this is this is clearly not unprecedented and we didn't raise any issues back then in 2018. So those again and just normal diplomatic affairs isn't actually out of the ordinary. Trump has the ability to make everything seem out of the ordinary by the way he speaks but we do have to pay attention to the substance of what he's actually saying and the precedent that's already set.

Guy Benson: Sure in the context and what exactly he's requesting and is there an explicit quid pro quo. I think people are getting out over their skis as usual in their criticism of him. I just I don't know Congressman I feel like if if you are looking at a president or asking a foreign government to investigate that president's domestic political rival in the context of any conversation about foreign aid I think that's the type of thing that should not be done and should be avoided. I'm not saying it's impeachable I'm not saying it's illegal I just think it's not a correct use of one's public office do you. Do you disagree with that.

Rep. Crenshaw: Yeah you're making a style of it it's it's a question of style right.

Rep. Crenshaw: It's a question of whether it's appropriate for that phone call.

Rep. Crenshaw: Well it's an extremely important distinction like whether it's illegal and certainly whether it's unprecedent. And I think we have to be we have to be to think coherently about this is if you're asking a foreign government to investigate somebody's personal life because they're your political rival. Well that's a very different thing than saying that hey we have questions about what happened when this person was in office. You don't get it. You don't get a pass just because you're now running against the current president. Right. Imagine if that was the case imagine so you have to do is run against the current political leadership in all your past wrongs would never be questioned as a result because it would be somehow inappropriate to ask another government about that. I think that's crazy. So again like I like I started out with there is a public interest in knowing about about why the vice president was so involved in this one prosecutor in a foreign country when it just so happens that his son that there was a connection with the son. And why why he wasn't recused from that why the State Department wasn't taking lead on that. I think there's real questions there. OK. Trump was asking him to investigate my personal life. Would that be a different story. Right so I distinguish between those factors.

Guy Benson: I am not arguing that Biden is immune here I also think that you can look at something and say that's a misuse of power and not say well that's a crime and let's throw someone out of office. And I think what we've seen and this is where the Democrats start to come into some trouble they many of them have been saying they want to impeach the president since before he even took office. And one of the public faces of that push who has been I think pretty reckless and irresponsible and dishonest all along the path has been the chairman of the Intelligence Committee in the house Adam Schiff. And now there's a move among GOP leadership to have him censured in the house. Where do you stand on the leadership of Chairman Schiff and this censure resolution.

Rep. Crenshaw: Well he clearly one of the most dishonest members of Congress that we know of with what the Russian probe him claiming and evidence that he did not.

Rep. Crenshaw: It's now coming out that he was he was well aware of this whistleblower and the complaints being made before it was made public even though it was planned otherwise. You know his his parody account in an official hearing at a congressional hearing was supposed to act like adults.

Rep. Crenshaw: This man does a Shakespearean parody account of what the actual transcript was between Trump and and Ukrainian president. I mean it's just disgusting behavior. This man is a liar you should not be trusted that he runs a very powerful and important committee that was ever meant to be so politicized. By the way did the intelligence committee was never meant to be in the public eye. The way it is it is supposed to be a bipartisan way to conduct official national security matters in the country.

Rep. Crenshaw: And it is not what he is capable of doing and it's just it's it's sad to see that.

Guy Benson: You know one of your colleagues on the Republican side who I think is a pretty smart and serious person is at Elise Stefanik from New York. She's not someone given to spasms of insane partisanship and she's come out in the last 24 hours and said that Schiff needs to step down as the chairman of that committee I think the chances of that are nil. Pelosi is going to go to bat for her chairman but I almost wonder does that politically speaking almost help the president because Schiff has such a credibility problem if he's out there as the tip of the spear on this impeachment stuff that might not be terribly helpful to the Democrats who want to at least put on a somber serious face as they go down this path.

Rep. Crenshaw: Yeah I mean that's exactly right. A ton of respect for her. And that's exactly right.

Rep. Crenshaw: She doesn't. She takes a very objective look at people's behavior and policy as I had a do I and now she's calling for that there's some substance to it she's obviously no that committe she deals with this every day and you know should take her at her word. And to your point yeah there's a there's a real credibility problem. OK. Adam Schiff has lied to us for years about about the Russia Collusion Hoax the evidence he had lying to us again you know and again to into your last point prior about you know whether it's wrong or appropriate but not illegal.

Rep. Crenshaw: You know I would I would still push back in this case because we're assuming that there was some quid pro quo but it turns out after we get the transcript there's really no evidence of that. And that's a really important distinction to make. If if there was an obvious political quid pro quo our view on this should change. But the evidence is just not there. And the media narrative seems to be operating on that premise and it's a false premise.

Guy Benson: Congressman last question we have about a minute left. We've seen Elizabeth Warren propose in the last few days taxing speech. Kamala Harris writing to Twitter saying that the president's Twitter feed should be shut down. And of course the ongoing spat with better raw who's out there talking about gun confiscation. I mean first and second amendments I'm a little nervous about this crowd over there.

Rep. Crenshaw: Yeah they really like the Bill of Rights. I think they've made that very clear and and that's it. If you want to understand who Democrats are they believe in pure democracy in a pure democracy 51 percent the population can can can can club the rest of the 49 percent.

Rep. Crenshaw: They can change what they can tell them what they think what to do what they can own what they can't own what they can say what they can't say. Democrats believe that it's in the name then Democrat Republicans believe.

Guy Benson: Yes and thankfully Congressman we have a republic if we can keep it. Congressman Dan Crenshaw of Texas. Always a pleasure sir. We gotta go. Taking a break. Back next on THE GUY BENSON show."

TEAM TRUMP CONSIDERS APPEALING TO DEMS IN GOP DISTRICTS

WaPo: “White House officials intent on stopping the House from impeaching President Trump are considering appealing to moderate Democrats in Republican districts to stand with the president, a pursuit at odds with fresh political attacks from the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee. The nascent outreach campaign would target some of the 31 Democrats from congressional districts Trump won in 2016, many of whom ran on rebuilding infrastructure, improving trade deals and lowering the cost of prescription drugs, according to multiple officials familiar with the strategy. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk freely, said the appeal would be based on these Democrats’ 2018 election promises to work with the president — accompanied with a warning that impeachment would hamper possible legislative victories.”



Impeachment vets urge caution - AP: “But the Republicans who carried out President Bill Clinton’s impeachment in 1998 are unanimous in urging caution and restraint as Congress embarks on yet another impeachment struggle, this time over accusations that President Donald Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and Biden’s son. The impeachment veterans of two decades ago were thrust into a seismic political event that was sober and circus-like at the same time. So began a new, angry chapter of American politics that strained Washington institutions that were stronger then than now. … Today, those Clinton impeachment Republicans are urging a pause in the tribalism of the Trump era. … The best-known is Lindsey Graham, a former Air Force prosecutor who was among those most aggressively gunning for Clinton. … The most senior of two Clinton prosecutor remaining in the House is Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin... Clinton impeachment manager Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, wasn’t eager to take a walk down memory lane when encountered in the Capitol last week…”



Kraushaar: The impeachment bellwethers - National Journal: “All told, the numbers suggest that while the politics of impeachment hearings now favor the Democrats, the prospect of building enough bipartisan support to remove Trump from office remains remote. … It’s easy to expect the Republican base remaining solidly behind the president regardless of new information, but it’s hard to see how the broader politics improve for Trump or his party. Despite the partisanship, there are still many members of Congress whose perspective on impeachment going forward will be worth watching closely. They’re the bellwethers, the swing votes whose forthcoming reactions will reflect the mood of the country. There are four categories of members I’m closely watching: the swing-state Republicans, the red-state Democrats, the Republican retirees, and the swing-district freshman Democrats with national security experience.”



Jim Geraghty: Don’t obsess over whistleblower - National Review: “Here’s an assessment sure to be unpopular: When the story of the impeachment effort against President Trump is written, the whistleblower will be an afterthought or a minor player in the overall story at most. Either the whistleblower’s claims are accurate, or they aren’t. Impeachment will hinge upon whether President Trump’s actions strike lawmakers as an effort to effectively blackmail Ukraine into finding dirt on Joe Biden, or whether it’s just Trump being Trump, wanting the facts on Biden strong-arming a foreign government to fire a prosecutor who might have been investigating a company that employed his son. The vast majority of lawmakers’ conclusions on this will just happen to align with their partisan affiliations.”



Schumer continues to press McConnell - Politico: “Chuck Schumer wants Senate Democrats to keep the pressure on Mitch McConnell to hold a fair trial if impeachment of President Donald Trump comes to the Senate — but he also wants to keep whacking the majority leader for presiding over a ‘legislative graveyard.’ The Senate minority leader convened a conference call with his caucus on Wednesday to stay focused on its double-barreled messaging tactics while his 47 members are scattered across the country in the middle of a two-week recess, according to three people familiar with the call. … Schumer (D-N.Y.) urged his colleagues to not act partisan amid the impeachment inquiry and pressure McConnell (R-Ky.) to commit to a fair process if the House impeaches the president, according to a Democratic aide briefed on the call. … A second Democrat briefed on the call said some in the party are anxious for more strategic guidance from party leaders.”



The Judge’s Ruling: Trump attacks his own presidency - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano explains the Democrats’ evidence against President Trump and why he should present a principled defense if he has one: “Federal law defines as criminal the solicitation of aid – anything of value – for a political campaign from a foreign national or foreign government, whether the thing of value arrives or not. Federal law also prohibits bribery and attempted bribery, which is defined as withholding the performance of an official duty conditioned upon the personal receipt of a thing of value, whether the thing of value arrives or not. The law further prohibits intimidating witnesses, which is defined as the use of language designed to deter witnesses from giving testimony, whether the intimidation is successful or not.” More here.

TIME OUT: THE TECH BEHIND MUSIC

Smithsonian: “With its cheery singles, theatrical medley and iconic cover, The Beatles’ 11th studio album, ‘Abbey Road,’ holds a special place in the hearts of the band’s fans. But as the album celebrates its 50th anniversary, few may realize just how groundbreaking its tracks were for the band. In [William D. Moylan’s] forthcoming book, ‘Recording Analysis: How the Record Shapes the Song,’ [he shows] how the recording process can enhance the artistry of songs, and ‘Abbey Road’ is one of the albums [he highlights]. Beginning with 1965’s ‘Rubber Soul,’ The Beatles started exploring new sounds. This quest continued in ‘Abbey Road,’ where the band was able to deftly incorporate emerging recording technology in a way that set the album apart from everything they had previously done. … ‘Abbey Road’ … shows how a song can be poetically written and an instrument deftly played. But the way a track is recorded can be the artist’s final stamp on the song.”

DEMS GRUMBLE OVER LARGE DEBATE STAGE

Politico: “The next Democratic presidential primary debate will likely be historic — but probably not for the reason Democrats were hoping. The Democratic National Committee announced Wednesday that 12 candidates have qualified for the Oct. 15 debate in Westerville, Ohio. And unlike the previous rounds, when the stage was limited to 10 candidates, which resulted in the first two debates being split into two consecutive nights, all 12 are set to share one stage on Oct. 15.This would make it the largest presidential primary debate ever, Republican or Democrat… Invited to the debate are: Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julián Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O’Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang. If none of the candidates drop out between now and the debate — and Sanders participates in the debate after his recent heart procedure — it will surpass the previous record of 11 candidates on a primary debate stage, set by Republicans during the 2016 cycle. The crowded stage is leading to some grumbling from Democrats, who are already conscious about their speaking time.”



Biden tries to fashion a Super Tuesday firewall - Politico: “Joe Biden’s campaign is ramping up its investment in Super Tuesday states, anticipating a Democratic race that narrows to two candidates by early March. The increase in staffing across the 14 states that will vote March 3 comes as Biden’s polling figures have declined and Elizabeth Warren’s have surged, particularly in states like Iowa and New Hampshire where she’s heavily invested in field organization. The former vice president’s campaign is still counting on strong finishes in the four early nominating states. But in the event of weaker-than-expected performances, a built-out Super Tuesday organization would provide a fail-safe for Biden. Many of the states on the Super Tuesday map — which includes a handful of Southern and Border states — play to his strengths among African-American voters and more moderate Democrats.”



Molly Ball: Harris remains an enigma to voters - Time: “Perhaps, in these days of brutal ideological combat, that kind of pragmatism could be sold as refreshing. But in Harris’ case it seems to be having the opposite effect. Some of the attendees at her events in Iowa told me they don’t think she’s progressive enough; others said she strikes them as too far left. ‘She hasn’t gone far enough to get the activists behind her, but she’s gone too far for some of the moderates,’ says Larry Gerston, a professor emeritus of political science at San Jose State University. ‘So she’s in kind of a no-person’s-land in terms of having a good base.’ And yet, polls indicate that Democratic voters still want to like her–if only they can figure out what she’s about. The race is far from over. Iowa voters are notorious for shopping around until the end.”



Klobuchar leans on family’s Iron Range roots - Roll Call: “If there’s proof of Klobuchar’s strengths as a candidate, it’s her margins in conservative parts of Minnesota. Despite Trump winning the 8th District — home to the Iron Range — by 16 points in 2016, and Democrats losing the seat last fall, Klobuchar carried it by more than 10 points in her 2018 reelection. But as Democrats have seen slippage in the Midwest, so has Klobuchar. Her margins last year in some conservative congressional districts were significantly lower than in 2012. Before she can try to extend that Minnesota success nationwide, she has to win over the Democratic Party base. ‘It would be unlikely,’ [University of Minnesota professor Larry] Jacobs said. ‘But I never give up on Amy Klobuchar. No one is going to outwork her.’”

AUDIBLE: THAT’S SOME PRETTY THICK BATTER

“There are different ways to bake the cake, depending on what sort of cake you want. Different flavoring, different temperatures, different ingredients yield different types of cake, and the president as the master baker is testing recipes and deciding what type of cake he wants.” – A senior White House official talking to the WaPo about President Trump’s freestyle solo approach to impeachment messaging.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I do enjoy reading the Halftime report and especially the From the Bleachers section where I can see how others are reacting to what they read. Your responses are usually spot on but [on Tuesday] I took umbrage to your calling the impeachment process ‘festivities’. While politics in general tends to resemble Battlebots and political conventions are certainly festive the gravity of what is taking place in Washington now should be handled with more seriousness. The potential removal of a duly elected president regardless of the outcome will leave wounds on this country that will take a long time to heal. We may not recognize our Republic when all is said and done due to the scars left behind. One can only hope that later generations can learn where we failed to, so that Impeachment, or the threat of it, is not used as a political tool every 4 years and never becomes something resembling a festival.” – Dave Fischer, Memphis, Tenn.



[Ed. note: I know that it’s very tempting to think the worst, Mr. Fischer. It not only seems more dramatic and historic than being optimistic, it also fits into the nation’s dour mood these days. I know it’s also tempting to take umbrage. In fact, umbrage taking has become sort of our new national pastime. The outrage olympics have overtaken our politics in a profound way. And while I do feel bad that you were offended at my jocularity, I am going to continue to decline to take politics so seriously. The issues at stake are too important to hang on every word of politicians. There’s no way around the partisan conflict ahead, but I still tend to think that there’s something better waiting on the other side. I’m grateful for your readership and hope you can stick with us despite my commitment to due flippancy.]



“Some are saying in the Senate trial, assuming the president is impeached, that the president’s attorneys will have the opportunity to subpoena and question anyone. By anyone, they’re suggesting Comey, Strzok, Page, Ohr, Holder, Lynch, Steele, Brennan, Clapper, not to mention Hilary Clinton… quite literally, anyone. It’s difficult to imagine that this is so, but, if it is, well, the country’s in for a tantalizing, and surely painful, show…” – B. A. Street, Colorado Springs, Colo.



[Ed. note: The Senate gets to make up its own trial rules. How long, how many witnesses, in what order, etc. would all be up for grabs if the House impeaches. I think the scenario you describe – weeks of confusing testimony going down alternate narratives, etc. – would be a bipartisan nightmare. Instead, I expect senators would prefer tight, concise presentations.]

The gator, which Humane Animal Rescue named ‘Gus,’ was found near the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh's Lawrenceville neighborhood. … George DeSavage and his girlfriend spotted the alligator. He said, ‘We were just down there sitting watching the sunset by the river and I happened to glance down and see it just sitting there.’ DeSavage said he wanted to save the animal and possibly prevent a dangerous situation for someone else. … He said grabbing the alligator was the right thing to do. ‘It was calm.

Appearing on ""Outnumbered Overtime"" with host Harris Faulkner, Starr said that he believed there was an ""air of illegitimacy"" to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's impeachment push and ""an abuse of power by the Speaker not holding a vote"" before the full House of Representatives.

""What's wrong with that?"" Starr asked. ""And, in fact, it's consist--I believe, with the texts--certainly the spirit of the Constitution which says the House of Representatives have the sole power of impeachment. Not a committee.""

On Thursday, the Trump administration confirmed to Fox News that it will send Pelosi a letter ""daring"" her to hold a vote on the impeachment inquiry.

The letter will say that the White House won't comply with the Democrats' investigation because Pelosi hasn't codified the probe with a formal vote on the House floor. The letter will mirror the tone of a letter House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., sent to the speaker on Thursday.

""Look, this is a political fight,"" Starr told Faulkner. ""Let's grow up and have a real democratic process where we debate. And, if we can't agree and it's a legal issue, we go to court. The court will resolve it, as it always has in our history.""

""The history of liberty is the history of process. Process counts,"" Starr noted. ""So, we need to have the protocol: the rules of engagement. So yes, so that the Republican minority has its rights and those are clearly delineated.""

""It's a very unfortunate situation that the Speaker has unleashed. For whatever reason...she clearly does not want a vote!"" he concluded."

The admission puts the mayor on a long line of corrupt leadership in the city, which has been riddled with chronic budget problems.

Frank Gillam Jr. told the judge he stole funds raised from donors in Atlantic City and Philadelphia for the Atlantic City Starz for personal expenses between 2013 and 2018. He was elected mayor in 2017 after serving as a City Councilman.

He was released after posting a $100,000 bond with the court, but New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and other elected officials quickly called for him to resign. Plans were already being made for the City Council president to assume Gillam’s position.

Gillam, 49, faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted in his trial, which is set for Jan. 7. Half of the money he stole was recovered from his home when FBI agents raided it in December, and he’s agreed to pay restitution for the fraud.

According to prosecutors, Gillam used the money for personal expenses such as luxury clothing, expensive meals and trips. He had solicited the donations using his political office under the false pretense they were for the youth basketball team or for school supplies for underprivileged children.

“When a scheme depletes (a) charity for children, it's unconscionable,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Gregory Ehrie. “But when the fraud is perpetrated by someone the public trusts, it damages the community's confidence in their public servants. This defendant betrayed the trust of his community and of people who wanted to improve the lives of children.”

Gillam’s lawyer, Harry Rimm, issued a defense that Gillam only admitted misusing private funds, not public money, which he argued made the mayor better than many of his predecessors. The city was on the brink of bankruptcy when Gillam took office in 2017 as its casino industry struggled.

The New York Times called it another example of ""the president using high-level diplomacy to advance his personal political interests.""

No, it's not. The president's critics are conflating two different things: the investigation by Trump's private lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, into Hunter Biden's business dealings, and the official inquiry by U.S. Attorney John Durham into the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.

The former is opposition research activity; the latter is a criminal justice matter.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with asking foreign heads of state or intelligence officials to cooperate with an official Justice Department investigation. As George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley explains: ""It is not uncommon for an attorney general, or even a president, to ask foreign leaders to assist with ongoing investigations. Such calls can shortcut bureaucratic red tape, particularly if the evidence is held, as in this case, by national security or justice officials.""

PETER SCHWEIZER: THE BOTTOM LINE IS JOE BIDEN HIS SON'S UKRAINE DEALINGS MUST BE INVESTIGATED

Americans support the Durham probe. For two years, they were told by Trump's opponents that the president was ""working on behalf of the Russians"" and had committed ""treasonous"" acts that were of ""a size and scope probably beyond Watergate.""

Those were serious accusations, and Americans took them seriously. They waited for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to tell them whether the president had indeed betrayed the country.

Then Mueller issued his report, and they found out that none of it was true. They understandably wanted answers.

How did it come to pass that our government was paralyzed for two years and spent tens of millions of their tax dollars, chasing a Trump-Russia collusion conspiracy theory?

A Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll following the Mueller report's public release found that 53 percent of Americans said that ""bias against President Trump in the FBI played a role in launching investigations against him,"" and 62 percent supported appointing a special counsel to investigate the investigation of Trump.

Instead of a special counsel, Barr appointed Durham, a career prosecutor, to lead the investigation that Americans demanded. Durham is a man of unimpeachable character who was appointed by Obama administration Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate the CIA's terrorist interrogation program.

At the conclusion of that probe, which ended without any criminal charges, Holder praised Durham for working ""tirelessly to conduct an extraordinarily thorough and complete"" investigation.

Now Barr has asked Durham to bring the same tireless professionalism to his investigation into the origins of the Mueller probe. But suddenly, all those who were so eager to find out what happened in 2016 when they thought Mueller would reveal that Trump conspired with the Russians have lost interest.

The same people who were outraged at Trump's efforts to discredit the Mueller probe are now doing the exact same thing to the Durham probe. Back then, Democrats insisted Trump stop criticizing the investigation and ""let Mueller follow the facts wherever they lead."" Now they need to heed their own advice: Stop criticizing the investigation.

Let Durham follow the facts wherever they lead. If there was no wrongdoing, then there is nothing to worry about.

To be sure, Trump bears some responsibility for helping Democrats lump together Durham's official investigation with Giuliani's partisan activities by mentioning them both on the call with Ukraine's president.

There should be a firewall between the two inquiries. Instead, Trump and Giuliani have blurred those lines.

But keep in mind, it was Democrats who told us there is nothing wrong or illegal with a presidential candidate hiring a private lawyer to conduct opposition research in a foreign country on their political opponents. After it emerged that the Clinton campaign and the DNC had paid Christopher Steele to dig up dirt in Russia on Trump, the Democrats' defense was: That's just opposition research. Everyone does it.

The biggest problem with the Steele dossier was not that Democrats paid for opposition research, but that the FBI might have used it as the basis for spying on the Trump campaign – which is part of what Durham is investigating.

Durham is no partisan actor. Despite political pressure, he cleared the CIA of wrongdoing during the Obama administration. Like Mueller, he will follow the facts wherever they lead. Maybe that is why so many Democrats are up in arms.

Trump to send Pelosi a letter 'daring' her to hold impeachment inquiry vote

The White House will send House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., a letter on Friday ""daring"" her to hold a vote on Democrats' impeachment inquiry into President Trump, Fox News has confirmed. The letter will say the White House won't comply with the Democrats' investigation because Pelosi hasn't codified the probe with a formal vote on the House floor. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., sent a similar letter to Pelosi on Thursday, taking issue with reports that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., was limiting Republicans' ability to ask questions during Thursday’s testimony by former U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, who resigned last week. Pelosi shot back at McCarthy, saying that ""existing rules of the House provide House committees with full authority to conduct investigations for all matters under their jurisdiction."" Speaking to ABC's “Good Morning America” Thursday, Pelosi defended Schiff, who was criticized for reading a ""parody"" of President Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Congress, stating “He did not make it up.""

Adam Schiff-Ukraine connection comes under scrutiny

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who has played a leading role in investigating the Trump-Ukraine scandal, is facing questions about his own connection to a Soviet-born businessman who has raised money for his campaign and whose company has received lucrative defense contracts from Ukraine's government. That man is Igor Pasternak, founder and CEO of Worldwide Aeros Corp., which makes blimps for military and commercial customers, including the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense. In 2013, Pasternak hosted a fundraiser in Washington for Schiff, who later came to embrace a strong stance in support of the U.S. sending military aid to Ukraine during its conflict with Russia.

Documents heighten scrutiny on Biden-Ukraine dealings, indicate Hunter Biden may have made ‘millions’

A batch of newly released documents, including court filings as well as notes from interviews conducted by Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, raised more questions about how much money former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter made while serving on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas firm at the center of the controversy, with one estimate putting the figure in the ""millions."" Among the documents, as Fox News reported Wednesday, are notes from an interview Trump attorney Giuliani conducted with fired Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin earlier this year, in which he claimed he was told by former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey R. Pyatt to back off an investigation involving that firm, Burisma Holdings, and its founder. According to interview notes, Shokin claimed Pyatt -- currently the ambassador to Greece -- told him to handle that investigation “with white gloves.” Shokin said his “investigations stopped out of fear of the United States.” Click here for more on this story.

In other developments in the formal Trump impeachment inquiry: Republican lawmakers who were present at ex-Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker’s closed-door marathon interview before three House committees on Thursday seemed confident it disproved any allegations of a ""quid pro quo"" in the impeachment inquiry of President Trump, as sources told Fox News that Volker was worried about the reliability of the Ukrainian prosecutor informing Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. Volker did not think Victor Shokin, the prosecutor investigating Ukrainian firm Burisma -- on which Hunter Biden held a board seat -- was reliable when he told Giuliani that he was told to back off of the investigation at then-Vice President Joe Biden's behest, which is why he worried what Giuliani might try to do with Shokin's claims, according to sources familiar with the testimony. Text messages obtained by Fox News showed Volker and other U.S. officials battling internally over whether Trump was engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukraine as he pressed the country to look into the Biden family, reportedly using $400 million in military aid as leverage during a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to induce him to have officials investigate the Bidens.

Chinese woman caught at Mar-a-Lago with malware was apparently asked to target Clintons: docs

A Chinese businesswoman who was convicted of trespassing at President Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida earlier this year had been urged by her handler to target other famous figures including the Clintons and billionaire businessman Warren Buffett, court documents say. Yujing Zhang, 33, who is scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 22, was caught by Secret Service agents with troves of technology embedded with malware and thousands of dollars in cash after she claimed that she was at Trump's prestigious club to attend a “United Nations friendship event” that had apparently been canceled. Her bizarre behavior and backstory led to suspicions that she was a Chinese government spy, but she was not charged with espionage or related crimes.

Zhang apparently purchased a $20,000 travel package from Li Weitian, also known as Charles Lee, who advertised tickets on the Chinese social media site WeChat promising access to events across the U.S. to meet prominent political and business figures. Upon learning that the event at Mar-a-Lago had been canceled, Lee tried to convince Zhang to attend another event on Wall Street in New York City, text messages between the pair released by the South Florida court Thursday revealed. Bill and Hillary Clinton were scheduled to be there. Click here for more on this story.

Environmental protesters spray UK's Treasury building with fake blood, four arrested

British police arrested four members of the climate activist group Extinction Rebellion on Thursday after they used a fire hose to spray the U.K.’s Treasury building with hundreds of gallons of fake blood. The group said it carried out the protest because it wanted to raise awareness of the ""inconsistency between the U.K. government's insistence that the U.K. is a world leader in tackling climate breakdown while pouring vast sums of money into fossil exploration and carbon-intensive projects,” according to Sky News. Organizers said they sprayed 1,800 liters of red liquid colored with food dye at the Treasury building, yet most of it appeared to have ended up on the street and sidewalk, Sky News reports. At another point, the protesters lost control of the decommissioned fire engine’s hose, it added. Click here for more on this story.

In one example, De Niro allegedly went ballistic on the woman, calling her a “spoiled brat” in an explicit voicemail when she did not answer his phone call, according to the suit. “How dare you f------ disrespect me?,” he said in the voicemail, in which he also told her: “You’re f------ history.” Last Sunday, De Niro startled CNN and its viewers when he used profanity during a live on-air interview.

TRUMP OFFERS NO OFF-RAMPS FOR REPUBLICANS

The news these days is pretty grim for the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress.



The central claim of the whistleblower who came forward to authorities was that President Trump was pressuring America’s Ukrainian allies for dirt on Trump’s chief political rival, Joe Biden.



It has not only been proven true, the president is now doing it right out in the open. He’s even added China to the list of foreign powers he wants to provide opposition research on the Democratic front runner.



Worse, newly revealed texts between American diplomats show that senior State Department officials believed that Trump was conditioning U.S. aid to the long-beleaguered former Soviet republic on the provision of anti-Biden goodies.



But in potentially the worst development so far, it is now alleged that Trump’s personal defense attorney was dangling the promise of an official diplomatic visit to the White House for the Ukrainian president in exchange for a public statement from the Ukrainian leader to investigate Biden and his family’s business dealings in Kyiv.



Team Trump is having some success in deflecting attention, discrediting the California Democrat in charge of the House Intelligence Committee (who’s doing a pretty good job of discrediting himself) and bringing increased attention to the younger Biden’s super-swampy business model.



But the damage is already done. Trump has admitted that the central allegations are true. He has been and is using his office for his own political advantage. All presidents do in more innocuous ways — Air Force One as campaign prop, “official” events as rallies, the White House as an extension of the campaign — but dragging diplomats and involving one of the most potentially dangerous parts of the globe is new.



For Trump loyalists who are in the shoot-‘em-on-Fifth-Avenue club, this is not a problem. They agree with the president that his conduct was “perfect.” They are also convinced that Trump’s predecessor did as bad or worse but was protected by the media. But for those who are not acolytes of Trumpism, including the persuadable voters he desperately needs to win back for re-election, this is turning toxic.



Add in news of an increasingly slouchy economy and you have perhaps the worst political run for this administration yet.



That’s not to say that it’s likely that Trump would ever be removed by the Republican-held Senate. The idea that 20 Republican senators would join Democrats in ousting Trump still sounds laughable.



But the president is certainly not helping his cause with a scorched earth strategy that provides no shelter for his less-fanatically-devoted allies.



Trump’s stance is that he did nothing wrong — again “perfect” — and that anyone who says so is part of the cabal trying to drive him from office.



That’s not going to cut it for lawmakers, especially for vulnerable Senate Republicans, as the 2020 election approaches. They need a space in between: Denunciation of dragging other countries into American politics while still saying Trump’s behavior doesn’t merit removal from office.



Bill Clinton’s team in 1998 knew they had to give Democrats a chance to denounce the president’s scuzzy behavior. Those denunciations actually strengthened Clinton’s standing in the Senate and with voters. He was being punished, formally and informally, and so wasn’t getting away with it. It helped turn him into a sympathetic figure.



Trump and his party are right now a long way from anything like that.



THE RULEBOOK: SERIOUS STUFF

“There is hardly any part of the system which could have been attended with greater difficulty in the arrangement of it than [the executive department]; and there is, perhaps, none which has been inveighed against with less candor or criticised with less judgment.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 67



TIME OUT: BON APPÉTIT, Y’ALL

Garden&Gun: “Nearly any Southerner who grew up in the country—whether on one acre or ten thousand—has seen the damage feral hogs do, trampling and uprooting crops and native plants alike. Raised in a North Texas cattle-ranching family, Taylor Hall experienced firsthand the destruction—and one potential solution. ‘Some of the cowboys I worked with would kill them for pig roasts, gumbo, and so forth,’ he says. … Hall kicked around California kitchens before returning home to open his own restaurant, Apis, in the hills outside Austin. A must for his menu: wild pig. … Hall compares the meat with beef. ‘It’s a lot darker because it’s an animal that moves around a lot, so there’s more blood in its muscles. And with that, you’re going to get more of that iron-y, metallic flavor.’ At Apis, Hall cures the meat for charcuterie and grinds it to make a traditional, slow-cooked Italian ragù, a.k.a. Sunday gravy.”

WARREN, SANDERS LAP BIDEN IN THIRD QUARTER FUNDRAISING

Politico: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign said Friday that it raised $24.6 million in the third quarter and has $25.7 million cash on hand, further solidifying her rise to the top tier in the Democratic primary. The haul bests the $19 million Warren raised last quarter but trails progressive rival Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose third-quarter total of $25.3 million is the biggest one so far from the Democratic presidential hopefuls. Despite neither candidate holding traditional high-dollar fundraisers, Warren and Sanders both significantly outraised former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg ($19.1 million), former Vice President Joe Biden ($15.2 million) and Sen. Kamala Harris ($11.6 million). Warren’s team was alone among those campaigns to disclose its exact cash on hand. … [Campaign manager Roger] Lau wrote that Warren added over 300,000 new donors in the third quarter, bringing her total to about 750,000 donors over the course of the campaign. Sanders' campaign said in September that it had accrued more than 1 million donors.”



Dem front-runners’ ages show larger issue for party - Politico: “Bernie Sanders’ hospitalization with a blocked artery this week finally forced the Democratic Party to confront a lingering fact: All three of its presidential front-runners are septuagenarians, and two are older than Donald Trump… For Sanders, the immediate effect of the incident — a blockage requiring two stents — was to sideline the 78-year-old senator until further notice… But the broader implications were also thrust into plain view: In a Democratic primary that was once expected to break along generational lines, a whole crop of younger contenders has fallen so far back that — even with an aging, top-tier contender laid up — it would take an upset for the party to mount a generational argument against Trump next year. Biden, Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren — the youngest of the three at 70 — are pulling nearly three-quarters of the primary electorate’s support in national polling. And even if Sanders stumbles, no younger alternative is likely to benefit. Instead, it is Sanders’ friend and fellow progressive, Warren, who might be poised to gain.”



Harris struggles to gain ground in home state - LAT: “When Kamala Harris launched her presidential bid, she counted California as a major asset. … But rather than serving as a foundation, California is exposing the cracks in her troubled campaign. Recent polling shows Harris mired in a distant fourth place, with support from fewer than 1 in 10 of those surveyed. … In part, the poor standing reflects problems that have plagued Harris nationwide: uneven debate performances, a shifting stance on issues and, perhaps above all, the lack of a clear and compelling message. But part of the explanation is California itself. The state is physically immense… It’s also astronomically expensive to advertise, and that makes it exceedingly difficult for a politician — even one elected three times to statewide office like Harris — to become well known, much less revered. In short, as other presidential hopefuls have painfully learned, there is no such thing in California as a home-state advantage.”



Walter Shapiro: Pete Buttigieg’s undeniable allure - New Republic: “Four months before the Iowa caucuses, it is time to reckon with the reality that Buttigieg probably has a better chance to be the Democratic nominee than anyone aside from Biden and the surging Warren. With Sanders ailing and Kamala Harris sputtering, Buttigieg has enough money to go the distance (he has raised $44 million in the last six months) and enough polling support to guarantee his place on every debate stage. Whatever happens next, this youthful candidate with a long resume (Harvard, Rhodes Scholar, McKinsey analyst, failed statewide candidate, mayor, and intelligence officer in Afghanistan) has already emerged as the political surprise of 2019. And that raises a new question: Is Buttigieg, who would be four years younger than JFK if he were inaugurated in 2021, ready for the White House?”

THE REAL REASON THE CHICKEN CROSSED THE ROAD

Bangor [Maine] Daily News: “It all started around two weeks ago when [Kate] McCormick returned home from a day at Common Ground Fair… ‘I was really tired and I just wanted to go to bed,’ she said. ‘I lifted up the throw pillows [on my bed], and there was an egg under them.’ McCormick said all she could do at the time was laugh, and look for the nearest suspect. In this case, her 7-year-old German Shepherd-Labrador Retriever mix Jake. … Further investigation, however, revealed the culprit. ‘I started walking around my house and found little piles of chicken poo,’ McCormick said. … The next morning … McCormick was able to witness the hen’s antics first hand. ‘I was awake and the back door was open and before I knew it, I could hear a chicken walking up the stairs in my house,’ she said. … The entire process took around 15 minutes, McCormick said, since the chicken took the time to arrange the blankets and pillows into a sort of nest into which she laid the egg.”

Hackers targeted 241 accounts in total, including those linked to the presidential campaign, government officials, media figures and prominent Iranian expatriates. Four accounts were penetrated successfully. Sources familiar with the operation told Reuters the Trump campaign was not among those successfully penetrated.

The announcement is the latest alarm that foreign governments may be looking for ways to influence the 2020 election. It comes less than a week after Iran’s foreign minister denied Iran was interfering in the 2020 presidential election, but ominously stated that “there is a cyberwar going on” in an interview with NBC.

IRAN PREPARES FOR CYBERWR AMID RISING TENSIONS, BOASTS THOUSANDS OF CYBER BATTALIONS

“The United States started that cyberwar, with attacking our nuclear facilities in a very dangerous, irresponsible way that could’ve killed millions of people. You remember Stuxnet?” Foreign Minister Javad Zarif told Chuck Todd on “Meet the Press.” “So there is a cyberwar … and Iran is engaged in that cyberwar.""

He further declared that ""any war that the United States starts, it won’t be able to finish.”

Tensions between the U.S. and Iran have been steadily rising in recent months after President Trump angered that foreign nation’s leadership by pulling out of a 2015 deal intended to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions and ramping up sanctions. Iran could be hoping to usher in a 2020 U.S. president who will look more kindly upon it.

In the 2016 election, Russian government hackers worked to infiltrate U.S. election infrastructure, and may have identified vulnerabilities ripe for exploitation in future elections. Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller warned in July that “many more countries are developing capabilities to replicate” Moscow’s activities.

The latest attacks occurred during a 30-day period between August and September, perpetrated by a group Microsoft calls Phosphorus. Keepers of the four compromised accounts have been notified and the Department of Homeland Security said it was working with Microsoft to “assess and mitigate impacts.”

Microsoft’s Tom Burt said the hackers used password reset and account recovery features to try to take over the accounts. Some 2,700 attempts were made to identify email addresses that belonged to Microsoft customers.

Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for Trump's 2020 reelection campaign, said Friday there was ""no indication that any of our campaign infrastructure was targeted."" The campaigns of Sen. Kamala Harris, Michael Bennet and Pete Buttigieg told The Associated Press they had not been targeted either.

On Friday, Fox News learned that the Islamic Republic of Iran has been beefing up its cyberintelligence forces. “Iran has been aggressive over the past several years when it comes to cyberattacks. Its back is against the wall, and it has less to lose from a cyberwar with the United States,” said David Kennedy, founder and CEO of TrustedSec and a onetime military intelligence analyst.

On Sept. 27 it was announced that hackers thought to be linked to Iran were targeting servicemen and veterans, trying to infiltrate military networks. The hackers ran a fake veterans job site, hoping one of their targets would use a Department of Defense system to download and run the malware, a Homeland Security cybersecurity analyst said.

Elizabeth Warren raked in $24.6 million during the July-September fundraising quarter, blowing past former Vice President Joe Biden and coming close to Sen. Bernie Sanders' field-leading haul.

The figure affirms the momentum Warren has appeared to be gaining in recent weeks and months, as polls show her now battling Biden – once the unrivaled front-runner – for the primary lead.

While Sanders remains in third position in many polls, his fundraising is unmatched, totaling $25.3 million in the third quarter.

BIDEN RAISES $15.2 MILLION IN THIRD QUARTER, DOWN $6 MILLION FROM APRIL-JUNE HAUL

But Warren's campaign cash number comes close — and is far ahead of the $15.2 million raised by Biden in the last quarter.

Warren and Biden are essentially tied for the lead position in most recent national and early-voting-state Democratic nomination polls.

The Massachusetts senator, who’s produced one progressive policy proposal after another, announced her fundraising figures on Twitter, saying, “I’m grateful down to my toes for every grassroots supporter who chipped in.”

“Together, we’re building a movement that’s going to put power back in the hands of the people,” she pledged.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Warren’s third-quarter haul is up nearly $6 million from what she raised during the April-June quarter.

Her campaign announced that they received 943,000 contributions from more than a half-million individual donors, with 300,000 of those donors giving for the first time. And they reported that the average contribution to Warren was $26.

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg reported raising $19.1 million this quarter.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California reported bringing in $11.6 million in the third quarter, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang hauling in $10 million, triple what he raised in the second quarter. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey announced he raised over $6 million.

Best-selling spiritual author Marianne Williamson said she raised over $3 million and Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado reported raising $2.1 million.

President Trump’s reelection team, meanwhile, blew past all of them. The campaign announced that it and the Republican National Committee combined had brought in a massive $125 million in the third quarter.

Asked Thursday during a campaign stop in California how she could compete with Trump's massive war chest if she reaches the general election, Warren touted her ""grassroots movement"" and highlighted ""that's going to be our comparative advantage to win in November 2020.""

Tuesday was the first day campaigns could announce their third-quarter numbers, but they have until Oct. 15 to file their fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission.

Campaign cash is a crucial barometer of a candidate’s appeal and popularity and of his or her campaign’s strength. Fundraising dollars can be used by the candidates to pay for campaign staff and grassroots outreach efforts, travel and ads.

Yang, whose hallmark campaign promise is to hand out $1,000 a month to every American, said at several New Hampshire campaign stops that he's ""peeling off"" disaffected Trump voters by the tens of thousands. However, New Hampshire Republicans were quick to dispute that.

""Just like his math and his policies,"" N.H. GOP communications director Joe Sweeney said, ""that's a big joke.""

But the candidate who emerged from obscurity last year is piquing the interest of at least a handful of Trump supporters that have shown up at his New Hampshire events in recent weeks.

ANDREW YANG KNOCKS CNN, MSNBC FOR SNUBBING HIS $10M FROM DEM FUNDRAISING COVERAGE

""I voted for Trump in 2016 and honestly, I'll probably vote for him again if Yang doesn't make it through,"" New Hampshire voter Anthony Hegstrom said, adding that the politics the rest of the Democratic ticket is selling don't appeal to him. ""Most of what's there right now is way too far left or too typical mainstream. Biden's just the same old story and I voted for Trump for the idea that it's something different.""

The Yang campaign is generating more enthusiasm and money than a handful of his Democratic rivals as well. The campaign announced earlier this week that it had raised $10 million, beating out New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, and closing in on California Sen. Kamala Harris' fundraising numbers. Each candidate will only go as far in the race as their donation dollars will stretch.

""Many working Americans do not feel like Democrats are speaking to them,"" Yang told Fox News at a campaign stop in Nashua, N.H. ""Just the fact that I'm focused on some of the economic issues that they're seeing in their communities, makes them at least receptive.""

With Former Vice President Joe Biden still leading in a handful of polls, voters like Russell Peterson, a lifelong conservative and Trump voter, converted into a 'Yang gang' devotee, think the Democrats could see a repeat of 2016.

""If the DNC was smart they would wise up,"" said Peterson, who is from North Carolina. ""There's nobody talking like Andrew Yang is talking.""

WITH HELP OF ‘YANG GANG,’ ANDREW YANG ELBOWS HIS WAY TO DEM DEBATE STAGE

Peterson, his wife Elasa, and his toddler Zephaniah have been driving around in the country following Yang and vlogging the experience on his Youtube channel. He said he represents the forgotten ""broke folk vote,"" arguing that Yang is the first candidate to propose solutions to rampant automation.

""It makes sense to me that it's not immigrants, it's automation that's taking the jobs in America,"" Peterson said after a Yang rally in Cambridge, Mass. ""You walk into a Walmart, and where there used to be 20 registers, now you have one person managing all these self-checkouts.""

But while Yang has been able to enthuse people who show up at his rallies, he still has a long way to go to the top of the Democratic ticket. A St. Anselm College poll released this week has Yang scraping up just 2 percent of likely New Hampshire primary voters.

Southern New Hampshire political science professor Dean Spiliotes said that with his small but loyal base, Yang is the type of candidate that will stay in the race to the end.

""There is a tendency to write him off as a little bit of a curiosity,"" Spiliotes said. ""But I do think it's instructive for other candidates to stop and think what is it about his message that is appealing to this group of voters who might not typically vote Democratic.""

Another right-leaning New Hampshire voter, Chester Deorocki II, likes his message around automation – he just isn't sure $1,000-a-month promise is a smart move.

""He's got to come around to my generation,"" said Deorocki, 65, who manages a trucking company. ""He's got to blend his ideas. They can't be all one-sided. [...] Giveaways weren't in my generation.""

Among the other Democrats in the field, Deorocki said the constant Trump-bashing could end up backfiring.

""I think they got to stop bashing Trump and telling me what they want to do,"" Deorocki said. ""Because otherwise, they'll help to elect him."""

Democratic presidential candidates continue to push court-packing proposals. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., recently filed a friend-of-the-court brief in a case containing the ominous words: “Perhaps the court can heal itself before the public demands it be ‘restructured in order to reduce the influence of politics.’” And many on the left continue to demand the impeachment of Justice Brett Kavanaugh nearly a year after his confirmation.

So the question is: How will the high court respond this term to the barrage of intimidation tactics?

INDIANA AG CURTIS HILL: FETAL REMAINS CASE RAISES UNAVOIDABLE QUESTIONS ABOUT LIFE'S SANCTITY

To be sure, the stakes continue to be high. This term the court will be considering a host of critical legal questions, some of which are the subject of widespread national interest.

Among the first up are three Title VII cases, which will be argued on Oct. 8: Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia; Altitude Express Inc. v. Zarda; and R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The court will consider whether the prohibition against employment discrimination “because of ... sex” in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 includes discrimination based on one’s sexual orientation or status as transgender.

After President Barack Obama’s Equal Employment Opportunity Commission decided to reinterpret the 50-year-old statute and expand its reach to include discrimination not based on a binary conception of gender, some courts of appeals followed along. But as Justice Antonin Scalia once wrote for the court, “Congress ... does not ... hide elephants in mouseholes.” This case will be a bellwether as to the court’s commitment to adhering to what was clearly the longstanding meaning of a landmark statute in the face of intense media pressure.

Another case attracting national media attention is New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. City of New York — the most significant Second Amendment case since District of Columbia v. Heller in 2008. While Heller affirmed that the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to possess firearms, the court will now consider whether it protects an individual’s right to carry a firearm beyond one’s home.

As the Supreme Court begins its new term, it faces unprecedented political pressure and threats to its independence.

Religious liberty is also on the docket in Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue. Last year, the Montana Supreme Court held that legislation which gave residents up to a $150 tax credit for contributions to a scholarship program violated the state’s “Blaine Amendment”—a state constitutional provision enacted in Montana and other states during the 19th century to prevent the federal government from funding Catholic schools.

Thirty-seven states still have Blaine Amendments, but their constitutionality is in doubt after the court held in Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer that the exclusion of churches from an otherwise neutral and secular aid program violates the First Amendment. (Linda Greenhouse, the New York Times Supreme Court reporter, has already launched her Espinoza campaign with a column last month entitled, “Religious Crusaders at the Supreme Court’s Gates.”)

Finally, the court will consider an important separation of powers case involving the Trump administration’s decision to wind down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. McAleenan v. Vidal; Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California; and Trump v. NAACP have been consolidated and will heard together on Nov. 12.

After Congress failed to pass comprehensive immigration reform, Obama implemented the DACA program through executive action. In 2017, the Trump administration reversed the policy— again by executive action — after concluding that the policy was unlawful. (Recall that even Obama initially raised concerns about his administration going around Congress, saying in 2013: “I’m not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed, and Congress right now has not changed what I consider to be a broken immigration system.”)

The DACA case raises fundamental questions about our nation’s constitutional structure on two fronts: First, can the executive branch usurp Congress’ power to make laws when Congress doesn’t act? Second, when the Trump administration decided that it had an obligation to enforce our immigration laws, could federal courts prevent it from doing so? These are some of the important issues the Court will consider when it hears the DACA case.

As the Supreme Court begins its term, anticipate the pressure to ramp up even more. We should expect to hear suggestions that the court is “illegitimate” if it doesn’t succumb to coordinated left-wing PR campaigns, more calls for court packing, and perhaps even more attacks against Kavanaugh.

And as the term presses on, we will see how the court responds to this unprecedented assault on its independence.

The New York Times called it another example of ""the president using high-level diplomacy to advance his personal political interests.""

No, it's not. The president's critics are conflating two different things: the investigation by Trump's private lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, into Hunter Biden's business dealings, and the official inquiry by U.S. Attorney John Durham into the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.

The former is opposition research activity; the latter is a criminal justice matter.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with asking foreign heads of state or intelligence officials to cooperate with an official Justice Department investigation. As George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley explains: ""It is not uncommon for an attorney general, or even a president, to ask foreign leaders to assist with ongoing investigations. Such calls can shortcut bureaucratic red tape, particularly if the evidence is held, as in this case, by national security or justice officials.""

PETER SCHWEIZER: THE BOTTOM LINE IS JOE BIDEN HIS SON'S UKRAINE DEALINGS MUST BE INVESTIGATED

Americans support the Durham probe. For two years, they were told by Trump's opponents that the president was ""working on behalf of the Russians"" and had committed ""treasonous"" acts that were of ""a size and scope probably beyond Watergate.""

Those were serious accusations, and Americans took them seriously. They waited for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to tell them whether the president had indeed betrayed the country.

Then Mueller issued his report, and they found out that none of it was true. They understandably wanted answers.

How did it come to pass that our government was paralyzed for two years and spent tens of millions of their tax dollars, chasing a Trump-Russia collusion conspiracy theory?

A Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll following the Mueller report's public release found that 53 percent of Americans said that ""bias against President Trump in the FBI played a role in launching investigations against him,"" and 62 percent supported appointing a special counsel to investigate the investigation of Trump.

Instead of a special counsel, Barr appointed Durham, a career prosecutor, to lead the investigation that Americans demanded. Durham is a man of unimpeachable character who was appointed by Obama administration Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate the CIA's terrorist interrogation program.

At the conclusion of that probe, which ended without any criminal charges, Holder praised Durham for working ""tirelessly to conduct an extraordinarily thorough and complete"" investigation.

Now Barr has asked Durham to bring the same tireless professionalism to his investigation into the origins of the Mueller probe. But suddenly, all those who were so eager to find out what happened in 2016 when they thought Mueller would reveal that Trump conspired with the Russians have lost interest.

The same people who were outraged at Trump's efforts to discredit the Mueller probe are now doing the exact same thing to the Durham probe. Back then, Democrats insisted Trump stop criticizing the investigation and ""let Mueller follow the facts wherever they lead."" Now they need to heed their own advice: Stop criticizing the investigation.

Let Durham follow the facts wherever they lead. If there was no wrongdoing, then there is nothing to worry about.

To be sure, Trump bears some responsibility for helping Democrats lump together Durham's official investigation with Giuliani's partisan activities by mentioning them both on the call with Ukraine's president.

There should be a firewall between the two inquiries. Instead, Trump and Giuliani have blurred those lines.

But keep in mind, it was Democrats who told us there is nothing wrong or illegal with a presidential candidate hiring a private lawyer to conduct opposition research in a foreign country on their political opponents. After it emerged that the Clinton campaign and the DNC had paid Christopher Steele to dig up dirt in Russia on Trump, the Democrats' defense was: That's just opposition research. Everyone does it.

The biggest problem with the Steele dossier was not that Democrats paid for opposition research, but that the FBI might have used it as the basis for spying on the Trump campaign – which is part of what Durham is investigating.

Durham is no partisan actor. Despite political pressure, he cleared the CIA of wrongdoing during the Obama administration. Like Mueller, he will follow the facts wherever they lead. Maybe that is why so many Democrats are up in arms.

Trump to send Pelosi a letter 'daring' her to hold impeachment inquiry vote

The White House will send House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., a letter on Friday ""daring"" her to hold a vote on Democrats' impeachment inquiry into President Trump, Fox News has confirmed. The letter will say the White House won't comply with the Democrats' investigation because Pelosi hasn't codified the probe with a formal vote on the House floor. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., sent a similar letter to Pelosi on Thursday, taking issue with reports that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., was limiting Republicans' ability to ask questions during Thursday’s testimony by former U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, who resigned last week. Pelosi shot back at McCarthy, saying that ""existing rules of the House provide House committees with full authority to conduct investigations for all matters under their jurisdiction."" Speaking to ABC's “Good Morning America” Thursday, Pelosi defended Schiff, who was criticized for reading a ""parody"" of President Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Congress, stating “He did not make it up.""

Adam Schiff-Ukraine connection comes under scrutiny

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who has played a leading role in investigating the Trump-Ukraine scandal, is facing questions about his own connection to a Soviet-born businessman who has raised money for his campaign and whose company has received lucrative defense contracts from Ukraine's government. That man is Igor Pasternak, founder and CEO of Worldwide Aeros Corp., which makes blimps for military and commercial customers, including the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense. In 2013, Pasternak hosted a fundraiser in Washington for Schiff, who later came to embrace a strong stance in support of the U.S. sending military aid to Ukraine during its conflict with Russia.

Documents heighten scrutiny on Biden-Ukraine dealings, indicate Hunter Biden may have made ‘millions’

A batch of newly released documents, including court filings as well as notes from interviews conducted by Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, raised more questions about how much money former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter made while serving on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas firm at the center of the controversy, with one estimate putting the figure in the ""millions."" Among the documents, as Fox News reported Wednesday, are notes from an interview Trump attorney Giuliani conducted with fired Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin earlier this year, in which he claimed he was told by former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey R. Pyatt to back off an investigation involving that firm, Burisma Holdings, and its founder. According to interview notes, Shokin claimed Pyatt -- currently the ambassador to Greece -- told him to handle that investigation “with white gloves.” Shokin said his “investigations stopped out of fear of the United States.” Click here for more on this story.

In other developments in the formal Trump impeachment inquiry: Republican lawmakers who were present at ex-Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker’s closed-door marathon interview before three House committees on Thursday seemed confident it disproved any allegations of a ""quid pro quo"" in the impeachment inquiry of President Trump, as sources told Fox News that Volker was worried about the reliability of the Ukrainian prosecutor informing Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. Volker did not think Victor Shokin, the prosecutor investigating Ukrainian firm Burisma -- on which Hunter Biden held a board seat -- was reliable when he told Giuliani that he was told to back off of the investigation at then-Vice President Joe Biden's behest, which is why he worried what Giuliani might try to do with Shokin's claims, according to sources familiar with the testimony. Text messages obtained by Fox News showed Volker and other U.S. officials battling internally over whether Trump was engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukraine as he pressed the country to look into the Biden family, reportedly using $400 million in military aid as leverage during a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to induce him to have officials investigate the Bidens.

Chinese woman caught at Mar-a-Lago with malware was apparently asked to target Clintons: docs

A Chinese businesswoman who was convicted of trespassing at President Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida earlier this year had been urged by her handler to target other famous figures including the Clintons and billionaire businessman Warren Buffett, court documents say. Yujing Zhang, 33, who is scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 22, was caught by Secret Service agents with troves of technology embedded with malware and thousands of dollars in cash after she claimed that she was at Trump's prestigious club to attend a “United Nations friendship event” that had apparently been canceled. Her bizarre behavior and backstory led to suspicions that she was a Chinese government spy, but she was not charged with espionage or related crimes.

Zhang apparently purchased a $20,000 travel package from Li Weitian, also known as Charles Lee, who advertised tickets on the Chinese social media site WeChat promising access to events across the U.S. to meet prominent political and business figures. Upon learning that the event at Mar-a-Lago had been canceled, Lee tried to convince Zhang to attend another event on Wall Street in New York City, text messages between the pair released by the South Florida court Thursday revealed. Bill and Hillary Clinton were scheduled to be there. Click here for more on this story.

Environmental protesters spray UK's Treasury building with fake blood, four arrested

British police arrested four members of the climate activist group Extinction Rebellion on Thursday after they used a fire hose to spray the U.K.’s Treasury building with hundreds of gallons of fake blood. The group said it carried out the protest because it wanted to raise awareness of the ""inconsistency between the U.K. government's insistence that the U.K. is a world leader in tackling climate breakdown while pouring vast sums of money into fossil exploration and carbon-intensive projects,” according to Sky News. Organizers said they sprayed 1,800 liters of red liquid colored with food dye at the Treasury building, yet most of it appeared to have ended up on the street and sidewalk, Sky News reports. At another point, the protesters lost control of the decommissioned fire engine’s hose, it added. Click here for more on this story.

The former vice president is ahead by 29 points, according to a Fox News Poll. That’s up from a 21-point lead in July.

Biden captures 41 percent support among Democratic primary voters (+6 points since July), Elizabeth Warren trails with 12 percent (+7), and Bernie Sanders gets 10 percent (-4).

The Sanders campaign announced Wednesday that he is off the trail indefinitely after undergoing a heart procedure. The poll was conducted Sunday through Wednesday evenings.

Kamala Harris receives 4 percent, down from 12 percent. Tom Steyer, who entered the race in July, also gets 4 percent. Cory Booker (3 percent) and Pete Buttigieg (2 percent) held steady. All others receive 1 percent or less.

South Carolina holds its Democratic primary February 29, 2020. It is the fourth state to vote in the nomination race and the first with a large African-American population.

The poll, released Sunday, shows Biden with large leads among blacks (+41 points), men (+31), and voters over age 45 (+38). Since July, his support has grown 9 points among blacks and 13 points among black men.

Warren is ahead among one group -- white voters with a college degree (+5 points), and comes close to Biden among white voters, trailing him by just 4 points.

Sanders is the top pick among voters under age 35, besting Biden by 9 points.

Hillary Clinton beat Sanders by 73-26 percent in the 2016 South Carolina primary.

When asked their second-choice candidate, Warren tops the list with 16 percent. When first and second-choice preferences are combined, it’s Biden at 52 percent, Warren at 28 and Sanders at 23 percent.

“Warren is a distant second even though she more than doubled her support since July -- and she would need to triple her support again to even get within striking distance of winning South Carolina,” says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican counterpart Daron Shaw. “But she is really in the delegate hunt here. The fact that she is the top second choice candidate puts her in a good position to gain momentum as the field narrows.”

Fifty-eight percent of South Carolina Democratic primary voters prioritize backing a candidate who can beat Donald Trump, up from 52 percent who felt that way in July. That’s twice the number saying supporting a candidate they like is more important (29 percent).

They also prefer a candidate who will build on former President Barack Obama’s legacy over one with a new and different approach (50-41 percent).

Biden dominates among those prioritizing beating Trump (+39 points) and those wanting to build on Obama’s legacy (+41). He has narrower advantages, although still commanding, among those wanting to back their favorite candidate (+15) and preferring a new approach (+16).

Some 83 percent of primary voters are dissatisfied with how things are going in the country today, and 78 percent favor impeaching Trump and removing him from office.

Conducted September 29-October 2, 2019 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 803 South Carolina Democratic primary voters who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

Joe Biden bests Trump by 9 points (48-39 percent) and has the only lead outside the poll’s margin of error. Bernie Sanders is up by 5 over Trump (45-40) and Elizabeth Warren has a 4-point edge (45-41). In each case, the remaining 13-14 percent of undecided/third-party voters is enough to shift the race either way.

Trump receives 41 percent support or less in each of the matchups -- well below the 47 percent he won the Badger State with in 2016. At the same time, none of the Democrats hit 50 percent.

The Democratic candidates mostly owe their advantage to women voters and those with a college degree. Trump does best among white men without a degree and white evangelical Christians.

“Wisconsin is a tough nut for Republicans and the president has an uphill climb,” says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. “He needs to reassure rural voters who are spooked by the tariffs while persuading suburban voters to buy into his low tax/pro-growth economic vision.”

Trump won rural voters by 27 points in 2016. They now back him over Biden by only 2 points.

By a 19-point margin Wisconsin voters think tariffs hurt rather than help the economy, and more oppose building a wall along the southern border by 10 points.

Those favoring the wall prefer Trump by 73 points, while those opposed go for Biden by 76.

Voters who say tariffs hurt the economy prefer Biden by a 61-point margin. Those who think tariffs help support Trump by 65.

Trump beat Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin by less than one percentage point, making him the first Republican to win the state since 1984. Ninety-two percent of Clinton voters back Biden, while 83 percent of Trump voters stick with him.

Currently, 44 percent of Badger State voters approve of the job Trump is doing and 54 percent disapprove.

Views are nearly identical on the direction of the country: 43 percent are satisfied with how things are going vs. 55 percent dissatisfied.

Almost half (48 percent) rate the economy as excellent or good, while slightly more (51 percent) say it is in only fair or poor shape.

Meanwhile, despite many finding Trump’s dealings with the president of Ukraine troubling (33 percent extremely and 12 percent very), a 54 percent majority says there is zero chance something about the situation would cause them to change their mind about Trump.

Forty-two percent want Trump impeached and removed from office, 4 percent say impeached, but not removed, and 45 percent oppose impeachment. More Republicans (90 percent) oppose impeachment than Democrats favor it (82 percent).

In the race for the Democratic nomination, Biden is the top choice with 28 percent support, followed by Warren at 22 percent, and Sanders at 17 percent.

Pete Buttigieg comes in at 7 percent, Kamala Harris 5 percent, and Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, and Andrew Yang get 2 percent apiece. All others receive 1 percent or less.

The Sanders campaign announced Wednesday that he is off the trail indefinitely after undergoing a heart procedure. The poll was conducted Sunday through Wednesday evenings.

More Sanders supporters strongly back him (75 percent), compared to Warren (61 percent) and Biden supporters (61 percent).

Biden’s strongest groups include moderates, white Catholics and voters without a college degree. Warren does best among college graduates and self-described liberals, and Sanders makes the top three largely because of voters under age 35.

More Warren supporters (64 percent) are extremely interested in the election than Sanders (60 percent) or Biden supporters (51 percent).

Democratic primary voters place far greater importance on beating Trump than voting for their preferred candidate (52-33 percent). They split, however, when it comes to supporting a candidate who will build on former President Obama’s legacy vs. one who will take a new and different approach (43-47 percent).

Biden is the top pick among those who want to build on Obama’s legacy and those who prioritize beating Trump.

Democratic primary voters favoring a new approach give roughly equal support to Biden, Warren and Sanders.

In the most recent debate, candidates tried to out promise each other with their spin on government-run health care. By a show of hands, almost all of the Democratic candidates embraced some form government-run health care, which would destroy the private insurance market that serves more than 67 percent of Americans. In January, Sen. Kamala Harris said, “Let’s eliminate all of that. Let’s move on.”

I'm a mom, two of my four children have a lifetime medical condition. I’ve watched how children like mine suffer in other countries with similar government-run health care schemes. And it terrifies me.

DRS. NICOLE AND PAUL SAPHIER: WHILE HEALTH CARE DEBATE RAGES, AN ASTONISHING 33% OF US AVOID SEEKING CARE

My children have cystic fibrosis, a hereditary life-shortening condition that impacts the lungs and digestive system. The disease makes it hard to process enough calories to survive and leads to life-threatening breathing issues. In the U.K. right now, the government-run National Health Service has delayed access to a drug my son has been on for more than two years. The drug, Orkambi, is one of the first of its kind, correcting the underlying cause of CF, not just treating the symptoms. Yet this spring, a 600 years' supply of the drug expired on shelves in Britain.

Why? Because the NHS refuses to negotiate in good faith with the manufacturer, Vertex, over the price it wants to charge. That means people with CF will continue to die waiting for a drug they know can help them.

A government-run system in which bureaucrats decide how much they will pay – if anything – and what should be covered will result in extreme health care shortages as doctors and services go away when what the government decides it will pay won’t cover actual costs.

Currently people with private insurance pay a little more than those on Medicare, allowing hospitals and doctors to stay afloat. Without private insurance, hospitals would lose $151 billion in annual revenue. No magic words from a president – “Presto, you’re covered!” – will keep the doors of a business open when costs exceed revenue.

And consider that increased wait times are a cause of death under government-run schemes. A Fraser Institute study titled ""The Effect of Wait Times on Mortality"" found that, between 1993 and 2009, up to 63,090 women died waiting for treatment in Canada. Considering that the population of the U.S. is about nine times greater than Canada, the death toll here would be greater.

With so many Democrats joining Sanders' “Medicare-for-all” bill, the coming breakdown in care is a clear and present danger for the ill, the elderly and the preborn.

A look at the government-run Veterans Administration further illustrates the problem. As USA Today reported “death rates, bed sores, ER wait times” are a problem at many facilities.

With so many Democrats joining Sen. Bernie Sanders' “Medicare-for-all” bill in full or in part, the coming breakdown in care is a clear and present danger for the ill and elderly and, in the current plans, the preborn.

The Democratic presidential field has been in lockstep on their health care machinations including full taxpayer funding of abortion. When she was still in the race, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said, “I don’t think there is room in our party for a Democratic candidate who does not support women’s full reproductive freedom.” That’s election code word for abortion in all nine months, for whatever reason and taxpayer funded.

Though polls show Americans do not agree with such extremism, that hasn't stopped Democratic candidates from going all in for Planned Parenthood and abortion.

Writing for Slate, William Saletan laid out the depth of opposition to taxpayer funding of abortion for pro-life and pro-choice Americans. “In every poll, a plurality of Americans opposes public funding of abortions. In every poll but one, that plurality is a majority,” he noted.

While money is no object in the current debate, it will be. The government accountants were astoundingly wrong in their assessments of the price tag for ObamaCare, which pushed many to go without care or to spend exorbitant amounts. After ObamaCare was passed, its “architect,” Jonathan Gruber, mocked “the stupidity of the American voter” for not perceiving how the law hid its true costs.

ObamaCare totaled $940 billion over a decade and covered nowhere near what ""Medicare-for-all"" would entail. Reasons reports that “organizations across the ideological spectrum have pegged Bernie Sanders' ... ""Medicare-for-all"" at around $32 trillion over 10 years.”

That kind of spending will lead to price controls as politicians and government bean counters take charge of medical decision making. It’s the kind of radical change that “Rules for Radicals” author Saul Alinsky could like. The mentor to the Clintons and Obamas advocated the tactic of pushing a substandard policy forward that would later be countered with what activists really want. “The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative,” he famously advised.

Isn’t happening now? ObamaCare was forced on Americans with full knowledge that a quasi-public and quasi-private system would not to work. Now, to fix what their party broke, Democrats are advocating for complete or near complete government control of health care.

A rational mind can look at the problems and call for innovation and compassion, but “Medicare-for-all” really means health care for some and rising costs for all. The most vulnerable will be sacrificed in the name of cost-cutting and in service to an agenda that devalues the vulnerable.

At the end of its last term, for example, the court upheld the Bladensburg WWI Memorial, setting aside precedent that has been hostile to religious freedom for decades.

On Oct. 7, the court will commence its 2019-2020 term, and it appears it will have ample opportunity to continue its recent trend of returning to the Constitution’s original text and meaning regarding religious liberty.

Whether one is a constitutional expert, a Supreme Court junkie, or merely a casual observer, all Americans should pay close attention to these important religious liberty cases. How the justices rule could indicate whether the court’s shift toward textualism is real or ephemeral.

TIM CHAPMAN: PROGRESSIVES' PLAN TO FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER SUPREME COURT WOULD MAKE IT A POLITICAL FOOTBALL

In a major case over religious discrimination, Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, the court will consider whether Montana violated the First Amendment by barring students who receive student aid from tax credit scholarship programs from using those funds to attend religious schools.

First Liberty Institute filed a “friend of the court” brief in this case, arguing that religious schools and organizations should be treated equally with non-religious organizations when seeking to partner with the government to provide services. As the court found in its 2017 Trinity Lutheran decision, the government may not exclude religious organizations from a generally available benefit “solely because of its religious character.”

In another major case — which is actually three cases — of the term, the court will decide whether the definition of “sex” in federal employment non-discrimination law includes sexual orientation and gender identity. Collectively these cases — R. G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes v. E.E.O.C., Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda, and Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia — will have enormous implications for ministries, faith-based organizations and business owners.

The vision of religious freedom imagined by our Founders and enshrined in our Constitution may soon be restored in America.

Many faith-based American businesses and organizations are looking forward to better guidance regarding balancing faith and potential obligations imposed by federal law. First Liberty Institute submitted a “friend of the court” brief in the Harris Funeral Homes case arguing that, whatever the court’s decision on the definition of “sex,” it must ensure ministries, faith-based organizations and business owners retain robust religious liberty protections.

A case the court has yet to decide to review arises out of Puerto Rico. Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Juan, Puerto Rico, et al. v. Yalí Acevedo Feliciano, et al. has flown under the proverbial radar, yet it has the potential to bolster what is known as the “church autonomy doctrine,” which ensures that religious institutions, schools and ministries retain their religious identities and autonomy. Several of the parties — First Liberty represents two Catholic schools in the case — urge the court to overturn a dangerous decision by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico that threatens to undo the long-standing structure and autonomy of Catholic churches and schools.

During the past few terms, the court has sent unmistakable signals that the days of government hostility against religion are waning.

In the case over the Bladensburg cross, the American Legion v. American Humanist Association, the court declared religious symbols, monuments and practices that are in keeping with the history and tradition of the country now enjoy the presumption of constitutionality — one of the biggest paradigm shifts in Establishment Clause jurisprudence in over 40 years.

Last term, the court also reminded state governments of their obligation to respect Americans’ religious speech and conscience rights. In Sweet Cakes by Melissa v. Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industry, the justices vacated and remanded an outrageous Oregon Court of Appeals decision upholding a financial penalty imposed by the state that drove the family-owned bakery out of business.

CLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM

And in Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, a case the court chose not to review (at this time), four of the justices raised the possibility that the Free Exercise Clause, rendered dormant by Employment Division v. Smith, may soon find new life.

If this term picks up where the last term left off, we may be well on our way to more religious freedom than many of us have known in our lifetime. The vision of religious freedom imagined by our Founders and enshrined in our Constitution may soon be restored in America.

Cole, 5-0 with a 1.07 ERA in six starts last month, set an Astros postseason record with 15 strikeouts in 7 2/3 scoreless innings to win his franchise-record 17th straight decision. The 15 strikeouts tied for third-most in a postseason game, the highest total since Roger Clemens had 15 in the 2000 AL Championship Series for the New York Yankees against Seattle.

Cole (1-0), who led the majors with 326 strikeouts in the regular season, extended his major league record with his 10th straight game with at least 10 Ks. The Rays were unable to string anything together off of him on a night he induced 33 swings and misses — the most since MLB started tracking the stat in 2008 — and threw a career-high 118 pitches.

Kevin Kiemaier doubled with two outs in the eighth and Cole was lifted after putting on Willy Adames with Cole's first walk. The right-hander received a standing ovation as he walked off the mound and waved to the crowd just before he reached the dugout. Roberto Osuna took over and struck out Yandy Díaz to end the inning before running into trouble in the ninth.

Austin Meadows and Tommy Pham hit consecutive singles and Ji-Man Choi walked to load the bases. The Rays cut the lead to 3-1 when Avisaíl Garcia grounded into a forceout that scored Meadows. Osuna walked Brandon Lowe, reloading the bases, and Astros manager AJ Hinch brought in Will Harris.

Travis d'Arnaud worked the count full, then struck out on a high cutter, and Kiermaier grounded to first baseman Yuli Gurriel, who flipped to Harris, who stepped on first for the save.

Cole's performance came after fellow ace and Cy Young Award contender Justin Verlander pitched seven scoreless innings to lead the Astros to a 6-2 win in the opener on Friday.

Game 3 of the best-of five series is Monday in Florida.

There were no outs in the fourth when Bregman, who hit a career-best 41 home runs in the regular season, homered off Blake Snell (0-10. All seven of Bregman's homers have come off All-Stars, including two against Chris Sale and one each vs. Trevor Bauer, Clayton Kershaw, Corey Kluber and Kenley Jansen.

YANKEES TAG TWINS IN ALDS GAME 2; GREGORIUS SMACKS GRAND SLAM

His shot gave the Astros a home run in 27 straight games, extending a franchise record.

After Lowe's error at second gifted Houston two runs in the opener, another error on helped in the seventh. Adames bobbled Gurriel's leadoff grounder to shortstop, then bounced the thorw to first. Carlos Correa doubled and Martín Maldonado blooped a run-scoring single to left.

Correa added a two-out RBI single off Nick Anderson in the eighth for a 3-0 lead.

Snell, the 2018 AL Cy Young Award winner, sat out from July 22-Sept. 17 after arthroscopic surgery to remove bone chips in his left elbow. He didn't get out of the third inning in any of his three September starts, but said he hoped to give the Rays five innings on Saturday. Instead he was lifted one batter after Bregman's homer, finishing with four hits and a strikeout in 3 1/3 innings.

Correa helped Cole out with a fantastic defensive play to start the game. Díaz led off with a grounder toward Correa, who grabbed the ball backhanded while on the run and spun around for the throw to Gurriel that just beat a sliding Díaz.

UP NEXT

Former Astro Charlie Morton, who got the win in the Rays wild-card victory, will start against Zack Greinke. Morton pitched for the Astros from 2017-18 and played a big role in their 2017 World Series title. He won Game 7 of AL Championship Series against the Yankees and Game 7 of the World Series at Dodger Stadium to give Houston its first championship.

Morton had a tough time in his last start against Houston when he gave up a season-high six runs in four innings, which tied his shortest start of season, in a 15-1 win by Astros on Aug. 27. Greinke, acquired from Arizona at the trade deadline, went 8-1 with a 3.02 ERA in 10 starts after the trade capped by a gem in his last start when he came two outs shy of his first no-hitter on Sept. 25 against Seattle."

Democratic presidential candidates continue to push court-packing proposals. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., recently filed a friend-of-the-court brief in a case containing the ominous words: “Perhaps the court can heal itself before the public demands it be ‘restructured in order to reduce the influence of politics.’” And many on the left continue to demand the impeachment of Justice Brett Kavanaugh nearly a year after his confirmation.

So the question is: How will the high court respond this term to the barrage of intimidation tactics?

INDIANA AG CURTIS HILL: FETAL REMAINS CASE RAISES UNAVOIDABLE QUESTIONS ABOUT LIFE'S SANCTITY

To be sure, the stakes continue to be high. This term the court will be considering a host of critical legal questions, some of which are the subject of widespread national interest.

Among the first up are three Title VII cases, which will be argued on Oct. 8: Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia; Altitude Express Inc. v. Zarda; and R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The court will consider whether the prohibition against employment discrimination “because of ... sex” in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 includes discrimination based on one’s sexual orientation or status as transgender.

After President Barack Obama’s Equal Employment Opportunity Commission decided to reinterpret the 50-year-old statute and expand its reach to include discrimination not based on a binary conception of gender, some courts of appeals followed along. But as Justice Antonin Scalia once wrote for the court, “Congress ... does not ... hide elephants in mouseholes.” This case will be a bellwether as to the court’s commitment to adhering to what was clearly the longstanding meaning of a landmark statute in the face of intense media pressure.

Another case attracting national media attention is New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. City of New York — the most significant Second Amendment case since District of Columbia v. Heller in 2008. While Heller affirmed that the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to possess firearms, the court will now consider whether it protects an individual’s right to carry a firearm beyond one’s home.

As the Supreme Court begins its new term, it faces unprecedented political pressure and threats to its independence.

Religious liberty is also on the docket in Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue. Last year, the Montana Supreme Court held that legislation which gave residents up to a $150 tax credit for contributions to a scholarship program violated the state’s “Blaine Amendment”—a state constitutional provision enacted in Montana and other states during the 19th century to prevent the federal government from funding Catholic schools.

Thirty-seven states still have Blaine Amendments, but their constitutionality is in doubt after the court held in Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer that the exclusion of churches from an otherwise neutral and secular aid program violates the First Amendment. (Linda Greenhouse, the New York Times Supreme Court reporter, has already launched her Espinoza campaign with a column last month entitled, “Religious Crusaders at the Supreme Court’s Gates.”)

Finally, the court will consider an important separation of powers case involving the Trump administration’s decision to wind down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. McAleenan v. Vidal; Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California; and Trump v. NAACP have been consolidated and will heard together on Nov. 12.

After Congress failed to pass comprehensive immigration reform, Obama implemented the DACA program through executive action. In 2017, the Trump administration reversed the policy— again by executive action — after concluding that the policy was unlawful. (Recall that even Obama initially raised concerns about his administration going around Congress, saying in 2013: “I’m not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed, and Congress right now has not changed what I consider to be a broken immigration system.”)

The DACA case raises fundamental questions about our nation’s constitutional structure on two fronts: First, can the executive branch usurp Congress’ power to make laws when Congress doesn’t act? Second, when the Trump administration decided that it had an obligation to enforce our immigration laws, could federal courts prevent it from doing so? These are some of the important issues the Court will consider when it hears the DACA case.

As the Supreme Court begins its term, anticipate the pressure to ramp up even more. We should expect to hear suggestions that the court is “illegitimate” if it doesn’t succumb to coordinated left-wing PR campaigns, more calls for court packing, and perhaps even more attacks against Kavanaugh.

And as the term presses on, we will see how the court responds to this unprecedented assault on its independence.

South Carolina holds its Democratic primary February 29, 2020. It is the fourth state to vote in the nomination race and the first with a large African-American population.

The poll, released Sunday, shows Biden with large leads among blacks (+41 points), men (+31), and voters over age 45 (+38). Since July, his support has grown 9 points among blacks and 13 points among black men.

Warren is ahead among one group -- white voters with a college degree (+5 points), and comes close to Biden among white voters, trailing him by just 4 points.

Sanders is the top pick among voters under age 35, besting Biden by 9 points.

Hillary Clinton beat Sanders by 73-26 percent in the 2016 South Carolina primary.

When asked their second-choice candidate, Warren tops the list with 16 percent. When first and second-choice preferences are combined, it’s Biden at 52 percent, Warren at 28 and Sanders at 23 percent.

“Warren is a distant second even though she more than doubled her support since July -- and she would need to triple her support again to even get within striking distance of winning South Carolina,” says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican counterpart Daron Shaw. “But she is really in the delegate hunt here. The fact that she is the top second choice candidate puts her in a good position to gain momentum as the field narrows.”

Fifty-eight percent of South Carolina Democratic primary voters prioritize backing a candidate who can beat Donald Trump, up from 52 percent who felt that way in July. That’s twice the number saying supporting a candidate they like is more important (29 percent).

They also prefer a candidate who will build on former President Barack Obama’s legacy over one with a new and different approach (50-41 percent).

Biden dominates among those prioritizing beating Trump (+39 points) and those wanting to build on Obama’s legacy (+41). He has narrower advantages, although still commanding, among those wanting to back their favorite candidate (+15) and preferring a new approach (+16).

Some 83 percent of primary voters are dissatisfied with how things are going in the country today, and 78 percent favor impeaching Trump and removing him from office.

Joe Biden bests Trump by 9 points (48-39 percent) and has the only lead outside the poll’s margin of error. Bernie Sanders is up by 5 over Trump (45-40) and Elizabeth Warren has a 4-point edge (45-41). In each case, the remaining 13-14 percent of undecided/third-party voters is enough to shift the race either way.

Trump receives 41 percent support or less in each of the matchups -- well below the 47 percent he won the Badger State with in 2016. At the same time, none of the Democrats hit 50 percent.

The Democratic candidates mostly owe their advantage to women voters and those with a college degree. Trump does best among white men without a degree and white evangelical Christians.

“Wisconsin is a tough nut for Republicans and the president has an uphill climb,” says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. “He needs to reassure rural voters who are spooked by the tariffs while persuading suburban voters to buy into his low tax/pro-growth economic vision.”

Trump won rural voters by 27 points in 2016. They now back him over Biden by only 2 points.

By a 19-point margin Wisconsin voters think tariffs hurt rather than help the economy, and more oppose building a wall along the southern border by 10 points.

Those favoring the wall prefer Trump by 73 points, while those opposed go for Biden by 76.

Voters who say tariffs hurt the economy prefer Biden by a 61-point margin. Those who think tariffs help support Trump by 65.

Trump beat Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin by less than one percentage point, making him the first Republican to win the state since 1984. Ninety-two percent of Clinton voters back Biden, while 83 percent of Trump voters stick with him.

Currently, 44 percent of Badger State voters approve of the job Trump is doing and 54 percent disapprove.

Views are nearly identical on the direction of the country: 43 percent are satisfied with how things are going vs. 55 percent dissatisfied.

Almost half (48 percent) rate the economy as excellent or good, while slightly more (51 percent) say it is in only fair or poor shape.

Meanwhile, despite many finding Trump’s dealings with the president of Ukraine troubling (33 percent extremely and 12 percent very), a 54 percent majority says there is zero chance something about the situation would cause them to change their mind about Trump.

Forty-two percent want Trump impeached and removed from office, 4 percent say impeached, but not removed, and 45 percent oppose impeachment. More Republicans (90 percent) oppose impeachment than Democrats favor it (82 percent).

In the race for the Democratic nomination, Biden is the top choice with 28 percent support, followed by Warren at 22 percent, and Sanders at 17 percent.

Pete Buttigieg comes in at 7 percent, Kamala Harris 5 percent, and Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, and Andrew Yang get 2 percent apiece. All others receive 1 percent or less.

The Sanders campaign announced Wednesday that he is off the trail indefinitely after undergoing a heart procedure. The poll was conducted Sunday through Wednesday evenings.

More Sanders supporters strongly back him (75 percent), compared to Warren (61 percent) and Biden supporters (61 percent).

Biden’s strongest groups include moderates, white Catholics and voters without a college degree. Warren does best among college graduates and self-described liberals, and Sanders makes the top three largely because of voters under age 35.

More Warren supporters (64 percent) are extremely interested in the election than Sanders (60 percent) or Biden supporters (51 percent).

Democratic primary voters place far greater importance on beating Trump than voting for their preferred candidate (52-33 percent). They split, however, when it comes to supporting a candidate who will build on former President Obama’s legacy vs. one who will take a new and different approach (43-47 percent).

Biden is the top pick among those who want to build on Obama’s legacy and those who prioritize beating Trump.

Democratic primary voters favoring a new approach give roughly equal support to Biden, Warren and Sanders.

As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I was on the frontline throughout the entire confirmation process and was one of Kavanaugh’s staunchest supporters.

It was surreal to see my Democratic colleagues abandon the basic tenants of due process, presuming Kavanaugh guilty until proven innocent.

Encouraged by their fanatical, left-wing base and a pliant media, no allegation was too far-fetched to embrace. They even sunk so low that they hyped up the egregiously false allegations made by the client of con-man lawyer Michael Avenatti. It was a disgrace.

Fortunately, their smear campaign failed. The truth prevailed and Kavanaugh was confirmed.

Fast forward to just a few weeks ago, when Democratic presidential candidates and mainstream media outlets pounced on a completely uncorroborated allegation against Kavanaugh published by The New York Times in the paper’s Opinion section.

The Democrats’ impeachment push is about overturning the results of the 2016 election, covering up their socialist and open borders policies, and destroying President Trump personally and politically to pave their path to victory in 2020.

Democrats like Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris rushed to call for Kavanaugh’s impeachment. However, the American people soon learned that the authors conveniently left out vital exculpatory facts, forcing the New York Times to issue an editor’s note correcting the story.

While September may have started with Democrats’ aiming their politics of personal destruction and calls for impeachment at Kavanaugh, it ended with them doing the same against President Trump.

We already know more about the facts of President Trump’s call with his Ukrainian counterpart than the so-called “whistleblower” did because we’ve seen the transcript, unlike the individual who filed the complaint. The transcript directly contradicts the Democratic narrative that the president engaged in a “quid pro quo.”

The latest impeachment push is already unfolding in a way that’s eerily similar to the Kavanaugh spectacle, including Democrats knowing about the allegations before they were made public -- giving them time to create their narrative in advance.

This week the public learned that Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and his staff were working with the so-called whistleblower and encouraged him or her to file the complaint.

It’s no surprise that Democrats have already deemed the facts as irrelevant because their end game is removing President Trump from power using any means necessary.

They're not even trying to hide what their motivation is with Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, recently declaring on national television that “I’m concerned if we don’t impeach this president, he will get re-elected.”

That’s exactly why Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for an impeachment inquiry before she even saw the transcript of the president’s call with the Ukrainian leader. And it’s why Schiff tried to deceive the American public by reading a completely fabricated transcript to make the president look bad.

Democrats, including those running against me in North Carolina, are taking a page out of their Kavanaugh playbook by pushing impeachment because it’s the only play they have left.

At the end of the day, Democrats know they can’t beat President Trump on the issues the American people care about.

They know they can’t beat President Trump by attacking his record of generating record economic growth, securing the border, appointing conservative judges, rebuilding our military, making major reforms to the VA and cutting taxes for hardworking Americans.

The only alternative Democrats are offering Americans is a radical liberal agenda that the American people refuse to buy.

They want to eliminate your employer-provided health insurance, increase the taxes on the money you worked hard for and even implement radical policies like the Green New Deal to prevent you from eating hamburgers and driving the cars you to want to drive.

In the most recent debate, candidates tried to out promise each other with their spin on government-run health care. By a show of hands, almost all of the Democratic candidates embraced some form government-run health care, which would destroy the private insurance market that serves more than 67 percent of Americans. In January, Sen. Kamala Harris said, “Let’s eliminate all of that. Let’s move on.”

I'm a mom, two of my four children have a lifetime medical condition. I’ve watched how children like mine suffer in other countries with similar government-run health care schemes. And it terrifies me.

DRS. NICOLE AND PAUL SAPHIER: WHILE HEALTH CARE DEBATE RAGES, AN ASTONISHING 33% OF US AVOID SEEKING CARE

My children have cystic fibrosis, a hereditary life-shortening condition that impacts the lungs and digestive system. The disease makes it hard to process enough calories to survive and leads to life-threatening breathing issues. In the U.K. right now, the government-run National Health Service has delayed access to a drug my son has been on for more than two years. The drug, Orkambi, is one of the first of its kind, correcting the underlying cause of CF, not just treating the symptoms. Yet this spring, a 600 years' supply of the drug expired on shelves in Britain.

Why? Because the NHS refuses to negotiate in good faith with the manufacturer, Vertex, over the price it wants to charge. That means people with CF will continue to die waiting for a drug they know can help them.

A government-run system in which bureaucrats decide how much they will pay – if anything – and what should be covered will result in extreme health care shortages as doctors and services go away when what the government decides it will pay won’t cover actual costs.

Currently people with private insurance pay a little more than those on Medicare, allowing hospitals and doctors to stay afloat. Without private insurance, hospitals would lose $151 billion in annual revenue. No magic words from a president – “Presto, you’re covered!” – will keep the doors of a business open when costs exceed revenue.

And consider that increased wait times are a cause of death under government-run schemes. A Fraser Institute study titled ""The Effect of Wait Times on Mortality"" found that, between 1993 and 2009, up to 63,090 women died waiting for treatment in Canada. Considering that the population of the U.S. is about nine times greater than Canada, the death toll here would be greater.

With so many Democrats joining Sanders' “Medicare-for-all” bill, the coming breakdown in care is a clear and present danger for the ill, the elderly and the preborn.

A look at the government-run Veterans Administration further illustrates the problem. As USA Today reported “death rates, bed sores, ER wait times” are a problem at many facilities.

With so many Democrats joining Sen. Bernie Sanders' “Medicare-for-all” bill in full or in part, the coming breakdown in care is a clear and present danger for the ill and elderly and, in the current plans, the preborn.

The Democratic presidential field has been in lockstep on their health care machinations including full taxpayer funding of abortion. When she was still in the race, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said, “I don’t think there is room in our party for a Democratic candidate who does not support women’s full reproductive freedom.” That’s election code word for abortion in all nine months, for whatever reason and taxpayer funded.

Though polls show Americans do not agree with such extremism, that hasn't stopped Democratic candidates from going all in for Planned Parenthood and abortion.

Writing for Slate, William Saletan laid out the depth of opposition to taxpayer funding of abortion for pro-life and pro-choice Americans. “In every poll, a plurality of Americans opposes public funding of abortions. In every poll but one, that plurality is a majority,” he noted.

While money is no object in the current debate, it will be. The government accountants were astoundingly wrong in their assessments of the price tag for ObamaCare, which pushed many to go without care or to spend exorbitant amounts. After ObamaCare was passed, its “architect,” Jonathan Gruber, mocked “the stupidity of the American voter” for not perceiving how the law hid its true costs.

ObamaCare totaled $940 billion over a decade and covered nowhere near what ""Medicare-for-all"" would entail. Reasons reports that “organizations across the ideological spectrum have pegged Bernie Sanders' ... ""Medicare-for-all"" at around $32 trillion over 10 years.”

That kind of spending will lead to price controls as politicians and government bean counters take charge of medical decision making. It’s the kind of radical change that “Rules for Radicals” author Saul Alinsky could like. The mentor to the Clintons and Obamas advocated the tactic of pushing a substandard policy forward that would later be countered with what activists really want. “The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative,” he famously advised.

Isn’t happening now? ObamaCare was forced on Americans with full knowledge that a quasi-public and quasi-private system would not to work. Now, to fix what their party broke, Democrats are advocating for complete or near complete government control of health care.

A rational mind can look at the problems and call for innovation and compassion, but “Medicare-for-all” really means health care for some and rising costs for all. The most vulnerable will be sacrificed in the name of cost-cutting and in service to an agenda that devalues the vulnerable.

Clint Walker, 27, is accused of fatally shooting a man during a November 2016 robbery gone awry. Several months ago, Walker was released on a $100,000 surety bond and ordered to wear the GPS monitor, provided by a company called Guarding Public Safety.

MAN'S 'HOW TO' VIDEO FOR REMOVING ANKLE MONITOR LEADS TO FELONY CHARGE, AUTHORITIES SAY

But Walker, according to KHOU, ""failed to pay the company his monthly monitoring fee"" that was reportedly a condition of his bond, and therefore the company removed the device — leaving authorities unable to track the murder suspect.

Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg said the company sent ""a representative to physically remove his ankle monitor"" on Sept. 19, and Walker wasn't re-arrested until Oct. 2, according to jail records, which meant he was not monitored for a nearly two-week period.

Ogg described the situation as a ""troubling loophole,"" and the Harris County Community Supervision & Corrections Department, which didn't respond to Fox News' request for comment, said the bizarre technicality had not led to any widespread issues — and placed blame in the Walker case on Guarding Public Safety.

“The vendor was immediately terminated because of serious violations of the memorandum of understanding,” Teresa May, department of director, told the news outlet, noting other defendants monitored by the company have been transferred elsewhere.

May said the company was supposed to gain permission from the department in the event they had to remove Walker's ankle monitor, but they allegedly never contacted the department about the issue.

Guarding Public Safety, which also did not immediately return Fox News' request for comment, told KTRK in a statement that the company ""sent several violations on Clint Walker to the Harris County Pretrial Supervision Dept. including his failure to charge his device as instructed resulting in no location and no communication.""

""His device went dead several times and we had no location and no communication with this defendant,"" the statement read. ""Immediate notification was sent upon removal of his device."""

BIDEN STILL SLIDIN’

IBD: “Elizabeth Warren has taken a narrow lead over Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, the October IBD/TIPP Poll found. Both candidates continue to lead in a head-to-head matchup against President Trump, though Biden had a more comfortable lead, outside the margin of error. Elizabeth Warren had the support of 27%, with Joe Biden backed by 26% and Bernie Sanders a distant third at 10%. Support for South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg climbed to 7% from 5%. No other candidate polled more than 3%. The October IBD/TIPP Poll showed continued momentum for Warren. Last month's poll had shown support for Warren jumping to 24% from 17%. Meanwhile, Biden's support saw further erosion, after slipping to 28% in September from 30% in August. Sanders, whose nomination prospects could suffer after his heart attack last week, saw support fall after registering 12% the prior two months.”



Biden expands lead in South Carolina - Fox News: “Joe Biden increases his lead in the Palmetto State, as a growing number of South Carolina Democratic primary voters want a candidate who can defeat President Trump. The former vice president is ahead by 29 points, according to a Fox News Poll. That’s up from a 21-point lead in July. Biden captures 41 percent support among Democratic primary voters (+6 points since July), Elizabeth Warren trails with 12 percent (+7), and Bernie Sanders gets 10 percent (-4). … Kamala Harris receives 4 percent, down from 12 percent. Tom Steyer, who entered the race in July, also gets 4 percent. Cory Booker (3 percent) and Pete Buttigieg (2 percent) held steady. All others receive 1 percent or less. South Carolina holds its Democratic primary February 29, 2020. … Biden [has] large leads among blacks (+41 points), men (+31), and voters over age 45 (+38).”



Trump trails Dems in Wisconsin - Fox News: “Wisconsin voters are unhappy with how things are going in the country, oppose the border wall, think tariffs hurt the economy, and disapprove of the job President Trump is doing. … Joe Biden bests Trump by 9 points (48-39 percent) and has the only lead outside the poll’s margin of error. Bernie Sanders is up by 5 over Trump (45-40) and Elizabeth Warren has a 4-point edge (45-41). In each case, the remaining 13-14 percent of undecided/third-party voters is enough to shift the race either way. Trump receives 41 percent support or less in each of the matchups -- well below the 47 percent he won the Badger State with in 2016. At the same time, none of the Democrats hit 50 percent.”



Have you tried turning your campaign off, then turning it back on? - NYT: “At campaign events this past week, Ms. [Kamala] Harris debuted a fresh stump speech focused on the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump, an issue in which her campaign believes she is uniquely suited to lead as a former prosecutor. She began each of the rallies, titled ‘Dude Gotta Go,’ with a lengthy discussion of the president’s purported crimes, and concluded by talking directly about the idea of ‘electability,’ which she described as the ‘elephant’ in the 2020 race, and the fear that the country was not ready to elect a black woman as president. … In strategic terms, her campaign’s choice to pivot to Iowa is a concession that its initial theory of the presidential race was at least partially incorrect. From the start, her longtime advisers mapped out a national strategy that highlighted primaries with more diverse electorates … while conserving resources often used in early states for television advertisements in later ones.”



STEYER STICKING AROUND

Fox Business: “The wealthiest Democrat in the 2020 race, billionaire Tom Steyer, announced Sunday that he qualified for the November debate. Steyer is worth a whopping $1.6 billion. Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney is the runner-up with a net worth of roughly $200 million. ‘Tom is surging because he’s not part of the establishment and his message of ending the corporate takeover of our government is resonating,’ his campaign manager Heather Hargreaves said in a statement. ‘Tom is excited to continue getting out there and meeting with voters all across the country, hearing their stories, and connecting with them personally, and we are thrilled to see him on stage sharing his vision with the full country at the DNC debate in Ohio on October 15th and in November.’”



Sanders takes aim at DNC corporate donors in new plan - Politico: “Bernie Sanders, a longtime critic of the nation’s campaign finance system, is releasing a plan Monday aimed at ending the influence of corporate cash in politics, including at the 2020 Democratic National Convention. The Vermont senator pledges to put a stop to all corporate PAC contributions to the convention if he wins the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination. AT&T, Facebook, Independence Blue Cross and other companies each gave seven-figure donations to the event’s host committee in 2016. … His proposal also calls for a lifetime lobbying ban on Democratic National Committee chairs and co-chairs, as well as a prohibition on them working for companies that hold federal contracts or are trying to obtain government approval for mergers or other projects.”



Dem race becomes one of uncertainty - WaPo: “Interviews with more than two dozen Democratic leaders, top strategists and former elected officials revealed that most are still holding out judgment about how — or how much — the events will shift the race. But they point to several worrying factors [about Biden, Warren and Sanders]… Others expressed skepticism that any Democrat would be able to compete against Trump’s unmatched ability to shift the public’s focus. … The shifting dynamic has already altered campaign strategies, as some trailing candidates focus on early-voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire… But for the front-running trio, the events of the last two weeks have served as a public test of how they would handle crises in a general election.”

TIME OUT: THE COMEBACK OF ‘THE NATION’S RIVER’

Smithsonian: “When George Washington chose to build his Mount Vernon estate along the Potomac River, he declared the then-pristine body of water ‘the nation’s river.’ At the time, even dolphins were a common sight. In fact, as Karin Bruillard at the Washington Post reports, the porpoises were seen as far upriver as Alexandria, Virginia, in the 1840s. But by the 1960s, the river that flows through the nation’s capital had lost its luster. … Now, after almost 50 years of pollution control, clean-up and restoration efforts, researchers have catalogued well over 1,000 bottlenose dolphins living, mating, and even giving birth in the lower reaches of the river. … Over the past four years, researchers from Georgetown University’s Potomac-Chesapeake Dolphin Project have been cataloguing dolphins in the lake-like area where the Potomac joins the Chesapeake Bay, reports Bruillard for the Post. … But the most exciting development came in August, when researchers witnessed a dolphin giving birth in the river.”

PELOSI RIDES TO RESCUE

WaPo: “A Democratic group with close ties to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is set to spend more than $1 million on ads set to begin airing this week aimed at bolstering a handful of vulnerable House Democrats as the impeachment probe unfolds. The ads from House Majority Forward, examples of which were reviewed by The Washington Post, do not mention the word ‘impeachment.’ Instead, they focus solely on the accomplishments of the 11 individual lawmakers targeted in the campaign. … The campaign represents the first tranche of television ads to be aired by a group with close ties to the party establishment. House Majority Forward is an affiliate of House Majority PAC, the largest Democratic super PAC focused solely on House races. The focus on non-impeachment issues is further evidence that Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other Democratic leaders are aiming to sell a ‘walk and chew gum’ image for the party — that they can investigate and possibly impeach President Trump while also working to make progress on jobs, health care and other concerns.”



Team Trump sends Pence impeachment Dems districts - Politico: “The White House wants to make vulnerable House Democrats pay for impeachment. Starting this week, Vice President Mike Pence will embark on a national tour of congressional districts represented by Democrats who’ve come out in support of the inquiry. … Each of the districts on Pence's itinerary were won by Trump in 2016, making them potent targets for Republicans. The vice president will travel Wednesday to the southwest Iowa district of Rep. Cindy Axne, and Thursday he’s slated to visit the suburban Twin Cities district of another freshman Democrat, Minnesota Rep. Angie Craig. The vice president is then scheduled to barnstorm an array of battleground districts, including those held by Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Virginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger.”



McConnell uses campaign ad to flex impeachment muscle - Louisville Courier Journal: “Earlier [last] week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said his chamber would have ‘no choice’ but to hold a trial on whether to remove President Donald Trump from office if the House votes to impeach. But in a new campaign ad on Facebook, the Kentucky Republican makes clear that any impeachment attempt will fail as long as he remains in charge of the Senate. ‘Nancy Pelosi's in the clutches of a left wing mob. They finally convinced her to impeach the president,’ McConnell says directly to the camera in a 17-second video. ‘All of you know your Constitution. The way that impeachment stops is a Senate majority with me as majority leader.’ … The McConnell campaign, according to Facebook's ‘Ad Library,’ started running the digital ad last week…”



SUPCO BACK IN SESSION

Fox News: “Now, as the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to launch its new term Monday, a 5-4 conservative majority could be poised to provide the White House with significant legal and political victories -- or setbacks. Such are the unusual dynamics now percolating from the nation's highest court. The justices' election-year agenda includes cases dealing with Trump's executive power over immigration, along with LGBTQ workplace discrimination, gun rights and abortion regulations. All are teed up to be argued this term, with religious liberty and health-care appeals good bets to be added to the docket. All will likely be decided in a presidential election year. ‘The court will be an issue in 2020 but that's perfectly normal. It was a huge issue in 2016, it helped get President Trump elected,’ said Paul Smith, a Georgetown University law professor who has argued 21 cases before the high court. ‘And it will be so again, precisely because it's become such an important part of our system.’”

AUDIBLE: HABITUAL LINE STEPPER

“We say, ‘Don’t cross this line.’ Okay, you crossed it. So, ‘Don’t cross this line.’ We’re finally at a point where patience is exhausted, reason is exhausted and, quite frankly, the voters are exhausted.” – Tom Rath, a longtime member of the GOP in New Hampshire, explaining the crossroads Republicans are at with the president right now, per the WaPo.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“A week ago (give or take a few days), you ran a lead article to the effect that over the months ahead you were going to soberly and impartially report the facts at every turn in the very ‘wine-dy’ (meaning curve-y) road to the 2020 election. Your lead article [Friday] entitled ‘Trump Offers No Off Ramps to Republicans’ strikes me (after the second reading) as anything but consistent with what I understood to be your sober and impartial mission. It seems that your article is strongly slanted against Trump from beginning to end. If I am wrong, can you explain what your ‘Off Ramp’ article would have to say in order to fail your criteria of impartiality, none-emotional, none-judgmental reporting and analysis? I'm genuinely baffled.” – Eric Hutchins, Santa Barbara, Calif.



[Ed. note: I gather from your sentiments, Mr. Hutchins that you are a political supporter of the president. And I understand that for the president’s supporters these are trying, frustrating, exhausting days. If one agrees with the president that his conduct relating to Joe Biden and Ukraine has been “perfect” then what’s happening now must seem like madness. But to most observers, the president failed in his duty by entwining domestic politics with foreign policy. It’s proving to be quite damaging. Now, I don’t care who believes what. You may think Trump hung the moon or you may think Trump is Old Scratch himself. Not my problem. What I promised you on Sept. 26 was that we would not obsess over minutiae from the day to day battle between the two sides over impeachment: “You have plenty of other options for getting the latest details on what this unnamed source said or what that hearing may or may not have revealed. We’re going to stay focused on the political repercussions because that’s our job.” I’m not sure how I’m supposed to do that and not talk about what’s happening in the news. The president is getting absolutely smashed over his conduct vis-a-vis Biden. Support for impeachment has jumped hugely. Republicans are in a defensive crouch and every day one of the president’s team seems to make another blunder that makes the situation even worse. It’s a political catastrophe. It may end up actually working out for Trump and the GOP. Democrats are making plenty of errors of their own and this may all blow up in their faces. And if it does, we’ll certainly be talking about it. But right now, the president and his core supporters don’t seem to understand what a pickle he’s put them in — and the huge problems he’s creating for the GOP. Trump had just gotten out of the woods on the Mueller probe and the very next day needlessly put himself in this jackpot. The position that the president has taken — the “perfect” doctrine — does not reflect the political reality for many members of his party. They need to be able to say that they disapprove, like Democrats did a generation ago, but think America should now “move on” from a divisive distraction. It’s none of my business who wins this fight. That’s up to you. But if you’re interested in my abilities as a forecaster and analyst, it will mean hearing things that you don’t always agree with and certainly discussing matters that are bad news for your team. But it will also mean that I will tell it to you straight. That I will be fair-minded. That I will listen and admit when I’m wrong. That I will give you my thoughts without fear or favor. That we will always do our best.]



“Chris, I’ll keep this short and sweet: 1. Where can I find the law that prohibits a candidate from getting ‘dirt’ on his political opponent from a foreign government? 2. Why is it against the law? Don’t I as a constituent have the right to know if a candidate has broken the law regardless of where the act was committed? 3. If you can never investigate a political opponent for deeds done in a foreign country, what’s to keep someone from simply committing all of their illegal acts in a foreign country?” – Meredith Shoemaker, Sugar Land, Texas



[Ed. note: The president mustn’t do such things himself. And he especially mustn’t do them when he would be the direct beneficiary. We have a Justice Department and a Department of State. We have federal police at the FBI. We have all manner of means by which to combat corruption here and abroad. But when it’s about his political opponents, the president must do his best to stay out of it. Doing otherwise diminishes the confidence Americans have in our legal system to provide dispassionate justice. Presidents of both parties have failed this test in the past so we know how real the temptation is. But it’s not something Americans want to become normal. That’s how governments operate in places like Turkey, Russia and China: People in power use that power to stifle their rivals. I know Trump believes the system is rigged against him, but he is still the president and he must find some way to better honor that high vocation or voters will surely throw him out next year.]



“Unforced errors are the worst kind of errors, in sports and everywhere else. I am reminded of Watergate back when President Richard Nixon was running for re-election. No benefit or advantage was gained from the break-in, and Nixon won re-election in a landslide anyway. Here now President Trump is trying to compromise Joe Biden as a candidate with actions that are expected to have substantial negative consequences for the incumbent – and for what? The race for the Democratic nominee is far from over, but Biden seems to be suffering from the ‘Curse of the Early Frontrunner’ and slipping in the polls for many other reasons than those that are being brought to light from any revelations out of The Ukraine. Hindsight, but also no small amount of foresight and experience, suggests that it would have been (and is) best to ‘keep your powder dry’ for whomever is the actual nominee and not waste time and resources going after those who will not be running against you. If Joe Biden is not the eventual Democratic nominee, this may well be one of those unforced errors that may even approach the impact and magnitude of the Watergate disaster. So much for learning from our past mistakes.” – Kent Haldorson, Beaverton, Ore.

SO FRESH YOU CAN TASTE THE SQUEAK

Fox News: “And we thought mustard ice cream was a stretch. An ice cream vendor in Ecuador is reportedly seeing demand for her new — and arguably strangest — offering. It's made using the flesh of guinea pigs. Guinea pig meat, known as ‘cuy’ in Ecuador, is typically eaten as a savory dish there and in other South American countries, like Peru and Colombia, where it's often grilled and served whole, per NPR. But María del Carmen Pilapaña, who runs a small stall near the capital of Quito, has stumbled upon a completely new preparation — and it is a hit, she tells The Associated Press. … Pilapaña makes the ice cream by cooking down the guinea pig’s meat and making a pate of sorts before blending it with milk or cream, freezing it, and serving it just like she does with her other flavors.”

“As I became convinced of the practical and theoretical defects of the social-democratic tendencies of my youth, it was but a short distance to a philosophy of restrained, free-market governance that gave more space and place to the individual and to the civil society that stands between citizen and state.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the National Review on Oct. 25, 2013.

At the end of its last term, for example, the court upheld the Bladensburg WWI Memorial, setting aside precedent that has been hostile to religious freedom for decades.

On Oct. 7, the court will commence its 2019-2020 term, and it appears it will have ample opportunity to continue its recent trend of returning to the Constitution’s original text and meaning regarding religious liberty.

Whether one is a constitutional expert, a Supreme Court junkie, or merely a casual observer, all Americans should pay close attention to these important religious liberty cases. How the justices rule could indicate whether the court’s shift toward textualism is real or ephemeral.

TIM CHAPMAN: PROGRESSIVES' PLAN TO FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER SUPREME COURT WOULD MAKE IT A POLITICAL FOOTBALL

In a major case over religious discrimination, Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, the court will consider whether Montana violated the First Amendment by barring students who receive student aid from tax credit scholarship programs from using those funds to attend religious schools.

First Liberty Institute filed a “friend of the court” brief in this case, arguing that religious schools and organizations should be treated equally with non-religious organizations when seeking to partner with the government to provide services. As the court found in its 2017 Trinity Lutheran decision, the government may not exclude religious organizations from a generally available benefit “solely because of its religious character.”

In another major case — which is actually three cases — of the term, the court will decide whether the definition of “sex” in federal employment non-discrimination law includes sexual orientation and gender identity. Collectively these cases — R. G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes v. E.E.O.C., Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda, and Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia — will have enormous implications for ministries, faith-based organizations and business owners.

The vision of religious freedom imagined by our Founders and enshrined in our Constitution may soon be restored in America.

Many faith-based American businesses and organizations are looking forward to better guidance regarding balancing faith and potential obligations imposed by federal law. First Liberty Institute submitted a “friend of the court” brief in the Harris Funeral Homes case arguing that, whatever the court’s decision on the definition of “sex,” it must ensure ministries, faith-based organizations and business owners retain robust religious liberty protections.

A case the court has yet to decide to review arises out of Puerto Rico. Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Juan, Puerto Rico, et al. v. Yalí Acevedo Feliciano, et al. has flown under the proverbial radar, yet it has the potential to bolster what is known as the “church autonomy doctrine,” which ensures that religious institutions, schools and ministries retain their religious identities and autonomy. Several of the parties — First Liberty represents two Catholic schools in the case — urge the court to overturn a dangerous decision by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico that threatens to undo the long-standing structure and autonomy of Catholic churches and schools.

During the past few terms, the court has sent unmistakable signals that the days of government hostility against religion are waning.

In the case over the Bladensburg cross, the American Legion v. American Humanist Association, the court declared religious symbols, monuments and practices that are in keeping with the history and tradition of the country now enjoy the presumption of constitutionality — one of the biggest paradigm shifts in Establishment Clause jurisprudence in over 40 years.

Last term, the court also reminded state governments of their obligation to respect Americans’ religious speech and conscience rights. In Sweet Cakes by Melissa v. Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industry, the justices vacated and remanded an outrageous Oregon Court of Appeals decision upholding a financial penalty imposed by the state that drove the family-owned bakery out of business.

And in Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, a case the court chose not to review (at this time), four of the justices raised the possibility that the Free Exercise Clause, rendered dormant by Employment Division v. Smith, may soon find new life.

If this term picks up where the last term left off, we may be well on our way to more religious freedom than many of us have known in our lifetime. The vision of religious freedom imagined by our Founders and enshrined in our Constitution may soon be restored in America.

Cole, 5-0 with a 1.07 ERA in six starts last month, set an Astros postseason record with 15 strikeouts in 7 2/3 scoreless innings to win his franchise-record 17th straight decision. The 15 strikeouts tied for third-most in a postseason game, the highest total since Roger Clemens had 15 in the 2000 AL Championship Series for the New York Yankees against Seattle.

Cole (1-0), who led the majors with 326 strikeouts in the regular season, extended his major league record with his 10th straight game with at least 10 Ks. The Rays were unable to string anything together off of him on a night he induced 33 swings and misses — the most since MLB started tracking the stat in 2008 — and threw a career-high 118 pitches.

Kevin Kiemaier doubled with two outs in the eighth and Cole was lifted after putting on Willy Adames with Cole's first walk. The right-hander received a standing ovation as he walked off the mound and waved to the crowd just before he reached the dugout. Roberto Osuna took over and struck out Yandy Díaz to end the inning before running into trouble in the ninth.

Austin Meadows and Tommy Pham hit consecutive singles and Ji-Man Choi walked to load the bases. The Rays cut the lead to 3-1 when Avisaíl Garcia grounded into a forceout that scored Meadows. Osuna walked Brandon Lowe, reloading the bases, and Astros manager AJ Hinch brought in Will Harris.

Travis d'Arnaud worked the count full, then struck out on a high cutter, and Kiermaier grounded to first baseman Yuli Gurriel, who flipped to Harris, who stepped on first for the save.

Cole's performance came after fellow ace and Cy Young Award contender Justin Verlander pitched seven scoreless innings to lead the Astros to a 6-2 win in the opener on Friday.

Game 3 of the best-of five series is Monday in Florida.

There were no outs in the fourth when Bregman, who hit a career-best 41 home runs in the regular season, homered off Blake Snell (0-10. All seven of Bregman's homers have come off All-Stars, including two against Chris Sale and one each vs. Trevor Bauer, Clayton Kershaw, Corey Kluber and Kenley Jansen.

YANKEES TAG TWINS IN ALDS GAME 2; GREGORIUS SMACKS GRAND SLAM

His shot gave the Astros a home run in 27 straight games, extending a franchise record.

After Lowe's error at second gifted Houston two runs in the opener, another error on helped in the seventh. Adames bobbled Gurriel's leadoff grounder to shortstop, then bounced the thorw to first. Carlos Correa doubled and Martín Maldonado blooped a run-scoring single to left.

Correa added a two-out RBI single off Nick Anderson in the eighth for a 3-0 lead.

Snell, the 2018 AL Cy Young Award winner, sat out from July 22-Sept. 17 after arthroscopic surgery to remove bone chips in his left elbow. He didn't get out of the third inning in any of his three September starts, but said he hoped to give the Rays five innings on Saturday. Instead he was lifted one batter after Bregman's homer, finishing with four hits and a strikeout in 3 1/3 innings.

Correa helped Cole out with a fantastic defensive play to start the game. Díaz led off with a grounder toward Correa, who grabbed the ball backhanded while on the run and spun around for the throw to Gurriel that just beat a sliding Díaz.

Former Astro Charlie Morton, who got the win in the Rays wild-card victory, will start against Zack Greinke. Morton pitched for the Astros from 2017-18 and played a big role in their 2017 World Series title. He won Game 7 of AL Championship Series against the Yankees and Game 7 of the World Series at Dodger Stadium to give Houston its first championship.

Morton had a tough time in his last start against Houston when he gave up a season-high six runs in four innings, which tied his shortest start of season, in a 15-1 win by Astros on Aug. 27. Greinke, acquired from Arizona at the trade deadline, went 8-1 with a 3.02 ERA in 10 starts after the trade capped by a gem in his last start when he came two outs shy of his first no-hitter on Sept. 25 against Seattle."

John Bel Edwards (D) leading the pack with 45%, followed by while Eddie Rispone (R) is at 22% and Ralph Abraham (R) is at 17%. In the expected runoff, scheduled November 16, the poll shows Edwards leading Abraham, 53% to 38%.

* With Donald Trump slated to hold a rally in Minneapolis this week, there’s apparently a brewing dispute between the president’s campaign team and local officials over security costs associated with the event. It’s why Trump has spent much of the morning lashing out at Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey via Twitter.

* Speaking of Minnesota, Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s Democratic presidential campaign reported a third-quarter fundraising haul of $4.8 million, which isn’t great, but which is more than enough to meet the threshold for the party’s November primary debate. Klobuchar has not, however, yet met the polling threshold to participate in the event.

* The New York Times had an interesting item the other day on prominent members of the Republican Party’s “Never Trump” contingent who’ve since changed their minds. The article noted Erick Erickson, among others, who vowed, “I will not vote for Donald Trump. Ever,” only to recently change direction.

* With Sen. Johnny Isakson (R) stepping down in a couple of months for health reasons, Republicans are lining up to ask Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) to appoint them to the seat. Among the latest is former Rep. Jack Kingston (R), who lost in his Senate bid in 2014, and who last week reminded the governor’s office that he’s “aggressively defended President Trump at every turn” and “spent 30 years taking on the Democrats’ misguided agenda.”

Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., announced Tuesday she is endorsing former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary -- choosing her former longtime Senate colleague over Kamala Harris, her fellow California Democratic senator.

Feinstein’s endorsement, the first major Democratic endorsement by a top legislator this campaign season, comes as Biden has been losing ground in the polls in the wake of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump and a series of high-profile gaffes while on the stump. But the longtime California senator praised the former vice president for his long tenure in Washington and his work on gun control.

“I’ve worked closely with Vice President Biden and I’ve seen firsthand his legislative ability, his statesmanship, and most importantly his moral fortitude,” Feinstein said in a statement. “During his time in Congress and in the White House, Joe Biden has been a tireless fighter for hard-working American families.”

STAGE IS SET FOR RECORD-BREAKING DEMOCRATIC 2020 DEBATE

She added: “By making gun reform one of the pillars of his campaign and policy platform, Joe Biden demonstrates that he clearly recognizes what is needed to keep Americans safe. And I know, as president, he will continue the fight to restore the soul of the nation from the Oval Office.”

Feinstein’s endorsement of Biden may seem like a snub to Harris – a first-term senator and former California attorney general – but it hardly comes out of left field, as just last week she held a fundraiser for the former vice president in her home in San Francisco. Also back in January – following Biden’s campaign launch – Feinstein said that “he brings a level of experience and seniority which I think is really important,"" according to the San Francisco Chronicle.

The endorsement from Feinstein – a longtime liberal lawmaker who was first elected in 1992 – comes as Biden is struggling to hold on to his role as Democratic frontrunner. An average of recent polls compiled by Real Clear Politics has Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren virtually tied at the top of the Democratic race.

Warren, however, has surged in recent months in the polls, while Biden has dropped, and far surpassed him during the most recent quarter of fundraising.

Harris, meanwhile, sits in a distant fifth in the Real Clear Politics average, behind Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg."

The letter to Attorney General Bill Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray -- signed by GOP Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah, Ted Cruz and John Cornyn of Texas, Mike Crapo of Idaho, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, John Kennedy of Louisiana and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee -- came as Democrats have sought to relitigate the Kavanaugh issue, with virtually all of the party's 2020 presidential contenders calling for the justice to be impeached.

The first criminal referral, the senators wrote, concerned the ""false allegation made by an individual who told the [Judiciary] Committee that he had direct knowledge that Judge Kavanaugh assaulted a close friend on a boat in the harbor at Newport, Rhode Island in 1985.""

The Twitter account belonging to that accuser apparently advocated for a military coup against the Trump administration. The accuser, who had contacted the office of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., recanted the sexual assault claim on the social media site days later, after an investigation by Senate Republicans.

The second referral involved a claim from disgraced attorney Michael Avenatti and client Julie Swetnick, alleging that Kavanaugh participated in gang-rape trains.

""After a thorough investigation, the committee found no verifiable evidence to support any of the allegations made in the declaration,"" the senators wrote. ""The committee also found that both Mr. Avenatti and Ms. Swetnick had a long history of credibility issues and may have criminally conspired to mislead the committee and obstruct its investigation.""

The third referral specifically implicated Avenatti, who submitted a ""sworn statement by an unknown declarant claimed that Judge Kavanaugh had spiked the punch at house parties with Quaaludes and/or grain alcohol."" NBC News later reported that the apparent declarant had said Avenatti ""twisted her words.""

The final referral concerned a claim by Judy Munro-Leighton, who had sent an email to the Judiciary Committee indicating that she was ""the author of an unsigned letter containing highly graphic sexual-assault accusations against Judge Kavanaugh previously received by the office of Senator Kamala Harris."" But, when committee staff later interviewed her, ""she admitted that she falsely identified herself as the author of the letter and its allegations and had only claimed authorship 'as a way to grab attention.'""

The letter added: ""When asked by committee investigators if she had ever met Judge Kavanaugh, she said: 'Oh Lord, no.'""

'PART OF WHAT MOTIVATED' CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD WAS TO PUT POLITICAL 'ASTERISK' ON KAVANAUGH, LAWYER ADMITS

In the process of evaluating claims against Kavanaugh, the senators wrote that committee investigators ""collected 25 written statements and spoke with 45 individuals,"" and those investigations ""culminated in the nominee’s confirmation and the release of a 414-page committee report concluding that there was no credible evidence to support any of the allegations.""

The senators asked Wray and Barr to provide an update by Oct. 21. Specifically, the senators requested to know ""for each criminal referral made by the committee to the FBI, did the FBI open a criminal investigation? If so, which investigation(s) resulted in a referral to the Justice Department for prosecution? If not, why not?""

Additionally, the senators asked: ""For each case that was referred to the Justice Department for prosecution, which cases were rejected and which were accepted for prosecution?""

For the fifth debate, Democratic candidates need to receive 165,000 unique donors -- including 600 spread out over 20 states -- and reach 3 percent in ""four qualifying state or national polls."" They can also make the stage with 5 percent in two qualifying state polls.

STAGE IS SET FOR RECORD-BREAKING PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY DEBATE

According to the announcement, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas, and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro have yet to meet the polling requirements.

NBC hosted the first Democratic primary debate in June with anchors Chuck Todd, Savannah Guthrie, Lester Holt, Jose Diaz-Balart, and Rachel Maddow. That debate sparked an early controversy between Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who also qualified for the fifth debate, after the former made controversial comments about racial issues.

Since June, the 2020 field has narrowed but at least 12 remained and qualified for the fourth debate set to take place in Ohio. That debate will be hosted by CNN and The New York Times on Oct. 15. Given the much smaller field, NBC can apparently avoid the two-night format of the first debate.

The DNC announced that the fourth-round debate would also be held on a single night. The 10 contenders who faced off in September automatically qualified for the October debate. And Gabbard and Steyer, who narrowly missed the September cut, reached the thresholds to qualify for the upcoming showdown by the deadline.

Thom Tillis: Dems' strategy of personal destruction against Trump began with Brett Kavanaugh,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/democrats-strategy-personal-destruction-trump-kavanaugh-thom-tillis,"Monday, October 7, marks one year since Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in as an associate justice of the Supreme Court. He is already proving to be a brilliant and fair-minded conservative jurist who follows the Constitution as written.

While Kavanaugh will undoubtedly make his lasting mark on the Court in the coming decades, his confirmation process will, unfortunately, go down in history as one of the low points of American politics.

It will be remembered as the moment in which Democrats, starving for a political victory following their stunning defeat to President Trump in 2016, adopted a politics of personal destruction strategy, launching a highly coordinated smear campaign against the president’s judicial nominee.

GREGG JARRETT: THE PELOSI-SCHIFF 'WITCH HUNT' TO IMPEACH TRUMP IS AN ABUSE OF POWER

As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I was on the frontline throughout the entire confirmation process and was one of Kavanaugh’s staunchest supporters.

It was surreal to see my Democratic colleagues abandon the basic tenants of due process, presuming Kavanaugh guilty until proven innocent.

Encouraged by their fanatical, left-wing base and a pliant media, no allegation was too far-fetched to embrace. They even sunk so low that they hyped up the egregiously false allegations made by the client of con-man lawyer Michael Avenatti. It was a disgrace.

Fortunately, their smear campaign failed. The truth prevailed and Kavanaugh was confirmed.

Fast forward to just a few weeks ago, when Democratic presidential candidates and mainstream media outlets pounced on a completely uncorroborated allegation against Kavanaugh published by The New York Times in the paper’s Opinion section.

The Democrats’ impeachment push is about overturning the results of the 2016 election, covering up their socialist and open borders policies, and destroying President Trump personally and politically to pave their path to victory in 2020.

Democrats like Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris rushed to call for Kavanaugh’s impeachment. However, the American people soon learned that the authors conveniently left out vital exculpatory facts, forcing the New York Times to issue an editor’s note correcting the story.

While September may have started with Democrats’ aiming their politics of personal destruction and calls for impeachment at Kavanaugh, it ended with them doing the same against President Trump.

We already know more about the facts of President Trump’s call with his Ukrainian counterpart than the so-called “whistleblower” did because we’ve seen the transcript, unlike the individual who filed the complaint. The transcript directly contradicts the Democratic narrative that the president engaged in a “quid pro quo.”

The latest impeachment push is already unfolding in a way that’s eerily similar to the Kavanaugh spectacle, including Democrats knowing about the allegations before they were made public -- giving them time to create their narrative in advance.

This week the public learned that Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and his staff were working with the so-called whistleblower and encouraged him or her to file the complaint.

It’s no surprise that Democrats have already deemed the facts as irrelevant because their end game is removing President Trump from power using any means necessary.

They're not even trying to hide what their motivation is with Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, recently declaring on national television that “I’m concerned if we don’t impeach this president, he will get re-elected.”

That’s exactly why Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for an impeachment inquiry before she even saw the transcript of the president’s call with the Ukrainian leader. And it’s why Schiff tried to deceive the American public by reading a completely fabricated transcript to make the president look bad.

Democrats, including those running against me in North Carolina, are taking a page out of their Kavanaugh playbook by pushing impeachment because it’s the only play they have left.

At the end of the day, Democrats know they can’t beat President Trump on the issues the American people care about.

They know they can’t beat President Trump by attacking his record of generating record economic growth, securing the border, appointing conservative judges, rebuilding our military, making major reforms to the VA and cutting taxes for hardworking Americans.

The only alternative Democrats are offering Americans is a radical liberal agenda that the American people refuse to buy.

They want to eliminate your employer-provided health insurance, increase the taxes on the money you worked hard for and even implement radical policies like the Green New Deal to prevent you from eating hamburgers and driving the cars you to want to drive.

Democrats know they can’t beat President Trump by running on the issues the American people care about, which is why they’ve employed the politics of personal destruction designed to grind the president’s policy initiatives to a halt, even as they admit that doing so will tear the country apart.

The Democrats’ impeachment push is about overturning the results of the 2016 election, covering up their socialist and open borders policies, and destroying President Trump personally and politically to pave their path to victory in 2020.

Elizabeth Warren is holding a slight edge over former Vice President Joe Biden in the race for their party’s 2020 nomination.

The poll – released Tuesday by Quinnipiac University – is the latest in a slew of national and early voting state surveys in recent weeks to show Warren has surged and now is virtually tied with Biden in the Democratic primary battle.

STAGE IS SET FOR RECORD-BREAKING DEMOCRATIC 2020 DEBATE

The populist senator from Massachusetts who has produced one progressive plan after another stands at 29 percent support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents in the survey. Biden – who for months was the unrivaled front-runner – registers at 26 percent. Warren’s three-point advantage over the former vice president is within the poll’s margin of error.

“Warren maintains her strength in the Democratic primary, which has been consistently growing since the start of her campaign. This poll confirms her status as a co-frontrunner with Biden,"" Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy said.

Sen. Bernie Sanders – the progressive independent from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House run – received 16 percent support.

Warren was at 27 percent, Biden 25 percent, and Sanders 16 percent in Quinnipiac's last Democratic primary poll, which was released two weeks ago.

QUESTIONS MOUNT OVER WARREN'S STUMP SPEECH STORY THAT SHE LOST HER TEACHING JOB BECAUSE SHE WAS PREGNANT

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is a distant fourth, at 4 percent, in the new survey. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang stand at 3 percent in the survey. Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota register at 2 percent, with everyone one else in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential candidates coming in at 1 percent or less.

Biden tops President Trump 51-40 percent in a hypothetical general election matchup. But that’s down from a 16 percentage point lead over the GOP president in Quinnipiac’s late August poll. Warren’s ahead of Trump by eight points in the new survey, down from a 12-point lead in August. And Sanders beat the president by 7 points, down from a 14 point lead in the previous poll.

The new poll also indicates that registered voters nationwide remain divided over impeaching and removing the president from office over the Ukrainian crisis.

IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY GETS MAJORITY SUPPORT IN NEW POLL

Forty-five percent of registered voters say Trump should be impeached and removed from office, with 49 percent opposing such a move. Voters were evenly split at 47 percent in last week’s Quinnipiac survey. But a Quinnipiac poll released late last month – before news of the Ukrainian crisis broke – indicated support for impeachment at just 37 percent.

The new poll indicates 53-43 percent majority support for impeachment inquiry being conducted the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, a slight uptick from 52-45 percent backing for the investigation a week ago.

As expected, there’s a vast partisan divide, with 92 percent of Democrats saying the inquiry’s legitimate and 88 percent of Republicans calling it a witch hunt. By a 52-40 percent margin, independents say the investigation into Trump is legitimate.

Trump’s under fire over his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he urged Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter over their dealings in the eastern European country that’s been battling Russia this decade. Fueled by whistleblower complaints and a read-out of the call released by the White House, Democrats argue the president was asking a foreign country to potentially interfere in a U.S. election.

Trump has repeatedly insisted that he did nothing wrong and has on numerous occasions described his conversation with the Ukrainian leader as “perfect.”

The president and allies have instead tried to put the spotlight in the scandal on Biden, a political rival who’s hoping to face off against the president in next year’s election.

Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how Biden pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor – who had been widely accused by both Democrats and Republicans of overlooking corruption in his own office – was later dismissed.

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted October 4-7, with 1,483 self-identified registered voters questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, with a sampling error of plus or minus 4.7 percent for questions to the 646 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents."

Clint Walker, 27, is accused of fatally shooting a man during a November 2016 robbery gone awry. Several months ago, Walker was released on a $100,000 surety bond and ordered to wear the GPS monitor, provided by a company called Guarding Public Safety.

MAN'S 'HOW TO' VIDEO FOR REMOVING ANKLE MONITOR LEADS TO FELONY CHARGE, AUTHORITIES SAY

But Walker, according to KHOU, ""failed to pay the company his monthly monitoring fee"" that was reportedly a condition of his bond, and therefore the company removed the device — leaving authorities unable to track the murder suspect.

Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg said the company sent ""a representative to physically remove his ankle monitor"" on Sept. 19, and Walker wasn't re-arrested until Oct. 2, according to jail records, which meant he was not monitored for a nearly two-week period.

Ogg described the situation as a ""troubling loophole,"" and the Harris County Community Supervision & Corrections Department, which didn't respond to Fox News' request for comment, said the bizarre technicality had not led to any widespread issues — and placed blame in the Walker case on Guarding Public Safety.

“The vendor was immediately terminated because of serious violations of the memorandum of understanding,” Teresa May, department of director, told the news outlet, noting other defendants monitored by the company have been transferred elsewhere.

May said the company was supposed to gain permission from the department in the event they had to remove Walker's ankle monitor, but they allegedly never contacted the department about the issue.

Guarding Public Safety, which also did not immediately return Fox News' request for comment, told KTRK in a statement that the company ""sent several violations on Clint Walker to the Harris County Pretrial Supervision Dept. including his failure to charge his device as instructed resulting in no location and no communication.""

""His device went dead several times and we had no location and no communication with this defendant,"" the statement read. ""Immediate notification was sent upon removal of his device."""

BIDEN STILL SLIDIN’

IBD: “Elizabeth Warren has taken a narrow lead over Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, the October IBD/TIPP Poll found. Both candidates continue to lead in a head-to-head matchup against President Trump, though Biden had a more comfortable lead, outside the margin of error. Elizabeth Warren had the support of 27%, with Joe Biden backed by 26% and Bernie Sanders a distant third at 10%. Support for South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg climbed to 7% from 5%. No other candidate polled more than 3%. The October IBD/TIPP Poll showed continued momentum for Warren. Last month's poll had shown support for Warren jumping to 24% from 17%. Meanwhile, Biden's support saw further erosion, after slipping to 28% in September from 30% in August. Sanders, whose nomination prospects could suffer after his heart attack last week, saw support fall after registering 12% the prior two months.”



Biden expands lead in South Carolina - Fox News: “Joe Biden increases his lead in the Palmetto State, as a growing number of South Carolina Democratic primary voters want a candidate who can defeat President Trump. The former vice president is ahead by 29 points, according to a Fox News Poll. That’s up from a 21-point lead in July. Biden captures 41 percent support among Democratic primary voters (+6 points since July), Elizabeth Warren trails with 12 percent (+7), and Bernie Sanders gets 10 percent (-4). … Kamala Harris receives 4 percent, down from 12 percent. Tom Steyer, who entered the race in July, also gets 4 percent. Cory Booker (3 percent) and Pete Buttigieg (2 percent) held steady. All others receive 1 percent or less. South Carolina holds its Democratic primary February 29, 2020. … Biden [has] large leads among blacks (+41 points), men (+31), and voters over age 45 (+38).”



Trump trails Dems in Wisconsin - Fox News: “Wisconsin voters are unhappy with how things are going in the country, oppose the border wall, think tariffs hurt the economy, and disapprove of the job President Trump is doing. … Joe Biden bests Trump by 9 points (48-39 percent) and has the only lead outside the poll’s margin of error. Bernie Sanders is up by 5 over Trump (45-40) and Elizabeth Warren has a 4-point edge (45-41). In each case, the remaining 13-14 percent of undecided/third-party voters is enough to shift the race either way. Trump receives 41 percent support or less in each of the matchups -- well below the 47 percent he won the Badger State with in 2016. At the same time, none of the Democrats hit 50 percent.”



Have you tried turning your campaign off, then turning it back on? - NYT: “At campaign events this past week, Ms. [Kamala] Harris debuted a fresh stump speech focused on the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump, an issue in which her campaign believes she is uniquely suited to lead as a former prosecutor. She began each of the rallies, titled ‘Dude Gotta Go,’ with a lengthy discussion of the president’s purported crimes, and concluded by talking directly about the idea of ‘electability,’ which she described as the ‘elephant’ in the 2020 race, and the fear that the country was not ready to elect a black woman as president. … In strategic terms, her campaign’s choice to pivot to Iowa is a concession that its initial theory of the presidential race was at least partially incorrect. From the start, her longtime advisers mapped out a national strategy that highlighted primaries with more diverse electorates … while conserving resources often used in early states for television advertisements in later ones.”



STEYER STICKING AROUND

Fox Business: “The wealthiest Democrat in the 2020 race, billionaire Tom Steyer, announced Sunday that he qualified for the November debate. Steyer is worth a whopping $1.6 billion. Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney is the runner-up with a net worth of roughly $200 million. ‘Tom is surging because he’s not part of the establishment and his message of ending the corporate takeover of our government is resonating,’ his campaign manager Heather Hargreaves said in a statement. ‘Tom is excited to continue getting out there and meeting with voters all across the country, hearing their stories, and connecting with them personally, and we are thrilled to see him on stage sharing his vision with the full country at the DNC debate in Ohio on October 15th and in November.’”



Sanders takes aim at DNC corporate donors in new plan - Politico: “Bernie Sanders, a longtime critic of the nation’s campaign finance system, is releasing a plan Monday aimed at ending the influence of corporate cash in politics, including at the 2020 Democratic National Convention. The Vermont senator pledges to put a stop to all corporate PAC contributions to the convention if he wins the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination. AT&T, Facebook, Independence Blue Cross and other companies each gave seven-figure donations to the event’s host committee in 2016. … His proposal also calls for a lifetime lobbying ban on Democratic National Committee chairs and co-chairs, as well as a prohibition on them working for companies that hold federal contracts or are trying to obtain government approval for mergers or other projects.”



Dem race becomes one of uncertainty - WaPo: “Interviews with more than two dozen Democratic leaders, top strategists and former elected officials revealed that most are still holding out judgment about how — or how much — the events will shift the race. But they point to several worrying factors [about Biden, Warren and Sanders]… Others expressed skepticism that any Democrat would be able to compete against Trump’s unmatched ability to shift the public’s focus. … The shifting dynamic has already altered campaign strategies, as some trailing candidates focus on early-voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire… But for the front-running trio, the events of the last two weeks have served as a public test of how they would handle crises in a general election.”



THE RULEBOOK: KEEP IN MIND…

TIME OUT: THE COMEBACK OF ‘THE NATION’S RIVER’

Smithsonian: “When George Washington chose to build his Mount Vernon estate along the Potomac River, he declared the then-pristine body of water ‘the nation’s river.’ At the time, even dolphins were a common sight. In fact, as Karin Bruillard at the Washington Post reports, the porpoises were seen as far upriver as Alexandria, Virginia, in the 1840s. But by the 1960s, the river that flows through the nation’s capital had lost its luster. … Now, after almost 50 years of pollution control, clean-up and restoration efforts, researchers have catalogued well over 1,000 bottlenose dolphins living, mating, and even giving birth in the lower reaches of the river. … Over the past four years, researchers from Georgetown University’s Potomac-Chesapeake Dolphin Project have been cataloguing dolphins in the lake-like area where the Potomac joins the Chesapeake Bay, reports Bruillard for the Post. … But the most exciting development came in August, when researchers witnessed a dolphin giving birth in the river.”

PELOSI RIDES TO RESCUE

WaPo: “A Democratic group with close ties to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is set to spend more than $1 million on ads set to begin airing this week aimed at bolstering a handful of vulnerable House Democrats as the impeachment probe unfolds. The ads from House Majority Forward, examples of which were reviewed by The Washington Post, do not mention the word ‘impeachment.’ Instead, they focus solely on the accomplishments of the 11 individual lawmakers targeted in the campaign. … The campaign represents the first tranche of television ads to be aired by a group with close ties to the party establishment. House Majority Forward is an affiliate of House Majority PAC, the largest Democratic super PAC focused solely on House races. The focus on non-impeachment issues is further evidence that Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other Democratic leaders are aiming to sell a ‘walk and chew gum’ image for the party — that they can investigate and possibly impeach President Trump while also working to make progress on jobs, health care and other concerns.”



Team Trump sends Pence impeachment Dems districts - Politico: “The White House wants to make vulnerable House Democrats pay for impeachment. Starting this week, Vice President Mike Pence will embark on a national tour of congressional districts represented by Democrats who’ve come out in support of the inquiry. … Each of the districts on Pence's itinerary were won by Trump in 2016, making them potent targets for Republicans. The vice president will travel Wednesday to the southwest Iowa district of Rep. Cindy Axne, and Thursday he’s slated to visit the suburban Twin Cities district of another freshman Democrat, Minnesota Rep. Angie Craig. The vice president is then scheduled to barnstorm an array of battleground districts, including those held by Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Virginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger.”



McConnell uses campaign ad to flex impeachment muscle - Louisville Courier Journal: “Earlier [last] week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said his chamber would have ‘no choice’ but to hold a trial on whether to remove President Donald Trump from office if the House votes to impeach. But in a new campaign ad on Facebook, the Kentucky Republican makes clear that any impeachment attempt will fail as long as he remains in charge of the Senate. ‘Nancy Pelosi's in the clutches of a left wing mob. They finally convinced her to impeach the president,’ McConnell says directly to the camera in a 17-second video. ‘All of you know your Constitution. The way that impeachment stops is a Senate majority with me as majority leader.’ … The McConnell campaign, according to Facebook's ‘Ad Library,’ started running the digital ad last week…”



SUPCO BACK IN SESSION

Fox News: “Now, as the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to launch its new term Monday, a 5-4 conservative majority could be poised to provide the White House with significant legal and political victories -- or setbacks. Such are the unusual dynamics now percolating from the nation's highest court. The justices' election-year agenda includes cases dealing with Trump's executive power over immigration, along with LGBTQ workplace discrimination, gun rights and abortion regulations. All are teed up to be argued this term, with religious liberty and health-care appeals good bets to be added to the docket. All will likely be decided in a presidential election year. ‘The court will be an issue in 2020 but that's perfectly normal. It was a huge issue in 2016, it helped get President Trump elected,’ said Paul Smith, a Georgetown University law professor who has argued 21 cases before the high court. ‘And it will be so again, precisely because it's become such an important part of our system.’”

AUDIBLE: HABITUAL LINE STEPPER

“We say, ‘Don’t cross this line.’ Okay, you crossed it. So, ‘Don’t cross this line.’ We’re finally at a point where patience is exhausted, reason is exhausted and, quite frankly, the voters are exhausted.” – Tom Rath, a longtime member of the GOP in New Hampshire, explaining the crossroads Republicans are at with the president right now, per the WaPo.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“A week ago (give or take a few days), you ran a lead article to the effect that over the months ahead you were going to soberly and impartially report the facts at every turn in the very ‘wine-dy’ (meaning curve-y) road to the 2020 election. Your lead article [Friday] entitled ‘Trump Offers No Off Ramps to Republicans’ strikes me (after the second reading) as anything but consistent with what I understood to be your sober and impartial mission. It seems that your article is strongly slanted against Trump from beginning to end. If I am wrong, can you explain what your ‘Off Ramp’ article would have to say in order to fail your criteria of impartiality, none-emotional, none-judgmental reporting and analysis? I'm genuinely baffled.” – Eric Hutchins, Santa Barbara, Calif.



[Ed. note: I gather from your sentiments, Mr. Hutchins that you are a political supporter of the president. And I understand that for the president’s supporters these are trying, frustrating, exhausting days. If one agrees with the president that his conduct relating to Joe Biden and Ukraine has been “perfect” then what’s happening now must seem like madness. But to most observers, the president failed in his duty by entwining domestic politics with foreign policy. It’s proving to be quite damaging. Now, I don’t care who believes what. You may think Trump hung the moon or you may think Trump is Old Scratch himself. Not my problem. What I promised you on Sept. 26 was that we would not obsess over minutiae from the day to day battle between the two sides over impeachment: “You have plenty of other options for getting the latest details on what this unnamed source said or what that hearing may or may not have revealed. We’re going to stay focused on the political repercussions because that’s our job.” I’m not sure how I’m supposed to do that and not talk about what’s happening in the news. The president is getting absolutely smashed over his conduct vis-a-vis Biden. Support for impeachment has jumped hugely. Republicans are in a defensive crouch and every day one of the president’s team seems to make another blunder that makes the situation even worse. It’s a political catastrophe. It may end up actually working out for Trump and the GOP. Democrats are making plenty of errors of their own and this may all blow up in their faces. And if it does, we’ll certainly be talking about it. But right now, the president and his core supporters don’t seem to understand what a pickle he’s put them in — and the huge problems he’s creating for the GOP. Trump had just gotten out of the woods on the Mueller probe and the very next day needlessly put himself in this jackpot. The position that the president has taken — the “perfect” doctrine — does not reflect the political reality for many members of his party. They need to be able to say that they disapprove, like Democrats did a generation ago, but think America should now “move on” from a divisive distraction. It’s none of my business who wins this fight. That’s up to you. But if you’re interested in my abilities as a forecaster and analyst, it will mean hearing things that you don’t always agree with and certainly discussing matters that are bad news for your team. But it will also mean that I will tell it to you straight. That I will be fair-minded. That I will listen and admit when I’m wrong. That I will give you my thoughts without fear or favor. That we will always do our best.]



“Chris, I’ll keep this short and sweet: 1. Where can I find the law that prohibits a candidate from getting ‘dirt’ on his political opponent from a foreign government? 2. Why is it against the law? Don’t I as a constituent have the right to know if a candidate has broken the law regardless of where the act was committed? 3. If you can never investigate a political opponent for deeds done in a foreign country, what’s to keep someone from simply committing all of their illegal acts in a foreign country?” – Meredith Shoemaker, Sugar Land, Texas



[Ed. note: The president mustn’t do such things himself. And he especially mustn’t do them when he would be the direct beneficiary. We have a Justice Department and a Department of State. We have federal police at the FBI. We have all manner of means by which to combat corruption here and abroad. But when it’s about his political opponents, the president must do his best to stay out of it. Doing otherwise diminishes the confidence Americans have in our legal system to provide dispassionate justice. Presidents of both parties have failed this test in the past so we know how real the temptation is. But it’s not something Americans want to become normal. That’s how governments operate in places like Turkey, Russia and China: People in power use that power to stifle their rivals. I know Trump believes the system is rigged against him, but he is still the president and he must find some way to better honor that high vocation or voters will surely throw him out next year.]



“Unforced errors are the worst kind of errors, in sports and everywhere else. I am reminded of Watergate back when President Richard Nixon was running for re-election. No benefit or advantage was gained from the break-in, and Nixon won re-election in a landslide anyway. Here now President Trump is trying to compromise Joe Biden as a candidate with actions that are expected to have substantial negative consequences for the incumbent – and for what? The race for the Democratic nominee is far from over, but Biden seems to be suffering from the ‘Curse of the Early Frontrunner’ and slipping in the polls for many other reasons than those that are being brought to light from any revelations out of The Ukraine. Hindsight, but also no small amount of foresight and experience, suggests that it would have been (and is) best to ‘keep your powder dry’ for whomever is the actual nominee and not waste time and resources going after those who will not be running against you. If Joe Biden is not the eventual Democratic nominee, this may well be one of those unforced errors that may even approach the impact and magnitude of the Watergate disaster. So much for learning from our past mistakes.” – Kent Haldorson, Beaverton, Ore.



[Ed. note: That’s a very interesting take, Mr. Haldorson. I’m going to chew on it for a while. If I write on it, it will be with due credit to you, sir.]

SO FRESH YOU CAN TASTE THE SQUEAK

Fox News: “And we thought mustard ice cream was a stretch. An ice cream vendor in Ecuador is reportedly seeing demand for her new — and arguably strangest — offering. It's made using the flesh of guinea pigs. Guinea pig meat, known as ‘cuy’ in Ecuador, is typically eaten as a savory dish there and in other South American countries, like Peru and Colombia, where it's often grilled and served whole, per NPR. But María del Carmen Pilapaña, who runs a small stall near the capital of Quito, has stumbled upon a completely new preparation — and it is a hit, she tells The Associated Press. … Pilapaña makes the ice cream by cooking down the guinea pig’s meat and making a pate of sorts before blending it with milk or cream, freezing it, and serving it just like she does with her other flavors.”

“As I became convinced of the practical and theoretical defects of the social-democratic tendencies of my youth, it was but a short distance to a philosophy of restrained, free-market governance that gave more space and place to the individual and to the civil society that stands between citizen and state.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the National Review on Oct. 25, 2013.

""It's not gonna stop us,"" said David Barrows, who held a pro-LGBT rights sign while wearing a ""Dump Trump"" hat. ""But it is too bad we can't be out front where the action is taking place.""

Barrows, along with other protesters, expressed confidence in the Capitol Police to keep the demonstrations safe, saying they were simply waiting for the scene to clear. He said he stayed because he is concerned the high court might rule to ""betray human rights"" by upholding precedent that it is not illegal to discriminate against gay and transgender people for employment.

Barbara Ehardt, an Idaho state representative and former Division I women's basketball coach, was walking toward the Supreme Court before the scene in front of the building had been cleared. The staunch Republican who has spoken out against the transgender movement in the past said she was slated to speak against the court overturning precedent in the transgender case.

""It's simply not fair and right that boys and men can take the place of girls and women in sports,"" she said.

WARREN UNDER FIRE FOR BIOGRAPHY, AGAIN

CBS News: “On the campaign trail, Elizabeth Warren often tells the story of how she was fired from her first teaching job in 1971 because she was pregnant, a pivotal moment that ultimately put her on a path to Harvard, the United States Senate, and quite possibly the presidency. But recently, several media outlets have questioned the veracity of these claims. In an exclusive interview with CBS News on Monday evening, Warren said she stands by her characterizations of why she left the job. ‘All I know is I was 22 years old, I was 6 months pregnant, and the job that I had been promised for the next year was going to someone else. The principal said they were going to hire someone else for my job,’ she said. … Asked by CBS News why she told the story differently at Berkeley a decade ago, Warren said her life since her election to the Senate in 2012 caused her to ‘open up’ about her past. … The Washington Free Beacon reported on a transcript from contemporaneous local school board meetings, also obtained by CBS News, which said Warren was rehired that spring and that the board ‘accepted with regret’ her ‘resignation’ the following summer.”



Ed Kilgore: The emerging anybody-but-Warren campaign - NY Mag: “But the problem with Warren that we are beginning to hear about most frequently is the claim that she’s just ‘too liberal’ or ‘too far left’ for otherwise persuadable voters (or donors) to countenance. Thus, in theory, she will lose swing voters that, say, Joe Biden might win, in part because her anti-corporate rhetoric and progressive policy positions will play into the Trump campaign’s clearly planned message that Democrats are all godless, baby-killing, America-hating socialists. Where is this argument coming from, if Warren is leading Trump in trial heats and becoming steadily more popular? Pretty clearly, corporate voices from Wall Street to Silicon Valley are taking the lead in demonizing her, for good reason: She’s a threat to their bottom lines and their all-but-sovereign business practices.”



Pennsylvanians unimpressed with 2020 Dems - FOX43: “Pennsylvania's presidential primary in 2020 is among the latest in the country. Only 10 states have primary dates later than April 28. … Of the 650 registered voters polled, 307 were registered Democrats. Of them, a majority of people (52%) say they are still undecided when it comes to who they plan to vote for in the Democratic presidential primary. Former Vice President Joe Biden still has the most interest among candidates with 17 percent of Democrats polled saying they would vote for him… Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren (9%) and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg (8%) both polled ahead of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders at 6 percent.”



Team Bernie want him to use heart attack to show personal side - WaPo: “Prominent friends and supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) say he should cut back on his relentless campaign pace and speak openly about his recent heart attack when he returns to the campaign trail, urging a shift toward a more personal and less hectic campaign than he has run so far. The comments reflect what supporters describe as a deeply personal decision with big implications for Sanders’s candidacy: how the 78-year-old democratic socialist, viewed by many of his backers as the leader of a movement, should proceed following a health scare that has sidelined him for days and raised questions about whether he can — or should — maintain the punishing demands of a presidential campaign. … Sanders supporters privately acknowledge concern that the heart attack could give voters second thoughts about the candidate, who would be the oldest president in history if elected.”



Klobuchar raises $4.8 million - Politico: “Democrat Amy Klobuchar raised $4.8 million between July and the end of September, her campaign announced Monday, a total that bested the Minnesota Senator’s haul from the previous quarter by $1 million. Klobuchar’s third-quarter fundraising was a fraction of the amount raised by top Democratic candidates such as Bernie Sanders, who raised the most of any candidate in the field, $25.3 million. But it is likely enough to keep Klobuchar’s campaign functioning as she attempts to secure more support. Klobuchar has qualified for the October Democratic debate and has crossed the donor threshold for the November debate, giving her opportunities to keep making the case for her presidential bid to a national audience.”



THE RULEBOOK: KEEP IT TOGETHER, PEOPLE

“If, on the other hand, they find us either destitute of an effectual government (each State doing right or wrong, as to its rulers may seem convenient), or split into three or four independent and probably discordant republics or confederacies … what a poor, pitiful figure will America make in their eyes!” – John Jay, Federalist No. 4



TIME OUT: CONSEQUENTIAL COW

History: “On October 8, 1871, flames spark in the Chicago barn of Patrick and Catherine O’Leary, igniting a two-day blaze that kills between 200 and 300 people, destroys 17,450 buildings, leaves 100,000 homeless and causes an estimated $200 million (in 1871 dollars; $3 billion in 2007 dollars) in damages. Legend has it that a cow kicked over a lantern in the O’Leary barn and started the fire, but other theories hold that humans or even a comet may have been responsible for the event that left four square miles of the Windy City, including its business district, in ruins. Dry weather and an abundance of wooden buildings, streets and sidewalks made Chicago vulnerable to fire. …Despite the fire’s devastation, much of Chicago’s physical infrastructure, including its water, sewage and transportation systems, remained intact. Reconstruction efforts began quickly and spurred great economic development and population growth, as architects laid the foundation for a modern city featuring the world’s first skyscrapers.”

SUPPORT FOR IMPEACHMENT CLIMBING

WaPo: “A majority of Americans say they endorse the decision by House Democrats to begin an impeachment inquiry of President Trump, and nearly half of all adults also say the House should take the additional step and recommend that the president be removed from office, according to a Washington Post-Schar School poll. … The poll finds that, by a margin of 58 percent to 38 percent, Americans say the House was correct to undertake the inquiry. ... More than 8 in 10 Democrats endorse the inquiry and nearly 8 in 10 favor a vote to recommend that Trump be removed from office. Among Republicans, roughly 7 in 10 do not support the inquiry but almost 3 in 10 do, and almost one-fifth of Republicans say they favor a vote recommending his removal. Among the critical voting bloc of independents, support for the impeachment inquiry hits 57 percent, with 49 percent saying the House should vote to remove Trump from office.”



Trump digs in - NYT: “The Trump administration directed a top American diplomat involved in its pressure campaign on Ukraine not to appear Tuesday morning for a scheduled interview in the House’s impeachment inquiry. The decision to block Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, from speaking with investigators for three House committees is certain to provoke an immediate conflict with potentially profound consequences for the White House and President Trump. House Democrats have repeatedly warned that if the administration tries to interfere with their investigation, it will be construed as obstruction, a charge they see as potentially worthy of impeachment. Democrats from the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees did not immediately respond on Tuesday.”



Graham offers Giuliani a stage to fight back - Fox News: “Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has offered President Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, a chance to come before lawmakers to detail his allegations about former Vice President Joe Biden and his dealings with Ukraine. ‘Have heard on numerous occasions disturbing allegations by [Giuliani] about corruption in Ukraine and the many improprieties surrounding the firing of former Prosecutor-General Viktor Shokin,’ Graham said Tuesday on Twitter. ‘Therefore I will offer to Mr. Giuliani the opportunity to come before the Senate Judiciary Committee to inform the committee of his concerns.’ Giuliani told Fox News on Tuesday he intends to testify, but needs to go over the offer with the other attorneys involved to determine whether they could sort out issues regarding attorney-client privilege and executive privilege.”



House Dems try to keep whistleblower secret - WaPo: “House Democrats are weighing extraordinary steps to secure testimony from a whistleblower whose complaint prompted their impeachment inquiry, masking his identity to prevent President Trump’s congressional allies from exposing the individual, according to three officials familiar with the deliberations. The steps under consideration include having the whistleblower testify from a remote location and obscuring the individual’s appearance and voice, these officials said. The efforts reflect Democrats’ deepening distrust of their GOP colleagues, whom they see as fully invested in defending a president who has attacked the whistleblower’s credibility and demanded absolute loyalty from Republicans. ‘There are lots of different protocols and procedures we’re looking into to find out what works and doesn’t work to protect the identity of the whistleblower,’ said a person familiar with the talks.”



Perry under pressure - Politico: “Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Monday denied that he pressed the Ukrainian government to put two U.S. businessmen on the board of the state energy company or that he was planning to leave the Trump administration. … Perry acknowledged making the recommendations to Ukraine’s state-owned natural gas company Naftogaz, but said he did so only at the request of that country’s government. He also said it was ‘true’ that he had pressed President Donald Trump to make the July call to Zelensky that is at the center of the impeachment inquiry. … Perry also denied he was planning to step down from his position, which POLITICO, the New York Times and Washington Post reported last week. ‘I’m here. I’m serving. They’ve been writing the story that I was leaving the Department of Energy for at least nine months now.’”

“We're all different and I think that we've forgotten that that's okay that we're all different… but just because I don't agree with someone on everything doesn't mean that I'm not going to be friends with them.” – Ellen DeGeneres’ response after receiving backlash for appearing at a Dallas Cowboys football game next to former President George W. Bush, whom she calls a friend.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Chris, you sounded like a Democrat politician when you dodged a direct answer to Meredith Shoemaker’s question [on Monday]. She did not ask you what you thought of President Trump’s call with the Ukrainian President. She asked you very directly ‘what law did President Trump break?’ With the impeachment standard being ‘high crimes and misdemeanors,’ Meredith’s question gets to the heart of the matter. Can I give you second chance here? No Democrat talking points, please. What law?” – Kevin Cook, Farmers Branch, Texas



[Ed. note: So I gather you’re not a Democrat, Mr. Cook! The question of a specific criminal statue here isn’t relevant. Congress’ power to impeach and remove is pretty much unlimited. Andrew Johnson’s impeachment, for example, rested on 11 articles, some relating to specific crimes, but check out the 10th and 11th articles here. How about alleging that Johnson acted “to bring into disgrace, ridicule, hatred, contempt and reproach” on Congress? It’s not a crime to ridicule Congress, even for the president. But Congress was asserting that Johnson’s efforts to undermine Congress was a breach of his duties under the constitutional. Or think of a hypothetical. What if a president laid up dead drunk every day at the White House or was posting top secret documents on Instagram? Neither of those things would be illegal for the president to do, but both would surely doubt in his or her impeachment. These are political, not legal considerations. Democrats in this case are focusing on the president seeking help from a foreign power against a political opponent, and the Constitution gives them more than enough room to do so.]



“At the risk of being accused of being ‘too cute by a half,’ until Joe Biden receives the Democratic nomination, can he really be considered a ‘political opponent’ for the purpose of prohibiting the President from asking for investigative assistance from a foreign government? Full disclosure – I am a supporter of President Trump.” – Tim Kasparek, Goodyear, Ariz.

SF Gate: “Reptile breeder Brian Gundy had just given a talk and animal presentation Saturday at the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Library in downtown San Jose. While going to get his car parked on the second level of the Fourth and San Fernando Street garage about 4:30 p.m., he left his snakes and lizards in boxes and a bag in a no-parking zone. When he returned for his critters, he made a grim discovery. ‘As I was loading up my gear, I realized the bag that had my four pythons and blue skink lizard inside was gone and they were just there seconds ago,’ Gundy told KTVU Fox 2. Gundy had seen several people walk by his equipment, so he ran after them but couldn't catch up. He told KTVU he doesn't think they knew what was inside. … The stolen animals were worth approximately $5,000, according to the reptile breeder.”

John Bel Edwards (D) leading the pack with 45%, followed by while Eddie Rispone (R) is at 22% and Ralph Abraham (R) is at 17%. In the expected runoff, scheduled November 16, the poll shows Edwards leading Abraham, 53% to 38%.

* With Donald Trump slated to hold a rally in Minneapolis this week, there’s apparently a brewing dispute between the president’s campaign team and local officials over security costs associated with the event. It’s why Trump has spent much of the morning lashing out at Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey via Twitter.

* Speaking of Minnesota, Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s Democratic presidential campaign reported a third-quarter fundraising haul of $4.8 million, which isn’t great, but which is more than enough to meet the threshold for the party’s November primary debate. Klobuchar has not, however, yet met the polling threshold to participate in the event.

* The New York Times had an interesting item the other day on prominent members of the Republican Party’s “Never Trump” contingent who’ve since changed their minds. The article noted Erick Erickson, among others, who vowed, “I will not vote for Donald Trump. Ever,” only to recently change direction.

* With Sen. Johnny Isakson (R) stepping down in a couple of months for health reasons, Republicans are lining up to ask Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) to appoint them to the seat. Among the latest is former Rep. Jack Kingston (R), who lost in his Senate bid in 2014, and who last week reminded the governor’s office that he’s “aggressively defended President Trump at every turn” and “spent 30 years taking on the Democrats’ misguided agenda.”

* A national Quinnipiac poll released yesterday found Elizabeth Warren holding onto her narrow lead over Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic nomination, 29% to 26%. Bernie Sanders was third with 16%, and no other candidate topped 5%.

* The same poll found Biden leading Donald Trump in a hypothetical general election match-up by 11 points (51% to 40%), Warren leading Trump by eight points (49% to 41%), and Sanders leading him by seven points (49% to 42%).

* Presidential hopeful Andrew Yang was at 3% in the Quinnipiac poll, which means he’s now the eighth candidate to qualify for the Democrats’ presidential primary debate in November.

* On a related note, we learned yesterday that MSNBC and the Washington Post will co-host the fifth Democratic presidential primary debate on Nov. 20 in Georgia. As NBC News’ report on this added, “The specific location, venue, format and moderators will be announced at a later date.”

* With just a few days remaining ahead of Louisiana’s first round of balloting in the state’s gubernatorial race, the latest Emerson poll found Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) leading the field with 48% – which is awfully close to the 50% threshold he’d need to avoid a runoff and serve a second term. Eddie Rispone (R) was second in the poll with 25%, followed by Ralph Abraham (R) at 19%.

* At home in Vermont yesterday, Bernie Sanders told reporters that in the wake of his heart attack that he’ll have to “change the nature of the campaign a bit.” The independent senator suggested the shift will mean holding fewer campaign events.

* Because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is nothing if not shameless, his re-election campaign yesterday began promoting a Politico article pointing to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao’s alleged favoritism for Kentucky. Chao, of course, is McConnell’s wife. “Mitch McConnell is a Kentucky Asset,” the senator’s team wrote in a tweet highlighting the report.

* Probate judge Steven Reed (D) made history yesterday, becoming the first African-American mayor of Montgomery, Alabama.

* And Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D) has thrown her endorsement to Joe Biden, looking past her fellow California senator, Kamala Harris. Feinstein had previously indicated support for Biden in January, but that was before most of the Democratic candidates had formally launched their campaigns.

Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., announced Tuesday she is endorsing former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary -- choosing her former longtime Senate colleague over Kamala Harris, her fellow California Democratic senator.

Feinstein’s endorsement, the first major Democratic endorsement by a top legislator this campaign season, comes as Biden has been losing ground in the polls in the wake of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump and a series of high-profile gaffes while on the stump. But the longtime California senator praised the former vice president for his long tenure in Washington and his work on gun control.

“I’ve worked closely with Vice President Biden and I’ve seen firsthand his legislative ability, his statesmanship, and most importantly his moral fortitude,” Feinstein said in a statement. “During his time in Congress and in the White House, Joe Biden has been a tireless fighter for hard-working American families.”

STAGE IS SET FOR RECORD-BREAKING DEMOCRATIC 2020 DEBATE

She added: “By making gun reform one of the pillars of his campaign and policy platform, Joe Biden demonstrates that he clearly recognizes what is needed to keep Americans safe. And I know, as president, he will continue the fight to restore the soul of the nation from the Oval Office.”

Feinstein’s endorsement of Biden may seem like a snub to Harris – a first-term senator and former California attorney general – but it hardly comes out of left field, as just last week she held a fundraiser for the former vice president in her home in San Francisco. Also back in January – following Biden’s campaign launch – Feinstein said that “he brings a level of experience and seniority which I think is really important,"" according to the San Francisco Chronicle.

The endorsement from Feinstein – a longtime liberal lawmaker who was first elected in 1992 – comes as Biden is struggling to hold on to his role as Democratic frontrunner. An average of recent polls compiled by Real Clear Politics has Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren virtually tied at the top of the Democratic race.

Warren, however, has surged in recent months in the polls, while Biden has dropped, and far surpassed him during the most recent quarter of fundraising.

Harris, meanwhile, sits in a distant fifth in the Real Clear Politics average, behind Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg."
124,Gregg Re,Senate Republicans on Tuesday sought an update from the Justice Department and the FBI concerning four accusers who allegedly made false claims under oath against now-Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings last year.… [+4277 chars],Senate Republicans on Tuesday sought an update from the Justice Department and the FBI concerning four accusers who allegedly made false claims under oath against now-Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings last year.,2019-10-08,Fox News,Kavanaugh controversy: Senate Republicans want update on criminal referrals over dubious accusations,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/brett-kavanaugh-senate-republicans-criminal-referrals-accusations-update,"Senate Republicans on Tuesday sought an update from the Justice Department and the FBI concerning four accusers who allegedly made false claims under oath against now-Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings last year.

The letter to Attorney General Bill Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray -- signed by GOP Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah, Ted Cruz and John Cornyn of Texas, Mike Crapo of Idaho, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, John Kennedy of Louisiana and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee -- came as Democrats have sought to relitigate the Kavanaugh issue, with virtually all of the party's 2020 presidential contenders calling for the justice to be impeached.

The first criminal referral, the senators wrote, concerned the ""false allegation made by an individual who told the [Judiciary] Committee that he had direct knowledge that Judge Kavanaugh assaulted a close friend on a boat in the harbor at Newport, Rhode Island in 1985.""

The Twitter account belonging to that accuser apparently advocated for a military coup against the Trump administration. The accuser, who had contacted the office of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., recanted the sexual assault claim on the social media site days later, after an investigation by Senate Republicans.

NEW YORK TIMES UPDATES KAVANAUGH 'BOMBSHELL' WITH ONE MINOR DETAIL -- 'ACCUSER' HAS NO RECOLLECTION OF ALLEGED EPISODE

The second referral involved a claim from disgraced attorney Michael Avenatti and client Julie Swetnick, alleging that Kavanaugh participated in gang-rape trains.

""After a thorough investigation, the committee found no verifiable evidence to support any of the allegations made in the declaration,"" the senators wrote. ""The committee also found that both Mr. Avenatti and Ms. Swetnick had a long history of credibility issues and may have criminally conspired to mislead the committee and obstruct its investigation.""

EX-BOYFRIEND TELLS FOX NEWS THAT SWETNICK THREATENED TO KILL UNBORN CHILD, ALWAYS EXAGGERATED STORIES

The third referral specifically implicated Avenatti, who submitted a ""sworn statement by an unknown declarant claimed that Judge Kavanaugh had spiked the punch at house parties with Quaaludes and/or grain alcohol."" NBC News later reported that the apparent declarant had said Avenatti ""twisted her words.""

The final referral concerned a claim by Judy Munro-Leighton, who had sent an email to the Judiciary Committee indicating that she was ""the author of an unsigned letter containing highly graphic sexual-assault accusations against Judge Kavanaugh previously received by the office of Senator Kamala Harris."" But, when committee staff later interviewed her, ""she admitted that she falsely identified herself as the author of the letter and its allegations and had only claimed authorship 'as a way to grab attention.'""

The letter added: ""When asked by committee investigators if she had ever met Judge Kavanaugh, she said: 'Oh Lord, no.'""

In the process of evaluating claims against Kavanaugh, the senators wrote that committee investigators ""collected 25 written statements and spoke with 45 individuals,"" and those investigations ""culminated in the nominee’s confirmation and the release of a 414-page committee report concluding that there was no credible evidence to support any of the allegations.""

The senators asked Wray and Barr to provide an update by Oct. 21. Specifically, the senators requested to know ""for each criminal referral made by the committee to the FBI, did the FBI open a criminal investigation? If so, which investigation(s) resulted in a referral to the Justice Department for prosecution? If not, why not?""

Additionally, the senators asked: ""For each case that was referred to the Justice Department for prosecution, which cases were rejected and which were accepted for prosecution?""

""The next Supreme Court nominee should not have to defend himself or herself against baseless and fabricated allegations, and committee staff should not have to spend valuable time investigating them,"" the senators concluded.

Steven Reed, who became Montgomery County’s first African-American probate judge in 2012, won about 67 percent of the vote in a nonpartisan runoff election, according to unofficial results released Tuesday night.

Reed defeated David Woods, a white television station owner, after the two earned the most votes in a 12-person election in August, the New York Times reported. He will replace the current mayor of Montgomery, Todd Strange, who chose not to run for reelection after a decade in office, the Montgomery Advertiser reported. Reed will be sworn in Nov. 12.

""This election has never been about me,"" Reed said in his victory speech. ""This election has never been about just my ideas. It's been about all the hopes and dreams we have as individuals and collectively in this city.""

""Montgomery is a city with limitless potential, a city that has no limits outside of our imagination,"" Reed continued. ""The only thing that can hold us back is our fears. When we come together there's nothing that we can't accomplish. ""

In his concession speech, Woods said: “We’re just going to go forward and try to support Steven Reed as mayor. And I just want to encourage everyone to try to continue to work together to bring Montgomery as a unified city. A unified Montgomery is a lot stronger than a divided Montgomery.”

Montgomery has historically been a hotbed for racial tension. Southern delegates gathered in Montgomery in 1861 to vote to form the Confederacy. The city is also home to the church where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. organized the Montgomery bus boycott, in which Rosa Parks became a symbol of the 1960s civil rights movement.

Reed was endorsed by Democratic 2020 hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox, Montgomery's WSFA-TV reported. His father, Joe Reed, is the longtime leader of the black caucus of the Alabama Democratic Party.

The network said it would wait to announce the format, moderators, and specific location but did announce it would host the debate in cooperation with The Washington Post.

It also commented on which Democrats appeared to qualify for the debate. As of Tuesday, the field included former Vice President Joe Biden, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.

For the fifth debate, Democratic candidates need to receive 165,000 unique donors -- including 600 spread out over 20 states -- and reach 3 percent in ""four qualifying state or national polls."" They can also make the stage with 5 percent in two qualifying state polls.

STAGE IS SET FOR RECORD-BREAKING PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY DEBATE

According to the announcement, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas, and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro have yet to meet the polling requirements.

NBC hosted the first Democratic primary debate in June with anchors Chuck Todd, Savannah Guthrie, Lester Holt, Jose Diaz-Balart, and Rachel Maddow. That debate sparked an early controversy between Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who also qualified for the fifth debate, after the former made controversial comments about racial issues.

Since June, the 2020 field has narrowed but at least 12 remained and qualified for the fourth debate set to take place in Ohio. That debate will be hosted by CNN and The New York Times on Oct. 15. Given the much smaller field, NBC can apparently avoid the two-night format of the first debate.

The DNC announced that the fourth-round debate would also be held on a single night. The 10 contenders who faced off in September automatically qualified for the October debate. And Gabbard and Steyer, who narrowly missed the September cut, reached the thresholds to qualify for the upcoming showdown by the deadline.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's ""Green New Deal.""

The freshman New York congresswoman traveled to Copenhagen for a meeting with the C40, a group of 94 mayors led by Los Angeles' Mayor Eric Garcetti -- who was just announced as the group's new chair. The plan aims to halve carbon emissions by 2030 through cleaner alternatives and the ""strictest possible building codes."" It also seeks to achieve the Paris Climate Agreement's goal of keeping warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Besides Garcetti, mayors from at least five U.S. cities released statements supporting the global adoption of Ocasio-Cortez's climate framework. Those included New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio; Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan; Austin, Texas, Mayor Steve Adler; Portland, Ore., Mayor Ted Wheeler; and Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney.

KAMALA HARRIS THREATENS TO END FILIBUSTER TO PASS GREEN NEW DEAL

“I am inspired by this coalition and the commitments made for a global Green New Deal. If we work to join forces globally, we will be able to defeat our greatest threat and realize our greatest opportunity,"" said Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

The C40 group echoed months of Ocasio-Cortez's rhetoric, warning of an impending ""climate emergency"" and blaming ""a minority of very powerful, science-denying governments, representing the interests of the fossil-fuel industry"" for inaction.

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who also serves as C40's board president, portrayed the commitment as a way to improve public health and drive economic growth.

“Together, C40 cities have taken thousands of successful actions to reduce carbon emissions, and they are proving how fighting climate change helps drive economic growth and improve public health. There is no time to waste,"" he said.

DOOMSDAYS THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN: THINK TANK COMPILES DECADES' WORTH OF DIRE CLIMATE PREDICTIONS

Wednesday's news appeared to be a flagrant rebuke of the Trump administration's approach to foreign policy on climate change. The president controversially said he would rescind the U.S.'s support for the Paris Climate Agreement, citing economic impacts on cities like Pittsburgh.

It was also the latest indication that high-ranking officials were willing to embrace Ocasio-Cortez's ambitious vision for tackling climate change. A slew of 2020 Democratic candidates endorsed the framework of her ""Green New Deal"" while laying out multitrillion-dollar plans that involved substantial regulation.

Conservatives have balked at the plan as a thinly veiled attempt to bring socialism to the United States. The price tag alone could be problematic for Democrats in the 2020 election. Conservative estimates have projected the ""Green New Deal"" would cost trillions, inflict a heavy toll on economic growth and burden swing-state voters.

Advocates say that the alternative would be worse. ""We need to start getting comfortable with how extreme the problem is,"" Ocasio-Cortez previously said, ""because only until we accept ... how bad climate change is and how bad it can be for our children's lives, are we going to be comfortable pursuing really big solutions."""

Elizabeth Warren is holding a slight edge over former Vice President Joe Biden in the race for their party’s 2020 nomination.

The poll – released Tuesday by Quinnipiac University – is the latest in a slew of national and early voting state surveys in recent weeks to show Warren has surged and now is virtually tied with Biden in the Democratic primary battle.

STAGE IS SET FOR RECORD-BREAKING DEMOCRATIC 2020 DEBATE

The populist senator from Massachusetts who has produced one progressive plan after another stands at 29 percent support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents in the survey. Biden – who for months was the unrivaled front-runner – registers at 26 percent. Warren’s three-point advantage over the former vice president is within the poll’s margin of error.

“Warren maintains her strength in the Democratic primary, which has been consistently growing since the start of her campaign. This poll confirms her status as a co-frontrunner with Biden,"" Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy said.

Sen. Bernie Sanders – the progressive independent from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House run – received 16 percent support.

Warren was at 27 percent, Biden 25 percent, and Sanders 16 percent in Quinnipiac's last Democratic primary poll, which was released two weeks ago.

QUESTIONS MOUNT OVER WARREN'S STUMP SPEECH STORY THAT SHE LOST HER TEACHING JOB BECAUSE SHE WAS PREGNANT

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is a distant fourth, at 4 percent, in the new survey. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang stand at 3 percent in the survey. Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota register at 2 percent, with everyone one else in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential candidates coming in at 1 percent or less.

Biden tops President Trump 51-40 percent in a hypothetical general election matchup. But that’s down from a 16 percentage point lead over the GOP president in Quinnipiac’s late August poll. Warren’s ahead of Trump by eight points in the new survey, down from a 12-point lead in August. And Sanders beat the president by 7 points, down from a 14 point lead in the previous poll.

The new poll also indicates that registered voters nationwide remain divided over impeaching and removing the president from office over the Ukrainian crisis.

IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY GETS MAJORITY SUPPORT IN NEW POLL

Forty-five percent of registered voters say Trump should be impeached and removed from office, with 49 percent opposing such a move. Voters were evenly split at 47 percent in last week’s Quinnipiac survey. But a Quinnipiac poll released late last month – before news of the Ukrainian crisis broke – indicated support for impeachment at just 37 percent.

The new poll indicates 53-43 percent majority support for impeachment inquiry being conducted the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, a slight uptick from 52-45 percent backing for the investigation a week ago.

As expected, there’s a vast partisan divide, with 92 percent of Democrats saying the inquiry’s legitimate and 88 percent of Republicans calling it a witch hunt. By a 52-40 percent margin, independents say the investigation into Trump is legitimate.

Trump’s under fire over his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he urged Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter over their dealings in the eastern European country that’s been battling Russia this decade. Fueled by whistleblower complaints and a read-out of the call released by the White House, Democrats argue the president was asking a foreign country to potentially interfere in a U.S. election.

Trump has repeatedly insisted that he did nothing wrong and has on numerous occasions described his conversation with the Ukrainian leader as “perfect.”

The president and allies have instead tried to put the spotlight in the scandal on Biden, a political rival who’s hoping to face off against the president in next year’s election.

Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how Biden pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor – who had been widely accused by both Democrats and Republicans of overlooking corruption in his own office – was later dismissed.

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted October 4-7, with 1,483 self-identified registered voters questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, with a sampling error of plus or minus 4.7 percent for questions to the 646 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents."

TIME FOR A RE-PETE?

What’s so great about fourth place?



If you’re South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, quite a lot actually.



Readers have no doubt been watching Elizabeth Warren’s steady gains against front-runner Joe Biden in recent weeks. She is now just 2.4 points behind Biden in our Democratic 2020 Power Ranking. As Biden continues to struggle with the enhanced scrutiny on his family’s buck raking facilitated by Biden’s proximity to power, we expect his troubles to continue.



While Democrats are loath to publically agree with President Trump, the facts of the case of Trump’s likely impeachment reinforce Biden’s strongest negatives: That he has been around too long and is too much of a swamp creature.



We know Biden supporters are preparing to spend millions to prop up the former Delaware senator in his third presidential quest, but it is hard to imagine that Biden could persist for long in second place.



When electability is your cri de coeur it’s hard to keep voters around when you don’t look so electable.



This is good news for Warren, no doubt. But she had better be worried that it is good news come too soon. As Biden is currently experiencing, being the frontrunner is not all aviator sunglasses and waffle cones.



Warren has long enjoyed kid-glove treatment from the press, with relatively little scrutiny on her very ambitious policy proposals. She has also gotten a couple of mulligans on biographical boo-boos. That won’t last if she gets out in front. The steady diet of opposition research that will fill reporters’ inboxes will see to that.



So cast your eyes down the list. You can skip over poor Bernie Sanders who is struggling not just with his own health issues, but with the tragic loss of his daughter-in-law. The Vermont senator has said he will scale back his campaigning, and is already 10 points behind Warren and falling.



Buttigieg, though, has been climbing. Perhaps the beneficiary of the unraveling of California Sen. Kamala Harris’ misbegotten campaign or perhaps some Biden skeptics defecting, Buttigieg is a man on the move.



Certainly Sens. Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar are hoping that they would see their boats lifted by the melting of Biden’s iceberg, but Buttigieg may have the best case to make.



His fundraising haul in the third quarter says that he will have the resources to go the distance and his moderate-sounding appeal to voters would position him nicely to pick up the business-friendly Democratic donors who are terrified of either a Warren defeat or victory.



Whether Buttigieg can capitalize on the opportunity will depend on his ability to go toe-to-toe with Warren. In the first Buttigieg craze, he wasn’t able to translate interest into hard support. In a second go-around he’d have to play for keeps.



SANDERS TO SCALE BACK CAMPAIGN AFTER HEART SURGERY

WaPo: “[Bernie Sanders] visited a cardiologist Tuesday morning, and when he returned, he told reporters, ‘We’re gonna change the nature of the campaign a bit.’ ‘Probably not doing four rallies a day,’ said Sanders, who had adopted a more furious campaign schedule than many of his much younger opponents. Sanders, who has committed to releasing his medical records before the first primary votes but has not yet done so, said Tuesday he would provide the information at ‘the appropriate time.’ Former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) — fellow septuagenarians who join Sanders at the top of most polls — have also committed to releasing their medical records.”



Daughter-in-law, 46, killed by rare cancer - USA Today: “The daughter-in-law of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has died, shortly after being diagnosed with cancer. Rainè Riggs was 46. The Lee & Martin Funeral Home in Burgettstown, Pennsylvania, says Riggs died Saturday, the day Sanders returned to Vermont after suffering a heart attack. Her obituary said she was diagnosed with neuroendocrine cancer. Riggs, a neuropsychologist, was married to Levi Sanders, who ran unsuccessfully for a New Hampshire congressional seat in 2018. Riggs' obituary says she met Levi Sanders while the two worked at an emergency food shelter in Vermont. The obituary said Riggs was the director of behavioral medicine at Dartmouth Medical School for several years, and she started the Palliative Care Department for Dartmouth Medical Center. She also owned Riggs Geriatric Psychology in Windsor, Vermont. Riggs and Sanders had three children.”



Dianne Feinstein endorses Biden, snubs Harris - Fox News: “Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., announced Tuesday she is endorsing former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary -- choosing her former longtime Senate colleague over Kamala Harris, her fellow California Democratic senator. Feinstein’s endorsement, the first major Democratic endorsement by a top legislator this campaign season, comes as Biden has been losing ground in the polls in the wake of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump and a series of high-profile gaffes while on the stump. But the longtime California senator praised the former vice president for his long tenure in Washington and his work on gun control. ‘I’ve worked closely with Vice President Biden and I’ve seen firsthand his legislative ability, his statesmanship, and most importantly his moral fortitude,’ Feinstein said in a statement.”



THE RULEBOOK: SUFFICIENT RESOURCES

“I believe it may be regarded as a position warranted by the history of mankind, that, IN THE USUAL PROGRESS OF THINGS, THE NECESSITIES OF A NATION, IN EVERY STAGE OF ITS EXISTENCE, WILL BE FOUND AT LEAST EQUAL TO ITS RESOURCES.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 30



TIME OUT: ‘YESTERDAY’ CAME SUDDENLY

On this day in 1965, The Beatles’ “Yesterday” began its month-long reign as the top single in the U.S. The song, Paul McCartney’s masterwork, started as a dream. The Telegraph [U.K.]: “As McCartney explained in 1980: ‘I woke up with a lovely tune in my head. I thought, 'That’s great, I wonder what that is?' There was an upright piano next to me, to the right of the bed by the window. I got out of bed, sat at the piano, found G, found F sharp minor 7th – and that leads you through then to B to E minor, and finally back to E. It all leads forward logically. I liked the melody a lot but because I’d dreamed it I couldn’t believe I’d written it. I thought, ‘No, I’ve never written like this before.’ But I had the tune, which was the most magic thing.’ McCartney was living in Wimpole Street, London, at the time, at the family home of Jane Asher, who he was dating at the time.”

TRUMP’S IMPEACHMENT PLAN: BURN DOWN THE HOUSE

Axios: “President Trump, while nervous about the historic stain of impeachment, is throwing everything he has into this fight: refusing all cooperation, running ads to profit politically, and torching every person who stands in opposition to him. When it all boils down, Trump really only trusts his own instincts. And his instincts here are the same as they were with the Mueller investigation: Fight like hell. No nuance or apology — not a hint of it. Turn the leader of the investigation (in this case, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff) into a conservative media villain. Condemn Trump enemies in the most incendiary and exaggerated language possible (treason, traitors, coup, etc.). Compared to the Mueller investigation, the Ukraine phone call appears to have more resonance with the general public. Republicans close to leadership and the White House tell Axios they're concerned by trend lines in a Washington Post poll showing 49% of Americans think Trump should be removed from office.”



Partisan lines holding - NBC News: “A majority of Americans say the allegations that President Donald Trump asked a foreign leader to investigate 2020 rival Joe Biden are serious and need to be fully investigated, and they also believe the president hasn’t been honest and truthful about his actions. Still, the public is divided – largely along partisan lines – on whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office, with 43 percent supporting his removal given what they know today, versus 49 percent who oppose it. … According to the poll, 47 percent of Americans believe the allegations that Trump requested Ukraine’s president to look into the Bidens are either ‘quite serious’ or ‘extremely serious.’ That includes 73 percent of Democrats, 55 percent of independents and even 21 percent of Republicans. By contrast, a combined 28 percent dismiss the allegations as either being not serious or false and without merit. Twenty-five percent of respondents say they don’t have an opinion or are unsure.”



Q Poll: Support for impeachment inquiry steady - Quinnipiac University: “After another week with impeachment in the news, registered voters nationwide are still divided on impeaching and removing President Trump from office, with 45 percent saying he should be impeached and removed and 49 percent opposing the idea, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. This compares to last week's poll, in which voters were evenly split on impeaching and removing the president 47 - 47 percent. In a poll released on September 25, before any major news about impeachment, voters were clearly against impeachment 37 - 57 percent. While nearly half of voters do not currently back impeachment, a majority of voters do still approve 53 - 43 percent of the impeachment inquiry being conducted by the U.S. House of Representatives in order to determine whether or not to bring impeachment charges against the president. A week ago, voters approved of the inquiry 52 - 45 percent.”



Gowdy joins Team Trump - Bloomberg: “Donald Trump has enlisted former Representative Trey Gowdy to work with the White House team combating the U.S. House’s impeachment inquiry into the president, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Gowdy, a former prosecutor from South Carolina, is not formally joining the White House staff, according to the people. He was at the White House on Tuesday, according to one person who saw him there, before an eight-page letter was issued to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declaring that Trump and the administration wouldn’t participate in the impeachment inquiry.”



What will become of Mick Mulvaney? - The Atlantic: “[Mick] Mulvaney’s uncertain status says something about Trump’s mind-set. In the face of this latest peril, and nearly 1,000 days into his tenure, he still hasn’t settled on how the West Wing should run. Confronting the impeachment threat is a West Wing staff that Trump has largely neutered. Aides have been left guessing about who’s coming and going, much less what they’re supposed to say about accusations that Trump pressured Ukraine to ferret out dirt on his potential 2020 rival Joe Biden. In the two weeks since the whistle-blower complaint was released to the public, the White House still hasn’t articulated a clear legal, political, or communications strategy needed to withstand impeachment and keep Trump’s Republican support from eroding.”



Watergate lessons for GOP - FiveThirtyEight: “One complicating factor here is that if Republicans were to abandon Trump, history does not suggest that Trump loyalists would easily forgive them for joining the Democrats’ impeachment effort. Even though most Americans did eventually support removing [Richard] Nixon from office, Republican voters were mostly not part of that consensus. Days before he resigned, a Gallup poll found that only 31 percent of Republicans thought Nixon should no longer be president. And some of those supporters deeply resented their representatives for their role in ousting Nixon, which may even have contributed to the Democratic landslide in the 1974 midterm elections.”



SENATE GOP CAMPAIGN ARM RAISES RECORD CASH

WashEx: “The committee tasked with electing Republican senators amid the impeachment battle will report raising $47.7 million so far this year, an amount that is already greater than ever raised before in the year prior to an election year. The National Republican Senatorial Committee is crucial to protecting vulnerable incumbents like Susan Collins of Maine, Cory Gardner of Colorado, and Martha McSally of Arizona. In the three-month period ending Sept. 30, the NRSC raised roughly $13.1 million, including approximately $5 million in September — and made the last payment on a $17 million debt left over from the midterm elections. The NRSC shared these figures with the Washington Examiner on Tuesday, ahead of its upcoming Federal Election Commission filing. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is trying maintain Republican control of the Senate. Currently there are 53 GOP senators in the conference.”



Planned Parenthood preps massive 2020 spending - Fox News: “Planned Parenthood, the behemoth nonprofit organization that provides reproductive health care and is the nation’s largest abortion provider, says it’s making a major investment in the 2020 elections. Planned Parenthood’s political wings – which fight for legal protections for abortion – announced Wednesday that they’ll spend $45 million backing candidates who support abortion rights in elections next year ranging from the state house level to the White House. … The group says its top priority in 2020 is to defeat and unseat President Trump. Other priorities include helping Democrats retake control of the GOP-controlled Senate and holding the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. The group will target roughly 5 million voters across the country, with the spotlight on nine key swing states: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.”



Bevin looks to impeachment backlash to hold on in Kentucky - RCP: “[Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin] has pressed the pending impeachment of President Trump into his own Kentucky reelection effort. Standing outside the governor’s mansion on Friday, Bevin tied his fate to Trump’s by condemning impeachment as ‘an absolute travesty’ and calling on his Democratic opponent, state Attorney General Andy Beshear, to answer a ‘fundamental question’: Will Beshear support or oppose forcing the president from office? The Democrat doesn’t want to answer, and the ensuing drama in a 2019 race could draw a rough sketch of the electoral implications of impeachment in 2020.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I appreciate Ellen DeGeneres’ statement about her friendship with former President George W. Bush. How have we reached this point where we can’t be friends with, or at least be civil to, those who hold a different viewpoint? … The father of Christian Rock, Larry Norman, once told a joke about witnessing to people and the ‘religious’ terminology that is often used. In the story, the Christian becomes frustrated at the end of a conversation he’s been having with a friend because the friend doesn’t understand the terms justification, sanctification, or being saved. In frustration he shouts, ‘I’m trying to tell you the Good News!’ His friend asks, ‘What’s that?’ The Christian responds, ‘You’re going to Hell!’ To which his friend replies, ‘Well, what’s the bad news?’ The point of recounting that is to state that if we hold firm convictions, that’s fine, but we need to convey them in a loving and respectful way. Our actions speak louder than our words. If we’re not mindful of that, we risk offending the person, or worse, losing the opportunity for dialogue that we seek with the other person. I believe that in matters of faith especially, that would be a bad thing. As always, I wish you and your family God’s richest blessings!” – Paul Schnier, Shoreham, N.Y.



[Ed. note: Amen, Mr. Schnier! That goes for politics, too. Persuasion leads to consensus, which leads to durable reforms. Division leads to government by plurality, which leads to lurching. Blessings to you and yours, too.]



“I fully understand your point today about the legal (‘shoot someone on 5th Ave’) and political differences (‘posting TS documents on IG’) when viewing Congress' vested powers to impeach a sitting President. Hopefully this third time is a charm. What about this [Contributions and donations by foreign nationals.] I believe this is what your colleague Judge [Andrew Napolitano] has been referencing in his argument on recent articles and TV shows. … The difference between this and the Mueller/Russia case was that this bordered on bribery in ‘bribes, high crimes and misdemeanors.’ Mueller's case was weak and bordered on emotion. This is a stronger case with a self-admitted crime, No? An independent voter's perspective.” – Jai Suresh, Fremont, Calif.



[Ed. note: I hear you, Mr. Suresh. But, no matter which side you take here, the question of impeachment still isn’t about the law. The question is political, or at best, moral. It is what the members of the House (and the constituents they represent) say it is. Efforts to find specific criminal charges miss the point of the endeavor.]

EAU DE BIG BOY

AP: “An Ohio homeowner never envisioned becoming semi-famous because of a goat butting its way into her home and taking a nap in her bathroom. … The break-in happened Friday when an escaped male goat from a farm several miles away repeatedly butted against a sliding glass door... [Jennifer Keathley’s] 18-year-old son, Logan, discovered the billy goat in the bathroom when he returned home Friday afternoon from school to find the family’s agitated German Shepherd in the driveway, broken glass on the back porch and the house reeking. … Two Ashland County Sheriff’s deputies unsuccessfully tried to coax the goat, named Big Boy, out of the home with carrots, a dog bone and grass. They eventually grabbed him by the horns and dragged him outside… The Keathleys learned their home insurance policy covers damage from bears and deer but not goats. … Despite applications of carpet deodorant and urine neutralizer, she said the odor from Big Boy’s urine still lingers.”

The packages were discovered around 8 a.m. ET and officers closed some streets to traffic in the immediate area around the Supreme Court. Police did not evacuate the court itself, though they did move a large group of protesters from the area in front of the court steps where the court was to hear three cases about discrimination against gay and transgender individuals in the workplace.

Barrows, along with other protesters, expressed confidence in the Capitol Police to keep the demonstrations safe, saying they were simply waiting for the scene to clear. He said he stayed because he is concerned the high court might rule to ""betray human rights"" by upholding precedent that it is not illegal to discriminate against gay and transgender people for employment.

Farrow was an NBC News employee when his reporting on now-disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein helped launch the #MeToo movement in 2017. NBC has long claimed that Farrow’s reporting, as presented to it, was not fit to run with. Farrow’s work ultimately appeared in The New Yorker, which is known for its vigorous fact-checking, so numerous theories have since been floated about why the Peacock Network passed.

LAUER DENIES GRAPHIC RAPE CLAIM, SAYS SEX WITH NBC NEWS COLLEAGUE 'COMPLETELY CONSENSUAL'

The son of Mia Farrow and Woody Allen has been expected to tell his side of the NBC saga in “Catch and Kill.” But it's just one of the bombshells he shared with The Hollywood Reporter’s Marisa Guthrie in an interview published on Wednesday, along with information from Guthrie's advance look at the book in an office at publisher Little, Brown.

NBC News did not immediately respond to a request for comment to a series of questions about Farrow's interview with The Hollywood Reporter.

Fox News has not seen the book, that is scheduled to be released on Tuesday. But here are six takeaways from Farrow's blockbuster interview:

‘TODAY’ ADDRESSES ‘APPALLING’ NEW MATT LAUER REPORT: 'IT’S JUST VERY PAINFUL'

THR: Farrow’s book will detail Weinstein’s alleged attempts to silence NBC

Weinstein attempted to “bully” NBC News into killing the story by leveraging information about then-NBC News anchor Matt Lauer, according to Guthrie. An executive from National Enquirer publisher American Media helped Weinstein formulate a plan to silence NBC News, according to Guthrie, and the duo found a “pressure point” against the network when he learned of alleged behavior by Lauer.

""Weinstein made it known to the network that he was aware of Lauer's behavior and capable of revealing it."" The book documents ""a period in which secrets at NBC were under threat of exposure,"" Farrow wrote in his book, according to Guthrie. ""And it is very clear from the conversations I document how heavily those secrets weighed on their [reporting] judgment.""

In a statement to THR, NBC News denied this claim and said “the idea of NBC News taking a threat seriously from a tabloid company about Matt Lauer is especially preposterous, since they already covered him with great regularity.”

RONAN FARROW'S TEAM 'CONFIDENT IN THE FACTS' IN NEW #METOO BOOK, DISMISSES LEGAL THREAT FROM EX-NATIONAL ENQUIRER EDITOR

THR: Farrow will directly name high-powered NBC executives

The book details ""Weinstein's personal interactions with NBC News and MSNBC chairman Andy Lack, NBC News president Noah Oppenheim and MSNBC president Phil Griffin,” according to Guthrie, who notes that the disgraced movie mogul called them frequently enough “that Weinstein's assistants who were asked to place phone calls to the men dubbed them ‘the triumvirate.’”

“Catch and Kill” will also detail “just how deep Weinstein's connections ran within NBC and reveals his aggressive effort to court additional executives,” Guthrie wrote.

THR also indicated that claims of sexual misconduct against NBC executives themselves will be included in the book.

NBC NEWS BOSS ANDY LACK SLAMMED FOR KEEPING SEX MISCONDUCT REVIEW IN-HOUSE

THR: The book will reportedly contradict NBC’s internal review

After an internal review, NBC declared in 2018 that NBC News management was oblivious to Lauer’s alleged pervy past. The controversial review was conducted by in-house general counsel Kim Harris despite widespread calls for an independent investigation.

“Farrow uncovers seven allegations of workplace sexual misconduct by Lauer that seem to contradict the network's stance that management had no knowledge of his behavior as well as seven nondisclosure agreements — many with hush-money payouts — to accusers of Lauer and others at NBC. Multiple Lauer accusers, including the woman whose complaint to NBC's human resources department resulted in the star's ouster, tell their stories in detail,” Guthrie wrote. ""NBC maintains that it had no knowledge of Lauer's behavior before he was fired.""

NBC News maintained it had no knowledge of Lauer’s misconduct in a statement to THR.

MADDOW CELEBRATES NYT REPORTERS WHO EXPOSED WEINSTEIN SCANDAL, IGNORES HOW NBC SPIKED SAME STORY

THR: Publisher Little, Brown has gone to great lengths to keep the book under wraps.

“In an effort to avoid any leaks, the publisher has gone to great lengths to secure the book's contents before publication. The Hollywood Reporter is one of only a handful of outlets allowed an early read, and even that had to be done in a conference room at Little, Brown's Midtown [Manhattan] offices under the gaze of a minder,” Guthrie wrote.

Guthrie indicated that she was eventually given a watermarked copy that she promised not to read in public.

THR: Weinstein allegedly used his friendship with Hillary Clinton, too

“Weinstein also attempted to leverage his long-term relationship with Hillary Clinton to pressure Farrow,” Guthrie reported.

Guthrie said Farrow was attempting to interview Clinton for an unrelated project in the summer of 2017, and the former secretary of state’s publicist later informed Weinstein that Farrow was working on a concerning story.

“Then, in September 2017, according to an email cited in the book, Weinstein wrote to Deborah Turness, the ex-president of NBC News who now runs NBC News International, to propose a docuseries on Clinton,” Guthrie wrote.

THR: Farrow says he is banned from NBC with one exception

Farrow appeared on MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” in October 2017 following the release of his Weinstein scoop and famously hinted that NBC News passed on the report. ""I walked in the door at The New Yorker with an explosive, reportable piece that should have been made public earlier,” he told Maddow.

Guthrie wrote that this segment “set off a firestorm at NBC”

“The moment they were off the air, Maddow's phone rang, and Farrow could hear {MSNBC President Phil] Griffin screaming through the receiver,” Guthrie wrote. “Farrow believes that he is blacklisted from NBC News and MSNBC. Only Maddow has had the clout to flout this ban; she had him on her show in April 2018, to discuss his foreign policy book, ‘War on Peace.’ NBC's executives deny Farrow is banned, but multiple sources tell THR that their attempts to book Farrow have been quashed.”

MSNBC did not immediately respond when asked if Farrow is subject to such a ban."

WARREN UNDER FIRE FOR BIOGRAPHY, AGAIN

CBS News: “On the campaign trail, Elizabeth Warren often tells the story of how she was fired from her first teaching job in 1971 because she was pregnant, a pivotal moment that ultimately put her on a path to Harvard, the United States Senate, and quite possibly the presidency. But recently, several media outlets have questioned the veracity of these claims. In an exclusive interview with CBS News on Monday evening, Warren said she stands by her characterizations of why she left the job. ‘All I know is I was 22 years old, I was 6 months pregnant, and the job that I had been promised for the next year was going to someone else. The principal said they were going to hire someone else for my job,’ she said. … Asked by CBS News why she told the story differently at Berkeley a decade ago, Warren said her life since her election to the Senate in 2012 caused her to ‘open up’ about her past. … The Washington Free Beacon reported on a transcript from contemporaneous local school board meetings, also obtained by CBS News, which said Warren was rehired that spring and that the board ‘accepted with regret’ her ‘resignation’ the following summer.”



Ed Kilgore: The emerging anybody-but-Warren campaign - NY Mag: “But the problem with Warren that we are beginning to hear about most frequently is the claim that she’s just ‘too liberal’ or ‘too far left’ for otherwise persuadable voters (or donors) to countenance. Thus, in theory, she will lose swing voters that, say, Joe Biden might win, in part because her anti-corporate rhetoric and progressive policy positions will play into the Trump campaign’s clearly planned message that Democrats are all godless, baby-killing, America-hating socialists. Where is this argument coming from, if Warren is leading Trump in trial heats and becoming steadily more popular? Pretty clearly, corporate voices from Wall Street to Silicon Valley are taking the lead in demonizing her, for good reason: She’s a threat to their bottom lines and their all-but-sovereign business practices.”



Pennsylvanians unimpressed with 2020 Dems - FOX43: “Pennsylvania's presidential primary in 2020 is among the latest in the country. Only 10 states have primary dates later than April 28. … Of the 650 registered voters polled, 307 were registered Democrats. Of them, a majority of people (52%) say they are still undecided when it comes to who they plan to vote for in the Democratic presidential primary. Former Vice President Joe Biden still has the most interest among candidates with 17 percent of Democrats polled saying they would vote for him… Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren (9%) and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg (8%) both polled ahead of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders at 6 percent.”



Team Bernie want him to use heart attack to show personal side - WaPo: “Prominent friends and supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) say he should cut back on his relentless campaign pace and speak openly about his recent heart attack when he returns to the campaign trail, urging a shift toward a more personal and less hectic campaign than he has run so far. The comments reflect what supporters describe as a deeply personal decision with big implications for Sanders’s candidacy: how the 78-year-old democratic socialist, viewed by many of his backers as the leader of a movement, should proceed following a health scare that has sidelined him for days and raised questions about whether he can — or should — maintain the punishing demands of a presidential campaign. … Sanders supporters privately acknowledge concern that the heart attack could give voters second thoughts about the candidate, who would be the oldest president in history if elected.”



Klobuchar raises $4.8 million - Politico: “Democrat Amy Klobuchar raised $4.8 million between July and the end of September, her campaign announced Monday, a total that bested the Minnesota Senator’s haul from the previous quarter by $1 million. Klobuchar’s third-quarter fundraising was a fraction of the amount raised by top Democratic candidates such as Bernie Sanders, who raised the most of any candidate in the field, $25.3 million. But it is likely enough to keep Klobuchar’s campaign functioning as she attempts to secure more support. Klobuchar has qualified for the October Democratic debate and has crossed the donor threshold for the November debate, giving her opportunities to keep making the case for her presidential bid to a national audience.”



THE RULEBOOK: KEEP IT TOGETHER, PEOPLE

“If, on the other hand, they find us either destitute of an effectual government (each State doing right or wrong, as to its rulers may seem convenient), or split into three or four independent and probably discordant republics or confederacies … what a poor, pitiful figure will America make in their eyes!” – John Jay, Federalist No. 4



TIME OUT: CONSEQUENTIAL COW

History: “On October 8, 1871, flames spark in the Chicago barn of Patrick and Catherine O’Leary, igniting a two-day blaze that kills between 200 and 300 people, destroys 17,450 buildings, leaves 100,000 homeless and causes an estimated $200 million (in 1871 dollars; $3 billion in 2007 dollars) in damages. Legend has it that a cow kicked over a lantern in the O’Leary barn and started the fire, but other theories hold that humans or even a comet may have been responsible for the event that left four square miles of the Windy City, including its business district, in ruins. Dry weather and an abundance of wooden buildings, streets and sidewalks made Chicago vulnerable to fire. …Despite the fire’s devastation, much of Chicago’s physical infrastructure, including its water, sewage and transportation systems, remained intact. Reconstruction efforts began quickly and spurred great economic development and population growth, as architects laid the foundation for a modern city featuring the world’s first skyscrapers.”

SUPPORT FOR IMPEACHMENT CLIMBING

WaPo: “A majority of Americans say they endorse the decision by House Democrats to begin an impeachment inquiry of President Trump, and nearly half of all adults also say the House should take the additional step and recommend that the president be removed from office, according to a Washington Post-Schar School poll. … The poll finds that, by a margin of 58 percent to 38 percent, Americans say the House was correct to undertake the inquiry. ... More than 8 in 10 Democrats endorse the inquiry and nearly 8 in 10 favor a vote to recommend that Trump be removed from office. Among Republicans, roughly 7 in 10 do not support the inquiry but almost 3 in 10 do, and almost one-fifth of Republicans say they favor a vote recommending his removal. Among the critical voting bloc of independents, support for the impeachment inquiry hits 57 percent, with 49 percent saying the House should vote to remove Trump from office.”



Trump digs in - NYT: “The Trump administration directed a top American diplomat involved in its pressure campaign on Ukraine not to appear Tuesday morning for a scheduled interview in the House’s impeachment inquiry. The decision to block Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, from speaking with investigators for three House committees is certain to provoke an immediate conflict with potentially profound consequences for the White House and President Trump. House Democrats have repeatedly warned that if the administration tries to interfere with their investigation, it will be construed as obstruction, a charge they see as potentially worthy of impeachment. Democrats from the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees did not immediately respond on Tuesday.”



Graham offers Giuliani a stage to fight back - Fox News: “Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has offered President Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, a chance to come before lawmakers to detail his allegations about former Vice President Joe Biden and his dealings with Ukraine. ‘Have heard on numerous occasions disturbing allegations by [Giuliani] about corruption in Ukraine and the many improprieties surrounding the firing of former Prosecutor-General Viktor Shokin,’ Graham said Tuesday on Twitter. ‘Therefore I will offer to Mr. Giuliani the opportunity to come before the Senate Judiciary Committee to inform the committee of his concerns.’ Giuliani told Fox News on Tuesday he intends to testify, but needs to go over the offer with the other attorneys involved to determine whether they could sort out issues regarding attorney-client privilege and executive privilege.”



House Dems try to keep whistleblower secret - WaPo: “House Democrats are weighing extraordinary steps to secure testimony from a whistleblower whose complaint prompted their impeachment inquiry, masking his identity to prevent President Trump’s congressional allies from exposing the individual, according to three officials familiar with the deliberations. The steps under consideration include having the whistleblower testify from a remote location and obscuring the individual’s appearance and voice, these officials said. The efforts reflect Democrats’ deepening distrust of their GOP colleagues, whom they see as fully invested in defending a president who has attacked the whistleblower’s credibility and demanded absolute loyalty from Republicans. ‘There are lots of different protocols and procedures we’re looking into to find out what works and doesn’t work to protect the identity of the whistleblower,’ said a person familiar with the talks.”



Perry under pressure - Politico: “Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Monday denied that he pressed the Ukrainian government to put two U.S. businessmen on the board of the state energy company or that he was planning to leave the Trump administration. … Perry acknowledged making the recommendations to Ukraine’s state-owned natural gas company Naftogaz, but said he did so only at the request of that country’s government. He also said it was ‘true’ that he had pressed President Donald Trump to make the July call to Zelensky that is at the center of the impeachment inquiry. … Perry also denied he was planning to step down from his position, which POLITICO, the New York Times and Washington Post reported last week. ‘I’m here. I’m serving. They’ve been writing the story that I was leaving the Department of Energy for at least nine months now.’”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Chris, you sounded like a Democrat politician when you dodged a direct answer to Meredith Shoemaker’s question [on Monday]. She did not ask you what you thought of President Trump’s call with the Ukrainian President. She asked you very directly ‘what law did President Trump break?’ With the impeachment standard being ‘high crimes and misdemeanors,’ Meredith’s question gets to the heart of the matter. Can I give you second chance here? No Democrat talking points, please. What law?” – Kevin Cook, Farmers Branch, Texas



[Ed. note: So I gather you’re not a Democrat, Mr. Cook! The question of a specific criminal statue here isn’t relevant. Congress’ power to impeach and remove is pretty much unlimited. Andrew Johnson’s impeachment, for example, rested on 11 articles, some relating to specific crimes, but check out the 10th and 11th articles here. How about alleging that Johnson acted “to bring into disgrace, ridicule, hatred, contempt and reproach” on Congress? It’s not a crime to ridicule Congress, even for the president. But Congress was asserting that Johnson’s efforts to undermine Congress was a breach of his duties under the constitutional. Or think of a hypothetical. What if a president laid up dead drunk every day at the White House or was posting top secret documents on Instagram? Neither of those things would be illegal for the president to do, but both would surely doubt in his or her impeachment. These are political, not legal considerations. Democrats in this case are focusing on the president seeking help from a foreign power against a political opponent, and the Constitution gives them more than enough room to do so.]



“At the risk of being accused of being ‘too cute by a half,’ until Joe Biden receives the Democratic nomination, can he really be considered a ‘political opponent’ for the purpose of prohibiting the President from asking for investigative assistance from a foreign government? Full disclosure – I am a supporter of President Trump.” – Tim Kasparek, Goodyear, Ariz.

SF Gate: “Reptile breeder Brian Gundy had just given a talk and animal presentation Saturday at the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Library in downtown San Jose. While going to get his car parked on the second level of the Fourth and San Fernando Street garage about 4:30 p.m., he left his snakes and lizards in boxes and a bag in a no-parking zone. When he returned for his critters, he made a grim discovery. ‘As I was loading up my gear, I realized the bag that had my four pythons and blue skink lizard inside was gone and they were just there seconds ago,’ Gundy told KTVU Fox 2. Gundy had seen several people walk by his equipment, so he ran after them but couldn't catch up. He told KTVU he doesn't think they knew what was inside. … The stolen animals were worth approximately $5,000, according to the reptile breeder.”

* A national Quinnipiac poll released yesterday found Elizabeth Warren holding onto her narrow lead over Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic nomination, 29% to 26%. Bernie Sanders was third with 16%, and no other candidate topped 5%.

* The same poll found Biden leading Donald Trump in a hypothetical general election match-up by 11 points (51% to 40%), Warren leading Trump by eight points (49% to 41%), and Sanders leading him by seven points (49% to 42%).

* Presidential hopeful Andrew Yang was at 3% in the Quinnipiac poll, which means he’s now the eighth candidate to qualify for the Democrats’ presidential primary debate in November.

* On a related note, we learned yesterday that MSNBC and the Washington Post will co-host the fifth Democratic presidential primary debate on Nov. 20 in Georgia. As NBC News’ report on this added, “The specific location, venue, format and moderators will be announced at a later date.”

* With just a few days remaining ahead of Louisiana’s first round of balloting in the state’s gubernatorial race, the latest Emerson poll found Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) leading the field with 48% – which is awfully close to the 50% threshold he’d need to avoid a runoff and serve a second term. Eddie Rispone (R) was second in the poll with 25%, followed by Ralph Abraham (R) at 19%.

* At home in Vermont yesterday, Bernie Sanders told reporters that in the wake of his heart attack that he’ll have to “change the nature of the campaign a bit.” The independent senator suggested the shift will mean holding fewer campaign events.

* Because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is nothing if not shameless, his re-election campaign yesterday began promoting a Politico article pointing to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao’s alleged favoritism for Kentucky. Chao, of course, is McConnell’s wife. “Mitch McConnell is a Kentucky Asset,” the senator’s team wrote in a tweet highlighting the report.

* Probate judge Steven Reed (D) made history yesterday, becoming the first African-American mayor of Montgomery, Alabama.

* And Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D) has thrown her endorsement to Joe Biden, looking past her fellow California senator, Kamala Harris. Feinstein had previously indicated support for Biden in January, but that was before most of the Democratic candidates had formally launched their campaigns. Biden now has five endorsements from sitting U.S. senators, more than any other Democratic candidate."

Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has secured nearly $20 million to fund measures that help California prevent millions of gallons of Tijuana’s raw sewage from flowing into San Diego, according to a Wednesday report.

The preventive measures were laid out in three Senate funding bills which appropriate $19.5 million for the EPA to address the sewage flows, direct the secretary of state to create a plan that addresses their impact, and directs U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to submit a report on its efforts to protect its agents from the flows, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported.

San Diego County has been dealing with raw sewage flows from Tijuana for decades. Last year, a pipe across the border in Mexico broke, causing millions of gallons of sewage to flow into the Tijuana River and, eventually, the Pacific Ocean, impacting California coastal areas.

“It’s absolutely outrageous and unacceptable,” Imperial Beach Mayor Serge Dedina told reporters last December. “The biggest issues that we’re concerned about is this happens again and again and then the Mexican government doesn’t notify anybody. They sort of cover it up and they notify us at the last minute and then our kids are at risk of swimming in sewage.”

DIANNE FEINSTEIN ENDORSES JOE BIDEN’S PRESIDENTIAL BID IN SNUB TO KAMALA HARRIS

Imperial Beach, located just across the border from Mexico, sued the federal government last year, claiming its failure to stop the flows was a violation of the Clean Water Act.

“More concrete action must be taken to stop this decades-long problem,” Feinstein said in a statement. “Raw sewage overflows and other pollution from Mexico along the Tijuana River that jeopardize human health are unacceptable.”

Steven Reed, who became Montgomery County’s first African-American probate judge in 2012, won about 67 percent of the vote in a nonpartisan runoff election, according to unofficial results released Tuesday night.

Reed defeated David Woods, a white television station owner, after the two earned the most votes in a 12-person election in August, the New York Times reported. He will replace the current mayor of Montgomery, Todd Strange, who chose not to run for reelection after a decade in office, the Montgomery Advertiser reported. Reed will be sworn in Nov. 12.

""This election has never been about me,"" Reed said in his victory speech. ""This election has never been about just my ideas. It's been about all the hopes and dreams we have as individuals and collectively in this city.""

""Montgomery is a city with limitless potential, a city that has no limits outside of our imagination,"" Reed continued. ""The only thing that can hold us back is our fears. When we come together there's nothing that we can't accomplish. ""

In his concession speech, Woods said: “We’re just going to go forward and try to support Steven Reed as mayor. And I just want to encourage everyone to try to continue to work together to bring Montgomery as a unified city. A unified Montgomery is a lot stronger than a divided Montgomery.”

Montgomery has historically been a hotbed for racial tension. Southern delegates gathered in Montgomery in 1861 to vote to form the Confederacy. The city is also home to the church where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. organized the Montgomery bus boycott, in which Rosa Parks became a symbol of the 1960s civil rights movement.

Reed was endorsed by Democratic 2020 hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox, Montgomery's WSFA-TV reported. His father, Joe Reed, is the longtime leader of the black caucus of the Alabama Democratic Party.

The freshman New York congresswoman traveled to Copenhagen for a meeting with the C40, a group of 94 mayors led by Los Angeles' Mayor Eric Garcetti -- who was just announced as the group's new chair. The plan aims to halve carbon emissions by 2030 through cleaner alternatives and the ""strictest possible building codes."" It also seeks to achieve the Paris Climate Agreement's goal of keeping warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Besides Garcetti, mayors from at least five U.S. cities released statements supporting the global adoption of Ocasio-Cortez's climate framework. Those included New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio; Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan; Austin, Texas, Mayor Steve Adler; Portland, Ore., Mayor Ted Wheeler; and Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney.

“I am inspired by this coalition and the commitments made for a global Green New Deal. If we work to join forces globally, we will be able to defeat our greatest threat and realize our greatest opportunity,"" said Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

The C40 group echoed months of Ocasio-Cortez's rhetoric, warning of an impending ""climate emergency"" and blaming ""a minority of very powerful, science-denying governments, representing the interests of the fossil-fuel industry"" for inaction.

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who also serves as C40's board president, portrayed the commitment as a way to improve public health and drive economic growth.

“Together, C40 cities have taken thousands of successful actions to reduce carbon emissions, and they are proving how fighting climate change helps drive economic growth and improve public health. There is no time to waste,"" he said.

DOOMSDAYS THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN: THINK TANK COMPILES DECADES' WORTH OF DIRE CLIMATE PREDICTIONS

Wednesday's news appeared to be a flagrant rebuke of the Trump administration's approach to foreign policy on climate change. The president controversially said he would rescind the U.S.'s support for the Paris Climate Agreement, citing economic impacts on cities like Pittsburgh.

It was also the latest indication that high-ranking officials were willing to embrace Ocasio-Cortez's ambitious vision for tackling climate change. A slew of 2020 Democratic candidates endorsed the framework of her ""Green New Deal"" while laying out multitrillion-dollar plans that involved substantial regulation.

Conservatives have balked at the plan as a thinly veiled attempt to bring socialism to the United States. The price tag alone could be problematic for Democrats in the 2020 election. Conservative estimates have projected the ""Green New Deal"" would cost trillions, inflict a heavy toll on economic growth and burden swing-state voters.

Advocates say that the alternative would be worse. ""We need to start getting comfortable with how extreme the problem is,"" Ocasio-Cortez previously said, ""because only until we accept ... how bad climate change is and how bad it can be for our children's lives, are we going to be comfortable pursuing really big solutions."""

Biden stays on top in the race with 32 percent support among primary voters, up 3 points since September. He’s followed by Elizabeth Warren at 22 percent -- that’s up 6 points and a new high for her. Bernie Sanders is at 17 percent, down 1 point since last month.

While Biden’s support has stayed between 29-35 percent since March, his current 10-point advantage is about half of his 19-point lead in June.

The rundown continues with Kamala Harris at 5 percent, Pete Buttigieg at 4 percent, Beto O’Rourke at 3 percent, and Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang each at 2 percent. Michael Bennet, Julian Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Tim Ryan, Tom Steyer, and Marianne Williamson receive 1 percent apiece.

CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS

Biden retains top billing with strong support among non-whites, voters over age 45, and moderates/conservatives. Warren has strengthened her position by increasing support among suburban voters, very liberals, and men.

When Democratic primary voters’ first and second choice preferences are considered together, Biden and Warren tie at 45 percent support, Sanders is at 34 percent, Harris 15 percent and Buttigieg 13 percent.

President Trump’s allegations about improper actions by Biden and his son have so far failed to chip away at Biden’s support in the primary race -- and Democratic primary voters continue to believe the former vice president is the candidate best equipped to beat Trump in 2020: 43 percent feel that way, up from 42 percent last month. Nineteen percent think Warren has the best chance to oust Trump and 15 percent say Sanders.

At the same time, the poll finds the three top Democratic candidates with sizable leads over the president in potential head-to-head matchups.

The poll, released Thursday, shows Biden (50-40 percent) and Warren (50-40 percent) both top Trump by 10 points, and Sanders is up by 9 (49-40 percent). This marks the first time all three Democrats have held a lead outside the poll’s margin of error. Last month, Biden was up by 14 points, Warren by 6 and Sanders by 8.

“If Warren continues to poll as strongly against Trump as the former vice president, it makes it increasingly difficult for the Biden team to keep making the argument he is the most electable candidate,” says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican Daron Shaw.

The impeachment inquiry hasn’t caused any real shifts in the ballot test, as Trump’s support in the two-way matchups has been between 37-42 percent all year. However, the poll finds an 8-point shift since last month in the number expecting Trump will be re-elected. In September, more thought he would win by a 6-point margin and now more expect he won’t by 2 points.

And while most Republican primary voters want to keep Trump as their party’s nominee, nearly one in five, 17 percent, would like to see someone else run.

“So far, Trump has been able to keep his Republican base on board,” says Shaw. “If the percentage opposing his re-nomination creeps into the 20s, that would be a troubling sign.”

Meanwhile, voters continue to believe Donald Trump is dishonest. Sixty-three percent say that -- far more than the 35 percent who think he is honest and trustworthy. By the way, that’s the same number who said Trump was honest before he won the 2016 election.

Vice President Mike Pence does a bit better than his boss, although not by much: 39 percent say he’s honest and 54 percent say dishonest.

On the other side, each of the top three Democratic candidates receives positive ratings on this measure. Sanders performs best with 59 percent saying he is honest and trustworthy (36 percent disagree). Fifty percent think Warren is honest vs. 44 percent dishonest, and for Biden voters split 48-47 percent.

Among Democrats, 87 percent think Sanders is honest and trustworthy, while 81 percent feel that way about Warren and 75 percent Biden. Seventy-three percent of Republicans say Trump is honest.

Currently, 51 percent of voters have a favorable opinion of Sanders, while 43 percent view him negatively. That puts him in positive territory by 8 points. More view Warren positively by 7 points (46 favorable vs. 39 unfavorable) and Biden by 6 (50 favorable vs. 44 unfavorable).

The ratings are closer to even for Buttigieg (+3 points), Yang (+3), Booker (-2), Harris (-3) and O’Rourke (-4). They each also have large numbers who have never heard of them or have no opinion of them. For example, 43 percent of voters are unable to rate Yang, while 36 percent can’t rate Buttigieg and 32 percent can’t rate Booker.

Voters view Trump more negatively than positively by 13 points (43-56). His personal favorable rating was underwater by 22 points in the days leading up to the 2016 election (38-60).

Twice as many primary voters say Trump’s allegations make them more likely to vote for Biden (21 percent more vs. 10 percent less), while twice as many say health concerns make them less (31 percent) rather than more likely (15 percent) to vote for Sanders in the primary.

Sanders is off the campaign trail since suffering a heart attack October 3. He’s 78 years old, while Biden is 76, Trump is 73, and Warren is 70.

Conducted October 6-8, 2019 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,003 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones.

A standout moment of the June 27 Democratic primary debate was that of all the candidates on the stage raising their hands, signifying support for government health care plans including “undocumented” immigrants.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SHOULD GET HEALTH CARE, SAY DEMS IN NIGHT 2 DEBATE

Republicans and the White House have seized on that moment, with President Trump declaring it “the end of the race.”

But with the campaign definitely not over, and a number of frontrunners now backing the policy, more attention is turning to how much it could cost to give millions of illegal immigrants health insurance. On Thursday, the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), a policy group that advocates for lower levels of immigration overall, published a study finding that the cost could be up to $23 billion a year.

While candidates have not necessarily gone into detail about their plans, CIS cites an Atlantic survey that found that Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; and former Housing Secretary Julian Castro would all provide “full benefits” to those in the country illegally.

The CIS study estimated that 4.9 million illegal immigrants have incomes below 400 percent of the poverty line and also do not have insurance -- meaning they have incomes low enough to receive coverage via either Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act -- also known to many, particularly critics, as ObamaCare.

The study estimates that if all income-eligible, uninsured illegal immigrants received subsidies under the ACA, then the cost to insure would be $22.6 billion, but with “likely enrollment” of 46 percent, the total cost would be perhaps $10.4 billion a year. It predicts that the average cost of a subsidized premium would be $4,637.

If a mixed approach of ACA subsidies and Medicaid enrollment were used, the cost would dip to $19.6 billion with 100 percent enrollment, and $10.7 billion assuming “likely enrollment.”

These numbers could change significantly if a more overarching health care overhaul is passed by a future Democratic White House and Congress.

“Numbers aside, the fact that presidential candidates are advocating spending billions of dollars on people who are in the country illegally is significant in its own right,” the report concludes. “It suggests that allowing in large numbers of less-educated workers will inevitably generate significant political pressure to provide them access to social programs.”

Extending health care to illegal immigrants could, however, be only one part of the cost to taxpayers of more generous social policies being pushed by Democrats.

AOC PUSHES NATIONAL RENT CONTROL, WELFARE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN LATEST MASSIVE PROPOSAL

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who was an early champion of left-favored policies now finding their way into 2020 Democratic platforms, recently introduced a new package of policies known as the “Just Society.”

Among those bills is “The Embrace Act,” which would allow illegal immigrants to claim the same welfare benefits as U.S. citizens and those in the country legally.

CLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM

""Notwithstanding any other provision of law ... an individual who is an alien (without regard to the immigration status of that alien) may not be denied any federal public benefit solely on the basis of the individual’s immigration status,” the bill reads.

The bill defines a federal public benefit as: “any grant, contract, loan, professional license or commercial license provided by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States; and ... any retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or assisted housing, post-secondary education, food assistance, unemployment benefit,or any other similar benefit for which payments or assistance are provided to an individual, household, or family eligibility unit by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States.”"

TIME FOR A RE-PETE?

What’s so great about fourth place?



If you’re South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, quite a lot actually.



Readers have no doubt been watching Elizabeth Warren’s steady gains against front-runner Joe Biden in recent weeks. She is now just 2.4 points behind Biden in our Democratic 2020 Power Ranking. As Biden continues to struggle with the enhanced scrutiny on his family’s buck raking facilitated by Biden’s proximity to power, we expect his troubles to continue.



While Democrats are loath to publically agree with President Trump, the facts of the case of Trump’s likely impeachment reinforce Biden’s strongest negatives: That he has been around too long and is too much of a swamp creature.



We know Biden supporters are preparing to spend millions to prop up the former Delaware senator in his third presidential quest, but it is hard to imagine that Biden could persist for long in second place.



When electability is your cri de coeur it’s hard to keep voters around when you don’t look so electable.



This is good news for Warren, no doubt. But she had better be worried that it is good news come too soon. As Biden is currently experiencing, being the frontrunner is not all aviator sunglasses and waffle cones.



Warren has long enjoyed kid-glove treatment from the press, with relatively little scrutiny on her very ambitious policy proposals. She has also gotten a couple of mulligans on biographical boo-boos. That won’t last if she gets out in front. The steady diet of opposition research that will fill reporters’ inboxes will see to that.



So cast your eyes down the list. You can skip over poor Bernie Sanders who is struggling not just with his own health issues, but with the tragic loss of his daughter-in-law. The Vermont senator has said he will scale back his campaigning, and is already 10 points behind Warren and falling.



Buttigieg, though, has been climbing. Perhaps the beneficiary of the unraveling of California Sen. Kamala Harris’ misbegotten campaign or perhaps some Biden skeptics defecting, Buttigieg is a man on the move.



Certainly Sens. Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar are hoping that they would see their boats lifted by the melting of Biden’s iceberg, but Buttigieg may have the best case to make.



His fundraising haul in the third quarter says that he will have the resources to go the distance and his moderate-sounding appeal to voters would position him nicely to pick up the business-friendly Democratic donors who are terrified of either a Warren defeat or victory.



Whether Buttigieg can capitalize on the opportunity will depend on his ability to go toe-to-toe with Warren. In the first Buttigieg craze, he wasn’t able to translate interest into hard support. In a second go-around he’d have to play for keeps.



SANDERS TO SCALE BACK CAMPAIGN AFTER HEART SURGERY

WaPo: “[Bernie Sanders] visited a cardiologist Tuesday morning, and when he returned, he told reporters, ‘We’re gonna change the nature of the campaign a bit.’ ‘Probably not doing four rallies a day,’ said Sanders, who had adopted a more furious campaign schedule than many of his much younger opponents. Sanders, who has committed to releasing his medical records before the first primary votes but has not yet done so, said Tuesday he would provide the information at ‘the appropriate time.’ Former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) — fellow septuagenarians who join Sanders at the top of most polls — have also committed to releasing their medical records.”



Daughter-in-law, 46, killed by rare cancer - USA Today: “The daughter-in-law of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has died, shortly after being diagnosed with cancer. Rainè Riggs was 46. The Lee & Martin Funeral Home in Burgettstown, Pennsylvania, says Riggs died Saturday, the day Sanders returned to Vermont after suffering a heart attack. Her obituary said she was diagnosed with neuroendocrine cancer. Riggs, a neuropsychologist, was married to Levi Sanders, who ran unsuccessfully for a New Hampshire congressional seat in 2018. Riggs' obituary says she met Levi Sanders while the two worked at an emergency food shelter in Vermont. The obituary said Riggs was the director of behavioral medicine at Dartmouth Medical School for several years, and she started the Palliative Care Department for Dartmouth Medical Center. She also owned Riggs Geriatric Psychology in Windsor, Vermont. Riggs and Sanders had three children.”



Dianne Feinstein endorses Biden, snubs Harris - Fox News: “Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., announced Tuesday she is endorsing former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary -- choosing her former longtime Senate colleague over Kamala Harris, her fellow California Democratic senator. Feinstein’s endorsement, the first major Democratic endorsement by a top legislator this campaign season, comes as Biden has been losing ground in the polls in the wake of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump and a series of high-profile gaffes while on the stump. But the longtime California senator praised the former vice president for his long tenure in Washington and his work on gun control. ‘I’ve worked closely with Vice President Biden and I’ve seen firsthand his legislative ability, his statesmanship, and most importantly his moral fortitude,’ Feinstein said in a statement.”

TIME OUT: ‘YESTERDAY’ CAME SUDDENLY

On this day in 1965, The Beatles’ “Yesterday” began its month-long reign as the top single in the U.S. The song, Paul McCartney’s masterwork, started as a dream. The Telegraph [U.K.]: “As McCartney explained in 1980: ‘I woke up with a lovely tune in my head. I thought, 'That’s great, I wonder what that is?' There was an upright piano next to me, to the right of the bed by the window. I got out of bed, sat at the piano, found G, found F sharp minor 7th – and that leads you through then to B to E minor, and finally back to E. It all leads forward logically. I liked the melody a lot but because I’d dreamed it I couldn’t believe I’d written it. I thought, ‘No, I’ve never written like this before.’ But I had the tune, which was the most magic thing.’ McCartney was living in Wimpole Street, London, at the time, at the family home of Jane Asher, who he was dating at the time.”

TRUMP’S IMPEACHMENT PLAN: BURN DOWN THE HOUSE

Axios: “President Trump, while nervous about the historic stain of impeachment, is throwing everything he has into this fight: refusing all cooperation, running ads to profit politically, and torching every person who stands in opposition to him. When it all boils down, Trump really only trusts his own instincts. And his instincts here are the same as they were with the Mueller investigation: Fight like hell. No nuance or apology — not a hint of it. Turn the leader of the investigation (in this case, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff) into a conservative media villain. Condemn Trump enemies in the most incendiary and exaggerated language possible (treason, traitors, coup, etc.). Compared to the Mueller investigation, the Ukraine phone call appears to have more resonance with the general public. Republicans close to leadership and the White House tell Axios they're concerned by trend lines in a Washington Post poll showing 49% of Americans think Trump should be removed from office.”



Partisan lines holding - NBC News: “A majority of Americans say the allegations that President Donald Trump asked a foreign leader to investigate 2020 rival Joe Biden are serious and need to be fully investigated, and they also believe the president hasn’t been honest and truthful about his actions. Still, the public is divided – largely along partisan lines – on whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office, with 43 percent supporting his removal given what they know today, versus 49 percent who oppose it. … According to the poll, 47 percent of Americans believe the allegations that Trump requested Ukraine’s president to look into the Bidens are either ‘quite serious’ or ‘extremely serious.’ That includes 73 percent of Democrats, 55 percent of independents and even 21 percent of Republicans. By contrast, a combined 28 percent dismiss the allegations as either being not serious or false and without merit. Twenty-five percent of respondents say they don’t have an opinion or are unsure.”



Q Poll: Support for impeachment inquiry steady - Quinnipiac University: “After another week with impeachment in the news, registered voters nationwide are still divided on impeaching and removing President Trump from office, with 45 percent saying he should be impeached and removed and 49 percent opposing the idea, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. This compares to last week's poll, in which voters were evenly split on impeaching and removing the president 47 - 47 percent. In a poll released on September 25, before any major news about impeachment, voters were clearly against impeachment 37 - 57 percent. While nearly half of voters do not currently back impeachment, a majority of voters do still approve 53 - 43 percent of the impeachment inquiry being conducted by the U.S. House of Representatives in order to determine whether or not to bring impeachment charges against the president. A week ago, voters approved of the inquiry 52 - 45 percent.”



Gowdy joins Team Trump - Bloomberg: “Donald Trump has enlisted former Representative Trey Gowdy to work with the White House team combating the U.S. House’s impeachment inquiry into the president, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Gowdy, a former prosecutor from South Carolina, is not formally joining the White House staff, according to the people. He was at the White House on Tuesday, according to one person who saw him there, before an eight-page letter was issued to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declaring that Trump and the administration wouldn’t participate in the impeachment inquiry.”



What will become of Mick Mulvaney? - The Atlantic: “[Mick] Mulvaney’s uncertain status says something about Trump’s mind-set. In the face of this latest peril, and nearly 1,000 days into his tenure, he still hasn’t settled on how the West Wing should run. Confronting the impeachment threat is a West Wing staff that Trump has largely neutered. Aides have been left guessing about who’s coming and going, much less what they’re supposed to say about accusations that Trump pressured Ukraine to ferret out dirt on his potential 2020 rival Joe Biden. In the two weeks since the whistle-blower complaint was released to the public, the White House still hasn’t articulated a clear legal, political, or communications strategy needed to withstand impeachment and keep Trump’s Republican support from eroding.”



Watergate lessons for GOP - FiveThirtyEight: “One complicating factor here is that if Republicans were to abandon Trump, history does not suggest that Trump loyalists would easily forgive them for joining the Democrats’ impeachment effort. Even though most Americans did eventually support removing [Richard] Nixon from office, Republican voters were mostly not part of that consensus. Days before he resigned, a Gallup poll found that only 31 percent of Republicans thought Nixon should no longer be president. And some of those supporters deeply resented their representatives for their role in ousting Nixon, which may even have contributed to the Democratic landslide in the 1974 midterm elections.”



SENATE GOP CAMPAIGN ARM RAISES RECORD CASH

WashEx: “The committee tasked with electing Republican senators amid the impeachment battle will report raising $47.7 million so far this year, an amount that is already greater than ever raised before in the year prior to an election year. The National Republican Senatorial Committee is crucial to protecting vulnerable incumbents like Susan Collins of Maine, Cory Gardner of Colorado, and Martha McSally of Arizona. In the three-month period ending Sept. 30, the NRSC raised roughly $13.1 million, including approximately $5 million in September — and made the last payment on a $17 million debt left over from the midterm elections. The NRSC shared these figures with the Washington Examiner on Tuesday, ahead of its upcoming Federal Election Commission filing. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is trying maintain Republican control of the Senate. Currently there are 53 GOP senators in the conference.”



Planned Parenthood preps massive 2020 spending - Fox News: “Planned Parenthood, the behemoth nonprofit organization that provides reproductive health care and is the nation’s largest abortion provider, says it’s making a major investment in the 2020 elections. Planned Parenthood’s political wings – which fight for legal protections for abortion – announced Wednesday that they’ll spend $45 million backing candidates who support abortion rights in elections next year ranging from the state house level to the White House. … The group says its top priority in 2020 is to defeat and unseat President Trump. Other priorities include helping Democrats retake control of the GOP-controlled Senate and holding the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. The group will target roughly 5 million voters across the country, with the spotlight on nine key swing states: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.”



Bevin looks to impeachment backlash to hold on in Kentucky - RCP: “[Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin] has pressed the pending impeachment of President Trump into his own Kentucky reelection effort. Standing outside the governor’s mansion on Friday, Bevin tied his fate to Trump’s by condemning impeachment as ‘an absolute travesty’ and calling on his Democratic opponent, state Attorney General Andy Beshear, to answer a ‘fundamental question’: Will Beshear support or oppose forcing the president from office? The Democrat doesn’t want to answer, and the ensuing drama in a 2019 race could draw a rough sketch of the electoral implications of impeachment in 2020.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I appreciate Ellen DeGeneres’ statement about her friendship with former President George W. Bush. How have we reached this point where we can’t be friends with, or at least be civil to, those who hold a different viewpoint? … The father of Christian Rock, Larry Norman, once told a joke about witnessing to people and the ‘religious’ terminology that is often used. In the story, the Christian becomes frustrated at the end of a conversation he’s been having with a friend because the friend doesn’t understand the terms justification, sanctification, or being saved. In frustration he shouts, ‘I’m trying to tell you the Good News!’ His friend asks, ‘What’s that?’ The Christian responds, ‘You’re going to Hell!’ To which his friend replies, ‘Well, what’s the bad news?’ The point of recounting that is to state that if we hold firm convictions, that’s fine, but we need to convey them in a loving and respectful way. Our actions speak louder than our words. If we’re not mindful of that, we risk offending the person, or worse, losing the opportunity for dialogue that we seek with the other person. I believe that in matters of faith especially, that would be a bad thing. As always, I wish you and your family God’s richest blessings!” – Paul Schnier, Shoreham, N.Y.



[Ed. note: Amen, Mr. Schnier! That goes for politics, too. Persuasion leads to consensus, which leads to durable reforms. Division leads to government by plurality, which leads to lurching. Blessings to you and yours, too.]



“I fully understand your point today about the legal (‘shoot someone on 5th Ave’) and political differences (‘posting TS documents on IG’) when viewing Congress' vested powers to impeach a sitting President. Hopefully this third time is a charm. What about this [Contributions and donations by foreign nationals.] I believe this is what your colleague Judge [Andrew Napolitano] has been referencing in his argument on recent articles and TV shows. … The difference between this and the Mueller/Russia case was that this bordered on bribery in ‘bribes, high crimes and misdemeanors.’ Mueller's case was weak and bordered on emotion. This is a stronger case with a self-admitted crime, No? An independent voter's perspective.” – Jai Suresh, Fremont, Calif.



[Ed. note: I hear you, Mr. Suresh. But, no matter which side you take here, the question of impeachment still isn’t about the law. The question is political, or at best, moral. It is what the members of the House (and the constituents they represent) say it is. Efforts to find specific criminal charges miss the point of the endeavor.]

EAU DE BIG BOY

AP: “An Ohio homeowner never envisioned becoming semi-famous because of a goat butting its way into her home and taking a nap in her bathroom. … The break-in happened Friday when an escaped male goat from a farm several miles away repeatedly butted against a sliding glass door... [Jennifer Keathley’s] 18-year-old son, Logan, discovered the billy goat in the bathroom when he returned home Friday afternoon from school to find the family’s agitated German Shepherd in the driveway, broken glass on the back porch and the house reeking. … Two Ashland County Sheriff’s deputies unsuccessfully tried to coax the goat, named Big Boy, out of the home with carrots, a dog bone and grass. They eventually grabbed him by the horns and dragged him outside… The Keathleys learned their home insurance policy covers damage from bears and deer but not goats. … Despite applications of carpet deodorant and urine neutralizer, she said the odor from Big Boy’s urine still lingers.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“Or more prosaically, the catastrophe that awaits everyone from a single false move, wrong turn, fatal encounter. Every life has such a moment. What distinguishes us is whether — and how — we ever come back.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the National Review on Aug. 17, 2007.

FOX News Channel (FNC) will present a special live “Town Hall America with Harris Faulkner: Police Emergency” on Sunday, October 27th at 8PM/ET at the FOX News headquarters in New York City. Moderated by Outnumbered Overtime anchor Harris Faulkner, the town hall will be presented in front of a live studio audience comprised of members connected to the police community and focus on the growing dangers law enforcement officials are facing across the country.

Throughout the evening, Faulkner will highlight discussions surrounding recent acts of threats and violence against police officers, in addition to featuring interviews with New York State Assemblyman Mike LiPetri (R), Chicago community activist Andrew Holmes, and Fraternal Order of Police Vice President Joe Gamaldi, among others. Faulkner will also be joined by injured police officers and their families to share their stories. Topics to be discussed will include the impact of rhetoric in America, the suicide crisis among police officers, and the surge of violence against men and women in law enforcement.

Faulkner contributed to the network’s midterm election coverage for the first time in 2018, and held a town hall in Phoenix, Arizona to focus on the immigration debate. Kicking off 2020 presidential election coverage, Harris anchored a town hall in Urbandale, Iowa to analyze the hot button issues that matter to voters most ahead of the election. Faulkner is the author of the New York Times bestseller “9 Rules of Engagement: A Military Brat’s Guide to Life and Success.”

Appearing on ""Outnumbered: Overtime"" with host Harris Faulkner, Fleischer said that House Democrats are attempting to interfere with the 2020 election process by pushing a Trump impeachment through.

""I have said that what the president did was inappropriate...It's not impeachable,"" said Fleischer. ""It should be a matter that the American people settle, and that's why I think impeachment is the wrong thing on the wrong track and it represents the House Democrats interfering in the 2020 election.""

ANDY MCCARTHY: IMPEACHMENT PUSH IS A POLITICAL PROCESS 'MASQUERADING' AS A LEGAL ONE

""They don't want him to be able to run for reelection and that's not proper. This is a decision that needs to be made by the American people,"" he said.

But some Democrats are now breaking ranks with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and calling for her to hold a full-floor vote on the inquiry.

""It's appropriate because If you're going to proceed with impeachment, our Constitution's gravest power that Congress has to wield over the president, it must be fair,"" Fleischer told Faulkner, arguing that Americans are generally ""fair-minded"" and will want any impeachment process to be open and fair.

""I think the reason they're not [voting] is they know it would be a partisan vote, and they don't want to expose it just as a partisan impeachment,"" he said. ""The reason they would do it is because the arguments about fairness are starting to add up and they recognize – the American people – if there's going to be an impeachment process it needs to be a fair one.""

According to a Fox News poll released Wednesday, just over half of voters want President Trump impeached and removed from office. Fleischer said there must be public hearings, along with relevant transcripts and information.

""Secret impeachment from CIA officers is not how America operates. We operate in public,"" Fleischer explained."

GIULIANI ASSOCIATES NABBED FOR ALLEGED CAMPAIGN CRIMES

WSJ: “Two Soviet-born donors to a pro-Trump fundraising committee who helped Rudy Giuliani’s efforts to investigate Democrat Joe Biden were arrested late Wednesday on criminal charges of violating campaign finance rules, including funneling Russian money into President Trump’s campaign. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two Florida businessmen, have been under investigation by the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan, and are expected to appear in federal court in Virginia later on Thursday, the people said. Both men were born in former Soviet republics. Mr. Giuliani, President Trump’s private lawyer, identified the two men in May as his clients. Both men have donated to Republican campaigns including Mr. Trump’s, and in May 2018 gave $325,000 to the primary pro-Trump super PAC, America First Action… A Justice Department official said [Attorney General William Barr] was supportive of their work on the case, on which he was first briefed shortly after being confirmed as attorney general in February.”



Fox poll: Record support for Trump’s ouster - Fox News: “Just over half of voters want President Trump impeached and removed from office, according to a Fox News Poll released Wednesday. A new high of 51 percent wants Trump impeached and removed from office, another 4 percent want him impeached but not removed, and 40 percent oppose impeachment altogether. In July, 42 percent favored impeachment and removal, while 5 percent said impeach but don’t remove him, and 45 percent opposed impeachment.Since July, support for impeachment increased among voters of all stripes: up 11 points among Democrats, 5 points among Republicans and 3 among independents. Support also went up among some of Trump’s key constituencies, including white evangelical Christians (+5 points), white men without a college degree (+8), and rural whites (+10). Among voters in swing counties (where Hillary Clinton and Trump were within 10 points in 2016), support for impeachment increased to 52 percent, up from 42 percent in July.”



Pence to release transcripts of his Ukraine calls - AP: “Vice President Mike Pence said Wednesday he is working with the White House counsel’s office to release transcripts of his own calls with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Pence said records of his two phone conversations would help exonerate President Donald Trump of any wrongdoing. Pence was asked about releasing his transcripts and told reporters, ‘I’d have no objection to that.’ He spoke after an event in Waukee, Iowa, where he addressed supporters about the president’s trade policy. Pence said he ‘never discussed the issue of the Bidens’ with Zelenskiy. And he again defended the president, insisting that a ‘plain reading’ of the rough transcript of Trump’s call with the Ukranian leader shows ‘there was no quid pro quo.’”



Pergram: Trump team’s stonewalling speeds up Democrats’ timetable - Fox News: “Next Tuesday is the deadline for most of the House’s requests. That coincides with the day the House returns to session. [Nancy] Pelosi will take the temperature of her caucus when lawmakers return. But in some respects, Pelosi already knows the temperature. Democrats are seething over the administration failing to meet congressional demands. They think they have a robust case against the president when it comes to obstruction of Congress. Pelosi could grant the administration more time to comply. That would let the issue marinate in public for a bit – and demonstrate that Democrats aren’t hasty to impeach. But after that, the House Judiciary Committee could begin drafting articles of impeachment. Pelosi doesn’t travel roads like this unless she already knows the outcome. She doesn’t lose votes on the floor – especially something of this magnitude.”



Trump’s Syria decision affects GOP backing on impeachment - WaPo: “President Trump’s decision to suddenly withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria has angered evangelical Christian leaders and Republican hawks, cleaving his political coalition at the very moment he is trying to fortify his standing to survive the intensifying impeachment inquiry in Congress. Instead of enjoying uncontested GOP support as he plunges into a constitutional showdown with House Democrats and prepares for a bruising reelection campaign, Trump is now fighting on two fronts within his party. … The past few days have tested the bounds of Trump’s Republican support at an unusually frenzied political crossroads that has brought uncertainty for elected officials. While GOP lawmakers have been skittish about directly engaging the subject at the heart of the impeachment debate — the president’s conduct with his Ukrainian counterpart — many have felt free to loudly condemn Trump’s Syria decision, underscoring the fluidity within GOP ranks.”



The Judge’s Ruling: With Syria, Trump lives up to his campaign promise - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano explains that President Trump removing U.S. troops from Syria complies with his duty to uphold the Constitution: “Trump ran for office promising to bring the troops home. He may have made the latest decision to do so without adequate warning to his military commanders, but his decision is utterly consistent with his promises, and it is utterly in compliance with the Constitution. Now is the time for Congress -- which is largely angry at the presidential use or nonuse of the military -- to repeal both AUMFs and the War Powers Resolution and reclaim its constitutional power as the sole entity in the federal government able to declare war. Until it does, these profoundly outdated, morally ambivalent and overtly unconstitutional statutes lie in the presidential desk drawer like a loaded gun.” More here.



THE RULEBOOK: CUE ‘I’M JUST A BILL’

“The President of the United States is to have power to return a bill, which shall have passed the two branches of the legislature, for reconsideration; and the bill so returned is to become a law, if, upon that reconsideration, it be approved by two thirds of both houses.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 69



TIME OUT: ‘WHY YOU SHOULD BE EATING MORE CHEDDAR’

WSJ: “For over 150 years cheddar was the most popular cheese in the U.S. It sustained colonists and Civil War soldiers, and was the foundation for the industrial innovation of processed ‘American’ cheese. Only recently was cheddar demoted to second place in overall consumption, usurped by that ubiquitous pizza-topper, mozzarella. Though English in origin, cheddar has been part of the American experience from the very start, and today some of this country’s best cheese makers are turning out better cheddar than ever before. Cheddaring, the stacking of blocks of drained curds to extract more whey, creates a sturdy curd suited to aging. … Commodity cheddar is a publicly traded product whose destiny is frozen food, pre-shredded packs and economy supermarket wedges; specialty cheddar, made on a small scale and sold primarily at cheese counters and gourmet stores, is often preserved in wax or clothbound (wrapped in cotton cloth and rubbed with oil or lard).”

BIDEN TRIES COUNTERPUNCHING

Politico: “After calling for Donald Trump’s impeachment for the first time, Joe Biden experienced something here he rarely sees on the campaign trail: a sustained standing ovation. …[T]he former vice president’s roll-out of a swaggering, fire-breathing approach and full embrace of impeachment signaled a dramatic departure from course — a change in direction necessitated by weeks of Trump’s siege warfare. … It was his most aggressive posture to date, presenting a case that Trump could not be trusted, while positioning himself as the fighter that America needs at this moment to face off against a ‘bully’ and a ‘coward.’ … He also took a veiled shot at Elizabeth Warren, who has overtaken Biden in recent national polls and whose campaign mantra is centered on her dozens of policy plans. … Biden’s shift toward a harsher tone and his evolution on impeachment was born out of circumstance, necessity and personal animus. It came after days of privately huddling with advisers.”



Sanders retracts statement about slowing down campaign - NBC News: “Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday tamped down speculation that he would slow his presidential campaign after he suffered a heart attack last week, saying he plans to compete as vigorously as ever for the 2020 Democratic nomination. The Vermont independent told NBC in an exclusive interview airing Wednesday night on ‘Nightly News’ and Thursday on the ‘Today’ show that his health scare has only strengthened his resolve, despite telling reporters a day earlier he planned to curtail his normally packed schedule. ‘I misspoke the other day. I said a word I should not have said and media drives me a little bit nuts to make a big deal about it,’ Sanders said during the interview alongside his wife, Jane Sanders. … He added, ‘I want to start off slower and build up and build up and build up.’”



Warren refreshes vow against high-dollar fundraisers - Politico: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she will continue to swear off high-dollar campaign fundraisers in the general election if she becomes the Democratic presidential nominee, extending her self-imposed ban on the events beyond the primary and reversing an earlier statement. ‘When Elizabeth is the Democratic nominee for president, she’s not going to change a thing in how she runs her campaign,’ campaign spokeswoman Kristen Orthman said in a statement Tuesday, which Warren later amplified in a Twitter thread. … That broad statement worried some Democrats, as the party’s presidential nominee traditionally has been a big fundraiser for other candidates and Democratic committees. But in a Wednesday statement, Orthman clarified that Warren's pledge would apply only to her presidential campaign, not to raising money for the Democratic Party or other candidates.”



TEAM TRUMP GOING ALL OUT FOR MINNESOTA, YOU BETCHA

NYT: “A Republican presidential candidate has not won the state of Minnesota since Richard M. Nixon’s victory there in 1972. But President Trump has long viewed it as the one that got away. Mr. Trump barely set foot in the state during his 2016 campaign, and his field organization on the ground was nonexistent… This time, the Trump campaign is determined not to let Minnesota go without trying. So on Thursday night, Mr. Trump will arrive in Minneapolis, one of the most Democratic congressional districts in the country, for his first political rally since House Democrats began an impeachment investigation that threatens to engulf his presidency. It is a rare rally for Mr. Trump in a state he did not win in 2016, and takes him to the heart of opposition territory… Meanwhile, Brad Parscale, the president’s campaign manager, is planning to pour tens of millions of dollars into the campaign’s Minnesota operation, compared with the $30,000 the Trump campaign spent on the state last cycle. The campaign already has 20 paid staff members in the state, and expects to expand to 100.”



LOUISIANA GOVERNOR RACE HEATS UP IN CLOSING DAYS

Politico: “The last televised primary debate in Louisiana saw Republicans Ralph Abraham and Eddie Rispone go after [Democratic Gov. John Bel] Edwards — but also each other, as they seek a second-place finish in an uncertain runoff. Rispone took the opportunity to post a question to Abraham, asking why he promised to donate his congressional salary but later stopped doing so, while Abraham criticized Rispone for his past support of Common Core. The two also argued back and forth about each other’s records, with Abraham accusing Rispone of running ‘distasteful’ attack ads, and Rispone calling Abraham’s line of attack on Common Core ‘an outright lie.’ The pair of Republicans did train their fire on Edwards, too. They hit him over the state’s economy and needled him on why he backed Hillary Clinton in 2016 — an attempt to nationalize the race, with President Donald Trump, who’s been tweeting proflicially about the race, planning an election-eve visit to Lake Charles on Friday night.”



McGrath raises $10.7 million in campaign to oust McConnell - WashTimes: “Democrat Amy McGrath raised a record $10.7 million in the last three months for her bit to topple Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the Senate race in Kentucky. Ms. McGrath, a Marine fighter pilot, is the leading Democratic candidate in the race to take on Mr. McConnell, a six-term senator who is immensely unpopular in his home state. The $10.7 million that Ms. McGrath raised in the third quarter came from 299,000 donors with an average individual contribution of $36. ‘Mitch McConnell has never faced an opponent like Amy McGrath. Not only does a new independent poll show the race tied, but more than a quarter-million grassroots donations — from all 120 Kentucky counties — have provided us a record-shattering first quarter of nearly $11 million to take down McConnell and his self-serving special interest allies. Change is coming,’ said McGrath campaign manager Mark Nickolas.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Chris! Woah, woah, woah! Can we please get an emergency podcast to discuss the new Fox News poll that has 51% of Americans supporting impeachment and removal? This seems crazy, yet not entirely surprising!” – Katie Hacker, Evington, Va.



[Ed. note: I don’t know if we can manage that one, Ms. Hacker, but how about a little Bleacher banter? It may be best here to look at our excellent pollsters’ work in context. If you check out FiveThirtyEight’s very helpful averages on the subject, you’ll see that support for impeachment has been on a sharp increase. On the day when the news broke that the President Trump had sought help from the Ukrainian president in getting dirt on the Bidens, opposition to impeachment ran 11 points ahead, 51 percent to 40 percent. That was in mid-September. Today, the average stands at 49 percent in favor of impeachment and 43 percent opposed. Support among Democrats and independents has jumped 10 points or more while Republicans increased a more modest, but still significant, 4 points on average. The takeaway from our poll and every other credible pollster is that the tide has turned decisively against the president. There is still a long way to go here and public opinion on this subject is obviously malleable. But if more than 80 percent of Democrats are already on board, it’s hard to see that number declining much any time soon. That means Team Trump’s urgent work is to convince increasingly skeptical independent voters that the president deserves to remain in office. It won’t be enough to count on the anger of core Republican supporters.]



“I've been following your continued response to readers who stubbornly insist on asking for a crime worthy of impeachment. Your response is that it's not a legal issue but a political issue. As a devotee of the U.S. Constitution, I really think that your reading of the ‘high crimes and misdemeanors’ standard should actually read ‘high crimes, misdemeanors, and anything else the U.S. House of Representatives feels adequate to the occasion’ would be more of a support for your position. But, alas, such language seems to be missing. Or am I reading the wrong U.S. Constitution? Please advise.” – Bill Panagakos, Littleton, Colo.



[Ed. note: It may be helpful here to look at the intent of the Framers in devising the vehicle. Here’s what Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 65 about the purpose of impeachment: “Those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.” The phrase “high crimes and misdemeanors” was a term of art long before the Constitution was drafted. As Hamilton alludes to in the passage above, the “high” in the term refers to the office more so than the offenses. The purpose of impeachment isn’t to prosecute federal officials for crimes, but rather to remove them from office for abusing their powers and breaching the public trust. The Framers were following in the footsteps of British politician and political philosopher, Edmund Burke. In his famous speech in 1786 seeking the impeachment of the governor general of India, Warren Hastings, for self-seeking, tyrannical treatment of the crown’s Indian subjects Burke declared “the principles of honor, the spirit of cavaliers to govern here; not the low principles of jurisprudence only.” Hastings’ scandal and trial were very much on the minds of Americans during the drafting and ratification of the Constitution and Burke’s view – that “principles of honor” were essential to consider – was the mainstream opinion on this side of the Atlantic. This is why the Senate, not the Supreme Court or some bicameral commission, was chosen to sit in judgment. Here’s Hamilton again: “The prosecution of them, for this reason, will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused. In many cases it will connect itself with the pre-existing factions, and will enlist all their animosities, partialities, influence, and interest on one side or on the other; and in such cases there will always be the greatest danger that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of parties, than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.” Sound familiar? The Senate, then indirectly elected by state legislatures, with its members serving six year terms, was seen as the best home for dispassionate, fair-minded evaluations of the facts at hand without the unpleasant thought of unelected judges removing an elected president. The House, more easily incited to partisan passion and more responsive to the immediate will of the electorate, can prosecute, but the upper chamber runs the show. Whether or not you agree with their assessment, if a majority of the members of the House believe that the president has abused his office for personal gain and should be removed, they would be entirely within the American understanding of an impeachable offense. Just as it would be within that tradition for the Senate to reject their claim if its members so choose. This is how the system is supposed to work. I imagine that Democrats will end up correlating their articles with existing criminal offenses, like the solicitation of campaign help from foreign countries and obstruction, but that’s just window dressing. Appeals to honor and ethics are enough.]



“Re: your report on Trey Gowdy joining Team Trump. Is he betting all his chips on a series of events that would get him a Supreme Court nomination?” – John Lee, Walnut Creek, Calif.



[Ed. note: I wouldn’t get too far ahead of myself on this one. Gowdy’s friend and longtime fellow South Carolina Congressman Mick Mulvaney is the White House chief of staff. Gowdy is arguably the best suited man in America to go up against House Democrats in this matter. He has a strong reputation among Republicans but still enjoys some credibility among his former Democratic colleagues for his successful navigation of efforts by Trump loyalists to torch the FBI. And if anything, running point on a matter this explosively controversial and rankly partisan would diminish, rather than improve, his chances of being picked for the Supreme Court.]



“Chris and Brianna, Please tell me you took editorial liberty in quoting Federalist No. 30 and that Alexander Hamilton did not write in all caps. My image of the esteemed first Secretary of the Treasury will be forever marred if he was a precedent Twitter troll.” – Dan Burch, Turlock, Calif.



[Ed. note: Capitalization is a funny thing. We’ve only really had standard practices for the past century or so. Certainly back in 1787, it was highly irregular across the English-speaking world. If you look at our founding documents you’ll see that in those days, for example, it was conventional to capitalize nouns in the way modern German speakers do. Consider the American creed: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” As you can see, the capitalization of nouns isn’t even standard. Why “Rights” but not “men?” “Liberty” but not “truths?” What comes through is that capitalization was a form of emphasis, not grammatical rules. The capitalized words after the start of the sentence – “Creator,” “Rights,” “Life,” “Liberty” and “Happiness” – actually make for a kind of semaphore for the actual meaning of the sentence. The essence is there in those five key words. So yes, I’m sorry to break it to you that ALL CAPS was a thing before Twitter. And you can just imagine Hamilton, eyes and pen aflame responding to the opponents of the Constitution: “IN THE USUAL PROGRESS OF THINGS, THE NECESSITIES OF A NATION, IN EVERY STAGE OF ITS EXISTENCE, WILL BE FOUND AT LEAST EQUAL TO ITS RESOURCES.” There’s no record of whether Patrick Henry wrote back “u mad bro?”]

WHAT I LEARNED IN CHICK-FIL-A TRAINING IS…

WBNS: “A Chick-fil-A employee went above and beyond to help a customer having a bad day. Shauna Hall was getting out of her van when she dropped her phone in the parking lot of a Chick-fil-A in Stafford, Virginia. The phone fell into a storm drain. … That’s when Seth, a digital marketing director with Chick-fil-A, said he would help. After cleaning his finger after slicing it trying to remove the manhole cover to the drain, Seth went into the storm drain and retrieved Hall’s phone. It didn’t break in the fall and wasn’t wet. ‘As he was about to climb out of the hole he asked me to snap a picture so he could show his girlfriend what he did at work today,’ Hall said. Seth’s shift had just ended, yet he didn’t hesitate to stay and help a customer in need.”

“If there wasn’t a ‘Man from Atlantis,’ I wouldn’t have been on ‘Dallas,’” the 70-year-old recently told Closer Weekly. “For starters, the producer of ‘Dallas,’ when he was creating the original show, [he] was filming a different one, right next door to me on ‘Man From Atlantis.’ He requested me to play the part of Bobby; I never auditioned for it.”

‘I DREAM OF JEANNIE’ STAR BARBARA EDEN RECALLS THE LAST TIME SHE SAW LARRY HAGMAN: ‘HE DIDN’T LOOK SICK’

“Had he not been there, next door to where I was doing ‘Atlantis,’ that opportunity may never have presented itself to me,” added Duffy. “So ‘Atlantis’ is very important in my career.”

“Man from Atlantis” chronicled the adventures of an amphibious man [Duffy], who was the last survivor of the legendary sunken city. It aired on NBC for one season between 1977 and 1978.

According to the outlet, the show was very similar to the 1961 Robert Heinlein novel “Stranger in a Strange Land,” which tells the story of Valentine Michael Smith, the sole survivor of a Mars colony who is brought to Earth. However, Duffy told the outlet that both stories were completely different.

“’Man from Atlantis’ wasn’t an adaptation,” he stressed. “Basically, it’s a recurring theme throughout most science fiction. ‘Man from Atlantis’ was that and I loved the opportunity to examine things with virginal eyes. In other words, we get so used to saying, ‘This is a plastic cup’ or ‘This is a recording device,’ but if you were from Planet-X, you had no idea what that was. You have to learn everything and that’s what ‘Man from Atlantis' was.”

“It was fun to play a superhero,” Duffy continued. “On top of that, obviously it was before almost all special effects, very little green screen, so everything we had to do was invented at the time. Now I look at the tentpole major features like ‘X-Men’ and all these other things and the special effects are phenomenal. Because we didn’t have that technology, if I was going to fly up somewhere, they had to hoist me up with a crane. It was fun.”

Duffy also shared that the series also came at the right time for audiences.

“There was the original George Reeves series ['Adventures of Superman'] where he was playing Superman,” Duffy explained. “There was simultaneous to ‘Man from Atlantis’ on the air, ‘The Six Million Dollar Man.’ But we were one of the first to not just be a strong detective or policeman, but someone with actual superpowers and tried to make that on a weekly television show basis. It was obviously difficult, because we only lasted two years, but I think we were pioneers in that sense.

“And there’s a clique of people who will never forget ‘Man from Atlantis.’ Usually, men come up to me and say, ‘I was 8 years old and tried to swim like you in the pool.’ So at an impressionable age, young people saw that show and never forgot it.”

‘HART TO HART’ STAR STEFANIE POWERS SAYS SHE AND ROBERT WAGNER ‘HELD EACH OTHER UP’ AFTER PARTNERS’ DEATHS

Back in 2006, Duffy told The Guardian why he initially left “Dallas,” which aired on CBS from 1978 until 1991.

“I quit because, at the end of seven years in an ensemble show with one leader, I thought, ‘I will be known as 'Dallas' starring Larry Hagman and the cast,’” he explained to the UK-based outlet at the time. “And at this point in my career — I was in my mid to late 30s — I thought, ‘Now is the time when it’s hottest for me to go out and establish my thing. So I had a meeting with Larry and with the producers. They all told me it was a really dumb choice to leave.”

When producer Leonard Katzman asked Duffy how he wanted to leave, the star said he “wanted to leave a hero,” but stressed he had zero intention of ever coming back.

“I wanted to leave knowing I couldn’t come back,” said Duffy. “I said I wanted to leave so that it’s not a trick from the audience. I didn’t want to disappear, or have my plane go down in the jungle.”

Bobby Ewing seemingly died in the last episode of Season 8 of ""Dallas"" in 1985. And Duffy’s career never took off after that.

“Larry would call me — he’d make fun of me,” recalled Duffy. “He’d say, ‘How you likin’ it out there?’ I would go to see the cats. We were close socially. I got a TV movie, but nothing major.”

Then Duffy got a phone call that would change everything.

“I got home and the message light was blinking,” said Duffy. “It was Larry. He said, ‘Let’s take a Jacuzzi and get drunk. I wanna talk to you.’”

Most recently, he’s filming the new TV movie “The Mistletoe Secret,” which is expected to come out next month."

Appearing on ""Outnumbered: Overtime"" with host Harris Faulkner, Ray said a full vote could have a significant impact in other legal battles.

""I've been saying for a long time their position legally in the cases that are pending -- mostly before the District Court in the District of Columbia -- would be enhanced if there was an impeachment vote in the House because the case law seems to suggest that they'll have, obviously, additional factual ammunition to be able to say it's the action of the entire body and precedent that will allow them a better argument to get access for -- among other things -- grand jury material,"" he said.

ARI FLEISCHER: 'PARTISAN IMPEACHMENT' WILL NEVER BE ACCEPTED BY THE AMERICAN PUBLIC

The White House insists that a formal House vote is necessary just to start the impeachment process, but Democrats are moving ahead without one, confident that they are backed by the Constitution and the president's own acknowledgment of trying to persuade a foreign government to investigate political rival former Vice President Joe Biden and his family.

In response to a letter from the Trump administration to House leaders, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said that, ""The White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the president's abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction.

Recent Fox News polling finds that support for impeachment has shifted significantly. A poll conducted Sunday through Tuesday found 51 percent of Americans now say that the president should be impeached and removed from office in comparison to just 42 percent in July.

However, President Trump told reporters on Wednesday that the fight might be taken all the way up to the Supreme Court if Republicans don't ""get a fair shake.""

""On portions of this, he may well be right,"" Ray told Faulkner. ""There are issues about, for example, access to grand jury material. That particular issue is actually the subject of a pending partition before the United States Supreme Court that may result in the Supreme Court reviewing that issue.""

""There are issues about the pendency of this impeachment inquiry and the efforts by the House of Representatives that may well land before the Supreme Court,"" he said.

Already feeling the heat with the book's publication still days away, Lack has begun his defense, penning a scathing letter to NBC News employees on Wednesday that took issue with Farrow’s claims.

“It disappoints me to say that even with passage of time, Farrow’s account has become neither more accurate, nor more respectful of the dedicated colleagues he worked with here at NBC News,"" Lack wrote in the memo obtained by Fox News. ""He uses a variety of tactics to paint a fundamentally untrue picture.”

That picture of Lack's tenure as it stands is already rife with accusations of mismanagement and boys' club behavior. Lack has been accused of botching a variety of sexual misconduct issues, ranging from his claim that Ronan Farrow’s award-winning coverage of Harvey Weinstein wasn’t fit to print to insisting that the investigation into Matt Lauer’s lewd workplace behavior be conducted by fellow NBC executives instead of an outside entity.

But allegations against Lack aren’t limited to covering up for the sexual misconduct of others, he’s also been accused of a variety of wrongdoings himself. The New York Post’s Page Six obtained an excerpt of Farrow’s book, “Catch and Kill,” which has long been expected to generate an onslaught of negative publicity for the beleaguered NBC News boss.

NBC NEWS BOSS ANDY LACK TAKES AIM AT FARROW'S CLAIMS HE WAS BLOCKED FROM REPORTING ON ALLEGED WEINSTEIN CRIMES

According to the Post, the book cites an alleged victim who claims that Lack “preyed on female underlings and pursued sexual relationships with them” throughout his career.

The Post also indicated that Farrow’s book features former CBS News anchor Jane Wallace openly discussing her 1980s affair with the then-married Lack while he was her executive producer and boss. Wallace reportedly told Farrow that Lack was “almost unrelenting” in his desire to take her out to dinner and celebrate her new contract – which led to a consensual sexual affair.

“What are you gonna say? You know if you say ‘I don’t want to celebrate with you,’ you’re asking for trouble,” Wallace says in the book, according to the Post. “I got worked over.”

The extramarital affair didn’t last, and Lack reportedly turned on his former fling.

“Eventually, Wallace claimed Lack bullied her out of the job she loved — and lorded his power over her — when their relationship soured,” Page Six reporter Sara Nathan wrote before noting that Farrow’s book details Wallace’s claim that she was intimidated into signing a binding nondisclosure agreement with a “substantial payout” to protect Lack.

According to the Post, Wallace told Farrow that she “loved that job” and reluctantly walked away because of Lack’s behavior.

A source close to Lack denied Wallace’s version of events, telling the Post “the charges of retaliation are just not true.”

MIKA BRZEZINSKI PUBLICLY SUPPORTED NEWS VET BROKAW AMID MISCONDUCT CLAIMS, PRIVATELY APOLOGIZED

Wallace isn’t the only extramarital sexual partner of Lack who spoke to Farrow, according to the Post.

A young production assistant reportedly told Farrow that she had an affair with Lack, but things got ugly once it ended. Farrow reportedly wrote that Lack wouldn’t allow her to be reassigned and “compelled her to work longer hours, and on weekends, and proposed she cancel vacations.”

Jennifer Laird told Farrow, “There’s clearly a reason you don’t get involved with your boss,” according to the Post.

“In the book, a rep denied Lack ever took retaliatory action against Laird,” Nathan wrote.

NBC News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In 2018 The Daily Beast published a bombshell report headlined, “Accused sexual harassers thrived under NBC News chief Andy Lack,” which detailed how scandals always seemed to emerge under his leadership.

MADDOW CELEBRATES NYT REPORTERS WHO EXPOSED WEINSTEIN SCANDAL, IGNORES HOW NBC SPIKED SAME STORY

Lack was the president of NBC News from 1993 until 2001 and returned to the Peacock Network in 2015 after top jobs at Sony Music and Bloomberg in between.

Citing sources, the Beast reported that Lack “protected a male employee who sexually harassed multiple women” when he was a Sony executive in between stints at NBC News.

While Lack was in power at Sony, music executive Charlie Walk reportedly sent “very graphic and totally inappropriate” pornography to female staffers, according to the Beast.

“Andy didn’t do anything,” a former Sony executive told the Beast.

NBC NEWS BOSS ANDY LACK SLAMMED FOR KEEPING SEX MISCONDUCT REVIEW IN-HOUSE

After Sony, Lack went to work running the Bloomberg Media Group, where he reportedly hinted at his longtime pal Lauer’s affairs well before he would return to NBC and fire the former “Today” co-host for sexual misconduct.

“During the Bloomberg years, according to two people who worked alongside Lack, he regularly boasted of his close friendship with Lauer and spoke of knowing that Lauer was unfaithful to his then-wife,” the Beast reported.

An NBC spokesperson disputed this when reached by the Beast last year.

Despite all of the issues surrounding Lack, he has a powerful longtime ally in Stephen Burke, the executive vice president of NBC’s parent Comcast and CEO of NBCUniversal. Burke defended Lack to The Daily Beast and an NBC insider told Fox News prior to excerpts from “Catch and Kill” emerging that Burke buys Lack’s narrative that Farrow has an axe to grind when it comes to the Peacock Network.

RONAN FARROW'S TEAM 'CONFIDENT IN THE FACTS' IN NEW #METOO BOOK, DISMISSES LEGAL THREAT FROM EX-NATIONAL ENQUIRER EDITOR

NBCUniversal did not immediately respond to a series of questions from Fox News, including whether or not the company and Burke still stand behind Lack and a request for comment on Farrow’s book in general.

Fox News has not seen Farrow’s “Catch and Kill,” which is scheduled to be released on Tuesday. In addition to new information regarding Lack’s personal wrongdoings, the book is expected to reveal other significant damaging information related to NBC News.

On Lack’s watch the now-disgraced Weinstein reportedly leveraged NBC executives to stop Farrow from exposing him as a sexual predator with scandalous information regarding Lauer.

The former “Today” anchor was ultimately fired weeks after Farrow exposed Weinstein in his Pulitzer Prize-winning piece that was published in The New Yorker after NBC passed on it.

‘TODAY’ ADDRESSES ‘APPALLING’ NEW MATT LAUER REPORT: 'IT’S JUST VERY PAINFUL'

""Weinstein made it known to the network that he was aware of Lauer's behavior and capable of revealing it,” Farrow wrote, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Lack refused to allow an outside counsel to investigate who knew about Lauer’s sexual wrongdoings. Instead of enlisting a white-shoe law firm – which has been standard for other news organizations dealing with sexual harassment during the #MeToo era – NBC allowed in-house General Counsel Kim Harris to conduct the review.

Harris’ internal review eventually declared that Lack and NBC management were completely oblivious to Lauer’s pervy behavior. The heavily criticized internal review contradicted the Beast report that Lack knew “Lauer was unfaithful” to his wife years before the #MeToo movement changed corporate culture across America.

LAUER DENIES GRAPHIC RAPE CLAIM, SAYS SEX WITH NBC NEWS COLLEAGUE 'COMPLETELY CONSENSUAL'

Farrow’s book will also contradict the internal review, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

“Farrow uncovers seven allegations of workplace sexual misconduct by Lauer that seem to contradict the network's stance that management had no knowledge of his behavior as well as seven nondisclosure agreements — many with hush-money payouts — to accusers of Lauer and others at NBC. Multiple Lauer accusers, including the woman whose complaint to NBC's human resources department resulted in the star's ouster, tell their stories in detail,” THR reporter Marisa Guthrie wrote. ""NBC maintains that it had no knowledge of Lauer's behavior before he was fired.""

Meanwhile, NBC News has still not explained how the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape of Donald Trump was leaked from within Lack’s news organization to the Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold just in time to potentially hurt Trump weeks before the 2016 election.

CLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM

Fahrenthold, like Farrow, won a Pulitzer Prize for reporting that NBC News passed on. The tape derailed the career of then-NBC host Billy Bush and Fahrenthold was later given a paid consultancy with NBC News.

Lack’s top deputy, NBC News president Noah Oppenheim, is an old college buddy of Fahrenthold from their time together at Harvard University. NBC has long denied that Oppenheim leaked the tape to Fahrenthold -- who with Oppenheim is also tied from Harvard to investor Marc Mezvinsky, the son-in-law of Hillary Clinton.

According to THR, which got access to the book, “Catch and Kill” will reveal that Clinton’s publicist Nick Merrill informed Weinstein that Farrow was poking around lewd accusations against him in the first place."

Embattled NBC News Chairman Andy Lack and his top deputy, Noah Oppenheim are reportedly “quivering in their suits,” while Zucker has denied any knowledge of Lauer’s transgressions and still sits atop the liberal CNN.

Zucker, who began his career at the Peacock Network, rose from NBC researcher all the way to president and CEO of NBC Universal. Along the way, he was the executive producer of “Today” when Lauer was hired in 1994.

NBC NEWS PRESIDENT MOCKED BY STAFFERS DURING FIERY MEETING ABOUT LAUER RAPE CLAIM

By 2001, Zucker was president of NBC Entertainment. In this role, he resumed oversight of Lauer -- then NBC’s biggest star -- and was frequently in touch with him about important matters related to “Today.”

A former NBC News employee with knowledge of Zucker’s relationship with Lauer feels the two shared a unique bond.

“They are very close friends. Jeff even did a Friars Club roast of Matt where he cracked jokes about Matt’s marital problems,” the former NBC News employee told Fox News. “At NBC, [Zucker] was the one person who could tell Matt to shut up.”

NBC NEWS BOSS ANDY LACK’S LEADERSHIP SCRUTINIZED AS RONAN FARROW TELL-ALL APPROACHES

At the 2008 roast, Zucker made several lewd remarks about Lauer.

“It’s just good to see Matt up here and not under my desk,” Zucker said from the podium, according to a media executive who attended. “I don’t want to say Matt is a germophobe, but he’s the only guy I know who uses Purell both before and after he masturbates.”

When Lauer was abruptly fired by NBC for sexual misconduct nine years later, in 2017, Zucker said at Business Insider’s Ignition conference that the news was ‘incredibly disturbing” and “heartbreaking.”

CNN, MSNBC IGNORE MATT LAUER RAPE ALLEGATIONS, NBC SCANDAL DURING PRIME TIME

""I've known Matt for 25 years and, I didn't know this Matt,” Zucker claimed at the time. “There was never a complaint about Matt. … There was never a suggestion of that kind of deviant or predatory behavior. There was never even a whisper of it.”

At the time, former CNN Chief White House Correspondent and USC Annenberg journalism professor Jessica Yellin said Zucker’s comments missed the point.

“This speaks to a problem with the culture and leadership of the workplace,” Yellin wrote in a scathing Twitter thread. “Creating a workplace in which women feel they can't report harassment isn't exonerating.”

Zucker’s comments at the conference mirrored the subsequent findings of a controversial internal review that NBC News launched to determine who knew about Lauer’s alleged misconduct. Lack insisted on keeping the investigation in-house, despite calls for an outside firm to take over. NBC General Counsel Kim Harris eventually declared that her colleagues were completely oblivious to Lauer’s supposed behavior.

ANDY LACK TAKES AIM AT FARROW'S CLAIMS HE WAS BLOCKED FROM REPORTING ON ALLEGED WEINSTEIN CRIMES

NBC declared that the investigation “found no evidence indicating that any NBC News or ‘Today’ show leadership” received any complaints about Lauer’s misconduct prior to the November 2017 complaint that resulted in his ousting. But once Lauer was fired, complaints began to surface and a 2017 New York Times report about a Lauer incident that allegedly happened during Zucker’s time at NBC was particularly shocking.

“One complaint came from a former employee who said Mr. Lauer had summoned her to his office in 2001, locked the door and sexually assaulted her,” The New York Times reported. “She told The Times that she passed out and had to be taken to a nurse.”

The CNN boss and Lauer are apparently still friends and the fallen morning show host reportedly attended Zucker’s magic-themed birthday bash earlier this year alongside Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo.

The New York Post, which first reported that a “relaxed-looking” Lauer attended the party, followed up with a report that Zucker was forced to shoot down rumors that Lauer would revive his career at CNN.

“Some staff were starting to freak out that Matt Lauer was suddenly about to come back from the dead and show up at CNN’s shiny new Manhattan office at Hudson Yards,” a CNN insider told the Post in May.

The insider added that “some senior female employees would refuse to work with him,” but the women of CNN weren’t put in that position after all. Zucker told concerned staffers that “there is absolutely no truth at all in the reports that Matt is coming to CNN,” according to the Post.

Lauer reportedly isn’t working for CNN anytime soon, but Zucker’s network gave his old pal a pass on prime-time coverage of the disgraced anchor’s latest scandal.

Ronan Farrow’s upcoming “Catch and Kill” contains a disputed claim that Lauer raped an NBC colleague during the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Japan. While NBC found the bombshell claim important enough to cover on its own “Nightly News” and “Today,” Zucker’s CNN completely ignored the story during prime time.

“Anderson Cooper 360,” “Cuomo Prime Time,” “CNN Tonight” and “White House in Crisis” failed to mention Lauer on Wednesday, according to a review of transcripts by Fox News.

Farrow was an NBC News employee when his reporting on now-disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein helped launch the #MeToo movement in 2017. NBC has long claimed that Farrow’s reporting, as presented to it, was not fit to run with. Farrow’s work ultimately appeared in The New Yorker, which is known for its vigorous fact-checking, so numerous theories have since been floated about why the Peacock Network passed.

LAUER DENIES GRAPHIC RAPE CLAIM, SAYS SEX WITH NBC NEWS COLLEAGUE 'COMPLETELY CONSENSUAL'

The son of Mia Farrow and Woody Allen has been expected to tell his side of the NBC saga in “Catch and Kill.” But it's just one of the bombshells he shared with The Hollywood Reporter’s Marisa Guthrie in an interview published on Wednesday, along with information from Guthrie's advance look at the book in an office at publisher Little, Brown.

NBC News did not immediately respond to a request for comment to a series of questions about Farrow's interview with The Hollywood Reporter.

Fox News has not seen the book, that is scheduled to be released on Tuesday. But here are six takeaways from Farrow's blockbuster interview:

‘TODAY’ ADDRESSES ‘APPALLING’ NEW MATT LAUER REPORT: 'IT’S JUST VERY PAINFUL'

THR: Farrow’s book will detail Weinstein’s alleged attempts to silence NBC

Weinstein attempted to “bully” NBC News into killing the story by leveraging information about then-NBC News anchor Matt Lauer, according to Guthrie. An executive from National Enquirer publisher American Media helped Weinstein formulate a plan to silence NBC News, according to Guthrie, and the duo found a “pressure point” against the network when he learned of alleged behavior by Lauer.

""Weinstein made it known to the network that he was aware of Lauer's behavior and capable of revealing it."" The book documents ""a period in which secrets at NBC were under threat of exposure,"" Farrow wrote in his book, according to Guthrie. ""And it is very clear from the conversations I document how heavily those secrets weighed on their [reporting] judgment.""

In a statement to THR, NBC News denied this claim and said “the idea of NBC News taking a threat seriously from a tabloid company about Matt Lauer is especially preposterous, since they already covered him with great regularity.”

RONAN FARROW'S TEAM 'CONFIDENT IN THE FACTS' IN NEW #METOO BOOK, DISMISSES LEGAL THREAT FROM EX-NATIONAL ENQUIRER EDITOR

THR: Farrow will directly name high-powered NBC executives

The book details ""Weinstein's personal interactions with NBC News and MSNBC chairman Andy Lack, NBC News president Noah Oppenheim and MSNBC president Phil Griffin,” according to Guthrie, who notes that the disgraced movie mogul called them frequently enough “that Weinstein's assistants who were asked to place phone calls to the men dubbed them ‘the triumvirate.’”

“Catch and Kill” will also detail “just how deep Weinstein's connections ran within NBC and reveals his aggressive effort to court additional executives,” Guthrie wrote.

THR also indicated that claims of sexual misconduct against NBC executives themselves will be included in the book.

NBC NEWS BOSS ANDY LACK SLAMMED FOR KEEPING SEX MISCONDUCT REVIEW IN-HOUSE

THR: The book will reportedly contradict NBC’s internal review

After an internal review, NBC declared in 2018 that NBC News management was oblivious to Lauer’s alleged pervy past. The controversial review was conducted by in-house general counsel Kim Harris despite widespread calls for an independent investigation.

“Farrow uncovers seven allegations of workplace sexual misconduct by Lauer that seem to contradict the network's stance that management had no knowledge of his behavior as well as seven nondisclosure agreements — many with hush-money payouts — to accusers of Lauer and others at NBC. Multiple Lauer accusers, including the woman whose complaint to NBC's human resources department resulted in the star's ouster, tell their stories in detail,” Guthrie wrote. ""NBC maintains that it had no knowledge of Lauer's behavior before he was fired.""

NBC News maintained it had no knowledge of Lauer’s misconduct in a statement to THR.

MADDOW CELEBRATES NYT REPORTERS WHO EXPOSED WEINSTEIN SCANDAL, IGNORES HOW NBC SPIKED SAME STORY

THR: Publisher Little, Brown has gone to great lengths to keep the book under wraps.

“In an effort to avoid any leaks, the publisher has gone to great lengths to secure the book's contents before publication. The Hollywood Reporter is one of only a handful of outlets allowed an early read, and even that had to be done in a conference room at Little, Brown's Midtown [Manhattan] offices under the gaze of a minder,” Guthrie wrote.

Guthrie indicated that she was eventually given a watermarked copy that she promised not to read in public.

THR: Weinstein allegedly used his friendship with Hillary Clinton, too

“Weinstein also attempted to leverage his long-term relationship with Hillary Clinton to pressure Farrow,” Guthrie reported.

Guthrie said Farrow was attempting to interview Clinton for an unrelated project in the summer of 2017, and the former secretary of state’s publicist later informed Weinstein that Farrow was working on a concerning story.

“Then, in September 2017, according to an email cited in the book, Weinstein wrote to Deborah Turness, the ex-president of NBC News who now runs NBC News International, to propose a docuseries on Clinton,” Guthrie wrote.

THR: Farrow says he is banned from NBC with one exception

Farrow appeared on MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” in October 2017 following the release of his Weinstein scoop and famously hinted that NBC News passed on the report. ""I walked in the door at The New Yorker with an explosive, reportable piece that should have been made public earlier,” he told Maddow.

Guthrie wrote that this segment “set off a firestorm at NBC”

“The moment they were off the air, Maddow's phone rang, and Farrow could hear {MSNBC President Phil] Griffin screaming through the receiver,” Guthrie wrote. “Farrow believes that he is blacklisted from NBC News and MSNBC. Only Maddow has had the clout to flout this ban; she had him on her show in April 2018, to discuss his foreign policy book, ‘War on Peace.’ NBC's executives deny Farrow is banned, but multiple sources tell THR that their attempts to book Farrow have been quashed.”

MSNBC did not immediately respond when asked if Farrow is subject to such a ban."

Kamala Harris while moderating the network’s LGBTQ town hall in California earlier in the evening.

Cuomo, 49, began the Los Angeles event -- before an audience composed of members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer communities and their allies -- by welcoming Harris, D-Calif., to the stage.

Harris, following an LGBTQ custom, said her preferred pronouns were “she, her, and hers.""

“Mine too,” Cuomo quipped. But the comment drew negative reaction on social media.

""painfully awkward,"" one user wrote.

""It's cool that the dem nominees had an LGBTQ town hall where nobody challenged Chris Cuomo's disrespectful trans joke,"" another observer wrote.

Cuomo later apologized on Twitter, writing: “PLEASE READ: When Sen. Harris said her pronouns were she her and her's, I said mine too. I should not have. I apologize.

“I am an ally of the LGBTQ community, and I am sorry because I am committed to helping us achieve equality. Thank you for watching our townhall,” he wrote.

But even Cuomo's apology drew backlash.

""Fredo Cuomo grovels to the intolerant left like a good puppy,"" one commenter wrote.

Aside from Harris, eight other Democratic 2020 contenders took part in the CNN event.

Former Vice President Joe Biden began a sentence saying, “When I came out … ,” using a phrase commonly employed by those publicly identifying as LGBTQ for the first time.

“That would be news,” CNN's Anderson Cooper interjected, prompting Biden to walk across the stage to embrace him.



“I got something to tell you ... ,” Biden started to joke to Cooper, who is gay.

“I kind of figured it out a while ago,” Cooper replied.

Biden also responded to a question from Shannon Scott, a 10-year U.S. Air Force veteran, who claimed she had to choose between serving in the military and her identity as a transgender woman because of the Trump administration's policy on those diagnosed with gender dysphoria serving in the military.

Biden said he would change the Trump policy if elected president.

""If I were president, you would not have to choose,"" he said. ""Not a joke. You would not have to choose. The fact of the matter is that we're in a position where transgender men and women are in a position where they should be able to do anything anybody else in the world can do. There should be no difference.""

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., addressed a comment she made in 2012, in which she said she did not support the use of taxpayer money to fund transgender reassignment surgery for prison inmates.

""It was a bad answer,” Warren told the audience. “And I believe that everyone is entitled to medical care and medical care they need. And that includes people who are transgender who, it is the time for them to have gender affirming surgery. I just think that’s important.""

Harris said she would make stopping the spread of HIV/AIDs within a decade one of her top priorities if she becomes president.

Other Democrats taking part were Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro and businessman Tom Steyer."

Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has secured nearly $20 million to fund measures that help California prevent millions of gallons of Tijuana’s raw sewage from flowing into San Diego, according to a Wednesday report.

The preventive measures were laid out in three Senate funding bills which appropriate $19.5 million for the EPA to address the sewage flows, direct the secretary of state to create a plan that addresses their impact, and directs U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to submit a report on its efforts to protect its agents from the flows, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported.

San Diego County has been dealing with raw sewage flows from Tijuana for decades. Last year, a pipe across the border in Mexico broke, causing millions of gallons of sewage to flow into the Tijuana River and, eventually, the Pacific Ocean, impacting California coastal areas.

“It’s absolutely outrageous and unacceptable,” Imperial Beach Mayor Serge Dedina told reporters last December. “The biggest issues that we’re concerned about is this happens again and again and then the Mexican government doesn’t notify anybody. They sort of cover it up and they notify us at the last minute and then our kids are at risk of swimming in sewage.”

Imperial Beach, located just across the border from Mexico, sued the federal government last year, claiming its failure to stop the flows was a violation of the Clean Water Act.

“More concrete action must be taken to stop this decades-long problem,” Feinstein said in a statement. “Raw sewage overflows and other pollution from Mexico along the Tijuana River that jeopardize human health are unacceptable.”

He adds, ""Freedom of religion is a fundamental right, but it should not be used to discriminate.""

Matt Lewis, CNN political commentator, tweeted out, ""This isn't going to help win the electoral college. If you wonder why so many Christians are willing to hold their nose and support someone as horrible as Donald Trump, this helps explain it.""

Luke Goodrich, vice president and senior counsel at Becket, a religious liberty law firm, called it ""blatantly unconstitutional,"" adding ""it's also foolish because those groups provide billions of dollars in essential social services to their communities.

And Hiram Sasser, general counsel for First Liberty Institute, told Fox News their faith-based organization has taken on the government before.

Biden is on top in the race with 32 percent support among primary voters, up 3 points since September. He’s followed by Warren at 22 percent -- up 6 points and a new high for her. Bernie Sanders is at 17 percent, down 1 point since last month.

Biden retains top billing with strong support among non-whites, voters over age 45, and moderates/conservatives. Warren has strengthened her position by increasing support among suburban voters, very liberals, and men.

When Democratic primary voters’ first and second choice preferences are considered together, Biden and Warren tie at 45 percent support, Sanders is at 34 percent, Harris 15 percent and Buttigieg 13 percent.

President Trump’s allegations about improper actions by Biden and his son have so far failed to chip away at Biden’s support in the primary race -- and Democratic primary voters continue to believe the former vice president is the candidate best equipped to beat Trump in 2020: 43 percent feel that way, up from 42 percent last month. Nineteen percent think Warren has the best chance to oust Trump and 15 percent say Sanders.

At the same time, the poll finds the three top Democratic candidates with sizable leads over the president in potential head-to-head matchups.

The poll, released Thursday, shows Biden (50-40 percent) and Warren (50-40 percent) both top Trump by 10 points, and Sanders is up by 9 (49-40 percent). This marks the first time all three Democrats have held a lead outside the poll’s margin of error. Last month, Biden was up by 14 points, Warren by 6 and Sanders by 8.

“If Warren continues to poll as strongly against Trump as the former vice president, it makes it increasingly difficult for the Biden team to keep making the argument he is the most electable candidate,” says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican Daron Shaw.

The impeachment inquiry hasn’t caused any real shifts in the ballot test, as Trump’s support in the two-way matchups has been between 37-42 percent all year. However, the poll finds an 8-point shift since last month in the number expecting Trump will be re-elected. In September, more thought he would win by a 6-point margin and now more expect he won’t by 2 points.

And while most Republican primary voters want to keep Trump as their party’s nominee, nearly one in five, 17 percent, would like to see someone else run.

“So far, Trump has been able to keep his Republican base on board,” says Shaw. “If the percentage opposing his re-nomination creeps into the 20s, that would be a troubling sign.”

Meanwhile, voters continue to believe Donald Trump is dishonest. Sixty-three percent say that -- far more than the 35 percent who think he is honest and trustworthy. By the way, that’s the same number who said Trump was honest before he won the 2016 election.

Vice President Mike Pence does a bit better than his boss, although not by much: 39 percent say he’s honest and 54 percent say dishonest.

On the other side, each of the top three Democratic candidates receives positive ratings on this measure. Sanders performs best with 59 percent saying he is honest and trustworthy (36 percent disagree). Fifty percent think Warren is honest vs. 44 percent dishonest, and for Biden voters split 48-47 percent.

Among Democrats, 87 percent think Sanders is honest and trustworthy, while 81 percent feel that way about Warren and 75 percent Biden. Seventy-three percent of Republicans say Trump is honest.

Currently, 51 percent of voters have a favorable opinion of Sanders, while 43 percent view him negatively. That puts him in positive territory by 8 points. More view Warren positively by 7 points (46 favorable vs. 39 unfavorable) and Biden by 6 (50 favorable vs. 44 unfavorable).

The ratings are closer to even for Buttigieg (+3 points), Yang (+3), Booker (-2), Harris (-3) and O’Rourke (-4). They each also have large numbers who have never heard of them or have no opinion of them. For example, 43 percent of voters are unable to rate Yang, while 36 percent can’t rate Buttigieg and 32 percent can’t rate Booker.

Voters view Trump more negatively than positively by 13 points (43-56). His personal favorable rating was underwater by 22 points in the days leading up to the 2016 election (38-60).

Twice as many primary voters say Trump’s allegations make them more likely to vote for Biden (21 percent more vs. 10 percent less), while twice as many say health concerns make them less (31 percent) rather than more likely (15 percent) to vote for Sanders in the primary.

Sanders is off the campaign trail since suffering a heart attack October 3. He’s 78 years old, while Biden is 76, Trump is 73, and Warren is 70.

Homelessness in Los Angeles County and across Western states is skyrocketing. In 2019 so far, the number of homeless residents in Los Angeles has risen 12 percent from 2018, according to county statistics.

“We need a FEMA-like, Red Cross-like, National Guard-like [solution],"" said Rev. Andy Bales, the CEO of L.A.’s largest homeless shelter, Union Rescue Mission. ""Army Corps of Engineers needs to come and we need to figure out immediately how to get 44,000 people off the streets.""

Candidate plans that are more forward-looking, like five to 10 years down the road with millions of dollars in investment in affordable housing units, can be good in theory and are necessary, these advocates say, but don’t address “chronic” homelessness, or those who have lived out on the streets for six months or more in the past year.

HOMELESS MAN RANDOMLY PICKS UP 6-YEAR-OLD, SLAMS HIM ON CONCRETE: REPORT

“We’ve been doing $600,000 to $700,000 per person, per unit, and it’s planned over the next 10 years and that will not get it done,” Bales says. He added that only one candidate has reached out to him on how to remedy the situation.

Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary under President Obama Julian Castro and Beto O’ Rourke have actually visited homeless encampments on Skid Row, a notoriously expansive homeless encampment in downtown Los Angeles.

O’Rourke released a plan this week similar to Castro’s and Sen. Bernie Sanders’ plans, saying he wants to triple funding for homeless assistance grants through HUD providing $50 billion over the next 10 years, fully funding housing choice vouchers, capping rent increases, and pumping investment in dilapidated public housing units.

But for those who study the issue of homelessness, they say the problem should be coming up more in candidate rhetoric and dialogue as they campaign. It’s not so much to just have a job to maintain housing, they say, because rent prices have become so unsustainable.

“I think it’s becoming an intractable issue because we don’t have the investment and broader solutions to homelessness, which is why I think many of the presidential candidates are focused on affordable housing….it’s still something that’s just emerging and most of the candidates have not yet addressed,"" said Christopher Herring, a UCLA PhD student.

Herring said affordable housing is the main way to go, but there needs to be more steps done to prevent people from becoming homeless in the first place and notes that with Castro and Sanders’ plans, respectively, much of the dollar figures they’re proposing will be spent quickly and frivolously unless backed up by creating and maintaining affordable housing quickly and cost-efficiently.

""To put it another way, that expansion of the billions of dollars for homelessness in Castro and Sanders plans will be pissed away quickly and a waste of taxpayer money if not backed up by more robust structural reform in the production and preservation of affordable housing.""

TOMI LAHREN: CA DEMOCRATS IGNORING HOMELESS 'EPIDEMIC' IN FAVOR OF TRUMP IMPEACHMENT PUSH

California’s Democratic primary will be early in 2020, moving up to March from June, making the state in play again for candidates vying for the nomination with 500 delegates up for grabs.

Voters in the state have homelessness high on their list of issues. Some in Los Angeles county say it even trumps traffic and the environment in what needs to be fixed first in the city.

But ultimately, homeless people have very little, if any political power as a constituency, which could be why voters haven’t heard about the problem in states other than California.

“For the most part, the people who are experiencing homelessness are not voting, at least they’re not voting en masse, they don’t have a strong political voice, they don’t have political champions, and elected officials who are sensitive to what their constituents want or else they’re going to get voted out of office, it’s not a constituency they have to pay a lot of attention to,” said Adam Murray, executive director of LA’s Inner City Law Center.

California senator and presidential candidate Kamala Harris is supporting a bill in the Senate to provide $13 billion in emergency relief to areas affected by chronic homelessness over the next five years. But Republicans are unlikely to bring it up for a vote, citing the huge price tag.

Harris has blamed the Trump administration for cutting off funding to support what local government needs around affordable housing.

President Trump, on the other hand, has spoken about the issue on Twitter and at his rallies numerous times, largely in irreverent tones.

At a rally in Cincinnati in August, he said, ""What they are doing to our beautiful California is a disgrace to our country...It's a shame. The world is looking at it. Look at Los Angeles with the tents and the horrible, horrible conditions. Look at San Francisco, look at some of your other cities.""

Herring says California needs a federal response like what Trump is suggesting, saying, ""Trump has drawn attention to this and it’s woken up the Democratic candidates to putting forward and putting pressure on them to make real solutions.”"

A standout moment of the June 27 Democratic primary debate was that of all the candidates on the stage raising their hands, signifying support for government health care plans including “undocumented” immigrants.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SHOULD GET HEALTH CARE, SAY DEMS IN NIGHT 2 DEBATE

Republicans and the White House have seized on that moment, with President Trump declaring it “the end of the race.”

But with the campaign definitely not over, and a number of frontrunners now backing the policy, more attention is turning to how much it could cost to give millions of illegal immigrants health insurance. On Thursday, the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), a policy group that advocates for lower levels of immigration overall, published a study finding that the cost could be up to $23 billion a year.

While candidates have not necessarily gone into detail about their plans, CIS cites an Atlantic survey that found that Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; and former Housing Secretary Julian Castro would all provide “full benefits” to those in the country illegally.

The CIS study estimated that 4.9 million illegal immigrants have incomes below 400 percent of the poverty line and also do not have insurance -- meaning they have incomes low enough to receive coverage via either Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act -- also known to many, particularly critics, as ObamaCare.

The study estimates that if all income-eligible, uninsured illegal immigrants received subsidies under the ACA, then the cost to insure would be $22.6 billion, but with “likely enrollment” of 46 percent, the total cost would be perhaps $10.4 billion a year. It predicts that the average cost of a subsidized premium would be $4,637.

If a mixed approach of ACA subsidies and Medicaid enrollment were used, the cost would dip to $19.6 billion with 100 percent enrollment, and $10.7 billion assuming “likely enrollment.”

These numbers could change significantly if a more overarching health care overhaul is passed by a future Democratic White House and Congress.

“Numbers aside, the fact that presidential candidates are advocating spending billions of dollars on people who are in the country illegally is significant in its own right,” the report concludes. “It suggests that allowing in large numbers of less-educated workers will inevitably generate significant political pressure to provide them access to social programs.”

Extending health care to illegal immigrants could, however, be only one part of the cost to taxpayers of more generous social policies being pushed by Democrats.

AOC PUSHES NATIONAL RENT CONTROL, WELFARE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN LATEST MASSIVE PROPOSAL

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who was an early champion of left-favored policies now finding their way into 2020 Democratic platforms, recently introduced a new package of policies known as the “Just Society.”

Among those bills is “The Embrace Act,” which would allow illegal immigrants to claim the same welfare benefits as U.S. citizens and those in the country legally.

""Notwithstanding any other provision of law ... an individual who is an alien (without regard to the immigration status of that alien) may not be denied any federal public benefit solely on the basis of the individual’s immigration status,” the bill reads.

The bill defines a federal public benefit as: “any grant, contract, loan, professional license or commercial license provided by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States; and ... any retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or assisted housing, post-secondary education, food assistance, unemployment benefit,or any other similar benefit for which payments or assistance are provided to an individual, household, or family eligibility unit by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States.”"

GIULIANI ASSOCIATES NABBED FOR ALLEGED CAMPAIGN CRIMES

WSJ: “Two Soviet-born donors to a pro-Trump fundraising committee who helped Rudy Giuliani’s efforts to investigate Democrat Joe Biden were arrested late Wednesday on criminal charges of violating campaign finance rules, including funneling Russian money into President Trump’s campaign. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two Florida businessmen, have been under investigation by the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan, and are expected to appear in federal court in Virginia later on Thursday, the people said. Both men were born in former Soviet republics. Mr. Giuliani, President Trump’s private lawyer, identified the two men in May as his clients. Both men have donated to Republican campaigns including Mr. Trump’s, and in May 2018 gave $325,000 to the primary pro-Trump super PAC, America First Action… A Justice Department official said [Attorney General William Barr] was supportive of their work on the case, on which he was first briefed shortly after being confirmed as attorney general in February.”



Fox poll: Record support for Trump’s ouster - Fox News: “Just over half of voters want President Trump impeached and removed from office, according to a Fox News Poll released Wednesday. A new high of 51 percent wants Trump impeached and removed from office, another 4 percent want him impeached but not removed, and 40 percent oppose impeachment altogether. In July, 42 percent favored impeachment and removal, while 5 percent said impeach but don’t remove him, and 45 percent opposed impeachment.Since July, support for impeachment increased among voters of all stripes: up 11 points among Democrats, 5 points among Republicans and 3 among independents. Support also went up among some of Trump’s key constituencies, including white evangelical Christians (+5 points), white men without a college degree (+8), and rural whites (+10). Among voters in swing counties (where Hillary Clinton and Trump were within 10 points in 2016), support for impeachment increased to 52 percent, up from 42 percent in July.”



Pence to release transcripts of his Ukraine calls - AP: “Vice President Mike Pence said Wednesday he is working with the White House counsel’s office to release transcripts of his own calls with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Pence said records of his two phone conversations would help exonerate President Donald Trump of any wrongdoing. Pence was asked about releasing his transcripts and told reporters, ‘I’d have no objection to that.’ He spoke after an event in Waukee, Iowa, where he addressed supporters about the president’s trade policy. Pence said he ‘never discussed the issue of the Bidens’ with Zelenskiy. And he again defended the president, insisting that a ‘plain reading’ of the rough transcript of Trump’s call with the Ukranian leader shows ‘there was no quid pro quo.’”



Pergram: Trump team’s stonewalling speeds up Democrats’ timetable - Fox News: “Next Tuesday is the deadline for most of the House’s requests. That coincides with the day the House returns to session. [Nancy] Pelosi will take the temperature of her caucus when lawmakers return. But in some respects, Pelosi already knows the temperature. Democrats are seething over the administration failing to meet congressional demands. They think they have a robust case against the president when it comes to obstruction of Congress. Pelosi could grant the administration more time to comply. That would let the issue marinate in public for a bit – and demonstrate that Democrats aren’t hasty to impeach. But after that, the House Judiciary Committee could begin drafting articles of impeachment. Pelosi doesn’t travel roads like this unless she already knows the outcome. She doesn’t lose votes on the floor – especially something of this magnitude.”



Trump’s Syria decision affects GOP backing on impeachment - WaPo: “President Trump’s decision to suddenly withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria has angered evangelical Christian leaders and Republican hawks, cleaving his political coalition at the very moment he is trying to fortify his standing to survive the intensifying impeachment inquiry in Congress. Instead of enjoying uncontested GOP support as he plunges into a constitutional showdown with House Democrats and prepares for a bruising reelection campaign, Trump is now fighting on two fronts within his party. … The past few days have tested the bounds of Trump’s Republican support at an unusually frenzied political crossroads that has brought uncertainty for elected officials. While GOP lawmakers have been skittish about directly engaging the subject at the heart of the impeachment debate — the president’s conduct with his Ukrainian counterpart — many have felt free to loudly condemn Trump’s Syria decision, underscoring the fluidity within GOP ranks.”



The Judge’s Ruling: With Syria, Trump lives up to his campaign promise - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano explains that President Trump removing U.S. troops from Syria complies with his duty to uphold the Constitution: “Trump ran for office promising to bring the troops home. He may have made the latest decision to do so without adequate warning to his military commanders, but his decision is utterly consistent with his promises, and it is utterly in compliance with the Constitution. Now is the time for Congress -- which is largely angry at the presidential use or nonuse of the military -- to repeal both AUMFs and the War Powers Resolution and reclaim its constitutional power as the sole entity in the federal government able to declare war. Until it does, these profoundly outdated, morally ambivalent and overtly unconstitutional statutes lie in the presidential desk drawer like a loaded gun.” More here.



THE RULEBOOK: CUE ‘I’M JUST A BILL’

“The President of the United States is to have power to return a bill, which shall have passed the two branches of the legislature, for reconsideration; and the bill so returned is to become a law, if, upon that reconsideration, it be approved by two thirds of both houses.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 69



TIME OUT: ‘WHY YOU SHOULD BE EATING MORE CHEDDAR’

WSJ: “For over 150 years cheddar was the most popular cheese in the U.S. It sustained colonists and Civil War soldiers, and was the foundation for the industrial innovation of processed ‘American’ cheese. Only recently was cheddar demoted to second place in overall consumption, usurped by that ubiquitous pizza-topper, mozzarella. Though English in origin, cheddar has been part of the American experience from the very start, and today some of this country’s best cheese makers are turning out better cheddar than ever before. Cheddaring, the stacking of blocks of drained curds to extract more whey, creates a sturdy curd suited to aging. … Commodity cheddar is a publicly traded product whose destiny is frozen food, pre-shredded packs and economy supermarket wedges; specialty cheddar, made on a small scale and sold primarily at cheese counters and gourmet stores, is often preserved in wax or clothbound (wrapped in cotton cloth and rubbed with oil or lard).”

BIDEN TRIES COUNTERPUNCHING

Politico: “After calling for Donald Trump’s impeachment for the first time, Joe Biden experienced something here he rarely sees on the campaign trail: a sustained standing ovation. …[T]he former vice president’s roll-out of a swaggering, fire-breathing approach and full embrace of impeachment signaled a dramatic departure from course — a change in direction necessitated by weeks of Trump’s siege warfare. … It was his most aggressive posture to date, presenting a case that Trump could not be trusted, while positioning himself as the fighter that America needs at this moment to face off against a ‘bully’ and a ‘coward.’ … He also took a veiled shot at Elizabeth Warren, who has overtaken Biden in recent national polls and whose campaign mantra is centered on her dozens of policy plans. … Biden’s shift toward a harsher tone and his evolution on impeachment was born out of circumstance, necessity and personal animus. It came after days of privately huddling with advisers.”



Sanders retracts statement about slowing down campaign - NBC News: “Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday tamped down speculation that he would slow his presidential campaign after he suffered a heart attack last week, saying he plans to compete as vigorously as ever for the 2020 Democratic nomination. The Vermont independent told NBC in an exclusive interview airing Wednesday night on ‘Nightly News’ and Thursday on the ‘Today’ show that his health scare has only strengthened his resolve, despite telling reporters a day earlier he planned to curtail his normally packed schedule. ‘I misspoke the other day. I said a word I should not have said and media drives me a little bit nuts to make a big deal about it,’ Sanders said during the interview alongside his wife, Jane Sanders. … He added, ‘I want to start off slower and build up and build up and build up.’”



Warren refreshes vow against high-dollar fundraisers - Politico: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she will continue to swear off high-dollar campaign fundraisers in the general election if she becomes the Democratic presidential nominee, extending her self-imposed ban on the events beyond the primary and reversing an earlier statement. ‘When Elizabeth is the Democratic nominee for president, she’s not going to change a thing in how she runs her campaign,’ campaign spokeswoman Kristen Orthman said in a statement Tuesday, which Warren later amplified in a Twitter thread. … That broad statement worried some Democrats, as the party’s presidential nominee traditionally has been a big fundraiser for other candidates and Democratic committees. But in a Wednesday statement, Orthman clarified that Warren's pledge would apply only to her presidential campaign, not to raising money for the Democratic Party or other candidates.”



TEAM TRUMP GOING ALL OUT FOR MINNESOTA, YOU BETCHA

NYT: “A Republican presidential candidate has not won the state of Minnesota since Richard M. Nixon’s victory there in 1972. But President Trump has long viewed it as the one that got away. Mr. Trump barely set foot in the state during his 2016 campaign, and his field organization on the ground was nonexistent… This time, the Trump campaign is determined not to let Minnesota go without trying. So on Thursday night, Mr. Trump will arrive in Minneapolis, one of the most Democratic congressional districts in the country, for his first political rally since House Democrats began an impeachment investigation that threatens to engulf his presidency. It is a rare rally for Mr. Trump in a state he did not win in 2016, and takes him to the heart of opposition territory… Meanwhile, Brad Parscale, the president’s campaign manager, is planning to pour tens of millions of dollars into the campaign’s Minnesota operation, compared with the $30,000 the Trump campaign spent on the state last cycle. The campaign already has 20 paid staff members in the state, and expects to expand to 100.”



LOUISIANA GOVERNOR RACE HEATS UP IN CLOSING DAYS

Politico: “The last televised primary debate in Louisiana saw Republicans Ralph Abraham and Eddie Rispone go after [Democratic Gov. John Bel] Edwards — but also each other, as they seek a second-place finish in an uncertain runoff. Rispone took the opportunity to post a question to Abraham, asking why he promised to donate his congressional salary but later stopped doing so, while Abraham criticized Rispone for his past support of Common Core. The two also argued back and forth about each other’s records, with Abraham accusing Rispone of running ‘distasteful’ attack ads, and Rispone calling Abraham’s line of attack on Common Core ‘an outright lie.’ The pair of Republicans did train their fire on Edwards, too. They hit him over the state’s economy and needled him on why he backed Hillary Clinton in 2016 — an attempt to nationalize the race, with President Donald Trump, who’s been tweeting proflicially about the race, planning an election-eve visit to Lake Charles on Friday night.”



McGrath raises $10.7 million in campaign to oust McConnell - WashTimes: “Democrat Amy McGrath raised a record $10.7 million in the last three months for her bit to topple Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the Senate race in Kentucky. Ms. McGrath, a Marine fighter pilot, is the leading Democratic candidate in the race to take on Mr. McConnell, a six-term senator who is immensely unpopular in his home state. The $10.7 million that Ms. McGrath raised in the third quarter came from 299,000 donors with an average individual contribution of $36. ‘Mitch McConnell has never faced an opponent like Amy McGrath. Not only does a new independent poll show the race tied, but more than a quarter-million grassroots donations — from all 120 Kentucky counties — have provided us a record-shattering first quarter of nearly $11 million to take down McConnell and his self-serving special interest allies. Change is coming,’ said McGrath campaign manager Mark Nickolas.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Chris! Woah, woah, woah! Can we please get an emergency podcast to discuss the new Fox News poll that has 51% of Americans supporting impeachment and removal? This seems crazy, yet not entirely surprising!” – Katie Hacker, Evington, Va.



[Ed. note: I don’t know if we can manage that one, Ms. Hacker, but how about a little Bleacher banter? It may be best here to look at our excellent pollsters’ work in context. If you check out FiveThirtyEight’s very helpful averages on the subject, you’ll see that support for impeachment has been on a sharp increase. On the day when the news broke that the President Trump had sought help from the Ukrainian president in getting dirt on the Bidens, opposition to impeachment ran 11 points ahead, 51 percent to 40 percent. That was in mid-September. Today, the average stands at 49 percent in favor of impeachment and 43 percent opposed. Support among Democrats and independents has jumped 10 points or more while Republicans increased a more modest, but still significant, 4 points on average. The takeaway from our poll and every other credible pollster is that the tide has turned decisively against the president. There is still a long way to go here and public opinion on this subject is obviously malleable. But if more than 80 percent of Democrats are already on board, it’s hard to see that number declining much any time soon. That means Team Trump’s urgent work is to convince increasingly skeptical independent voters that the president deserves to remain in office. It won’t be enough to count on the anger of core Republican supporters.]



“I've been following your continued response to readers who stubbornly insist on asking for a crime worthy of impeachment. Your response is that it's not a legal issue but a political issue. As a devotee of the U.S. Constitution, I really think that your reading of the ‘high crimes and misdemeanors’ standard should actually read ‘high crimes, misdemeanors, and anything else the U.S. House of Representatives feels adequate to the occasion’ would be more of a support for your position. But, alas, such language seems to be missing. Or am I reading the wrong U.S. Constitution? Please advise.” – Bill Panagakos, Littleton, Colo.



[Ed. note: It may be helpful here to look at the intent of the Framers in devising the vehicle. Here’s what Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 65 about the purpose of impeachment: “Those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.” The phrase “high crimes and misdemeanors” was a term of art long before the Constitution was drafted. As Hamilton alludes to in the passage above, the “high” in the term refers to the office more so than the offenses. The purpose of impeachment isn’t to prosecute federal officials for crimes, but rather to remove them from office for abusing their powers and breaching the public trust. The Framers were following in the footsteps of British politician and political philosopher, Edmund Burke. In his famous speech in 1786 seeking the impeachment of the governor general of India, Warren Hastings, for self-seeking, tyrannical treatment of the crown’s Indian subjects Burke declared “the principles of honor, the spirit of cavaliers to govern here; not the low principles of jurisprudence only.” Hastings’ scandal and trial were very much on the minds of Americans during the drafting and ratification of the Constitution and Burke’s view – that “principles of honor” were essential to consider – was the mainstream opinion on this side of the Atlantic. This is why the Senate, not the Supreme Court or some bicameral commission, was chosen to sit in judgment. Here’s Hamilton again: “The prosecution of them, for this reason, will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused. In many cases it will connect itself with the pre-existing factions, and will enlist all their animosities, partialities, influence, and interest on one side or on the other; and in such cases there will always be the greatest danger that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of parties, than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.” Sound familiar? The Senate, then indirectly elected by state legislatures, with its members serving six year terms, was seen as the best home for dispassionate, fair-minded evaluations of the facts at hand without the unpleasant thought of unelected judges removing an elected president. The House, more easily incited to partisan passion and more responsive to the immediate will of the electorate, can prosecute, but the upper chamber runs the show. Whether or not you agree with their assessment, if a majority of the members of the House believe that the president has abused his office for personal gain and should be removed, they would be entirely within the American understanding of an impeachable offense. Just as it would be within that tradition for the Senate to reject their claim if its members so choose. This is how the system is supposed to work. I imagine that Democrats will end up correlating their articles with existing criminal offenses, like the solicitation of campaign help from foreign countries and obstruction, but that’s just window dressing. Appeals to honor and ethics are enough.]



“Re: your report on Trey Gowdy joining Team Trump. Is he betting all his chips on a series of events that would get him a Supreme Court nomination?” – John Lee, Walnut Creek, Calif.



[Ed. note: I wouldn’t get too far ahead of myself on this one. Gowdy’s friend and longtime fellow South Carolina Congressman Mick Mulvaney is the White House chief of staff. Gowdy is arguably the best suited man in America to go up against House Democrats in this matter. He has a strong reputation among Republicans but still enjoys some credibility among his former Democratic colleagues for his successful navigation of efforts by Trump loyalists to torch the FBI. And if anything, running point on a matter this explosively controversial and rankly partisan would diminish, rather than improve, his chances of being picked for the Supreme Court.]



“Chris and Brianna, Please tell me you took editorial liberty in quoting Federalist No. 30 and that Alexander Hamilton did not write in all caps. My image of the esteemed first Secretary of the Treasury will be forever marred if he was a precedent Twitter troll.” – Dan Burch, Turlock, Calif.



[Ed. note: Capitalization is a funny thing. We’ve only really had standard practices for the past century or so. Certainly back in 1787, it was highly irregular across the English-speaking world. If you look at our founding documents you’ll see that in those days, for example, it was conventional to capitalize nouns in the way modern German speakers do. Consider the American creed: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” As you can see, the capitalization of nouns isn’t even standard. Why “Rights” but not “men?” “Liberty” but not “truths?” What comes through is that capitalization was a form of emphasis, not grammatical rules. The capitalized words after the start of the sentence – “Creator,” “Rights,” “Life,” “Liberty” and “Happiness” – actually make for a kind of semaphore for the actual meaning of the sentence. The essence is there in those five key words. So yes, I’m sorry to break it to you that ALL CAPS was a thing before Twitter. And you can just imagine Hamilton, eyes and pen aflame responding to the opponents of the Constitution: “IN THE USUAL PROGRESS OF THINGS, THE NECESSITIES OF A NATION, IN EVERY STAGE OF ITS EXISTENCE, WILL BE FOUND AT LEAST EQUAL TO ITS RESOURCES.” There’s no record of whether Patrick Henry wrote back “u mad bro?”]

WHAT I LEARNED IN CHICK-FIL-A TRAINING IS…

WBNS: “A Chick-fil-A employee went above and beyond to help a customer having a bad day. Shauna Hall was getting out of her van when she dropped her phone in the parking lot of a Chick-fil-A in Stafford, Virginia. The phone fell into a storm drain. … That’s when Seth, a digital marketing director with Chick-fil-A, said he would help. After cleaning his finger after slicing it trying to remove the manhole cover to the drain, Seth went into the storm drain and retrieved Hall’s phone. It didn’t break in the fall and wasn’t wet. ‘As he was about to climb out of the hole he asked me to snap a picture so he could show his girlfriend what he did at work today,’ Hall said. Seth’s shift had just ended, yet he didn’t hesitate to stay and help a customer in need.”

“If there wasn’t a ‘Man from Atlantis,’ I wouldn’t have been on ‘Dallas,’” the 70-year-old recently told Closer Weekly. “For starters, the producer of ‘Dallas,’ when he was creating the original show, [he] was filming a different one, right next door to me on ‘Man From Atlantis.’ He requested me to play the part of Bobby; I never auditioned for it.”

‘I DREAM OF JEANNIE’ STAR BARBARA EDEN RECALLS THE LAST TIME SHE SAW LARRY HAGMAN: ‘HE DIDN’T LOOK SICK’

“Had he not been there, next door to where I was doing ‘Atlantis,’ that opportunity may never have presented itself to me,” added Duffy. “So ‘Atlantis’ is very important in my career.”

“Man from Atlantis” chronicled the adventures of an amphibious man [Duffy], who was the last survivor of the legendary sunken city. It aired on NBC for one season between 1977 and 1978.

According to the outlet, the show was very similar to the 1961 Robert Heinlein novel “Stranger in a Strange Land,” which tells the story of Valentine Michael Smith, the sole survivor of a Mars colony who is brought to Earth. However, Duffy told the outlet that both stories were completely different.

“’Man from Atlantis’ wasn’t an adaptation,” he stressed. “Basically, it’s a recurring theme throughout most science fiction. ‘Man from Atlantis’ was that and I loved the opportunity to examine things with virginal eyes. In other words, we get so used to saying, ‘This is a plastic cup’ or ‘This is a recording device,’ but if you were from Planet-X, you had no idea what that was. You have to learn everything and that’s what ‘Man from Atlantis' was.”

‘GILLIGAN’S ISLAND’ STAR TINA LOUISE SHARES HOW THE SHOW 'REPRESENTED THIS GREAT ESCAPE'

“It was fun to play a superhero,” Duffy continued. “On top of that, obviously it was before almost all special effects, very little green screen, so everything we had to do was invented at the time. Now I look at the tentpole major features like ‘X-Men’ and all these other things and the special effects are phenomenal. Because we didn’t have that technology, if I was going to fly up somewhere, they had to hoist me up with a crane. It was fun.”

Duffy also shared that the series also came at the right time for audiences.

“There was the original George Reeves series ['Adventures of Superman'] where he was playing Superman,” Duffy explained. “There was simultaneous to ‘Man from Atlantis’ on the air, ‘The Six Million Dollar Man.’ But we were one of the first to not just be a strong detective or policeman, but someone with actual superpowers and tried to make that on a weekly television show basis. It was obviously difficult, because we only lasted two years, but I think we were pioneers in that sense.

“And there’s a clique of people who will never forget ‘Man from Atlantis.’ Usually, men come up to me and say, ‘I was 8 years old and tried to swim like you in the pool.’ So at an impressionable age, young people saw that show and never forgot it.”

‘HART TO HART’ STAR STEFANIE POWERS SAYS SHE AND ROBERT WAGNER ‘HELD EACH OTHER UP’ AFTER PARTNERS’ DEATHS

Back in 2006, Duffy told The Guardian why he initially left “Dallas,” which aired on CBS from 1978 until 1991.

“I quit because, at the end of seven years in an ensemble show with one leader, I thought, ‘I will be known as 'Dallas' starring Larry Hagman and the cast,’” he explained to the UK-based outlet at the time. “And at this point in my career — I was in my mid to late 30s — I thought, ‘Now is the time when it’s hottest for me to go out and establish my thing. So I had a meeting with Larry and with the producers. They all told me it was a really dumb choice to leave.”

When producer Leonard Katzman asked Duffy how he wanted to leave, the star said he “wanted to leave a hero,” but stressed he had zero intention of ever coming back.

“I wanted to leave knowing I couldn’t come back,” said Duffy. “I said I wanted to leave so that it’s not a trick from the audience. I didn’t want to disappear, or have my plane go down in the jungle.”

Bobby Ewing seemingly died in the last episode of Season 8 of ""Dallas"" in 1985. And Duffy’s career never took off after that.

“Larry would call me — he’d make fun of me,” recalled Duffy. “He’d say, ‘How you likin’ it out there?’ I would go to see the cats. We were close socially. I got a TV movie, but nothing major.”

Then Duffy got a phone call that would change everything.

“I got home and the message light was blinking,” said Duffy. “It was Larry. He said, ‘Let’s take a Jacuzzi and get drunk. I wanna talk to you.’”

Most recently, he’s filming the new TV movie “The Mistletoe Secret,” which is expected to come out next month."

Appearing on ""Outnumbered: Overtime"" with host Harris Faulkner, Ray said a full vote could have a significant impact in other legal battles.

""I've been saying for a long time their position legally in the cases that are pending -- mostly before the District Court in the District of Columbia -- would be enhanced if there was an impeachment vote in the House because the case law seems to suggest that they'll have, obviously, additional factual ammunition to be able to say it's the action of the entire body and precedent that will allow them a better argument to get access for -- among other things -- grand jury material,"" he said.

ARI FLEISCHER: 'PARTISAN IMPEACHMENT' WILL NEVER BE ACCEPTED BY THE AMERICAN PUBLIC

The White House insists that a formal House vote is necessary just to start the impeachment process, but Democrats are moving ahead without one, confident that they are backed by the Constitution and the president's own acknowledgment of trying to persuade a foreign government to investigate political rival former Vice President Joe Biden and his family.

In response to a letter from the Trump administration to House leaders, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said that, ""The White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the president's abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction. Mr. President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable.""

Recent Fox News polling finds that support for impeachment has shifted significantly. A poll conducted Sunday through Tuesday found 51 percent of Americans now say that the president should be impeached and removed from office in comparison to just 42 percent in July.

However, President Trump told reporters on Wednesday that the fight might be taken all the way up to the Supreme Court if Republicans don't ""get a fair shake.""

""On portions of this, he may well be right,"" Ray told Faulkner. ""There are issues about, for example, access to grand jury material. That particular issue is actually the subject of a pending partition before the United States Supreme Court that may result in the Supreme Court reviewing that issue.""

""There are issues about the pendency of this impeachment inquiry and the efforts by the House of Representatives that may well land before the Supreme Court,"" he said.

But, when it would happen is a different story.

Already feeling the heat with the book's publication still days away, Lack has begun his defense, penning a scathing letter to NBC News employees on Wednesday that took issue with Farrow’s claims.

“It disappoints me to say that even with passage of time, Farrow’s account has become neither more accurate, nor more respectful of the dedicated colleagues he worked with here at NBC News,"" Lack wrote in the memo obtained by Fox News. ""He uses a variety of tactics to paint a fundamentally untrue picture.”

That picture of Lack's tenure as it stands is already rife with accusations of mismanagement and boys' club behavior. Lack has been accused of botching a variety of sexual misconduct issues, ranging from his claim that Ronan Farrow’s award-winning coverage of Harvey Weinstein wasn’t fit to print to insisting that the investigation into Matt Lauer’s lewd workplace behavior be conducted by fellow NBC executives instead of an outside entity.

But allegations against Lack aren’t limited to covering up for the sexual misconduct of others, he’s also been accused of a variety of wrongdoings himself. The New York Post’s Page Six obtained an excerpt of Farrow’s book, “Catch and Kill,” which has long been expected to generate an onslaught of negative publicity for the beleaguered NBC News boss.

NBC NEWS BOSS ANDY LACK TAKES AIM AT FARROW'S CLAIMS HE WAS BLOCKED FROM REPORTING ON ALLEGED WEINSTEIN CRIMES

According to the Post, the book cites an alleged victim who claims that Lack “preyed on female underlings and pursued sexual relationships with them” throughout his career.

The Post also indicated that Farrow’s book features former CBS News anchor Jane Wallace openly discussing her 1980s affair with the then-married Lack while he was her executive producer and boss. Wallace reportedly told Farrow that Lack was “almost unrelenting” in his desire to take her out to dinner and celebrate her new contract – which led to a consensual sexual affair.

“What are you gonna say? You know if you say ‘I don’t want to celebrate with you,’ you’re asking for trouble,” Wallace says in the book, according to the Post. “I got worked over.”

The extramarital affair didn’t last, and Lack reportedly turned on his former fling.

“Eventually, Wallace claimed Lack bullied her out of the job she loved — and lorded his power over her — when their relationship soured,” Page Six reporter Sara Nathan wrote before noting that Farrow’s book details Wallace’s claim that she was intimidated into signing a binding nondisclosure agreement with a “substantial payout” to protect Lack.

According to the Post, Wallace told Farrow that she “loved that job” and reluctantly walked away because of Lack’s behavior.

A source close to Lack denied Wallace’s version of events, telling the Post “the charges of retaliation are just not true.”

MIKA BRZEZINSKI PUBLICLY SUPPORTED NEWS VET BROKAW AMID MISCONDUCT CLAIMS, PRIVATELY APOLOGIZED

Wallace isn’t the only extramarital sexual partner of Lack who spoke to Farrow, according to the Post.

A young production assistant reportedly told Farrow that she had an affair with Lack, but things got ugly once it ended. Farrow reportedly wrote that Lack wouldn’t allow her to be reassigned and “compelled her to work longer hours, and on weekends, and proposed she cancel vacations.”

Jennifer Laird told Farrow, “There’s clearly a reason you don’t get involved with your boss,” according to the Post.

“In the book, a rep denied Lack ever took retaliatory action against Laird,” Nathan wrote.

NBC News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In 2018 The Daily Beast published a bombshell report headlined, “Accused sexual harassers thrived under NBC News chief Andy Lack,” which detailed how scandals always seemed to emerge under his leadership.

MADDOW CELEBRATES NYT REPORTERS WHO EXPOSED WEINSTEIN SCANDAL, IGNORES HOW NBC SPIKED SAME STORY

Lack was the president of NBC News from 1993 until 2001 and returned to the Peacock Network in 2015 after top jobs at Sony Music and Bloomberg in between.

Citing sources, the Beast reported that Lack “protected a male employee who sexually harassed multiple women” when he was a Sony executive in between stints at NBC News.

While Lack was in power at Sony, music executive Charlie Walk reportedly sent “very graphic and totally inappropriate” pornography to female staffers, according to the Beast.

“Andy didn’t do anything,” a former Sony executive told the Beast.

NBC NEWS BOSS ANDY LACK SLAMMED FOR KEEPING SEX MISCONDUCT REVIEW IN-HOUSE

After Sony, Lack went to work running the Bloomberg Media Group, where he reportedly hinted at his longtime pal Lauer’s affairs well before he would return to NBC and fire the former “Today” co-host for sexual misconduct.

“During the Bloomberg years, according to two people who worked alongside Lack, he regularly boasted of his close friendship with Lauer and spoke of knowing that Lauer was unfaithful to his then-wife,” the Beast reported.

An NBC spokesperson disputed this when reached by the Beast last year.

Despite all of the issues surrounding Lack, he has a powerful longtime ally in Stephen Burke, the executive vice president of NBC’s parent Comcast and CEO of NBCUniversal. Burke defended Lack to The Daily Beast and an NBC insider told Fox News prior to excerpts from “Catch and Kill” emerging that Burke buys Lack’s narrative that Farrow has an axe to grind when it comes to the Peacock Network.

RONAN FARROW'S TEAM 'CONFIDENT IN THE FACTS' IN NEW #METOO BOOK, DISMISSES LEGAL THREAT FROM EX-NATIONAL ENQUIRER EDITOR

NBCUniversal did not immediately respond to a series of questions from Fox News, including whether or not the company and Burke still stand behind Lack and a request for comment on Farrow’s book in general.

Fox News has not seen Farrow’s “Catch and Kill,” which is scheduled to be released on Tuesday. In addition to new information regarding Lack’s personal wrongdoings, the book is expected to reveal other significant damaging information related to NBC News.

On Lack’s watch the now-disgraced Weinstein reportedly leveraged NBC executives to stop Farrow from exposing him as a sexual predator with scandalous information regarding Lauer.

The former “Today” anchor was ultimately fired weeks after Farrow exposed Weinstein in his Pulitzer Prize-winning piece that was published in The New Yorker after NBC passed on it.

‘TODAY’ ADDRESSES ‘APPALLING’ NEW MATT LAUER REPORT: 'IT’S JUST VERY PAINFUL'

""Weinstein made it known to the network that he was aware of Lauer's behavior and capable of revealing it,” Farrow wrote, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Lack refused to allow an outside counsel to investigate who knew about Lauer’s sexual wrongdoings. Instead of enlisting a white-shoe law firm – which has been standard for other news organizations dealing with sexual harassment during the #MeToo era – NBC allowed in-house General Counsel Kim Harris to conduct the review.

Harris’ internal review eventually declared that Lack and NBC management were completely oblivious to Lauer’s pervy behavior. The heavily criticized internal review contradicted the Beast report that Lack knew “Lauer was unfaithful” to his wife years before the #MeToo movement changed corporate culture across America.

LAUER DENIES GRAPHIC RAPE CLAIM, SAYS SEX WITH NBC NEWS COLLEAGUE 'COMPLETELY CONSENSUAL'

Farrow’s book will also contradict the internal review, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

“Farrow uncovers seven allegations of workplace sexual misconduct by Lauer that seem to contradict the network's stance that management had no knowledge of his behavior as well as seven nondisclosure agreements — many with hush-money payouts — to accusers of Lauer and others at NBC. Multiple Lauer accusers, including the woman whose complaint to NBC's human resources department resulted in the star's ouster, tell their stories in detail,” THR reporter Marisa Guthrie wrote. ""NBC maintains that it had no knowledge of Lauer's behavior before he was fired.""

Meanwhile, NBC News has still not explained how the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape of Donald Trump was leaked from within Lack’s news organization to the Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold just in time to potentially hurt Trump weeks before the 2016 election.

CLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM

Fahrenthold, like Farrow, won a Pulitzer Prize for reporting that NBC News passed on. The tape derailed the career of then-NBC host Billy Bush and Fahrenthold was later given a paid consultancy with NBC News.

Lack’s top deputy, NBC News president Noah Oppenheim, is an old college buddy of Fahrenthold from their time together at Harvard University. NBC has long denied that Oppenheim leaked the tape to Fahrenthold -- who with Oppenheim is also tied from Harvard to investor Marc Mezvinsky, the son-in-law of Hillary Clinton.

According to THR, which got access to the book, “Catch and Kill” will reveal that Clinton’s publicist Nick Merrill informed Weinstein that Farrow was poking around lewd accusations against him in the first place."

On the roster: Biden buoyed amid Trump attacks - Giuliani’s woes mount - Trump legal team trashes Gowdy - Dems divided on timing of impeachment vote - ‘This is a nudge to pick up the fudge’



BIDEN BUOYED AMID TRUMP ATTACKS

Fox News: “Together Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren capture the support of more than half of Democratic primary voters, according to the latest Fox News national poll on the 2020 election. Biden stays on top in the race with 32 percent support among primary voters, up 3 points since September. He’s followed by Elizabeth Warren at 22 percent -- that’s up 6 points and a new high for her. Bernie Sanders is at 17 percent, down 1 point since last month. While Biden’s support has stayed between 29-35 percent since March, his current 10-point advantage is about half of his 19-point lead in June. The rundown continues with Kamala Harris at 5 percent, Pete Buttigieg at 4 percent, Beto O’Rourke at 3 percent, and Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang each at 2 percent. Michael Bennet, Julian Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Tim Ryan, Tom Steyer, and Marianne Williamson receive 1 percent apiece.”



Biden’s firewall still strong - WaPo: “[Contrary] to the expectations of analysts, the fears of supporters and the hopes of rivals, Biden maintains a sizable loyal following. Nowhere is that more evident than in the African American community, recent interviews suggest, especially in states like South Carolina, which holds a crucial early primary. Martha Beck, a retired high school teacher from Charleston … gushed about Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) but said Sanders is ‘too old and grumpy and he just shouts at people all the time.’ And she doesn’t think the same country that elected [Donald] Trump would put Warren, or any other woman, in the White House four years later.”



Will any Dem dare mention the swampy stuff? - NYT: “It’s the one question about impeachment that no Democratic presidential candidate wants to answer head on. Should Joe Biden’s son Hunter have been allowed to sit on the board of a foreign company while his father served as vice president? In the past few weeks, Mr. Biden and his campaign team have spent significant amounts of time and energy denouncing any whiff of impropriety between his son’s work and his service as vice president. … So far, none of the Democratic primary candidates have taken a hard swing at Mr. Biden, focusing instead on the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump. But a few are, quite delicately, trying to raise some concerns. … In past debates, candidates who have taken on Mr. Biden’s personal characteristics, like his age, have faced blowback. The questions surrounding his son may be even more sensitive… Echoing an attack introduced and continually leveraged — in false ways — by Mr. Trump could risk raising Democrats’ ire.”



Jane Sanders takes starring role in husband’s campaign - NYT: “When it comes time to make critical decisions regarding his presidential campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders often relies on a committee of two: himself and his wife, Jane Sanders. … When doctors confirmed to her on Thursday that Mr. Sanders had suffered a heart attack, she said, it was her decision to wait until he was discharged the next day to release that information. And when it was time to say publicly that Mr. Sanders would be easing the pace of his campaigning after his heart attack, Ms. Sanders … stood beside him to explain the reason: His closest advisers, ‘especially me,’ had told him to slow down. … In a rare interview on Wednesday at their home in Burlington, Ms. Sanders said it would be ‘egotistical’ to call herself Mr. Sanders’s top adviser but allowed that she was ‘very much a close adviser.’ Above all, she said, she was ‘his wife.’”



Voter intensity on both sides through the roof - Gallup: “A year before the 2020 presidential election, roughly seven in 10 Democrats and Republicans say they have given ‘quite a lot of thought’ to the election. About half of political independents have done so. The lack of a Republican-Democratic difference in thought given to the election is notable because Republicans usually have an advantage over Democrats, including in each of the past seven final presidential pre-election surveys, as well as in most surveys conducted throughout presidential election years historically. The current results are based on combined data from interviews with more than 2,400 U.S. adults aged 18 and older, conducted between Aug. 15 and Sept. 30, 2019. Gallup has measured thought given to the election since 1952, and it has shown a relationship to actual voter turnout among all Americans in past elections.”

“It seldom happens in the negotiation of treaties, of whatever nature, but that perfect SECRECY and immediate DESPATCH are sometimes requisite.

TIME OUT: ‘A STATUE OF FLORENTINE BRONZE’

Paris Review: “In the late summer of 1866, a black equestrian stuntwoman made her Paris debut and galvanized the city. She was known only as ‘Sarah the African,’ and history has left us few traces of her: just some battered posters, inky clippings, and burlesque scripts. Sarah was, in the words of the men who wrote about her, ‘the finest horsewoman of the King of Morocco,’ ‘an Ethiopian,’ or ‘a statue of Florentine bronze.’ A ‘negress’ who performed as neither slave nor clown, whose name evoked Sarah Baartman, the Khoikhoi woman dissected by Georges Cuvier just a few decades before in Paris, and Selika, the queen heroine of Meyerbeer’s hit posthumous opera, L’Africaine. She was a woman named for a whole continent. … On her debut in September she was billed above Méphistophélès the bareback horse, above a race of forty horses all mounted by women, above the rubber horseman, William Meyer, and even above Mlle Adèle, who made her Sidy-Laraby dance with no reins.”

GIULIANI’S WOES MOUNT

ABC News: “The business relationship between President Donald Trump's private lawyer Rudy Giuliani and the men charged Thursday in a campaign finance scheme is a subject of the ongoing criminal investigation being conducted by federal authorities in New York, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The investigation became public after the FBI had to quickly move to arrest Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman before they boarded a flight out of the country from Washington Dulles Airport with one-way tickets. They have been named as witnesses in the ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Trump. The investigation is being conducted by the FBI's New York field office and prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, the same U.S. Attorney's office Giuliani ran before he became mayor of New York.”



Former Ambassador to Ukraine cites Giuliani pressure campaign - AP: “Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch told lawmakers Friday that President Donald Trump pressured the State Department to oust her from her position. Yovanovitch said in an opening statement obtained by The Associated Press that she was ‘abruptly’ recalled in May and told the president had lost confidence in her. She said she was told by an official that there was a ‘concerted campaign against me’ and that Trump had pressured officials to remove her for almost a year. ‘Although I understand that I served at the pleasure of the president, I was nevertheless incredulous that the U.S. government chose to remove an ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives,’ Yovanovitch wrote in the statement.”



Report: Trump pushed Tillerson to help a Giuliani client - WaPo: “President Trump sought to enlist then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in the fall of 2017 to work with Rudolph W. Giuliani to help stop the prosecution of a Turkish Iranian gold trader represented by the former New York mayor, according to people with knowledge of the request. Trump urged Tillerson in an Oval Office meeting to try to craft a diplomatic ‘deal’ to stop the U.S. case against Reza Zarrab on corruption charges in exchange for concessions from Turkey. The request shocked the then-secretary of state, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations involving the president. At the time, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was personally lobbying Trump to get the charges dropped. Trump, in turn, repeatedly raised the topic with Tillerson — including directly in the Oval Office meeting, according to people with knowledge of the episode.”



Pete Session’s political revival threatened by Ukraine role - NYT: “Former Representative Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican who is seeking a return to Congress, was caught in the fallout of the Ukraine scandal on Thursday when he was referred to in the indictment of two presidential allies accused of campaign finance allegations. Mr. Sessions, who served 11 terms in Congress until he was swept out last year, is described as ‘Congressman-1’ in the indictment of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were arrested and charged on Thursday with illegally funneling foreign money to American political candidates and campaigns. The two men are associates of Rudolph W. Giuliani… Mr. Sessions’s appearance in the indictment, which was filed just a week after he announced he would run for Congress in 2020, was an early and potentially damaging blow to his campaign. Mr. Sessions is not named in the indictment, nor is he accused of any wrongdoing. On Thursday, he issued a statement that denied any wrongdoing and said he had no knowledge of the scheme detailed by federal prosecutors.”



Continetti: We are all Ukrainians - Free Beacon: “From Varsity Blues to Jeffrey Epstein, from China and the NBA to Ukraine and Hunter Biden, Americans are taking a crash course on the ways in which powerful people manipulate the system for personal advantage and globalization merges political cultures as well as economies. What has been uncovered as impeachment rolls on does nothing to spur confidence in the integrity of our system. America is exceptional, but our elites are not. Today we are all Ukrainians.”



TRUMP LEGAL TEAM TRASHES GOWDY

Yahoo: “The president’s decision to bulk up his legal team with former South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy amid a widening impeachment inquiry is drawing criticism from one of his high-profile supporters. On Wednesday morning, the day after news leaked that Gowdy was set to serve as outside counsel to the president, Victoria Toensing, a veteran Washington lawyer who has been working with Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, expressed concern and disbelief that the onetime advocate for congressional oversight would be coming onboard. ‘Trey Gowdy doesn’t know s***,’ she said. … ‘He screwed up the Benghazi hearings, and he came out with the advice to Trump, ‘Well, if you’ve done nothing wrong, just talk to Bob Mueller.’’ Toensing and her husband, Joe diGenova, work with Giuliani though they are not officially on Trump’s legal team.”



And he can’t even join until January - WashEx: “Former Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy cannot join President Trump's legal team until early next year, the president announced Thursday. Speaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, Trump said, ‘Trey Gowdy is a terrific guy. I think there’s a problem with, he can’t start for another couple of months because of lobbying rules and regulations.’ It was only a day after Jay Sekulow, counsel to the president, announced Gowdy had joined the team to assist with the response to the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry. … Gowdy, 55, is a former federal prosecutor who retired from Congress on Jan. 3 after representing the 4th Congressional District of South Carolina for four terms. He then rejoined his old white-collar law firm, Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough. Despite his return to the legal profession, federal law prevents Gowdy from taking on Trump as a client in the impeachment fight until Jan. 3, 2020.”



DEMS DIVIDED ON TIMING OF IMPEACHMENT VOTE

Politico: “House Democrats are grappling with whether to take more steps to formalize their impeachment inquiry and silence a chief Republican criticism of their efforts, with competing factions beginning to emerge. President Donald Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill have hammered Speaker Nancy Pelosi for not holding a vote authorizing the House’s impeachment proceedings — arguing that without a vote, the entire process is illegitimate. Pelosi has refused to cave, dismissing Trump’s demand last week and insisting it is not required under the Constitution or House rules. And allies close to the speaker say her position hasn’t changed, describing the idea as the latest ‘Republican canard’ in a series of stall tactics the GOP will employ to protect Trump. … Yet some Democratic lawmakers and aides have begun to say privately — and, to a lesser extent, publicly — that the House should just vote to formalize the inquiry, robbing the GOP of its main talking point. The debate is threatening to cleave Democrats’ unified front as the White House makes the arcane procedural arguments the centerpiece of its impeachment defense.”



House members get an earful from voters back home - Politico: “The ‘Make America Great Again’ hats were in the front row Thursday night at freshman Rep. Anthony Brindisi’s first town hall event since Speaker Nancy Pelosi blessed an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. But for all the criticism the centrist Democrat faced from pro-Trump voters, the sharper questions came from his own supporters about why he is one of just seven in his caucus who has refused to endorse the impeachment push. … Swing-district Democrats doggedly avoided the impeachment debate when they first got to Washington. Now they can’t avoid it. … But at dozens of town halls over the two-week recess, Brindisi and other vulnerable freshmen had to fend for themselves — serving as the party’s on-the-ground voices on impeachment. Whether they can deliver a message that resonates could determine Democrats’ chances of winning over the public and holding on to their seats and the House majority in 2020.”



Independents’ support for impeachment jumps 10 points - NPR: “A slim majority of Americans now approve of the Democratic House-led impeachment inquiry into President Trump, a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finds. Fifty-two percent say they approve of the inquiry, while 43% disapprove. That's a slight increase in support from two weeks ago, when 49% approved and 46% disapproved. The numbers are in line with other polls that have been released this week also showing majority support or an increase in support for the inquiry. The uptick in support in the NPR poll comes mostly from a swing among independents. In late September, more independents disapproved of the inquiry than approved, by a 50-44% margin. Now, in a reversal, more independents approve of the inquiry than disapprove, by a 54-41% margin, a net change of 19 points. On the questions of whether Trump should be impeached or removed from office, Americans are split — 49-47% in favor of impeachment and 48-48% on whether the Senate should vote to remove him.”



ROMNEY STEPS UP HIS ROLE FOR GOP

Politico: “President Donald Trump wants to sideline Mitt Romney — but the Utah senator isn’t having it. Even as he faces a barrage of attacks from the president and his allies, Romney is mapping out plans to play a central role in 2020 — headlining party events, shelling out cash from his campaign war chest, and hitting up his donor network for vulnerable senators on the ballot next year.Later this month, Romney will take his most aggressive step yet to insert himself into the 2020 campaign when he hosts a New York City fundraiser for Maine Sen. Susan Collins, Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner and Michigan Senate hopeful John James. All are establishment-aligned figures confronting tough races in swing states. Behind the scenes, Romney’s team has also begun directing his donors to help GOP candidates in Senate battlegrounds. Romney aides say he's always intended to help in competitive Senate races and that his desire to do so has never been influenced by Trump’s efforts to ostracize him.”



Dems eye Chelsea Clinton for New York House seat - NYT: “Ms. [Nita] Lowey’s announcement set off a wave of speculation about other potential contenders, including Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, as well as a state assemblyman, David Buchwald. Last year, when asked if she envisioned running for elected office, Chelsea Clinton told The Journal News, which covers the Hudson Valley, that ‘if someone were to step down or retire,’ she would ‘have to think if it’s the right choice for me.’ Ms. Clinton did not mention any particular office, although she is clearly familiar with Ms. Lowey’s district: Her parents’ house in Chappaqua, N.Y., is in the district. Ms. Clinton herself does not live in Westchester, but congressional candidates are not required to live in the district they represent. A representative for Ms. Clinton did not return a request for comment. Mr. Buchwald said he would make an announcement within a few days.”



Ocasio-Cortez draws credible primary challenger - Fox News: “A prominent New York City Democrat filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) Thursday to launch a primary challenge for the House of Representatives seat currently held by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D.-N.Y. City Council member Fernando Cabrera said he believes a moderate Democrat such as himself could beat the socialist Ocasio-Cortez. He plans to target her far-left views and highlight his belief that she is a ‘no show’ in the district. ‘Only a Democrat is going to be able to defeat her, and it’s going to be a moderate Democrat,’ Cabrera, who represents a Bronx City Council district, told Politico. ‘She’s a no-show in the district. She hasn’t brought about anything except division within the party.’ ‘Socialism doesn’t work,’ Cabrera added.”



Pompeo ally steps aside in Kansas Senate race - The Wichita [Kan.] Eagle: “A Kansas business leader with longtime ties to Mike Pompeo will not run for U.S. Senate after weighing a bid for months — renewing speculation about whether the secretary of state will enter the race. Alan Cobb, the president and CEO of the Kansas Chamber of Commerce, in the past has said he would defer to Pompeo if the chief diplomat decided to mount a campaign. Cobb, a former Koch Industries lobbyist, advised Pompeo in 2014 during a congressional primary battle against former Rep. Todd Tiahrt. He made no mention of Pompeo in a lengthy statement Thursday announcing his decision. Cobb said that ‘after months of serious deliberation, analysis, and careful and prayerful consideration with friends, colleagues and my family, I have decided that the best place for me to pursue my passion is to remain as the President and CEO of the Kansas Chamber.’”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I need your help. I don’t get what is going on with the Syria/Turkey situation. I understand the following: Trump has proclaimed that he is pulling troops from Syria after what has been a long involvement (partnering) with the Kurds. But, that doesn’t happen overnight, right? Once Trump announced the pulling of troops, Turkey is waiting on the sideline frothing at the chance to attack. They then attack, even with threats from Trump that they better not or there will once again be sanctions. Now the number of Kurds killed are rolling in, but are our troops still there? If they are, what are they doing? Is there something that Trump picked up on that is going on with the Kurds? The conspiracist side of me thinks he sniffed something out. My husband is an Iowa farmer and I work in crop insurance. We don’t have many ties to the military but sure understand how government a lot of the time just doesn’t make sense. Any insight would be appreciated.” – E’Lise Bracker, Underwood, Iowa



[Ed. note: No conspiracy here, Ms. Bracker. The number of U.S. troops in the disputed area was very small – measured in dozens. They were not a credible threat in terms of actually combating Turkey’s forces but rather something of a marker. By having the troops there, we were telling the Turks to stay out and leave our Kurdish allies alone. It was a small-scale version of the U.S. forces in South Korea: To fight, the Turks would have had to kill Americans, thereby bring our military down on their heads. Upon the president’s order, the U.S. troops were quickly out of the Turks’ zone of aggression. The Americans went to Iraq and other U.S. spots in the region, clearing the way for the Turks to start pummeling their ancient Kurdish enemies.]



“I am a huge fan of the Halftime Report and never miss it! Your struggle to remain fairly balanced is appreciated, especially by this reader who also struggles mightily to find truth and facts amid the bias and innuendo currently being passed off as ‘news.’ But I am confused by most of the polls' questions (especially the polls you quote) that seem to ask a compound question: Do you favor impeachment and removal of President Trump? I was under the impression that these are two distinct question. That impeachment is like a grand jury investigation, i.e. a procedure (in the House) designed to decide whether there are grounds for a trial (by the Senate) to decide if removal is warranted or not. Am I wrong? Please explain! And keep up the good work!!!” – Tom Scherer, Udon Thani, Thailand



[Ed. note: This is an excellent question, Mr. Scherer! Different pollsters do indeed ask these questions in different ways. The complexity of the situation is partly to blame. An “impeachment inquiry” is not a thing. It’s like a couple being “pre-engaged.” But some pollsters have been asking about it, which tends to screw things up. Getting respondents to differentiate between an “impeachment inquiry” and “impeachment” is quite a lot of hair-splitting for civilians. Our poll does it the right way (obvi) and asks whether voters support impeachment, impeachment and removal or no impeachment. Those are the three constitutional possibilities. In our poll, 4 percent of respondents said they wanted the president impeached but not removed. That adds up to 55 percent favoring impeachment and 51 percent favoring removal.]



“All my teams have long gone home for the winter. So now we have your traditional Nine in the form of the quite surprising Cardinals playing your hometown Nationals (who should be the Senators and in the American League with Walter Johnson throwing flames, but oh, well). Where do your loyalties lie?” – Mary Carol Miller, Greenwood, Miss.



[Ed. note: Hometown!? Washington, D.C.!? My place of residence, certainly. And I do love living here. But c’mon, Doc! My hometown is Wheeling, W.Va. and the Cardinals, whose order I lustily joined as a boy when my family moved to St. Louis for four years, are my baseball team. I admire the Nats’ pluck and am grateful for the chance they are affording me to watch the National League Championship Series in person. But I love the Cardinals and am absolutely over the moon with this year’s squad. What a bunch! The infield alone may be the greatest since my glory days of fandom in the mid-1980s. Matt Carpenter is an absolute rock for the team and the personification of professionalism, Paul DeJong is a clutch player (whoever heard of a slugger shortstop?) who seems like he was born to be a Cardinal, Kolten Wong surfs second base like the pros ride waves at Honoli’i in his hometown and Paul Goldschmidt has shown in his tenacity, play and quality of his character that he is truly in the right uniform. And Yadi is nothing less than a national treasure. So suffice it to say: Viva el Birdos!]

‘THIS IS A NUDGE TO PICK UP THE FUDGE’

AP: “Officials in a southwest Missouri city are planting small flags in piles of abandoned dog poop as part of a campaign to get residents to clean up after their pets downtown. The Police Department in Springfield, Mo., posted photos of the flags in use on its Facebook page Wednesday. The flags contain messages such as, ‘Is this your turd? ‘Cuz that's absurd’ and ‘This is a nudge to pick up the fudge.’ The campaign started this week and the department noted on Facebook that leaving behind a pet's mess in many cases violates a city ordinance. The city's Environmental Services said the flags are made of bamboo and recycled paper and downtown crews will pick them up if they have to clean up pet waste.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“The whole debate arouses dismay, and not just because of the overreaching claims of both sides. One has an instinctive feeling that religion has a place in American public life, and that both sides misunderstand it—that between sectarianism and secularism lies something else.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the New Republic on April 9, 1984.

Embattled NBC News Chairman Andy Lack and his top deputy, Noah Oppenheim are reportedly “quivering in their suits,” while Zucker has denied any knowledge of Lauer’s transgressions and still sits atop the liberal CNN.

Zucker, who began his career at the Peacock Network, rose from NBC researcher all the way to president and CEO of NBC Universal. Along the way, he was the executive producer of “Today” when Lauer was hired in 1994.

NBC NEWS PRESIDENT MOCKED BY STAFFERS DURING FIERY MEETING ABOUT LAUER RAPE CLAIM

By 2001, Zucker was president of NBC Entertainment. In this role, he resumed oversight of Lauer -- then NBC’s biggest star -- and was frequently in touch with him about important matters related to “Today.”

A former NBC News employee with knowledge of Zucker’s relationship with Lauer feels the two shared a unique bond.

“They are very close friends. Jeff even did a Friars Club roast of Matt where he cracked jokes about Matt’s marital problems,” the former NBC News employee told Fox News. “At NBC, [Zucker] was the one person who could tell Matt to shut up.”

NBC NEWS BOSS ANDY LACK’S LEADERSHIP SCRUTINIZED AS RONAN FARROW TELL-ALL APPROACHES

At the 2008 roast, Zucker made several lewd remarks about Lauer.

“It’s just good to see Matt up here and not under my desk,” Zucker said from the podium, according to a media executive who attended. “I don’t want to say Matt is a germophobe, but he’s the only guy I know who uses Purell both before and after he masturbates.”

When Lauer was abruptly fired by NBC for sexual misconduct nine years later, in 2017, Zucker said at Business Insider’s Ignition conference that the news was ‘incredibly disturbing” and “heartbreaking.”

CNN, MSNBC IGNORE MATT LAUER RAPE ALLEGATIONS, NBC SCANDAL DURING PRIME TIME

""I've known Matt for 25 years and, I didn't know this Matt,” Zucker claimed at the time. “There was never a complaint about Matt. … There was never a suggestion of that kind of deviant or predatory behavior. There was never even a whisper of it.”

At the time, former CNN Chief White House Correspondent and USC Annenberg journalism professor Jessica Yellin said Zucker’s comments missed the point.

“This speaks to a problem with the culture and leadership of the workplace,” Yellin wrote in a scathing Twitter thread. “Creating a workplace in which women feel they can't report harassment isn't exonerating.”

Zucker’s comments at the conference mirrored the subsequent findings of a controversial internal review that NBC News launched to determine who knew about Lauer’s alleged misconduct. Lack insisted on keeping the investigation in-house, despite calls for an outside firm to take over. NBC General Counsel Kim Harris eventually declared that her colleagues were completely oblivious to Lauer’s supposed behavior.

ANDY LACK TAKES AIM AT FARROW'S CLAIMS HE WAS BLOCKED FROM REPORTING ON ALLEGED WEINSTEIN CRIMES

NBC declared that the investigation “found no evidence indicating that any NBC News or ‘Today’ show leadership” received any complaints about Lauer’s misconduct prior to the November 2017 complaint that resulted in his ousting. But once Lauer was fired, complaints began to surface and a 2017 New York Times report about a Lauer incident that allegedly happened during Zucker’s time at NBC was particularly shocking.

“One complaint came from a former employee who said Mr. Lauer had summoned her to his office in 2001, locked the door and sexually assaulted her,” The New York Times reported. “She told The Times that she passed out and had to be taken to a nurse.”

‘TODAY’ ADDRESSES ‘APPALLING’ NEW MATT LAUER REPORT: 'IT’S JUST VERY PAINFUL'

The CNN boss and Lauer are apparently still friends and the fallen morning show host reportedly attended Zucker’s magic-themed birthday bash earlier this year alongside Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo.

The New York Post, which first reported that a “relaxed-looking” Lauer attended the party, followed up with a report that Zucker was forced to shoot down rumors that Lauer would revive his career at CNN.

“Some staff were starting to freak out that Matt Lauer was suddenly about to come back from the dead and show up at CNN’s shiny new Manhattan office at Hudson Yards,” a CNN insider told the Post in May.

The insider added that “some senior female employees would refuse to work with him,” but the women of CNN weren’t put in that position after all. Zucker told concerned staffers that “there is absolutely no truth at all in the reports that Matt is coming to CNN,” according to the Post.

Lauer reportedly isn’t working for CNN anytime soon, but Zucker’s network gave his old pal a pass on prime-time coverage of the disgraced anchor’s latest scandal.

Ronan Farrow’s upcoming “Catch and Kill” contains a disputed claim that Lauer raped an NBC colleague during the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Japan. While NBC found the bombshell claim important enough to cover on its own “Nightly News” and “Today,” Zucker’s CNN completely ignored the story during prime time.

“Anderson Cooper 360,” “Cuomo Prime Time,” “CNN Tonight” and “White House in Crisis” failed to mention Lauer on Wednesday, according to a review of transcripts by Fox News.

CNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

He added that she was the ""most disingenuous person in politics ... after Hillary,"" a reference to his father's former opponent, Hillary Clinton.

Harris responded with an apparent attack on his father. ""You wouldn’t know a joke if one raised you,"" she tweeted.

Trump Jr. shot back with a comment on her poll numbers. ""Based on your tanking poll numbers, what’s definitely a joke is your entire campaign Yikes!"" he tweeted.

According to a Fox News poll from Oct. 6-8, Harris grabbed 15 percent of national Democratic primary voters' support, placing her fourth behind former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.

Harris saw a bump in polling over the summer after she took Biden to task over his controversial comments about race. But since then, she's seen drops in multiple polls,

Harris recently faced criticism for calling on Twitter to suspend President Trump's account. The senator sent a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, accusing the president of violating the company's terms of service.

""I believe the president's recent tweets rise to the level that Twitter should consider suspending his account,"" she said. ""When this kind of abuse is being spewed from the most powerful office in the United States, the stakes are too high to do nothing."""

Kamala Harris while moderating the network’s LGBTQ town hall in California earlier in the evening.

Cuomo, 49, began the Los Angeles event -- before an audience composed of members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer communities and their allies -- by welcoming Harris, D-Calif., to the stage.

Harris, following an LGBTQ custom, said her preferred pronouns were “she, her, and hers.""

“Mine too,” Cuomo quipped. But the comment drew negative reaction on social media.

""painfully awkward,"" one user wrote.

""It's cool that the dem nominees had an LGBTQ town hall where nobody challenged Chris Cuomo's disrespectful trans joke,"" another observer wrote.

Cuomo later apologized on Twitter, writing: “PLEASE READ: When Sen. Harris said her pronouns were she her and her's, I said mine too. I should not have. I apologize.

“I am an ally of the LGBTQ community, and I am sorry because I am committed to helping us achieve equality. Thank you for watching our townhall,” he wrote.

But even Cuomo's apology drew backlash.

""Fredo Cuomo grovels to the intolerant left like a good puppy,"" one commenter wrote.

Aside from Harris, eight other Democratic 2020 contenders took part in the CNN event.

Former Vice President Joe Biden began a sentence saying, “When I came out … ,” using a phrase commonly employed by those publicly identifying as LGBTQ for the first time.

“That would be news,” CNN's Anderson Cooper interjected, prompting Biden to walk across the stage to embrace him.



“I got something to tell you ... ,” Biden started to joke to Cooper, who is gay.

“I kind of figured it out a while ago,” Cooper replied.

Biden also responded to a question from Shannon Scott, a 10-year U.S. Air Force veteran, who claimed she had to choose between serving in the military and her identity as a transgender woman because of the Trump administration's policy on those diagnosed with gender dysphoria serving in the military.

Biden said he would change the Trump policy if elected president.

""If I were president, you would not have to choose,"" he said. ""Not a joke. You would not have to choose. The fact of the matter is that we're in a position where transgender men and women are in a position where they should be able to do anything anybody else in the world can do. There should be no difference.""

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., addressed a comment she made in 2012, in which she said she did not support the use of taxpayer money to fund transgender reassignment surgery for prison inmates.

""It was a bad answer,” Warren told the audience. “And I believe that everyone is entitled to medical care and medical care they need. And that includes people who are transgender who, it is the time for them to have gender affirming surgery. I just think that’s important.""

Harris said she would make stopping the spread of HIV/AIDs within a decade one of her top priorities if she becomes president.

Other Democrats taking part were Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro and businessman Tom Steyer."

The crowd erupted in applause before O'Rourke further explained.

""There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone or any institution, any organization in America, that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us,"" he said. ""So as president, we're going to make that a priority, and we are going to stop those who are infringing upon the human rights of our fellow Americans.""

In O'Rourke's ""Plan to Pursue Equality for LGBTQ+ People and Ensure They Can Live Openly Without Fear of Discrimination or Violence,"" he lists reversing the Trump administration's ""attempt to expand religious exemptions in order to enable discrimination or harm others.""

He adds, ""Freedom of religion is a fundamental right, but it should not be used to discriminate.""

Matt Lewis, CNN political commentator, tweeted out, ""This isn't going to help win the electoral college. If you wonder why so many Christians are willing to hold their nose and support someone as horrible as Donald Trump, this helps explain it.""

Luke Goodrich, vice president and senior counsel at Becket, a religious liberty law firm, called it ""blatantly unconstitutional,"" adding ""it's also foolish because those groups provide billions of dollars in essential social services to their communities. Churches and ministries should be allowed to hold centuries-old beliefs without fear of government retribution.""

And Hiram Sasser, general counsel for First Liberty Institute, told Fox News their faith-based organization has taken on the government before.

“When the Obama IRS came after pastors gathering together in conferences with Rick Perry support traditional marriage, we had to defend the pastors,” Sasser said. “We beat the IRS then and we would do it again if O’Rourke attacks churches with the IRS in the future.”

""It said in Micah, 'What do you want from your Lord, but what is it you want from your people?'"" he said.

""If there is an upset in Iowa, or even a close vote, and New Hampshire and it appears that Elizabeth Warren is the one that can beat Donald Trump, a lot of that vote will switch because a lot of the pro-Biden vote or the pro-any of the Democrats votes are based on anti-Trump,"" Sharpton said.

Together, Biden and Warren have captured the support of more than half of Democratic primary voters, according to the latest Fox News national poll on the 2020 election.

Biden is on top in the race with 32 percent support among primary voters, up 3 points since September. He’s followed by Warren at 22 percent -- up 6 points and a new high for her. Bernie Sanders is at 17 percent, down 1 point since last month.

NANCY PELOSI SAYS TRUMP'S RALLY COMMENTS ABOUT BIDEN 'BEYOND THE PALE,' RIPS SENATE REPUBLICANS' 'COWARDICE' ON IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

The question of recusal was raised by Rep. Thomas Masie, R-Ky., who asked if senators running for president “have a conflict of interest regarding possible impeachment of an opponent.”

House Democrats last month launched an impeachment inquiry into the circumstances surrounding President Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Democrats allege that Trump was using U.S. military aid to push Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s conduct in the country. Trump has said there was no quid pro quo and that he wanted only to root out corruption.

But as the inquiry consumes Washington and the 2020 campaign trail, it is possible the Democrat-controlled House votes to impeach the president in the coming months.

That would then set up an impeachment trial in the Senate, where a host of 2020 candidates -- including Sens. Klobuchar; Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; Kamala Harris, D-Calif.; Cory Booker, D-N.J.; and Michael Bennet, D-Colo.

It raises the question of whether they would benefit if their potential 2020 general election rival were removed from office -- and if so, if they should therefore recuse themselves from any trial.

“Shouldn’t they recuse themselves if it came to the Senate?” Massie asked. “Wouldn’t anyone so positioned against a defendant be barred from serving as a judge or jury in a court of law?”

Booker was asked on Friday if he would ever recuse himself, and he gave a short, simple answer: “No.”

In her answer, Klobuchar went into greater detail.

“I was elected as a U.S. senator for the state of Minnesota and my job will be to be a juror in the case and...I very strongly believe that this impeachment proceeding must go forward,” she said. “I don't know what counts that the House will come up with and what they will bring over to us but my job will be to look at the evidence and make a decision.”

Other senators have not addressed the question directly, but have no given any sign that they would recuse themselves. On Wednesday, Harris sent a letter with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., to every Trump cabinet official demanding they cooperate with ongoing investigations and preserve relevent evidence."

STAGE IS SET FOR RECORD-BREAKING DEMOCRATIC 2020 DEBATE

Maher also took aim at Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, the foreign-born associates of Rudy Giuliani who were arrested this week on campaign finance charges before allegedly attempting to flee the U.S.

""This is the great irony of the Trump presidency,"" Maher said. ""Foreign criminals must be kept out of the country at all costs, unless they're here to steal our elections.""

On the Trump impeachment inquiry, and Republicans' reluctance to cooperate with Democrat-led House committees, Maher quipped: ""The president of the United States is going to be impeached because he treats subpoenas like parking tickets.""

Maher also made the case that Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders were too ""far left"" to win the general election, and touted Sen. Amy Klobuchar as a ""dark horse"" who could potentially top the party's ticket.

Maher spoke to Klobuchar in a one-on-one interview. He argued that Klobuchar was ""plenty liberal"" but could actually beat President Trump.

""Obviously this is a fight between two wings of the party, which is almost every election. There is a center in the Democrat, a center-left wing. You're plenty liberal. You're plenty progressive,"" Maher told Klobuchar. ""And then there is a far-left which I think would be represented by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.""

Klobuchar would not address Warren and Sanders directly but clearly dismissed their platforms and pushed her center-left agenda.

""I want to win big and if someone is looking to kick one hundred forty nine million Americans off their current health insurance in four years then I'm not your candidate,"" Klobuchar said. ""If you want to use a bunch of hardworking people's money to send rich people's kids to college for free and I'm not your candidate. And just because people say ideas are bold doesn't mean they're bold. They may be bad.""

Maher also slammed former Vice President Joe Biden, saying he may be too old for the presidency, and that Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., wasn't doing well in the polls -- despite the media attention she's received after debate performances.

Klobuchar ripped Trump on his Ukraine phone call before making a case for her candidacy, saying ""she could bring in moderate Republicans"" and ""win big."" She is currently polling at 2 percent in the latest national Fox News Poll.

In an awkward moment, Maher emphasized that Klobuchar being a woman might help her chances as well.

""I'm saying it's a lot easier to be on the center side of things, as Obama was, if you are not a white man,"" Maher tried to clarify. ""If you're a white straight man.""

Homelessness in Los Angeles County and across Western states is skyrocketing. In 2019 so far, the number of homeless residents in Los Angeles has risen 12 percent from 2018, according to county statistics.

“We need a FEMA-like, Red Cross-like, National Guard-like [solution],"" said Rev. Andy Bales, the CEO of L.A.’s largest homeless shelter, Union Rescue Mission. ""Army Corps of Engineers needs to come and we need to figure out immediately how to get 44,000 people off the streets.""

Candidate plans that are more forward-looking, like five to 10 years down the road with millions of dollars in investment in affordable housing units, can be good in theory and are necessary, these advocates say, but don’t address “chronic” homelessness, or those who have lived out on the streets for six months or more in the past year.

HOMELESS MAN RANDOMLY PICKS UP 6-YEAR-OLD, SLAMS HIM ON CONCRETE: REPORT

“We’ve been doing $600,000 to $700,000 per person, per unit, and it’s planned over the next 10 years and that will not get it done,” Bales says. He added that only one candidate has reached out to him on how to remedy the situation.

Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary under President Obama Julian Castro and Beto O’ Rourke have actually visited homeless encampments on Skid Row, a notoriously expansive homeless encampment in downtown Los Angeles.

O’Rourke released a plan this week similar to Castro’s and Sen. Bernie Sanders’ plans, saying he wants to triple funding for homeless assistance grants through HUD providing $50 billion over the next 10 years, fully funding housing choice vouchers, capping rent increases, and pumping investment in dilapidated public housing units.

But for those who study the issue of homelessness, they say the problem should be coming up more in candidate rhetoric and dialogue as they campaign. It’s not so much to just have a job to maintain housing, they say, because rent prices have become so unsustainable.

“I think it’s becoming an intractable issue because we don’t have the investment and broader solutions to homelessness, which is why I think many of the presidential candidates are focused on affordable housing….it’s still something that’s just emerging and most of the candidates have not yet addressed,"" said Christopher Herring, a UCLA PhD student.

Herring said affordable housing is the main way to go, but there needs to be more steps done to prevent people from becoming homeless in the first place and notes that with Castro and Sanders’ plans, respectively, much of the dollar figures they’re proposing will be spent quickly and frivolously unless backed up by creating and maintaining affordable housing quickly and cost-efficiently.

""To put it another way, that expansion of the billions of dollars for homelessness in Castro and Sanders plans will be pissed away quickly and a waste of taxpayer money if not backed up by more robust structural reform in the production and preservation of affordable housing.""

TOMI LAHREN: CA DEMOCRATS IGNORING HOMELESS 'EPIDEMIC' IN FAVOR OF TRUMP IMPEACHMENT PUSH

California’s Democratic primary will be early in 2020, moving up to March from June, making the state in play again for candidates vying for the nomination with 500 delegates up for grabs.

Voters in the state have homelessness high on their list of issues. Some in Los Angeles county say it even trumps traffic and the environment in what needs to be fixed first in the city.

But ultimately, homeless people have very little, if any political power as a constituency, which could be why voters haven’t heard about the problem in states other than California.

“For the most part, the people who are experiencing homelessness are not voting, at least they’re not voting en masse, they don’t have a strong political voice, they don’t have political champions, and elected officials who are sensitive to what their constituents want or else they’re going to get voted out of office, it’s not a constituency they have to pay a lot of attention to,” said Adam Murray, executive director of LA’s Inner City Law Center.

California senator and presidential candidate Kamala Harris is supporting a bill in the Senate to provide $13 billion in emergency relief to areas affected by chronic homelessness over the next five years. But Republicans are unlikely to bring it up for a vote, citing the huge price tag.

Harris has blamed the Trump administration for cutting off funding to support what local government needs around affordable housing.

President Trump, on the other hand, has spoken about the issue on Twitter and at his rallies numerous times, largely in irreverent tones.

At a rally in Cincinnati in August, he said, ""What they are doing to our beautiful California is a disgrace to our country...It's a shame. The world is looking at it. Look at Los Angeles with the tents and the horrible, horrible conditions. Look at San Francisco, look at some of your other cities.""

Herring says California needs a federal response like what Trump is suggesting, saying, ""Trump has drawn attention to this and it’s woken up the Democratic candidates to putting forward and putting pressure on them to make real solutions.”"

Harris spoke with The Guardian in a candid interview about her various film roles and her upcoming part in Daniel Craig’s final outing as James Bond in “No Time To Die.” During the lengthy interview, she casually revealed she was less-than-honest in the past when she claimed she never experienced racism or sexism in show business.

Harris, 43, said that the incident took place while she was in her mid-20s, but didn’t elaborate as to what the audition was for or who the actor was.

She went on to note that she believes her Cambridge education shielded her from a lot of other sexual advances in show business saying, ""I think there is an immediate assumption that you have a brain.""

In California, that day is nowhere in sight. With the passage of a bill designed to force untold thousands of independent contractors to reclassify as employees, California moves closer to the brink economic.

Many parts of California are really quite beautiful. As a longtime resident, the blue skies, great weather and unbeatable landscape, from the coast to the mountains, make it hard to contemplate ever leaving. The California Legislature, on the other hand, is compelling all but the rich and members of unions to leave.

California, of course, is beset with fiscal problems. As I have written elsewhere, California is unsustainable. California features one of the highest tax and regulatory burdens in America, if not the world. California has the highest income tax rate, one of the highest sales tax rates, and Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom (who wants to be your president one day) wants to raise property taxes by taking away tax protections for business properties. If his measure passes, those taxes will be an added burden on businesses and consumers throughout the state.

TUCKER CARLSON: CALIFORNIA, ONCE A SYMBOL OF THE AMERICAN DREAM, NOW REPRESENTS EVERYTHING THAT'S WRONG

Of course, California is likely the most regulated state in the world. California’s global warming law, the most strict in the world, isn’t the only factor. Estimates suggests that it costs $800,000 to build a home in California equal to a $300,000 home in Texas. A good deal of those costs are a result of the California Environmental Quality Act and related litigation.

Beyond contributing to the housing crisis in the state, all those regulations are driving up energy costs. Combined with forcing utilities to pay for wildfire protections, renewable energy mandates are causing rate increases that exceed 6 percent in some cases.

It's little wonder California's middle class is being hollowed out. One recent headline reported, ""Californians fed up with housing costs and taxes are fleeing state in big numbers."" For years, that departing middle class has been replaced by those who are far more dependent on government programs, including those who come over the border illegally.

As if those problems aren’t bad enough, California also has more debt than any other state. Government pension debt alone likely exceeds $1 trillion, and combined state and local government debt surely exceeds $2 trillion. There is also infrastructure debt. Years ago, the Bay Area Council Economic Institute pegged “the cost of California’s unfunded infrastructure needs at up to $737 billion and possibly as much as $765 billion.”

It should be no surprise that businesses large and small are leaving the state. Why would they stick around to foot the tax bills for huge debts? It’s so bad that it wouldn't be surprising to see California Democrats seek to impose a personal and business wealth tax within the next decade.

You would think that California’s ruling Democratic Party might be concerned about keeping as many jobs as possible in the state. After all, jobs represent a critical tax base, and when people are working, they are far less likely to be on government assistance. Considering California represents just 16 percent of the country's population but boasts roughly 30 percent of America's welfare recipients, that is no minor concern.

Alas, that is not the case. The latest dagger driven employers' hearts is a law that, in large part, ends the use of independent contractors by employers and businesses. Simply stated, if a business wants to hire the services of an individual, and those services are part of the normal business of the employer — say, a tech company wants to hire a person who writes computer code — that person must be made an employee of the company.

According to Newsom, the new law ""is an important step."" He added, ""The next step is creating pathways for more workers to form a union, collectively bargain to earn more and have a stronger voice at work.""

It's too bad that during Newsom's charmed, elite upbringing, he had been taught simple economics.

You see, the more something costs, the less of it you get. It's why low-price cars outsell high-price cars, such as Ford over Bentley. It is called the ""law of demand"" in economics. That is why a rising minimum wage results in automation and a reduced number of those employed at that wage.

In California, it is estimated that the costs of an employee exceed the cost of an independent contractor by at least 30 percent. Imagine that if you are an employer. All of history and economics, not to mention just plain common sense, will tell you people are going to lose their jobs.

In other words, the real-world effect of the politicians will be exactly the opposite of what they “claim” to want. At least Newsom is honest enough to mention this new law is about unionization. Meanwhile, from higher energy costs to higher taxes and even more lost jobs, California is killing off more jobs and therefore its middle class.

On one last note, California is the land of Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris. They want to run your country with the policies that California has in place now. Just think about that while you are ""California dreaming.""

President Trump on Friday announced that McAleenan would be leaving the job to spend more time with his family, and added that the new acting secretary would be announced next week.

CUCCINELLI PUTS HARDLINE STAMP ON IMMIGRATION AGENDA, JUST 2 MONTHS INTO USCIS JOB

“Many wonderful candidates,” he said.

The announcement immediately led to speculation as to who would step into the vital cabinet position -- one that is a central post for the nation's immigration policy.

A former senior DHS official with close ties to the administration told Fox News Friday that Cuccinelli is on the top of Trump’s list to be the next acting secretary. The source noted that a Senate confirmation hearing would be bruising for Cuccinelli but ""he, [White House adviser] Steve Miller and Trump are all in sync on a number of key policies.

""They have been trying to clear the way for a while,"" the source said.

If Trump doesn’t go with Cuccinelli, the source said Trump may go with former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach -- another hardliner who has long been floated for a possible administration position but is currently running for the U.S. Senate.

One administration official told Fox News on Saturday that Cuccinelli was in “good standing” for the position.

“Ken has been very effective on the regulatory side and he has proven to be a team player who will do every media hit no matter how small or how hostile,” the official said. “Ken is someone who hands-down supports and defends the work of the president and the administration.”

Trump may face some resistance from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has in the past indicated his ""lack of enthusiasm"" for Cuccinelli. That could make getting Cuccinelli confirmed difficult. Cuccinelli was previously president of the Senate Conservatives Fund, which seeks to push more conservative Senate candidates and was therefore often critical of McConnell and his allies.

""I've not spoken to [Trump] about any of them. I have expressed my, shall I say, lack of enthusiasm for one of them ... Ken Cuccinelli,"" McConnell told reporters in April when Cuccinelli was floated to replace former DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, according to The Hill.

A Cuccinelli pick would also face significant opposition from Senate Democrats. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., declared Cuccinelli ""unfit"" to lead USCIS in August after old remarks emerged of the former Virginia attorney general calling illegal immigrants ""foreign invaders.""

However, a Cuccinelli pick would be welcomed by many conservatives, particularly those focused on immigration and who didn't warm to McAleenan. As head of USCIS since the summer -- an often overlooked agency that deals with bureaucratic issues to do with green card applications and citizenship requests -- Cuccinneli put a hardline stamp on the agency with policies that picked up national attention.

TRUMP ANNOUNCES ACTING HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY MCALEENAN TO LEAVE POST

Perhaps the most striking of those changes was the “public charge” rule that toughened and clarified guidance for officials as to when they should deny green cards to immigrants deemed likely to rely on government welfare.

The rule defined public charge as an immigrant who receives one or more designated benefits for more than 12 months within a 36-month period. It also expanded the number of benefits that could be considered. On Friday, however, the rule was dealt a setback when a federal judge issued a nationwide injunction blocking it from being implemented.

“An objective judiciary will see that this rule lies squarely within long-held existing law,” Cuccinelli said in response.

In addition to public charge, Cuccinelli has also pushed a number of significant, and often controversial, changes. Buzzfeed News reported last month that he sought the power to publicize information about migrants being prosecuted for certain crimes. His agency has also tightened rules for awarding work permits to immigrants allowed into the U.S. for humanitarian reasons and has also cut the two-day window between detention and interview to one.

He has also not shied away from the media glare and from wading into controversies when defending the administration, something that may endear him to the president.

In August, in defending the public charge rule, he faced questions from reporters that the public charge rule was not in keeping with Emma Lazarus’ “The New Colossus” -- a sonnet added to the bottom of the Statue of Liberty that has become known for the line: “give me your tired and poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free...”

Asked separately about the poem’s reference to “wretched refuse,” Cuccinelli commented that the poem was ""referring back to people coming from Europe where they had class-based societies where people were considered wretched if they weren’t in the right class."" That remark sparked controversy from figures from 2020 hopeful Beto O’Rourke to pop singer Rihanna.

Cuccinelli has used his Twitter account (which he operates himself) to challenge the executive of Montgomery County, Md., to a debate over “sanctuary city” policies after a series of sex crimes allegedly perpetrated by illegal immigrants.

“I’ll defend children and crime victims, Elrich can defend rapists and murders who shouldn’t even be in this country,” he said.

He has also supported the use of “illegal aliens” to refer to illegal immigrants in U.S. law, even as McAleenan shied away from that term. Measures like that have earned him a reputation that has endeared him to groups in favor of tougher restrictions on immigration.

""The choice is clear, he must elevate Ken Cuccinelli,"" RJ Hauman, government relations director at the restrictionist Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), told Politico. ""The president understands that the opposition seeks to stop his efforts to secure the border and restore control over our nation’s immigration system through court orders and injunctions. What better force to stop this than the former attorney general of Virginia and one of the most skilled appellate lawyers in the country?""

On the roster: Biden buoyed amid Trump attacks - Giuliani’s woes mount - Trump legal team trashes Gowdy - Dems divided on timing of impeachment vote - ‘This is a nudge to pick up the fudge’



BIDEN BUOYED AMID TRUMP ATTACKS

Fox News: “Together Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren capture the support of more than half of Democratic primary voters, according to the latest Fox News national poll on the 2020 election. Biden stays on top in the race with 32 percent support among primary voters, up 3 points since September. He’s followed by Elizabeth Warren at 22 percent -- that’s up 6 points and a new high for her. Bernie Sanders is at 17 percent, down 1 point since last month. While Biden’s support has stayed between 29-35 percent since March, his current 10-point advantage is about half of his 19-point lead in June. The rundown continues with Kamala Harris at 5 percent, Pete Buttigieg at 4 percent, Beto O’Rourke at 3 percent, and Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang each at 2 percent. Michael Bennet, Julian Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Tim Ryan, Tom Steyer, and Marianne Williamson receive 1 percent apiece.”



Biden’s firewall still strong - WaPo: “[Contrary] to the expectations of analysts, the fears of supporters and the hopes of rivals, Biden maintains a sizable loyal following. Nowhere is that more evident than in the African American community, recent interviews suggest, especially in states like South Carolina, which holds a crucial early primary. Martha Beck, a retired high school teacher from Charleston … gushed about Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) but said Sanders is ‘too old and grumpy and he just shouts at people all the time.’ And she doesn’t think the same country that elected [Donald] Trump would put Warren, or any other woman, in the White House four years later.”



Will any Dem dare mention the swampy stuff? - NYT: “It’s the one question about impeachment that no Democratic presidential candidate wants to answer head on. Should Joe Biden’s son Hunter have been allowed to sit on the board of a foreign company while his father served as vice president? In the past few weeks, Mr. Biden and his campaign team have spent significant amounts of time and energy denouncing any whiff of impropriety between his son’s work and his service as vice president. … So far, none of the Democratic primary candidates have taken a hard swing at Mr. Biden, focusing instead on the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump. But a few are, quite delicately, trying to raise some concerns. … In past debates, candidates who have taken on Mr. Biden’s personal characteristics, like his age, have faced blowback. The questions surrounding his son may be even more sensitive… Echoing an attack introduced and continually leveraged — in false ways — by Mr. Trump could risk raising Democrats’ ire.”



Jane Sanders takes starring role in husband’s campaign - NYT: “When it comes time to make critical decisions regarding his presidential campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders often relies on a committee of two: himself and his wife, Jane Sanders. … When doctors confirmed to her on Thursday that Mr. Sanders had suffered a heart attack, she said, it was her decision to wait until he was discharged the next day to release that information. And when it was time to say publicly that Mr. Sanders would be easing the pace of his campaigning after his heart attack, Ms. Sanders … stood beside him to explain the reason: His closest advisers, ‘especially me,’ had told him to slow down. … In a rare interview on Wednesday at their home in Burlington, Ms. Sanders said it would be ‘egotistical’ to call herself Mr. Sanders’s top adviser but allowed that she was ‘very much a close adviser.’ Above all, she said, she was ‘his wife.’”



Voter intensity on both sides through the roof - Gallup: “A year before the 2020 presidential election, roughly seven in 10 Democrats and Republicans say they have given ‘quite a lot of thought’ to the election. About half of political independents have done so. The lack of a Republican-Democratic difference in thought given to the election is notable because Republicans usually have an advantage over Democrats, including in each of the past seven final presidential pre-election surveys, as well as in most surveys conducted throughout presidential election years historically. The current results are based on combined data from interviews with more than 2,400 U.S. adults aged 18 and older, conducted between Aug. 15 and Sept. 30, 2019. Gallup has measured thought given to the election since 1952, and it has shown a relationship to actual voter turnout among all Americans in past elections.”

“It seldom happens in the negotiation of treaties, of whatever nature, but that perfect SECRECY and immediate DESPATCH are sometimes requisite.

TIME OUT: ‘A STATUE OF FLORENTINE BRONZE’

Paris Review: “In the late summer of 1866, a black equestrian stuntwoman made her Paris debut and galvanized the city. She was known only as ‘Sarah the African,’ and history has left us few traces of her: just some battered posters, inky clippings, and burlesque scripts. Sarah was, in the words of the men who wrote about her, ‘the finest horsewoman of the King of Morocco,’ ‘an Ethiopian,’ or ‘a statue of Florentine bronze.’ A ‘negress’ who performed as neither slave nor clown, whose name evoked Sarah Baartman, the Khoikhoi woman dissected by Georges Cuvier just a few decades before in Paris, and Selika, the queen heroine of Meyerbeer’s hit posthumous opera, L’Africaine. She was a woman named for a whole continent. … On her debut in September she was billed above Méphistophélès the bareback horse, above a race of forty horses all mounted by women, above the rubber horseman, William Meyer, and even above Mlle Adèle, who made her Sidy-Laraby dance with no reins.”

GIULIANI’S WOES MOUNT

ABC News: “The business relationship between President Donald Trump's private lawyer Rudy Giuliani and the men charged Thursday in a campaign finance scheme is a subject of the ongoing criminal investigation being conducted by federal authorities in New York, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The investigation became public after the FBI had to quickly move to arrest Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman before they boarded a flight out of the country from Washington Dulles Airport with one-way tickets. They have been named as witnesses in the ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Trump. The investigation is being conducted by the FBI's New York field office and prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, the same U.S. Attorney's office Giuliani ran before he became mayor of New York.”



Former Ambassador to Ukraine cites Giuliani pressure campaign - AP: “Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch told lawmakers Friday that President Donald Trump pressured the State Department to oust her from her position. Yovanovitch said in an opening statement obtained by The Associated Press that she was ‘abruptly’ recalled in May and told the president had lost confidence in her. She said she was told by an official that there was a ‘concerted campaign against me’ and that Trump had pressured officials to remove her for almost a year. ‘Although I understand that I served at the pleasure of the president, I was nevertheless incredulous that the U.S. government chose to remove an ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives,’ Yovanovitch wrote in the statement.”



Report: Trump pushed Tillerson to help a Giuliani client - WaPo: “President Trump sought to enlist then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in the fall of 2017 to work with Rudolph W. Giuliani to help stop the prosecution of a Turkish Iranian gold trader represented by the former New York mayor, according to people with knowledge of the request. Trump urged Tillerson in an Oval Office meeting to try to craft a diplomatic ‘deal’ to stop the U.S. case against Reza Zarrab on corruption charges in exchange for concessions from Turkey. The request shocked the then-secretary of state, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations involving the president. At the time, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was personally lobbying Trump to get the charges dropped. Trump, in turn, repeatedly raised the topic with Tillerson — including directly in the Oval Office meeting, according to people with knowledge of the episode.”



Pete Session’s political revival threatened by Ukraine role - NYT: “Former Representative Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican who is seeking a return to Congress, was caught in the fallout of the Ukraine scandal on Thursday when he was referred to in the indictment of two presidential allies accused of campaign finance allegations. Mr. Sessions, who served 11 terms in Congress until he was swept out last year, is described as ‘Congressman-1’ in the indictment of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were arrested and charged on Thursday with illegally funneling foreign money to American political candidates and campaigns. The two men are associates of Rudolph W. Giuliani… Mr. Sessions’s appearance in the indictment, which was filed just a week after he announced he would run for Congress in 2020, was an early and potentially damaging blow to his campaign. Mr. Sessions is not named in the indictment, nor is he accused of any wrongdoing. On Thursday, he issued a statement that denied any wrongdoing and said he had no knowledge of the scheme detailed by federal prosecutors.”



Continetti: We are all Ukrainians - Free Beacon: “From Varsity Blues to Jeffrey Epstein, from China and the NBA to Ukraine and Hunter Biden, Americans are taking a crash course on the ways in which powerful people manipulate the system for personal advantage and globalization merges political cultures as well as economies. What has been uncovered as impeachment rolls on does nothing to spur confidence in the integrity of our system. America is exceptional, but our elites are not. Today we are all Ukrainians.”



TRUMP LEGAL TEAM TRASHES GOWDY

Yahoo: “The president’s decision to bulk up his legal team with former South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy amid a widening impeachment inquiry is drawing criticism from one of his high-profile supporters. On Wednesday morning, the day after news leaked that Gowdy was set to serve as outside counsel to the president, Victoria Toensing, a veteran Washington lawyer who has been working with Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, expressed concern and disbelief that the onetime advocate for congressional oversight would be coming onboard. ‘Trey Gowdy doesn’t know s***,’ she said. … ‘He screwed up the Benghazi hearings, and he came out with the advice to Trump, ‘Well, if you’ve done nothing wrong, just talk to Bob Mueller.’’ Toensing and her husband, Joe diGenova, work with Giuliani though they are not officially on Trump’s legal team.”



And he can’t even join until January - WashEx: “Former Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy cannot join President Trump's legal team until early next year, the president announced Thursday. Speaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, Trump said, ‘Trey Gowdy is a terrific guy. I think there’s a problem with, he can’t start for another couple of months because of lobbying rules and regulations.’ It was only a day after Jay Sekulow, counsel to the president, announced Gowdy had joined the team to assist with the response to the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry. … Gowdy, 55, is a former federal prosecutor who retired from Congress on Jan. 3 after representing the 4th Congressional District of South Carolina for four terms. He then rejoined his old white-collar law firm, Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough. Despite his return to the legal profession, federal law prevents Gowdy from taking on Trump as a client in the impeachment fight until Jan. 3, 2020.”



DEMS DIVIDED ON TIMING OF IMPEACHMENT VOTE

Politico: “House Democrats are grappling with whether to take more steps to formalize their impeachment inquiry and silence a chief Republican criticism of their efforts, with competing factions beginning to emerge. President Donald Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill have hammered Speaker Nancy Pelosi for not holding a vote authorizing the House’s impeachment proceedings — arguing that without a vote, the entire process is illegitimate. Pelosi has refused to cave, dismissing Trump’s demand last week and insisting it is not required under the Constitution or House rules. And allies close to the speaker say her position hasn’t changed, describing the idea as the latest ‘Republican canard’ in a series of stall tactics the GOP will employ to protect Trump. … Yet some Democratic lawmakers and aides have begun to say privately — and, to a lesser extent, publicly — that the House should just vote to formalize the inquiry, robbing the GOP of its main talking point. The debate is threatening to cleave Democrats’ unified front as the White House makes the arcane procedural arguments the centerpiece of its impeachment defense.”



House members get an earful from voters back home - Politico: “The ‘Make America Great Again’ hats were in the front row Thursday night at freshman Rep. Anthony Brindisi’s first town hall event since Speaker Nancy Pelosi blessed an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. But for all the criticism the centrist Democrat faced from pro-Trump voters, the sharper questions came from his own supporters about why he is one of just seven in his caucus who has refused to endorse the impeachment push. … Swing-district Democrats doggedly avoided the impeachment debate when they first got to Washington. Now they can’t avoid it. … But at dozens of town halls over the two-week recess, Brindisi and other vulnerable freshmen had to fend for themselves — serving as the party’s on-the-ground voices on impeachment. Whether they can deliver a message that resonates could determine Democrats’ chances of winning over the public and holding on to their seats and the House majority in 2020.”



Independents’ support for impeachment jumps 10 points - NPR: “A slim majority of Americans now approve of the Democratic House-led impeachment inquiry into President Trump, a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finds. Fifty-two percent say they approve of the inquiry, while 43% disapprove. That's a slight increase in support from two weeks ago, when 49% approved and 46% disapproved. The numbers are in line with other polls that have been released this week also showing majority support or an increase in support for the inquiry. The uptick in support in the NPR poll comes mostly from a swing among independents. In late September, more independents disapproved of the inquiry than approved, by a 50-44% margin. Now, in a reversal, more independents approve of the inquiry than disapprove, by a 54-41% margin, a net change of 19 points. On the questions of whether Trump should be impeached or removed from office, Americans are split — 49-47% in favor of impeachment and 48-48% on whether the Senate should vote to remove him.”



ROMNEY STEPS UP HIS ROLE FOR GOP

Politico: “President Donald Trump wants to sideline Mitt Romney — but the Utah senator isn’t having it. Even as he faces a barrage of attacks from the president and his allies, Romney is mapping out plans to play a central role in 2020 — headlining party events, shelling out cash from his campaign war chest, and hitting up his donor network for vulnerable senators on the ballot next year.Later this month, Romney will take his most aggressive step yet to insert himself into the 2020 campaign when he hosts a New York City fundraiser for Maine Sen. Susan Collins, Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner and Michigan Senate hopeful John James. All are establishment-aligned figures confronting tough races in swing states. Behind the scenes, Romney’s team has also begun directing his donors to help GOP candidates in Senate battlegrounds. Romney aides say he's always intended to help in competitive Senate races and that his desire to do so has never been influenced by Trump’s efforts to ostracize him.”



Dems eye Chelsea Clinton for New York House seat - NYT: “Ms. [Nita] Lowey’s announcement set off a wave of speculation about other potential contenders, including Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, as well as a state assemblyman, David Buchwald. Last year, when asked if she envisioned running for elected office, Chelsea Clinton told The Journal News, which covers the Hudson Valley, that ‘if someone were to step down or retire,’ she would ‘have to think if it’s the right choice for me.’ Ms. Clinton did not mention any particular office, although she is clearly familiar with Ms. Lowey’s district: Her parents’ house in Chappaqua, N.Y., is in the district. Ms. Clinton herself does not live in Westchester, but congressional candidates are not required to live in the district they represent. A representative for Ms. Clinton did not return a request for comment. Mr. Buchwald said he would make an announcement within a few days.”



Ocasio-Cortez draws credible primary challenger - Fox News: “A prominent New York City Democrat filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) Thursday to launch a primary challenge for the House of Representatives seat currently held by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D.-N.Y. City Council member Fernando Cabrera said he believes a moderate Democrat such as himself could beat the socialist Ocasio-Cortez. He plans to target her far-left views and highlight his belief that she is a ‘no show’ in the district. ‘Only a Democrat is going to be able to defeat her, and it’s going to be a moderate Democrat,’ Cabrera, who represents a Bronx City Council district, told Politico. ‘She’s a no-show in the district. She hasn’t brought about anything except division within the party.’ ‘Socialism doesn’t work,’ Cabrera added.”



Pompeo ally steps aside in Kansas Senate race - The Wichita [Kan.] Eagle: “A Kansas business leader with longtime ties to Mike Pompeo will not run for U.S. Senate after weighing a bid for months — renewing speculation about whether the secretary of state will enter the race. Alan Cobb, the president and CEO of the Kansas Chamber of Commerce, in the past has said he would defer to Pompeo if the chief diplomat decided to mount a campaign. Cobb, a former Koch Industries lobbyist, advised Pompeo in 2014 during a congressional primary battle against former Rep. Todd Tiahrt. He made no mention of Pompeo in a lengthy statement Thursday announcing his decision. Cobb said that ‘after months of serious deliberation, analysis, and careful and prayerful consideration with friends, colleagues and my family, I have decided that the best place for me to pursue my passion is to remain as the President and CEO of the Kansas Chamber.’”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I need your help. I don’t get what is going on with the Syria/Turkey situation. I understand the following: Trump has proclaimed that he is pulling troops from Syria after what has been a long involvement (partnering) with the Kurds. But, that doesn’t happen overnight, right? Once Trump announced the pulling of troops, Turkey is waiting on the sideline frothing at the chance to attack. They then attack, even with threats from Trump that they better not or there will once again be sanctions. Now the number of Kurds killed are rolling in, but are our troops still there? If they are, what are they doing? Is there something that Trump picked up on that is going on with the Kurds? The conspiracist side of me thinks he sniffed something out. My husband is an Iowa farmer and I work in crop insurance. We don’t have many ties to the military but sure understand how government a lot of the time just doesn’t make sense. Any insight would be appreciated.” – E’Lise Bracker, Underwood, Iowa



[Ed. note: No conspiracy here, Ms. Bracker. The number of U.S. troops in the disputed area was very small – measured in dozens. They were not a credible threat in terms of actually combating Turkey’s forces but rather something of a marker. By having the troops there, we were telling the Turks to stay out and leave our Kurdish allies alone. It was a small-scale version of the U.S. forces in South Korea: To fight, the Turks would have had to kill Americans, thereby bring our military down on their heads. Upon the president’s order, the U.S. troops were quickly out of the Turks’ zone of aggression. The Americans went to Iraq and other U.S. spots in the region, clearing the way for the Turks to start pummeling their ancient Kurdish enemies.]



“I am a huge fan of the Halftime Report and never miss it! Your struggle to remain fairly balanced is appreciated, especially by this reader who also struggles mightily to find truth and facts amid the bias and innuendo currently being passed off as ‘news.’ But I am confused by most of the polls' questions (especially the polls you quote) that seem to ask a compound question: Do you favor impeachment and removal of President Trump? I was under the impression that these are two distinct question. That impeachment is like a grand jury investigation, i.e. a procedure (in the House) designed to decide whether there are grounds for a trial (by the Senate) to decide if removal is warranted or not. Am I wrong? Please explain! And keep up the good work!!!” – Tom Scherer, Udon Thani, Thailand



[Ed. note: This is an excellent question, Mr. Scherer! Different pollsters do indeed ask these questions in different ways. The complexity of the situation is partly to blame. An “impeachment inquiry” is not a thing. It’s like a couple being “pre-engaged.” But some pollsters have been asking about it, which tends to screw things up. Getting respondents to differentiate between an “impeachment inquiry” and “impeachment” is quite a lot of hair-splitting for civilians. Our poll does it the right way (obvi) and asks whether voters support impeachment, impeachment and removal or no impeachment. Those are the three constitutional possibilities. In our poll, 4 percent of respondents said they wanted the president impeached but not removed. That adds up to 55 percent favoring impeachment and 51 percent favoring removal.]



“All my teams have long gone home for the winter. So now we have your traditional Nine in the form of the quite surprising Cardinals playing your hometown Nationals (who should be the Senators and in the American League with Walter Johnson throwing flames, but oh, well). Where do your loyalties lie?” – Mary Carol Miller, Greenwood, Miss.



[Ed. note: Hometown!? Washington, D.C.!? My place of residence, certainly. And I do love living here. But c’mon, Doc! My hometown is Wheeling, W.Va. and the Cardinals, whose order I lustily joined as a boy when my family moved to St. Louis for four years, are my baseball team. I admire the Nats’ pluck and am grateful for the chance they are affording me to watch the National League Championship Series in person. But I love the Cardinals and am absolutely over the moon with this year’s squad. What a bunch! The infield alone may be the greatest since my glory days of fandom in the mid-1980s. Matt Carpenter is an absolute rock for the team and the personification of professionalism, Paul DeJong is a clutch player (whoever heard of a slugger shortstop?) who seems like he was born to be a Cardinal, Kolten Wong surfs second base like the pros ride waves at Honoli’i in his hometown and Paul Goldschmidt has shown in his tenacity, play and quality of his character that he is truly in the right uniform. And Yadi is nothing less than a national treasure. So suffice it to say: Viva el Birdos!]



“How ‘bout them Redbirds! We miss you on Twitter where we could delight in the pure joy emanating from Cardinals gifs, memes, and tweets after a playoff series win…but the mailbag will have to do!” – Jack Whiteman, St. Louis

‘THIS IS A NUDGE TO PICK UP THE FUDGE’

AP: “Officials in a southwest Missouri city are planting small flags in piles of abandoned dog poop as part of a campaign to get residents to clean up after their pets downtown. The Police Department in Springfield, Mo., posted photos of the flags in use on its Facebook page Wednesday. The flags contain messages such as, ‘Is this your turd? ‘Cuz that's absurd’ and ‘This is a nudge to pick up the fudge.’ The campaign started this week and the department noted on Facebook that leaving behind a pet's mess in many cases violates a city ordinance. The city's Environmental Services said the flags are made of bamboo and recycled paper and downtown crews will pick them up if they have to clean up pet waste.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“The whole debate arouses dismay, and not just because of the overreaching claims of both sides. One has an instinctive feeling that religion has a place in American public life, and that both sides misunderstand it—that between sectarianism and secularism lies something else.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the New Republic on April 9, 1984.

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., appeared to call President Trump a ""joke"" while responding to his son questioning her sense of humor on Friday.

The exchange surfaced after Trump Jr. tweeted the question: ""Why is @KamalaHarris the only person that laughs at her jokes ... always way to [sic] long and way too hard?"" He added that she was the ""most disingenuous person in politics ... after Hillary,"" a reference to his father's former opponent, Hillary Clinton.

Harris responded with an apparent attack on his father. ""You wouldn’t know a joke if one raised you,"" she tweeted.

Trump Jr. shot back with a comment on her poll numbers. ""Based on your tanking poll numbers, what’s definitely a joke is your entire campaign Yikes!"" he tweeted.

According to a Fox News poll from Oct. 6-8, Harris grabbed 15 percent of national Democratic primary voters' support, placing her fourth behind former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.

Harris saw a bump in polling over the summer after she took Biden to task over his controversial comments about race. But since then, she's seen drops in multiple polls,

Harris recently faced criticism for calling on Twitter to suspend President Trump's account. The senator sent a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, accusing the president of violating the company's terms of service.

""I believe the president's recent tweets rise to the level that Twitter should consider suspending his account,"" she said. ""When this kind of abuse is being spewed from the most powerful office in the United States, the stakes are too high to do nothing."""

NANCY PELOSI SAYS TRUMP'S RALLY COMMENTS ABOUT BIDEN 'BEYOND THE PALE,' RIPS SENATE REPUBLICANS' 'COWARDICE' ON IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

The question of recusal was raised by Rep. Thomas Masie, R-Ky., who asked if senators running for president “have a conflict of interest regarding possible impeachment of an opponent.”

House Democrats last month launched an impeachment inquiry into the circumstances surrounding President Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Democrats allege that Trump was using U.S. military aid to push Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s conduct in the country. Trump has said there was no quid pro quo and that he wanted only to root out corruption.

But as the inquiry consumes Washington and the 2020 campaign trail, it is possible the Democrat-controlled House votes to impeach the president in the coming months.

That would then set up an impeachment trial in the Senate, where a host of 2020 candidates -- including Sens. Klobuchar; Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; Kamala Harris, D-Calif.; Cory Booker, D-N.J.; and Michael Bennet, D-Colo.

It raises the question of whether they would benefit if their potential 2020 general election rival were removed from office -- and if so, if they should therefore recuse themselves from any trial.

“Shouldn’t they recuse themselves if it came to the Senate?” Massie asked. “Wouldn’t anyone so positioned against a defendant be barred from serving as a judge or jury in a court of law?”

Booker was asked on Friday if he would ever recuse himself, and he gave a short, simple answer: “No.”

In her answer, Klobuchar went into greater detail.

“I was elected as a U.S. senator for the state of Minnesota and my job will be to be a juror in the case and...I very strongly believe that this impeachment proceeding must go forward,” she said. “I don't know what counts that the House will come up with and what they will bring over to us but my job will be to look at the evidence and make a decision.”

Other senators have not addressed the question directly, but have no given any sign that they would recuse themselves. On Wednesday, Harris sent a letter with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., to every Trump cabinet official demanding they cooperate with ongoing investigations and preserve relevent evidence."

""That's why you and I are the last sane people because we're liberals but we don't go for all the bulls--- on the far left."" — Bill Maher to Howard Stern

STAGE IS SET FOR RECORD-BREAKING DEMOCRATIC 2020 DEBATE

Maher also took aim at Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, the foreign-born associates of Rudy Giuliani who were arrested this week on campaign finance charges before allegedly attempting to flee the U.S.

""This is the great irony of the Trump presidency,"" Maher said. ""Foreign criminals must be kept out of the country at all costs, unless they're here to steal our elections.""

On the Trump impeachment inquiry, and Republicans' reluctance to cooperate with Democrat-led House committees, Maher quipped: ""The president of the United States is going to be impeached because he treats subpoenas like parking tickets.""

Maher also made the case that Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders were too ""far left"" to win the general election, and touted Sen. Amy Klobuchar as a ""dark horse"" who could potentially top the party's ticket.

Maher spoke to Klobuchar in a one-on-one interview. He argued that Klobuchar was ""plenty liberal"" but could actually beat President Trump.

""Obviously this is a fight between two wings of the party, which is almost every election. There is a center in the Democrat, a center-left wing. You're plenty liberal. You're plenty progressive,"" Maher told Klobuchar. ""And then there is a far-left which I think would be represented by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.""

Klobuchar would not address Warren and Sanders directly but clearly dismissed their platforms and pushed her center-left agenda.

""I want to win big and if someone is looking to kick one hundred forty nine million Americans off their current health insurance in four years then I'm not your candidate,"" Klobuchar said. ""If you want to use a bunch of hardworking people's money to send rich people's kids to college for free and I'm not your candidate. And just because people say ideas are bold doesn't mean they're bold. They may be bad.""

Maher also slammed former Vice President Joe Biden, saying he may be too old for the presidency, and that Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., wasn't doing well in the polls -- despite the media attention she's received after debate performances.

Klobuchar ripped Trump on his Ukraine phone call before making a case for her candidacy, saying ""she could bring in moderate Republicans"" and ""win big."" She is currently polling at 2 percent in the latest national Fox News Poll.

In an awkward moment, Maher emphasized that Klobuchar being a woman might help her chances as well.

""I'm saying it's a lot easier to be on the center side of things, as Obama was, if you are not a white man,"" Maher tried to clarify. ""If you're a white straight man.""

Klobuchar responded: ""I want to make clear and I am excited to be one of several women in this race. But I'm not just running on that.""

In California, that day is nowhere in sight. With the passage of a bill designed to force untold thousands of independent contractors to reclassify as employees, California moves closer to the brink economic.

Many parts of California are really quite beautiful. As a longtime resident, the blue skies, great weather and unbeatable landscape, from the coast to the mountains, make it hard to contemplate ever leaving. The California Legislature, on the other hand, is compelling all but the rich and members of unions to leave.

California, of course, is beset with fiscal problems. As I have written elsewhere, California is unsustainable. California features one of the highest tax and regulatory burdens in America, if not the world. California has the highest income tax rate, one of the highest sales tax rates, and Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom (who wants to be your president one day) wants to raise property taxes by taking away tax protections for business properties. If his measure passes, those taxes will be an added burden on businesses and consumers throughout the state.

TUCKER CARLSON: CALIFORNIA, ONCE A SYMBOL OF THE AMERICAN DREAM, NOW REPRESENTS EVERYTHING THAT'S WRONG

Of course, California is likely the most regulated state in the world. California’s global warming law, the most strict in the world, isn’t the only factor. Estimates suggests that it costs $800,000 to build a home in California equal to a $300,000 home in Texas. A good deal of those costs are a result of the California Environmental Quality Act and related litigation.

Beyond contributing to the housing crisis in the state, all those regulations are driving up energy costs. Combined with forcing utilities to pay for wildfire protections, renewable energy mandates are causing rate increases that exceed 6 percent in some cases.

It's little wonder California's middle class is being hollowed out. One recent headline reported, ""Californians fed up with housing costs and taxes are fleeing state in big numbers."" For years, that departing middle class has been replaced by those who are far more dependent on government programs, including those who come over the border illegally.

As if those problems aren’t bad enough, California also has more debt than any other state. Government pension debt alone likely exceeds $1 trillion, and combined state and local government debt surely exceeds $2 trillion. There is also infrastructure debt. Years ago, the Bay Area Council Economic Institute pegged “the cost of California’s unfunded infrastructure needs at up to $737 billion and possibly as much as $765 billion.”

It should be no surprise that businesses large and small are leaving the state. Why would they stick around to foot the tax bills for huge debts? It’s so bad that it wouldn't be surprising to see California Democrats seek to impose a personal and business wealth tax within the next decade.

You would think that California’s ruling Democratic Party might be concerned about keeping as many jobs as possible in the state. After all, jobs represent a critical tax base, and when people are working, they are far less likely to be on government assistance. Considering California represents just 16 percent of the country's population but boasts roughly 30 percent of America's welfare recipients, that is no minor concern.

Alas, that is not the case. The latest dagger driven employers' hearts is a law that, in large part, ends the use of independent contractors by employers and businesses. Simply stated, if a business wants to hire the services of an individual, and those services are part of the normal business of the employer — say, a tech company wants to hire a person who writes computer code — that person must be made an employee of the company.

According to Newsom, the new law ""is an important step."" He added, ""The next step is creating pathways for more workers to form a union, collectively bargain to earn more and have a stronger voice at work.""

It's too bad that during Newsom's charmed, elite upbringing, he had been taught simple economics.

You see, the more something costs, the less of it you get. It's why low-price cars outsell high-price cars, such as Ford over Bentley. It is called the ""law of demand"" in economics. That is why a rising minimum wage results in automation and a reduced number of those employed at that wage.

In California, it is estimated that the costs of an employee exceed the cost of an independent contractor by at least 30 percent. Imagine that if you are an employer. All of history and economics, not to mention just plain common sense, will tell you people are going to lose their jobs.

In other words, the real-world effect of the politicians will be exactly the opposite of what they “claim” to want. At least Newsom is honest enough to mention this new law is about unionization. Meanwhile, from higher energy costs to higher taxes and even more lost jobs, California is killing off more jobs and therefore its middle class.

On one last note, California is the land of Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris. They want to run your country with the policies that California has in place now. Just think about that while you are ""California dreaming.""

President Trump on Friday announced that McAleenan would be leaving the job to spend more time with his family, and added that the new acting secretary would be announced next week.

CUCCINELLI PUTS HARDLINE STAMP ON IMMIGRATION AGENDA, JUST 2 MONTHS INTO USCIS JOB

“Many wonderful candidates,” he said.

The announcement immediately led to speculation as to who would step into the vital cabinet position -- one that is a central post for the nation's immigration policy.

A former senior DHS official with close ties to the administration told Fox News Friday that Cuccinelli is on the top of Trump’s list to be the next acting secretary. The source noted that a Senate confirmation hearing would be bruising for Cuccinelli but ""he, [White House adviser] Steve Miller and Trump are all in sync on a number of key policies.

""They have been trying to clear the way for a while,"" the source said.

If Trump doesn’t go with Cuccinelli, the source said Trump may go with former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach -- another hardliner who has long been floated for a possible administration position but is currently running for the U.S. Senate.

One administration official told Fox News on Saturday that Cuccinelli was in “good standing” for the position.

“Ken has been very effective on the regulatory side and he has proven to be a team player who will do every media hit no matter how small or how hostile,” the official said. “Ken is someone who hands-down supports and defends the work of the president and the administration.”

Trump may face some resistance from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has in the past indicated his ""lack of enthusiasm"" for Cuccinelli. That could make getting Cuccinelli confirmed difficult. Cuccinelli was previously president of the Senate Conservatives Fund, which seeks to push more conservative Senate candidates and was therefore often critical of McConnell and his allies.

""I've not spoken to [Trump] about any of them. I have expressed my, shall I say, lack of enthusiasm for one of them ... Ken Cuccinelli,"" McConnell told reporters in April when Cuccinelli was floated to replace former DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, according to The Hill.

A Cuccinelli pick would also face significant opposition from Senate Democrats. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., declared Cuccinelli ""unfit"" to lead USCIS in August after old remarks emerged of the former Virginia attorney general calling illegal immigrants ""foreign invaders.""

However, a Cuccinelli pick would be welcomed by many conservatives, particularly those focused on immigration and who didn't warm to McAleenan. As head of USCIS since the summer -- an often overlooked agency that deals with bureaucratic issues to do with green card applications and citizenship requests -- Cuccinneli put a hardline stamp on the agency with policies that picked up national attention.

TRUMP ANNOUNCES ACTING HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY MCALEENAN TO LEAVE POST

Perhaps the most striking of those changes was the “public charge” rule that toughened and clarified guidance for officials as to when they should deny green cards to immigrants deemed likely to rely on government welfare.

The rule defined public charge as an immigrant who receives one or more designated benefits for more than 12 months within a 36-month period. It also expanded the number of benefits that could be considered. On Friday, however, the rule was dealt a setback when a federal judge issued a nationwide injunction blocking it from being implemented.

“An objective judiciary will see that this rule lies squarely within long-held existing law,” Cuccinelli said in response.

In addition to public charge, Cuccinelli has also pushed a number of significant, and often controversial, changes. Buzzfeed News reported last month that he sought the power to publicize information about migrants being prosecuted for certain crimes. His agency has also tightened rules for awarding work permits to immigrants allowed into the U.S. for humanitarian reasons and has also cut the two-day window between detention and interview to one.

He has also not shied away from the media glare and from wading into controversies when defending the administration, something that may endear him to the president.

In August, in defending the public charge rule, he faced questions from reporters that the public charge rule was not in keeping with Emma Lazarus’ “The New Colossus” -- a sonnet added to the bottom of the Statue of Liberty that has become known for the line: “give me your tired and poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free...”

Asked separately about the poem’s reference to “wretched refuse,” Cuccinelli commented that the poem was ""referring back to people coming from Europe where they had class-based societies where people were considered wretched if they weren’t in the right class."" That remark sparked controversy from figures from 2020 hopeful Beto O’Rourke to pop singer Rihanna.

Cuccinelli has used his Twitter account (which he operates himself) to challenge the executive of Montgomery County, Md., to a debate over “sanctuary city” policies after a series of sex crimes allegedly perpetrated by illegal immigrants.

“I’ll defend children and crime victims, Elrich can defend rapists and murders who shouldn’t even be in this country,” he said.

He has also supported the use of “illegal aliens” to refer to illegal immigrants in U.S. law, even as McAleenan shied away from that term. Measures like that have earned him a reputation that has endeared him to groups in favor of tougher restrictions on immigration.

""The choice is clear, he must elevate Ken Cuccinelli,"" RJ Hauman, government relations director at the restrictionist Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), told Politico. ""The president understands that the opposition seeks to stop his efforts to secure the border and restore control over our nation’s immigration system through court orders and injunctions. What better force to stop this than the former attorney general of Virginia and one of the most skilled appellate lawyers in the country?""

The lengthy memo obtained by Fox News rejects Farrow's reporting that suggests NBC wasn’t truthful regarding knowledge of alleged sexual misconduct by former “Today” co-host Matt Lauer, and that the network refused to expose Harvey Weinstein as a sexual predator because he leveraged information regarding Lauer.

FULL TEXT: NBC NEWS PRESIDENT'S EMAIL TO STAFF ABOUT FARROW'S TELL-ALL

“Now that we’ve read Farrow’s book, it’s clear – his smear rests on the allegation that NBC’s management knew about and took steps to hide Matt Lauer’s misconduct before his firing in November of 2017. Without that, he has no basis on which to rest his second conspiracy theory -- that his Harvey Weinstein reporting was squashed to protect Lauer,” Oppenheim wrote to staffers.

Oppenheim and NBC News chairman Andy Lack have been accused of a “massive breach of journalistic integrity” by Farrow’s former NBC News producer Rich McHugh. Farrow has long claimed that NBC News stopped his reporting in an attempt to essentially cover for Weinstein. The situation has been a public relations nightmare for NBC and Oppenheim’s memo to staffers is the latest attempt to discredit “Catch and Kill” before its Tuesday release. The highly anticipated book details Farrow’s side of the story and the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter has already caused NBC executives to release statements and hold staffer sit-downs prior to its official release on Tuesday.

“Farrow alleges there were employees who reported Lauer’s behavior prior to November of 2017 and were paid settlements to silence them. Not only is this false, the so-called evidence Farrow uses in his book to support the charge collapses under the slightest scrutiny,” Oppenheim wrote.

A spokesperson for Farrow did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the author responded on ""CBS This Morning"" Monday when informed of Oppenheim’s email.

“This book is an extraordinary, meticulously fact-checked work of investigative journalism. It's two years of reporting, one of the senior fact-checkers at The New Yorker checked it, I’ll let the reporting in the book stand on its own. We’re very confident in it,” Farrow said.

NBC NEWS PRESIDENT MOCKED BY STAFFERS DURING FIERY MEETING ABOUT LAUER RAPE CLAIM

NBC News famously refused to hire an outside investigator to dig into who knew about Lauer’s behavior, instead allowing internal general counsel Kim Harris to conduct a review. The internal review eventually declared that NBC management was completely oblivious to alleged sexual misconduct that was happening under their noses. While the internal review was widely criticized, Oppenheim is again relying on Harris – this time to discredit Farrow’s book.

“Kim Harris and the NBCU Legal Team have reviewed both the book and the referenced agreements and I’d like to share their analysis. The only three examples we can find that Farrow alleges are Lauer-related before 2017, with even minimal detail, involve employees who by their own admission made no complaint to management, and whose departure agreements were unrelated to Lauer and completely routine,” Oppenheim told NBC staffers before detailing the three examples.

According to Oppenheim’s memo, Farrow said a woman named in the book disclosed her allegation to former NBC News anchor Ann Curry in 2010.

“Curry says she then told two executives – both of whom are no longer with the company – that Lauer ‘had a problem with women.’ By her own account, Curry relayed no specific complaint, nor did she say Lauer’s ‘problem’ regarded any specific workplace misconduct,” Oppenheim wrote. “NBCU was able to speak with one of those former executives during the 2018 review and she denied having been told even this.”

LAUER’S OFFICE SEXCAPADES KNOWN TO MEDIA ELITES, WHO ROARED WITH LAUGHTER OVER LEWD JOKES AT 2008 ‘ROAST’

Last week, Farrow appeared on “Good Morning America” and said that “there were multiple secret settlements and non-disclosures being struck with women at NBC News,” but Oppenheim’s memo combats this claim.

The NBC News president added, “at the time of the employee’s exit, three years later, she still had made no complaint about Lauer,” and that her severance was based on years of service, not designed to prevent misconduct claims.

Oppenheim then wrote that the “on-air personality” who Farrow reported received inappropriate messages from Lauer never complained to management and signed a standard confidentiality provision “designed to protect proprietary company information, not prevent an employee from reporting misconduct.”

The third point that Oppenheim disputes is that, according to the book, a “senior member of the Today show team” departed in 2017 with a seven-figure payout.

MATT LAUER BREAKS SILENCE ON RAPE ACCUSATION: READ HIS LETTER HERE

“Our records indicate only one exit that matches this description and we can state unequivocally that no claims related to Lauer or sexual harassment of any kind were raised in that process. Farrow says this person ‘mentioned Lauer and sexual harassment’ to a ‘senior vice president’ but offers no details on who, when, or what exactly she said,” Oppenheim wrote. “She signed a completely standard separation agreement, including a routine confidentiality provision that was in her original employment contract. Once again, in no way was it designed to prevent her from reporting misconduct. Her severance was commensurate with her salary.”

Oppenheim, who many industry insiders feel will take the fall for the situation if NBC’s parent company decides to take action amid an onslaught of embarrassing headlines, wrote that Farrow’s book “is built on a series of distortions, confused timelines and outright inaccuracies.”

“I feel absolutely terrible that these three employees were subjected to Matt Lauer’s horrific behavior, but the facts do not support Farrow’s allegation of a ‘cover-up,’ and he offers no further evidence,” Oppenheim wrote. “There is no evidence of any reports of Lauer's misconduct before his firing, no settlements, no ‘hush money’ – no way we have found that NBC's current leadership could have been aware of his misdeeds in the past.”

Oppenheim then appeared to blame past NBC leadership for much of the ongoing public relations debacle.

CNN BOSS JEFF ZUCKER ESCAPES QUESTIONS ABOUT OLD COLLEAGUE MATT LAUER

“We can all agree those misdeeds should have come to light sooner, and that we should have had a culture in which anyone who knew about his abuse would have felt comfortable telling management. And if anyone on any past management team knew, they should have taken action. But we cannot undo mistakes that may have been made by people who have long since left the company,” Oppenheim wrote.

Current CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker was the executive producer of “Today” when Lauer was hired in 1994 and had oversight of the morning show anchor while in various roles until leaving NBC in 2010. Zucker has denied knowledge of Lauer’s alleged misconduct.

“We can make sure the culture today ensures this can never happen again,” Oppenheim wrote. “And that is what we have tried to do, each and every day since the moment Matt's offenses first came to light.”

Oppenheim added that, “Farrow takes the first false allegation – that we knew about Lauer's offenses – and uses it to sustain another, that we obstructed his reporting on Harvey Weinstein,” and then listed a series of fact-checks related to “Catch and Kill.”

Oppenheim also included an NBC News “fact sheet” that details the network’s side of the story."

Dear Colleagues

Matt Lauer's actions were abhorrent, and the anger and sadness he caused continue to this day. As we've said since the moment he was fired, his abuses should never have happened.

Ronan Farrow's book takes that undeniable fact and twists it into a lie – alleging we were a ""company with a lot of secrets.""

We have no secrets and nothing to hide.

Now that we’ve read Farrow’s book, it’s clear – his smear rests on the allegation that NBC’s management knew about and took steps to hide Matt Lauer’s misconduct before his firing in November of 2017. Without that, he has no basis on which to rest his second conspiracy theory -- that his Harvey Weinstein reporting was squashed to protect Lauer.

Farrow alleges there were employees who reported Lauer’s behavior prior to November of 2017 and were paid settlements to silence them. Not only is this false, the so-called evidence Farrow uses in his book to support the charge collapses under the slightest scrutiny.

Kim Harris and the NBCU Legal Team have reviewed both the book and the referenced agreements and I’d like to share their analysis. The only three examples we can find that Farrow alleges are Lauer-related before 2017, with even minimal detail, involve employees who by their own admission made no complaint to management, and whose departure agreements were unrelated to Lauer and completely routine:

A woman who is named in the book. Farrow says she disclosed her allegation to Ann Curry in 2010, and asked her not to share it. Curry says she then told two executives – both of whom are no longer with the company – that Lauer “had a problem with women.” By her own account, Curry relayed no specific complaint, nor did she say Lauer’s “problem” regarded any specific workplace misconduct. NBCU was able to speak with one of those former executives during the 2018 review and she denied having been told even this. At the time of the employee’s exit, three years later, she still had made no complaint about Lauer, was paid 22 weeks of severance based on her years of service, and was asked to sign a separation agreement that was standard for departing employees at the time. The standard separation agreement included a routine confidentiality clause that was designed to protect proprietary company information. It was not drafted to prevent an employee from reporting misconduct, and it has never been used that way. (This employee made a complaint to management about Lauer, for the first time, after his 2017 firing.) An “on-air personality” who departed in 2012. Farrow says this individual received inappropriate messages from Lauer, and showed them to “colleagues,” not management, made no report, and we’ve found no record of one. She signed a completely standard separation agreement, including a routine confidentiality provision that was in her original employment contract. Again, that provision was designed to protect proprietary company information, not prevent an employee from reporting misconduct, nor has it ever been used that way. A “senior member of the Today show team” who departed in 2017 with a “seven figure payout.” Our records indicate only one exit that matches this description and we can state unequivocally that no claims related to Lauer or sexual harassment of any kind were raised in that process. Farrow says this person “mentioned Lauer and sexual harassment” to a “senior vice president” but offers no details on who, when, or what exactly she said. She signed a completely standard separation agreement, including a routine confidentiality provision that was in her original employment contract. Once again, in no way was it designed to prevent her from reporting misconduct. Her severance was commensurate with her salary.

I feel absolutely terrible that these three employees were subjected to Matt Lauer’s horrific behavior, but the facts do not support Farrow’s allegation of a “cover-up”, and he offers no further evidence.

In fact, Harris and the Legal team have determined that nothing in the book undermines any of the conclusions of the May 2018 investigation conducted by NBCUniversal in the wake of Lauer’s firing. (Attached is Kim Harris's original report.) There is no evidence of any reports of Lauer's misconduct before his firing, no settlements, no ""hush money"" – no way we have found that NBC's current leadership could have been aware of his misdeeds in the past.

We can all agree those misdeeds should have come to light sooner, and that we should have had a culture in which anyone who knew about his abuse would have felt comfortable telling management. And if anyone on any past management team knew, they should have taken action. But we cannot undo mistakes that may have been made by people who have long since left the company.

We can make sure the culture today ensures this can never happen again. And that is what we have tried to do, each and every day since the moment Matt's offenses first came to light. Our senior leadership is now 63% women, a 20% improvement in the last 2 years. Almost every significant senior editorial role is now held by a woman. We have instituted in-person training for all employees (2,135 of you participated), developed a new training course for managers focused on trust (562 of you have completed it), significantly raised awareness of the multiple ways to lodge complaints, built a new team within NBCUniversal (outside of NBC News) to take and investigate concerns, and worked hard to create an environment that is safe and respectful in every way.

Farrow takes the first false allegation – that we knew about Lauer's offenses – and uses it to sustain another, that we obstructed his reporting on Harvey Weinstein. Attached is the detailed accounting of that reporting, which we released in September 2018. Once, again, we stand by every word of it.

In the meantime, Farrow’s effort to defame NBC News is clearly motivated not by a pursuit of truth, but an axe to grind. It is built on a series of distortions, confused timelines, and outright inaccuracies. Below are a few more of the most egregious examples.

Sincerely,

Noah

Fact-Check

CLAIM: Weinstein and AMI/The National Enquirer threatened to expose Lauer while Farrow was reporting on Weinstein.

FACTS: Farrow asserts this based entirely on third-hand rumor. Farrow cites William Arkin, a former NBC employee, who says he was “told” this by anonymous third parties. Farrow says two anonymous sources at AMI also “heard the same thing”. He offers no corroboration. Because it did not happen. Not to mention, Farrow describes a meeting in the book between Weinstein and AMI, involving a “kill file of unpublished reporting about Lauer…” implying that Weinstein might have used this material to threaten NBC over Farrow’s reporting. By Farrow’s own timeline, the meeting took place “not long after” Sept 5. Farrow left NBC News for the New Yorker on August 17.

CLAIM: NBC didn’t want to pursue the Weinstein story because it wanted to “protect its secrets”.

FACTS: Over the last decade, NBC News has been on the front line of exposing sexual misconduct involving USA Gymnastics, Silicon Valley, Penn State and many other universities and prep schools, the Jehovah’s Witnesses, the State Department, the Secret Service, Capitol Hill, Bill Cosby, professional athletes, Fox News, the Catholic Church, Jeffrey Epstein, Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Roman Polanski, the US Military, sex trafficking rings in the US and abroad, and hundreds more -- all stories that pre-dated Farrow’s Weinstein reporting and Lauer’s firing . The notion that this one story, among all the others, equally sensitive and difficult, would be handled differently is illogical and absurd.

CLAIM: “Enhanced Severance” was a technicality used to cover harassment settlements.

FACTS: “Enhanced Severance” was a standard option for departing employees prior to May 2014, and the severance amount paid was based on years of service. Enhanced severance was the norm; it was paid to hundreds if not thousands of employees regardless of whether the employee had any claim against the company.

CLAIM: Farrow writes that there were “at least fifteen calls between Weinstein and three NBC executives” – Andy Lack, Noah Oppenheim, and Phil Griffin.

FACT: Intentionally omitted – of those calls, only one was to Oppenheim, one was answered by Lack, and thirteen were to Griffin. Griffin had no role whatsoever in Farrow’s investigation and told Weinstein in the small fraction of the incoming calls he answered only that Weinstein, like anyone else, would be given the chance to comment before we aired any allegations. Lack, completely unaware of Farrow’s work when reached by Weinstein, told him that. The only call with Oppenheim took place in August. In it, Weinstein ranted about Rose McGowan’s credibility and was told, again, only that he’d be given the chance to comment when we had a story ready for air. None of this was different from the calls we receive other difficult stories our investigative unit regularly breaks. And none of it played any role in our decision-making.

CLAIM: Farrow and his producer, Rich McHugh, were told to “stand down” and stop reporting the Weinstein story.

FACTS: McHugh writes in Vanity Fair that he was called into Rich Greenberg’s office on August 18 2017 and told to “stand down”. He intentionally omits the fact that one day prior, on August 17, Farrow had asked to take his reporting to a national magazine that he claimed was ready to publish immediately and NBC had agreed to that. McHugh was told to stand down because Farrow had chosen to leave the previous day.

CLAIM: NBC “obstructed” or “discouraged” Farrow’s Weinstein reporting.

FACTS: As he now acknowledges, NBC assigned Farrow the Weinstein story and actively supported it, editorially and financially, for seven months. We encouraged Farrow to go back to Rose McGowan and get her to name Harvey Weinstein on camera, we encouraged him to get the full Gutierrez recording and to arrange for his editor and an NBC lawyer to meet with her, and we repeatedly encouraged him to get a victim or witness on camera, on the record. He was unable to do so during his time at NBC.

CLAIM: NBC “delayed” Farrow’s reporting on Weinstein.

FACTS: Farrow submitted a draft script for the first time on July 25. It did not have a single victim or witness on the record, on camera and contained multiple claims not supported by the underlying reporting – detailed in our September 2018 memo. Farrow said he’d secured another interview with Rose McGowan on July 27. She cancelled that interview by July 30, and her lawyer sent a cease-and-desist on August 2. Farrow continued to revise his script and on August 8 was told two of the most seasoned investigative reporters at NBC News would work with him to advance the story. They immediately recognized it was not ready for air. While they worked to review his reporting and chart a path forward, he announced his desire to leave.

CLAIM: Farrow says the colleagues brought in to join his work— two of the most seasoned investigative reporters at NBC News — did not listen to the Ambra Gutierrez tape. He writes: “They didn’t ask to listen to the tape. As it turned out, they never would.”

FACTS: Farrow emailed Rich Greenberg at 2:36pm on August 16, 2017 stating “we played Liz the audio” — directly contradicting this claim in the book. In fact, Farrow largely omits the entire existence of the editorial review conducted by his colleagues because it fundamentally contradicts his conspiracy theory. These producers, completely independently, read Farrow’s interview transcripts, reviewed his notes of off-camera interviews, made fact-checking calls, and spoke to Farrow about the status of the women in his reporting, and as of the morning he left NBC, confirmed none had agreed to speak on the record

CLAIM: Farrow describes his script for NBC as follows: “The script we developed, over the course of late July, was spare and economical. It included the tape, naming Gutierrez with her cooperation, as well as McGowan’s on-camera, on-the-record interview, and Nestor’s interview with her face in shadow, accompanied by images of her messages from Irwin Reiter, documenting how Weinstein’s behavior was seen as a serial problem within the company. The evidence we’d uncovered of the two settlements in London was included, based on multiple firsthand accounts of the negotiations and the check from Bob Weinstein’s account. And there were sound bites from the four former employees who had gone on camera.”

FACTS: Farrow’s characterization is fundamentally deceptive in several critical ways as he attempts to gloss over the script’s most fundamental shortcoming — that he did not have any victims or witnesses on the record:"

On the roster: Bidens acknowledge ethics woes - Time Out: Boom - Ambassador lays Ukraine claims off on Trump - Audible: Blammo - Didn’t mean to horn in on you



BIDENS ACKNOWLEDGE ETHICS WOES

NYT: “Hunter Biden, whose overseas business dealings have drawn relentless attacks from President Trump and posed a threat to the candidacy of his father, Joseph R. Biden Jr., intends to step down from the board of a Chinese company, BHR, by the end of the month, his lawyer said on Sunday, a move his father later lauded in a forceful defense of his son’s integrity. The lawyer also said in a statement that if Mr. Biden were to be elected president, his son would ‘agree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign-owned companies.’ The decision is the first action the pro-Biden camp has taken that appears to acknowledge the extent to which Hunter Biden’s business practices have created an untenable problem for his father’s 2020 campaign. With the fourth Democratic primary debate only two days away … Mr. Biden’s lower-polling Democratic rivals have suggested his son’s work overseas raises questions about conflict of interest.”



Rolls out ethics, campaign finance plan in reply - Reuters: “Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden would look to ban private money from federal elections, his campaign said on Monday in a plan for government ethics that doubled as an attack on President Donald Trump. … The former U.S. vice president is promising to match individual donations for elections with government funding, and to block cash from private sources. Biden would also establish a new commission to enforce anti-corruption laws, bar lobbying by foreign governments and require candidates to disclose their tax returns.”



Dems still hedging on Warren - NYT: “Senator Elizabeth Warren has built her following in part by taking pictures with thousands of voters deep into evening after campaign events, but her dinner audience [in Washington] one night last month was far smaller. And Ms. Warren’s guests were more interested in hearing, and politely challenging, her campaign pitch… Addressing a few dozen members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus at a Chinese restaurant a few blocks from the Capitol, she laid out her case… But just under a month since the family-style meal, the Massachusetts senator has the same small number of endorsements from congressional colleagues beyond her home state as she did beforehand: three. … [H]er growing crowd sizes, soaring fund-raising and surge to the top of a number of national and early-state polls only shine a brighter light on one of the most revealing elements of this primary: the widening gap between the preferences of many Democratic voters and the lawmakers who represent them.”



Trump said to still want Warren - Axios: “President Trump's allies still fear a general election matchup against a banged-up Joe Biden more than a run against an invigorated Elizabeth Warren, people close to the president tell Axios. Warren has surpassed Biden in some primary polls, seemingly helped by the early coverage of Trump's efforts to get Ukraine to investigate conspiracy theories involving Biden and his son Hunter. And a Fox News poll now shows Biden and Warren each would lead Trump, 50% to 40%. … Several advisers in Trumpworld told [Axios] that Warren is arguably a better candidate in terms of being quick on her feet and prepared on a debate stage. But those advisers say her liberal stances on some issues and her ‘likeability’ problem with segments of general election voters make her weaker against Trump than even a Biden hindered by gaffes, generational dissonances and a son with personal drama and a lobbying record.”



Sanders slams Warren as ‘capitalist’ - Fox News: “Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders … is seeking to cut into the support of his rival by dismissing her as a ‘capitalist.’ ‘There are differences between Elizabeth and myself,’ Sanders said during an interview Sunday on ABC’s ‘This Week.’ ‘Elizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I’m not.’ The comments come amid a rise in socialism in the Democratic Party, as candidates become more willing to openly embrace socialism over capitalism. It also follows polling showing that Democrats now view socialism more positively than they do capitalism. Last year, when asked if she was a capitalist, Warren reportedly said, ‘I am a capitalist to my bones.’ Sanders explained he is not a capitalist because he ‘will not tolerate for one second the kind of greed and corruption and income and wealth inequality and so much suffering that is going on in this country today, which is unnecessary.’”



THE RULEBOOK: CAREFUL, NOW

“The hope of impunity is a strong incitement to sedition; the dread of punishment, a proportionably strong discouragement to it.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 27



TIME OUT: BOOM

History: “[On this day 72 years ago] U.S. Air Force Captain Chuck Yeager becomes the first person to fly faster than the speed of sound. Yeager, born in Myra, West Virginia, in 1923, was a combat fighter during World War II and flew 64 missions over Europe. He shot down 13 German planes and was himself shot down over France, but he escaped capture with the assistance of the French Underground. After the war, he was among several volunteers chosen to test-fly the experimental X-1 rocket plane, built by the Bell Aircraft Company to explore the possibility of supersonic flight. … Yeager flew the X-1 over Rogers Dry Lake in Southern California. The X-1 was lifted to an altitude of 25,000 feet by a B-29 aircraft and then released through the bomb bay, rocketing to 40,000 feet and exceeding 662 miles per hour (the sound barrier at that altitude). The rocket plane, nicknamed ‘Glamorous Glennis,’ was designed with thin, unswept wings and a streamlined fuselage modeled after a .50-caliber bullet.”

AMBASSADOR LAYS UKRAINE CLAIMS OFF ON TRUMP

AP: “A U.S. ambassador is expected to tell Congress that his text message reassuring another envoy that there was no quid pro quo in their interactions with Ukraine was based solely on what President Donald Trump told him, according to a person familiar with his coming testimony in the impeachment probe. Gordon Sondland, Trump’s hand-picked ambassador to the European Union, is among administration officials being subpoenaed to appear on Capitol Hill this week against the wishes of the White House.”



Former top Russia aide talks, too - Politico: “President Donald Trump’s former top Russia aide arrived on Capitol Hill Monday to testify before House impeachment investigators, as Democrats accelerate efforts to unearth the facts of Rudy Giuliani’s shadow diplomacy with top Ukrainian officials. Democrats view Fiona Hill’s closed-door testimony as critical to their understanding of the extent to which Giuliani, the president’s personal attorney, bypassed official U.S. government channels by pressuring Ukrainian officials to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump’s possible opponent in the 2020 presidential election.”



Hairy situation: Inside the botched effort to hire Trey Gowdy - NYT: “For 24 hours last week, Trey Gowdy, the former South Carolina congressman best known for leading congressional investigations of Hillary Clinton, was the new face of President Trump’s outside legal defense and a symbol of a streamlined effort to respond to a fast-moving impeachment inquiry. A day later, the arrangement fell apart, with lobbying rules prohibiting Mr. Gowdy from starting until January, possibly after the inquiry is over. Now, according to two people familiar with events, Mr. Gowdy is never expected to join the team. And Trump advisers are back to square one, searching for a different lawyer.”



House impeachment roadmap shaping up - Axios: “Ahead of this week's subpoenas and depositions, new documents obtained by Axios show how Democrats are taking the impeachment inquiry in two tightly focused directions: Ukraine and obstruction of justice. Why it matters: There are new temptations for Democrats to broaden the scope of their inquiry after developments last week including President Trump's gift to Turkey, new questions about coordination with the Chinese over Hunter Biden, and the dramatic airport arrests of two of Rudy Giuliani's associates with Eastern European backgrounds and their indictments on campaign finance violations. But for now, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appears to be sticking with her instincts to keep the probe tight and as simple as possible for Americans to understand.”



RNC spends to tweak vulnerable House Dems on impeachment - McClatchy: “Republicans are planning to target Democrats in swing districts with a new round of ads on impeachment this week as lawmakers return from their fall recess. The Republican National Committee will spend $350,000 on a multi-media buy as part of a strategy that includes digital ads, text messages and phone calls starting Tuesday calling on Democratic House members to 'stop the madness.' The effort is primarily targeted at the 31 Democrats in districts President Donald Trump carried in 2016. ‘We’ll emphasize it’s time to move on,’ RNC spokesman Rick Gorka told McClatchy. ‘There are real issues they could be working on, anything but this.’ Rep. Lucy McBath, D-Georgia, who supports an impeachment inquiry, is one of the GOP targets.”

“I get it. He needs to pick a fight in order to stay relevant.” – Mayor Pete Buttigieg said about his gun fight with Beto O’Rourke in the latest episode of the Snapchat show Good Luck America.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Was Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch an Obama appointee or a Trump appointee? If she was a holdover from the Obama years doesn’t make a little bit of sense for Trump to do some housecleaning? From what I understand some Ambassador appointments are given to friends and people who do something (in the campaign) to help the president get into office.” – Mary Blanton, Alpharetta, Ga.



[Ed. note: There are all different kinds of ambassadors, Ms. Blanton. There are two main categories: political appointees and career diplomats. Among the “political” there are two broad groups: Positions of such import that presidents want trusted confidantes and loyalists. Then there are postings to places so safe and stable that they can be doled out to donors and key supporters as patronage plums. The divide on the “career” side is similar. Some are to places of little strategic importance but are so poor and/or remote that fat cats wouldn’t want to perch there. But many are to places where the work is just too sensitive to risk amateurism. Our ambassadors face terrible risks on a regular basis in places around the world where, but do so in service of crucial American goals. We want top people with deep knowledge of the language, culture and history of places like Iraq, Turkey and, yes, Ukraine, to serve in such posts. Yovanovitch is one of these folks. She was appointed to her former post by then-President Obama. But before that, George W. Bush appointed her to the strategically important former Soviet republics of Kyrgyzstan and Armenia. She started in the Foreign Service in 1986. She’s a lifer. So while it’s true that she was an Obama appointee, it’s probably better to think of her as a product of our Foreign Service system more than anything else.]



“I would love to hear your reaction to the following idea: There should be a law that the federal government cannot tax any citizen at a rate in excess of 33 1/3%. This is to prevent any candidate from getting votes by simply suggesting that they will tax ‘the rich’ at 50%, 60% or 70%. Low income people are apt to vote for those candidates for the wrong reason. What say you?” – Ted Boers, Grand Rapids, Mich.



[Ed. note: I hear you, Mr. Boers, but you’d have to quickly come up with a LOT of additional dough. Rich people – the 40 percent of highest earners – pay something like 70 percent of all the taxes. If you knock down the two top tax rates – 37 percent and 35 percent – that would be a lot of money off the table. Leaving aside that practical consideration, there’s this one: You’d really need a constitutional amendment to do what you’re describing. It’s very hard to imagine getting supermajority support for something that would immediately be unpopular with the bottom 60 percent of earners. In the coming fiscal disasters awaiting America, we’re going to have some tough fights over taxes and spending – the very fights lawmakers have been pushing off for decades. It’s going to be ugly and weird and a number of proposals once considered unthinkable will suddenly sound mainstream. Fiscal conservatives would probably do better to get ready for that moment.]



“In quite deservedly praising Cardinal shortstop Paul DeJong you parenthetically asked ‘(whoever heard of a slugger shortstop?).’ Does the name Ernie (Let’s play two) Banks ring a bell? In the four years from 1957 through 1960 when he was the Cubs regular shortstop he hit 176 home runs (yearly average 44), leading the league twice. Over that same period, he drove in 491 runs (yearly average 123), again twice leading the league. He wasn’t just an offensive force, winning a Gold Glove for his defensive play in 1960. Additionally, he was the National League Most Valuable Player in both 1958 and 1959 despite playing for a sorry team that in both years finished fifth in an eight team league. So, to answer your question — I have, as have the many others who undoubtedly have written to point out your egregious error. (I still love you).” – Bob Foys, Chicago



[Ed. note: There’s always a Cubs fan out there! Always! You are quite right, Mr. Foys. Other than to a lesser degree Robin Yount and Derek Jeter, Banks is the cream of the power hitting shortstop crop. I’m including your note for two reasons: 1) Goodness knows Cubs fans need something to be cheerful about in October 2) Maybe this expression of goodwill will help snap the Cardinals out of their slough of despair against the Nats!]

DIDN’T MEAN TO HORN IN ON YOU

Metro: “A rhino was filmed going for a walkabout in a crowded market. The animal casually strolled past liquor shops and clothes showrooms in Nepal as shocked members of the public looked on. What was probably more surprising is no-one seemed to be scared of the rhino, which had strayed from the popular Chitwan National Park. Some tourists were so comfortable they even took selfies with the large beast on Thursday. Shankar Kandu Ravi, 31, from Uttar Pradesh in India, followed the elusive animal for about ten minutes and then took a picture with it. … Mr. Ravi said the rhino even came face-to-face with a couple but didn’t attack anyone. He added: ‘It was just acting to scare the couple. It warned people to not come close.’ ‘Next morning, I had inquired about it and learnt that it returned to the jungle early in the morning.’”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“If we are not prepared to wage total war in response to total war, we risk disaster on a scale we have never seen and can barely imagine.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in Time magazine on Oct. 28, 2001.

""I've been calling for the impeachment of this president for a long time,"" replied Harris, a former prosecutor in San Francisco. ""And, based on everything I know, yes.""

She claimed Trump already has confessed to trying to using the power of his office to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, who previously was on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings.

""We have a confession. We have a coverup,"" Harris said, referring to reports alleging that White House lawyers moved the transcript of Trump's phone call with Zelensky from the computer system where they're normally kept to a more secure system.

Trump, on the contrary, repeatedly has denied doing anything wrong. He called his phone call with Zelensky ""perfect.""

Ingraham was reacting to Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O'Rourke saying he'd strip churches of tax-exempt status if they don't support same-sex marriage.

When the former Texas congressman was asked if religious institutions -- ""colleges, churches, charities"" -- should be stripped of tax-exempt status Thursday night by CNN anchor Don Lemon during the LGBTQ town hall, he immediately responded, ""Yes.""

""There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone or any institution, any organization in America, that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us,"" O'Rourke said.

Ingraham warned that Democrats have taken a more extreme view point on issues in recent times.

""It used to be that Democrats were all about tolerance. They're just going to let you live your lives. Let us live our lives and all be fine,"" Ingraham said, before saying what she believed the new ""left-wing"" ideology believes.

""Don't do business with those deplorables, don't let them into your universities, your clubs or even your companies. And all must bow to the new secular creed,"" Ingraham warned.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joe Biden locked in a close race for their party’s nomination.

Warren stood at 30 percent support in a Quinnipiac University survey Monday of Democratic voters and independents who leaned toward the party. Biden, the unrivaled front-runner until Warren’s surge in the polls the past couple of months, was at 27 percent.

Warren’s three percentage point advantage was within the survey’s margin of error.

GABBARD BACKS DOWN AFTER DEBATE BOYCOTT THREAT

The poll was the third conducted by Quinnipiac since late last month showing Warren with a slight edge over Biden.

“For Senator Warren, the third straight time essentially tied at the top is the charm,” Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy emphasized. “Her candidacy clearly has staying power going into the debate.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont stood at 11 percent, with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent and Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 4 percent.

Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang and billionaire environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer each registered at 2 percent in the poll. The other candidates in the shrinking – but still large – field of contenders stood at 1 percent or less.

Quinnipiac’s survey differed from a Fox News poll released last week that indicated Biden at 32 percent, with Warren ten points back at 22 percent and Sanders at 17 percent. No other candidate cracked double digits in the Fox News survey.

THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL IN THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

Twelve candidates qualified for Tuesday’s debate, which is set to be held at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. They are – in alphabetical order – Biden, Booker, Buttigieg, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Harris, Klobuchar, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, Sanders, Steyer, Warren and Yang.

While national primary horserace polls have grabbed plenty of attention, the battle for the nomination is a fight for the states and their delegates. And, a new poll in New Hampshire, the state holding the first presidential primary, indicated a three-way tie at the top.

Warren stood at 25 percent support among likely Democratic primary voters in the Granite State in a Boston Herald-Franklin Pierce University survey, with Biden at 24 percent and Sanders at 22 percent. Buttigieg stood at 9 percent and Harris at 5 percent, with no one else in the field topping 2 percent.

In New Hampshire’s Republican presidential contest, President Trump remained the overwhelming favorite against three extreme long-shot primary challengers, but his support has deteriorated from 88 percent a month ago to 71 percent in the survey. One of the primary challengers, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, saw his support jump from 3 percent in early September to 14 percent in the new survey.

The Boston Herald-Franklin Pierce University poll was conducted Oct. 9-13, with 422 likely Democratic primary voters and 405 likely Republican primary voters in New Hampshire questioned by live telephone operators.

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted October 11-13, with 1,195 self-identified registered voters nationwide questioned by live telephone operators.

The CNN/New York Times Democratic presidential debate is scheduled to feature 12 leading 2020 hopefuls duking it out from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio -- but the latest batch of alleged undercover recordings could indicate which candidates are preferred by CNN brass.

CNN'S BRIAN STELTER WIDELY RIDICULED AFTER BLAMING TECH ISSUES FOR BIZARRE ANTI-TRUMP SEGMENT

Fox News has not independently verified what Project Veritas says is a clandestine recording of CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker and members of his staff discussing their thoughts on the 2020 presidential race. The network has “already picked its winners and losers,” the Project Veritas narrator says.

“It's incredible that CNN is holding the debate when it's not a neutral referee, it's an advocate for the most-radical leftist policies. The Project Veritas videos are showing CNN for what it has become, the TV headquarters of The Resistance,” Media Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor told Fox News.

CNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

CNN HAS BAD WEEK AMID APRIL RYAN, CHRIS CUOMO AND DON LEMON NEWS: ‘IT WAS QUITE EMBARRASSING’

CNN’s previous Democratic debate, a two-night summer marathon, was criticized by both sides of the aisle. Viewers complained that CNN’s format did not allow articulate answers because of time restrictions and that questions were specifically designed to create tension between candidates. “It was not CNN’s finest hour,” Poynter’s Tom Jones wrote.

CNN hosts Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper are set to moderate the follow-up event on Tuesday, along with New York Times editor Marc Lacey. But the debate comes amid another public relations headache for the network.

A person identified as CNN’s senior justice correspondent, Evan Perez, is claimed to be featured on a recording saying “Joe Biden has a problem, because his son was trading in his name.” Another CNN staffer is claimed to be heard saying the network is less fair to candidates Andrew Yang and Amy Klobuchar than other 2020 hopefuls.

CNN BOSS JEFF ZUCKER ESCAPES QUESTIONS ABOUT OLD COLLEAGUE MATT LAUER

“I think they like Warren a lot,” a person identified as CNN Media Coordinator Christian Sierra says in the video. “They’re pro-Warren for now.”

Sierra is also claimed to have said, “They don’t like Tulsi Gabbard” and detailed Cooper’s disdain for Trump. “Every day, he’s always like mocking him and stuff.”

PROJECT VERITAS’ ALLEGED CNN WHISTLEBLOWER CLAIMS NETWORK IS ‘PUMPING OUT PROPAGANDA'

The Project Veritas videos feature now-former CNN satellite uplink technician Cary Poarch (he was fired after the first batch of recordings were released), who secretly recorded some of the network’s morning editorial meetings. Poarch said he still considers himself a Democrat but, “spent many sleepless night” pondering the bias within CNN and hope to ensure a “free and fair” election.

“It’s very obvious. It's an unwritten rule that if you are center, center right, or heaven forbid, full-right Republican Trump supporter, then you are not welcome at CNN,” Poarch said in the second installment of videos.

Zucker is also heard pushing coverage of Kamala Harris’ demand for Twitter to suspend President Trump’s account despite admitting it wasn’t actually going to happen.

TRUMP SAYS AMERICA WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT 'CNNs OF THE WORLD' AFTER FIERY NEWS CONFERENCE

“It’s not gonna happen, but it’s a good segment in the show, ‘Should Trump’s Twitter account be suspended?,’ It’s obviously what Kamala Harris has… others are talking about it. Not gonna happen, but it’s a good talk, it’s a good segment,” Zucker said.

Monday’s initial release featured recordings made by Poarch capturing Zucker telling top news executives to focus solely on impeachment even at the expense of other important news.

“I don’t care about the MSNBC event, OK? I don’t care about them. Let’s just stay very focused on impeachment,” a person identified as Zucker says in the recording on the day of an MSNBC town hall event. “We shouldn’t just pretend, oh, this is going one way. And so all of these moves are toward impeachment.”

Poarch said he decided to wear a hidden camera because of CNN's perceived bias, and said he secretly recorded Zucker’s 9 a.m. rundown conference call because the network was “pumping out propaganda.”

MAINSTREAM MEDIA SHREDS CNN DEMOCRATIC DEBATE: ‘THE CLEAR INTENT WAS TO SPARK FIGHTS’

“I noticed after… that there was a strong group-think that permeated through the halls and that everyone was onboard the ‘I hate Trump Train,” Poarch said.

Poarch said on “Hannity” during an exclusive interview on Monday night that he no longer works for CNN as a result of the secret recording.

Zucker, who began his career at NBC, rose from researcher all the way to president and CEO of NBC Universal. Along the way, he was responsible for increasing Donald Trump’s fame when he greenlighted “The Apprentice.”

Zucker and the president famously have feuded since Trump’s foray into politics, with the president attacking the liberal network on a regular basis and accusing CNN of unfair coverage. CNN has filled its primetime lineup with anti-Trump opinion hosts and the network’s White House correspondent, Jim Acosta, has made a name for himself by quarreling with members of the administration when they are available to the press.

“Its employees have been opposing the president and pushing for his removal so much that it is obvious it's the corporate position of the network,” Gainor said.

Project Veritas, which frames itself as a conservative whistleblower watchdog group, has previously released what it claims to be hidden camera footage of network news producers, federal politicians and members of private political organizations making statements while unaware they were being recorded."

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., announced that she would no longer be accepting campaign donations of more than $200 from big businesses and challenged her fellow White House hopefuls to be more transparent about how they’re funding their own campaigns.

Warren blasted some of her Democratic primary rivals in a post on Medium, in which she accused them of “hobnobbing with the rich and powerful” and “handing out secret titles and honors to rich donors.”

“I’m proud to be running a grassroots-funded campaign for president, and I hope my fellow candidates for the Democratic nomination will do the same,” Warren wrote. “That’s why I’m also calling on every candidate in this race to disclose any donor or fundraiser who has a special title on their campaign…and to disclose the dates and locations of their fundraising events and the names of every person who appears on a host committee on invitations tied to those events.”

THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL IN THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

Warren added: “If Democratic candidates for president want to spend their time hobnobbing with the rich and powerful, it is currently legal for them to do so – but they shouldn’t be handing out secret titles and honors to rich donors. Voters have a right to know who is buying access and recognition — and how much it costs.”

In her post, Warren does not specifically call out any of her fellow candidates, but her words appear to be a rebuke of Democratic presidential primary hopefuls like former Vice President Joe Bide, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif, and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Each of these candidates have raised millions of dollars through fundraisers and private events with wealthy donors — a practice that is common in both major political parties in the U.S.

Warren, along with fellow candidate and Vermont lawmaker Bernie Sanders, have spurned big-dollar donors this campaign season, in favor of relying on small-dollar, online donations. The results have surprisingly seen them outraising other candidates last quarter.

Warren’s critics have slammed her for holding fundraisers in the past and using some of the money left in her war chest to launch her 2020 presidential bid. But since announcing her candidacy, Warren has not taken any PAC or big-dollar donations.

“I’m not going to take any contributions over $200 from executives at big tech companies, big banks, private equity firms, or hedge funds,” Warren wrote. “And when I’m the Democratic nominee for president, I’m not going to change a thing in how I run my campaign: No PACs. No federal lobbyists. No special access or call time with rich donors or big dollar fundraisers to underwrite my campaign.”

Despite outraising most other candidates last quarter, Warren’s rivals still say that the small-dollar donations will hinder her chances of defeating President Trump should she win the Democratic nomination.

“We're not going to beat him with pocket change,"" Buttigieg said in a Snapchat post, adding that Democrats ""need the full spectrum of support in order to compete.”"

The freshman congresswoman is getting her very own action figure as part of a series of political toys created by a Brooklyn-based design company.

The company, FCTRY, showcased its ""AOC"" doll design through an online fundraising site, asking supporters to help finance its product along with other political action figures. The fundraiser started on Tuesday but has already surpassed its goal of $15,000, which it hoped to achieve by mid-November.

As of Tuesday afternoon, the campaign had nearly 800 backers and more than $20,000 in donations.

""We're toymakers, not prophets, so take what we say with a grain of salt,"" the company said. ""But we've got a pretty good track record of spotting real-life heroes in the making and from where we sit, AOC has the makings of a legend. So we're doing what we do best and turning her into an action figure.""

A promotional video debuts the ""AOC"" toy with a series of cheers describing her as a model feminist, activist and Democrat. ""Tell me what a role model looks like. This is what a role model looks like,"" voices on the video say in a call-and-response fashion typical of street protests.

FCTRY also displays infographics detailing the congresswoman's rise to prominence and touting her activism.

""Just two years ago, AOC was an anonymous 20-something waiting tables and tending bars in New York City, and now she is literally one of the most influential politicians in the United States. Things like this don't happen in real life, right?"" the company asked.

""But it is happening and we are all witnesses. What makes it even crazier is that she's just getting started. Like if this were a trilogy, we’re probably only about 45 minutes into part one -- aka the origin story -- so let's recap.""

The promotional video also praises AOC for supporting a climate protest outside of then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's office in November of 2018. Since becoming House speaker, Pelosi, D-Calif., has clashed with the congresswoman -- suggesting her social media following was relatively insignificant when compared with the amount of power she and other progressives had in Congress.

But FCTRY touted her Twitter following -- 5.5. million followers -- along with her status as the youngest congresswoman ever elected.

Bolton told aide to alert National Security Council lawyer after meeting with Ukrainians about investigations: impeachment testimony

Fiona Hill, the former senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs, told lawmakers investigating possible impeachment charges against President Trump on Monday that a July meeting with Ukrainian and U.S. officials about unspecified investigations left her and John Bolton, the former national security adviser, so concerned that he directed her to alert a lawyer in the National Security Council, Fox News confirmed. The meeting in question took place July 10, a little more than two weeks before President Trump's controversial call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. Both Bolton and Hill, who were present at the meeting, had concerns about the conversation, she testified.

Hill, who exited the administration days before the July 25 phone call, testified on Monday for about nine hours in front of three House panels. The Wall Street Journal reported that those at the hearing took her comments to refer to the ""investigation that could implicate Biden and his son."" Click here for more on our top story.

In addition, Hill had high praise for ousted U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch during testimony before the House Intelligence Committee. Yovanovitch, who herself testified before congressional lawmakers last Friday as part of the impeachment inquiry, was recalled from her ambassadorship in May by Trump, around the same time that Rudy Giuliani — Trump's personal attorney — pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate corruption allegations against Democrat Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who was involved with the board of a gas company there.

Democratic dozen at fourth presidential primary debate will be a record-breaker

A really big stage is set the fourth round of Democrats' presidential primary debate Tuesday night. Twelve candidates have qualified, meeting the polling and fundraising criteria. That means the showdown tonight will be the largest in presidential primary history, topping the 11 Republicans who faced off in a primary debate in September 2015, according to political research from Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a political newsletter and website.

The dozen Democratic White House contenders who made the cut are – in alphabetical order: former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; businessman and environmental advocate Tom Steyer; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

Twelve candidates on the same stage at the same time could make for an unwieldy debate and a lot of jockeying for time and attention. The debate will be held at Otterbein University, a liberal arts institution in Westerville, Ohio. The Democratic National Committee's media partners for the showdown are CNN and The New York Times. All eyes will be on Bernie Sanders, who just two weeks ago was rushed to the hospital when he suffered a heart attack.

Trump mulls idea of lawsuit against CNN over recording of network 'bias'

President Trump on Monday floated a lawsuit threat against CNN over reports that the network’s president, Jeff Zucker, launched an internal bias campaign to undermine his presidency. In a tweet posted Monday evening, Trump said, “’Project Veritas-Obtained Undercover Videos Highlight Jeff Zucker’s (@CNN) Campaign To Destroy Trump. Videos Reveal @CNN’s BIAS!’ @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Does this sound like a good, or even great, lawsuit?”

The president’s latest gripe with CNN comes after conservative activist group Project Veritas published undercover recordings from an alleged “whistleblower” that capture CNN employees casually confirming the network's anti-Trump bias and show Zucker telling top news executives to focus solely on impeachment even at the expense of other important news.

Elizabeth Warren came under attack from all sides during Tuesday night's presidential debate, as former Vice President Joe Biden defiantly defended his son's business practices overseas and vehemently denied any wrongdoing.

All of the 12 Democrats onstage in Westerville, Ohio, meanwhile, backed the ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Trump. In a sign of apparent disunity and hesitation among Democrats, though, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said only minutes before the debate began that there would be no vote on formally commencing the inquiry.

The debate marked the first time the candidates met since Pelosi's news conference last month at which she unilaterally declared the inquiry had begun -- a move that the White House has said is legally insufficient. The candidate lineup set a record for most politicians on a single debate stage, topping the 11 Republican candidates who assembled in 2016.

JOE BIDEN DEFENDS SON HUNTER'S UKRAINE WORK: 'MY SON DID NOTHING WRONG. I DID NOTHING WRONG'

""Sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that's the case with this impeachment inquiry,"" Warren, D-Mass., asserted at the outset of the debate, when asked why Congress should bother with the process given the impending election.

Biden has been at the top of the crowded field for months, but has come under withering assault from the White House concerning his son Hunter's lucrative overseas business dealings.

The elder Biden faced something of a timid confrontation over the issue during the debate, when CNN anchor and debate moderator Anderson Cooper broached the topic by stating, without evidence, that President Trump's accusations of misconduct by the Bidens were ""false.""

But Cooper pressed Joe Biden on Hunter's admission in a televised interview earlier in the day that he made a mistake by obtaining a lucrative role on the board of a Ukraine company, with no relevant expertise, while his father was vice president and handled Ukraine policy. (“I know I did nothing wrong at all. Was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is a swamp in many ways? Yeah,” the younger Biden said Tuesday morning.)

Joe Biden recently pledged that no members of his family would engage in foreign deals if he were to be elected president -- a tacit admission, Republicans said, of previous poor judgment or even wrongdoing.

""Look, my son's statement speaks for itself,"" Biden said. “My son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government which was to root out corruption in Ukraine, and that’s what we should be focusing on.”

Biden insisted he never discussed Ukraine matters with Hunter, although Hunter separately told The New Yorker magazine that the dealings had come up in one instance.

PROOF OF LINKS: FOX NEWS OBTAINS PHOTO SHOWING BIDENS GOLFING WITH UKRAINE EXEC, SEEMINGLY CONTRADICTING FORMER VP'S CLAIMS

He concluded: ""The fact of the matter is, this is about Trump's corruption. That's what we should be focused on.""

Later on, as the debate heated up, Biden remarked: “These debates are kinda crazy."" In a head-turning moment, he also stumbled over his words, saying wealthy individuals might be found ""clipping coupons in the stock market.""

Separately, asked about Trump's policy in Syria, Biden appeared to give an extended answer in which he meant to talk about Turkish President Recep Erdoğan -- but kept referencing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad instead.

HUNTER BIDEN BREAKS SILENCE ON HOW HE OBTAINED LUCRATIVE GIGS WITH NO RELEVANT EXPERTISE, BUT A VERY POWERFUL FATHER

Asked about his health toward the end of the debate, Biden vowed to release his medical records before the Iowa caucuses are held, and said his age (76) gives him ""wisdom.""

Hunter Biden obtained other high-paying board positions domestically and internationally, with no relevant expertise, while his father was a senator and vice president. For example, Hunter became an executive at the financial services company MBNA just two years after leaving law school. MBNA sources told Fox News this week that the company was trying to curry favor with Joe Biden, who was shepherding a bill favored by MBNA to passage in the Senate.

Meanwhile, Warren has climbed to co-front runner status but faces new questions about her dubious claims to Native American ancestry.

She was under attack from all sides at the debate for refusing to answer whether her ""Medicare for All"" plan would raise taxes for the middle class. Warren once again dodged the issue, insisting only that ""costs will go down"" for the middle class.

""I appreciate Elizabeth's work, but again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something you can actually get done,"" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said to Warren. ""At least Bernie’s being honest here. ... I’m sorry, Elizabeth.”

“These debates are kinda crazy."" — Joe Biden

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg also lambasted Warren on health care: “Your signature is to have a plan for everything, except this,"" he said.

Buttigieg specifically knocked Warren for the nonanswer, saying her failure to offer a direct answer is ""why people are so frustrated with politicians"" and arguing that ""Medicare-for-All"" would ""unnecessarily divide this country.""

""We heard it tonight,"" Buttigieg said. ""A yes-or-no question that didn't get a yes-or-no answer."" He said he wanted a plan that could be summed up as ""Medicare-for-All"" if you choose it, not whether you want it or not.

Former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke also pressed Warren on the tax issue, to no avail. (Later on, O'Rourke had no answer when Cooper asked how he could confiscate Americans' firearms, given that the government has no way of knowing where the vast majority of AR-15s are located. He said only that he believes Americans ""will do the right thing"" voluntarily.)

Sen. Bernie Sanders, who wrote the ""Medicare-for-All"" legislation that Warren has embraced, said it was ""appropriate to acknowledge taxes will go up.""

Sanders, who Fox News has confirmed will soon be endorsed by New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, also spoke about his recent heart attack: “But let me take this moment, if I might, to thank so many people from all over this country, including many of my colleagues up here, for their love, for their prayers, for their well wishes. ... And I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, and I'm so happy to be back here with you this evening.”

Also during the debate, Democrats also piled onto Warren for her signature proposal, a 2 percent wealth tax to raise the trillions needed for many of her ambitious proposals. Technology entrepreneur Andrew Yang noted that such a measure has failed in almost every European country where it's been tried.

The event, hosted by CNN and The New York Times, was on the campus of Otterbein University, just outside Columbus in Ohio, a state that has long helped decide presidential elections but has drifted away from Democrats in recent years.

Many of the candidates were struggling just to get noticed — trying to make up ground in a race that kicks off officially in just over three months with the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3. Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., are trying to crack the top tier.

In one possible indicator the debate was a lengthy one, Harris briefly mentioned her proposal to have Twitter take Trump's account down, and demanded that Warren explain why she felt that approach was unwise. Warren, who last week laughed openly when informed by a reporter of Harris' idea, responded that she wants Trump out of the White House, not just banned from Twitter.

Progressives and right-wing commentators alike were aghast at Harris' decision to again bring up the unrealistic and unpopular idea of somehow suspending Trump from Twitter.

""I cannot believe @KamalaHarris is pushing this suspend Donald Trump's twitter account bullshit at a presidential debate,"" former Obama administration official and Pod Save America cohost Tommy Vietor wrote on Twitter. ""It's so small ball. She is bigger and better than this.""

Fellow Obama administration alumnus and podcast host Ben Rhodes added: ""Seems like there are bigger issues in the world.""

Also debating were Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Obama housing chief Julián Castro and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii. Making his debate debut — and likely angling for a splash — was billionaire activist Tom Steyer.

Gabbard hit The New York Times and CNN for waging what she called a propaganda campaign against her, while also promoting endless ""regime-change wars.""

""The New York Times and CNN have smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime change war,"" Gabbard said. ""Just two days ago, The New York Times put out an article saying I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist, and all these different smears.

Gabbard has criticized Trump for how he's conducted the withdrawal in Syria, but said Tuesday that while Trump has ""the blood of the Kurds on his hands. ... So do many of the politicians in both parties who supported this regime change war.""

Gabbard, who was one of the last Democratic House members to back an impeachment inquiry, additionally lamented that some Democrats had been calling for Trump's impeachment since right after the 2016 election, undermining the party's case against him.

The debate's foreign policy discussion concluded without any mention by the moderators of the ongoing push by China to censor American companies, including the NBA and Blizzard Entertainment, from making or tolerating pro-Hong Kong statements. Buttigieg briefly mentioned that the Hong Kong protests were not receiving support from the White House.

Yang's plan for a universal basic income spurred a discussion onstage concerning whether a federal jobs guarantee is a better plan -- something of a remarkable achievement for Yang, who has struggled in the polls while advancing his own unique agenda.

On abortion, the Democrats agreed they would support a federal law ""codifying"" the Supreme Court's holding in Roe v. Wade, which found a constitutional right to abortion, as a kind of defense in case the Supreme Court overturned Roe. At the same time, Biden emphasized he would not support ""court packing,"" or passing a federal law to expand the size of the Supreme Court to load it with Democratic justices.

Buttigieg then said he did not support court packing, but wanted ""reforms"" to make the court less significant -- including possibly a ""fifteen member court, where five of the members can only be appointed by unanimous agreement of the other ten."" A similar idea was being debated in the Yale Law Journal, Buttigieg said, in a shout-out to the left-wing student publication.

Gabbard said that Democrats were right decades ago when they said abortion should be ""safe, legal, and rare"" -- highlighting a shift to the left among Democrats.

The 2020 field, which once had swelled to two dozen, has been shrinking as the Democratic Party's rules have mandated that candidates meet higher donor and fundraising thresholds to debate.

But, that’s just the first of many factors that could make this showdown – the first in a month – stand out.

BERNIE SANDERS SLAMS ELIZABETH WARREN AS A 'CAPITALIST'

“Since the last Democratic debate, the presidential race has dramatically shifted. Tonight is the first major gathering since the opening of the impeachment inquiry,” former Democratic National Committee chair and Fox News contributor Donna Brazile said.

The debate also comes as Joe Biden lost his long-held status as the unrivaled front-runner. The former vice president suddenly has been neck-and-neck with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts for the top spot in many of the recent national and early-voting-state polls. And, Biden was left in the dust in the race for campaign cash, with both Warren and fellow progressive champion Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont each topping him by roughly $10 million in the July-September third quarter of fundraising.

The showdown also comes two weeks after the 78-year old Sanders suffered a heart attack. The debate is set to mark his return to the campaign trail and with questions regarding his health and stamina, the independent senator making his second straight White House run will be under the microscope.

With all that in mind, here are eight things to watch at the debate.

Impeachment

The debate is the first held since House Democrats launched a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter over their dealings in the eastern European country. Fueled by whistleblower complaints and a transcript of the call released by the White House, Democrats argued the president was pressuring a foreign country to interfere in a U.S. election.

Adding to the controversy was the fact that before the phone call, millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been put on hold; it ultimately was released in September. Despite allegations that Trump was using that money as leverage, the president insisted repeatedly that he did nothing wrong. He said there was no “quid pro quo” and on numerous occasions has described his conversation with the Ukrainian leader as “perfect.”

While all the candidates on the stage supported impeaching the president, the impeachment inquiry clearly will overshadow the showdown -- but will it dominate the debate to the detriment of other top issues in the Democrats’ presidential nomination race?

“There is a real danger that the substance of the debate is limited by the impeachment inquiry,” warned veteran political scientist Wayne Lesperance, the vice president of academic affairs at New England College.

Biden and Biden

While only one Biden will be on the stage, another certainly will be part of the conversation. While the former vice president is expected to use impeachment to frame the race as a fight between himself and the Republican incumbent, he likely will face questions about his son just hours after Hunter Biden’s first public interview since the start of the Ukrainian controversy.

As the president has fought back against impeachment, he and his allies instead have tried to put the spotlight on the Bidens.

Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how Biden – as vice president – pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor – who had faced widespread accusations of overlooking corruption in his own office – later was dismissed.

Biden, defending his actions in Ukraine, said, “there’s no truth to [Trump's] charges and attacks against me and my son. Zero.”

Trump’s also repeatedly raised questions about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of a Chinese private equity firm. This past Sunday, Hunter Biden resigned from the company – and on Tuesday morning – just hours before the debate – broke his silence in an interview with ABC News’ “Good Morning America.""

The younger Biden maintained that he did nothing improper while he served on the board of the Ukrainian energy company. But he acknowledged that accepting the lucrative position was, in retrospect, ""poor judgment.""

Some of Biden’s lower-tier rivals, looking for a breakout moment, may be tempted to criticize him over the optics of having his son sit on the boards of foreign companies while he served as vice president. However, it may be a slippery slope, as none of the Democrats seeking to unseat Trump may want to play into his playbook of targeting the Bidens.

Sanders’ health

“I’m ready,” Sanders emphasized in an email to supporters on Monday.

While all the candidates will be under the spotlight, it will shine extra bright for Sanders, who would have a unique challenge in needing to showcase that he hasn’t lost a step, and quell concerns that he may not be up to speed.

Analysts pointed out Sanders would need to show strength and agility, but the question for his rivals would be whether it’s a fair game for them to raise concerns about his health. Questions were raised about the late Sen. John McCain’s medical condition during the 2008 campaign and about the health of both candidates four years ago.

Sanders vs. Warren

Aside from some sniping by some of his top advisors, Sanders has not criticized Warren, as she’s mostly passed him by in the polls the past two months.

That’s why his labeling of his friend and populist senator – who’s produced one progressive policy proposal after another – as a “capitalist” made so much news this weekend.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

“There are differences between Elizabeth and myself,” Sanders said during an interview Sunday on ABC News’ “This Week.” “Elizabeth, I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I’m not.”

Will Sanders continue to draw contrasts with the rising Warren at the debate?

A former Sanders adviser – who for months raised alarms that Warren, rather than Biden, was the real threat – said the drawing of distinctions may be a necessity.

“Unfortunately, it’s a sign of concern on the part of Bernie and his camp that Warren is beating him with the voters that he needs,” noted Kurt Ehrenberg, a top adviser for Sanders in New Hampshire and the 2016 and 2020 campaigns who recently parted ways with the campaign.

A more aggressive Biden?

The former vice president seemed to get a second wind last week during two speeches in New Hampshire, when Biden gave a full-throated thrashing of Trump as he called for the president’s impeachment for the first time. Will that aggressive style of campaigning continue on the debate stage in Ohio?

“One of the problems I’m finding, I’ve got to be more aggressive,” Biden acknowledged during a fundraiser late last week in California. “I’ve had some difficulties on knowing to counterattack.”

A senior Biden campaign adviser told Fox News hours before the debate that ""what you'll hear tonight from the VP is that first and foremost, we have to keep the focus on Donald Trump's unprecedented abuse of power.""

Back in the spotlight

Health care – specifically the intra-party battle over “Medicare-for-all,” immigration, race relations and other domestically focused issues – has dominated the discourse at the first three rounds of debates. Foreign policy mostly has been relegated to the garbage time late in the showdowns, when the number of viewers dwindled.

But, with Turkey’s attack on northern Syria, unfolding soon after the president’s move to withdraw U.S. troops who had been fighting alongside Kurdish forces against ISIS militants, questions about Trump’s record on the world stage could be back in the spotlight.

That may benefit the candidates with foreign policy experience. Besides the obvious – Biden – such a discussion could give the two veterans in the field who’ve served in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii – a moment to shine.

Looking for a breakout moment

The debate could provide the opportunity the mid-tier candidates have been seeking – a standout moment in front of millions of viewers with less than four months to go until the voting begins in Iowa. Buttigieg, Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas all have been looking to gain some traction and break up the narrative that the race has been a three-candidate contest between Biden, Warren, and Sanders.

So will businessman and billionaire environment and progressive activist Tom Steyer, who’s making his first appearance on the debate stage.

Buttigieg – in a likely tease of things to come – took aim at Warren and Sanders for proposing to scrap private insurance as he touted his Medicare-for-all-who-want-it plan a new digital ad hours before the debate.

“Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren believe that we have to force ourselves into Medicare for all, where private insurance is abolished,” the narrator says in the ad.

Unpredictable moments

Gabbard made headlines in the second round of debates in July when she took aim at Harris, firing away at the former California attorney general’s record as a prosecutor. Last week, she made headlines when she threatened to boycott the debate to protest the “rigging” of the debates and the race for the nomination by the Democratic National Committee and its media partners.

Gabbard announced Monday morning that she would take part in the debate after all, and her planned appearance – after failing to qualify for the September showdown – had analysts wondering what she had next up here sleeve.

Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro also has been looking to make some news. Castro – whose attacks on Biden’s age and memory at the September debate backfired, according to many analysts – is set to appear on the stage for what could possibly be the last time.

With the thresholds rising for the November showdown, Castro made a fundraising pitch to supporters, telling them ""I refuse to let tonight be my last time on the debate stage.""

A big debate moment would give him a boost to reach the new qualifying criteria."

The lengthy memo obtained by Fox News rejects Farrow's reporting that suggests NBC wasn’t truthful regarding knowledge of alleged sexual misconduct by former “Today” co-host Matt Lauer, and that the network refused to expose Harvey Weinstein as a sexual predator because he leveraged information regarding Lauer.

FULL TEXT: NBC NEWS PRESIDENT'S EMAIL TO STAFF ABOUT FARROW'S TELL-ALL

“Now that we’ve read Farrow’s book, it’s clear – his smear rests on the allegation that NBC’s management knew about and took steps to hide Matt Lauer’s misconduct before his firing in November of 2017. Without that, he has no basis on which to rest his second conspiracy theory -- that his Harvey Weinstein reporting was squashed to protect Lauer,” Oppenheim wrote to staffers.

Oppenheim and NBC News chairman Andy Lack have been accused of a “massive breach of journalistic integrity” by Farrow’s former NBC News producer Rich McHugh. Farrow has long claimed that NBC News stopped his reporting in an attempt to essentially cover for Weinstein. The situation has been a public relations nightmare for NBC and Oppenheim’s memo to staffers is the latest attempt to discredit “Catch and Kill” before its Tuesday release. The highly anticipated book details Farrow’s side of the story and the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter has already caused NBC executives to release statements and hold staffer sit-downs prior to its official release on Tuesday.

“Farrow alleges there were employees who reported Lauer’s behavior prior to November of 2017 and were paid settlements to silence them. Not only is this false, the so-called evidence Farrow uses in his book to support the charge collapses under the slightest scrutiny,” Oppenheim wrote.

A spokesperson for Farrow did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the author responded on ""CBS This Morning"" Monday when informed of Oppenheim’s email.

“This book is an extraordinary, meticulously fact-checked work of investigative journalism. It's two years of reporting, one of the senior fact-checkers at The New Yorker checked it, I’ll let the reporting in the book stand on its own. We’re very confident in it,” Farrow said.

NBC NEWS PRESIDENT MOCKED BY STAFFERS DURING FIERY MEETING ABOUT LAUER RAPE CLAIM

NBC News famously refused to hire an outside investigator to dig into who knew about Lauer’s behavior, instead allowing internal general counsel Kim Harris to conduct a review. The internal review eventually declared that NBC management was completely oblivious to alleged sexual misconduct that was happening under their noses. While the internal review was widely criticized, Oppenheim is again relying on Harris – this time to discredit Farrow’s book.

“Kim Harris and the NBCU Legal Team have reviewed both the book and the referenced agreements and I’d like to share their analysis. The only three examples we can find that Farrow alleges are Lauer-related before 2017, with even minimal detail, involve employees who by their own admission made no complaint to management, and whose departure agreements were unrelated to Lauer and completely routine,” Oppenheim told NBC staffers before detailing the three examples.

According to Oppenheim’s memo, Farrow said a woman named in the book disclosed her allegation to former NBC News anchor Ann Curry in 2010.

“Curry says she then told two executives – both of whom are no longer with the company – that Lauer ‘had a problem with women.’ By her own account, Curry relayed no specific complaint, nor did she say Lauer’s ‘problem’ regarded any specific workplace misconduct,” Oppenheim wrote. “NBCU was able to speak with one of those former executives during the 2018 review and she denied having been told even this.”

LAUER’S OFFICE SEXCAPADES KNOWN TO MEDIA ELITES, WHO ROARED WITH LAUGHTER OVER LEWD JOKES AT 2008 ‘ROAST’

Last week, Farrow appeared on “Good Morning America” and said that “there were multiple secret settlements and non-disclosures being struck with women at NBC News,” but Oppenheim’s memo combats this claim.

The NBC News president added, “at the time of the employee’s exit, three years later, she still had made no complaint about Lauer,” and that her severance was based on years of service, not designed to prevent misconduct claims.

Oppenheim then wrote that the “on-air personality” who Farrow reported received inappropriate messages from Lauer never complained to management and signed a standard confidentiality provision “designed to protect proprietary company information, not prevent an employee from reporting misconduct.”

The third point that Oppenheim disputes is that, according to the book, a “senior member of the Today show team” departed in 2017 with a seven-figure payout.

MATT LAUER BREAKS SILENCE ON RAPE ACCUSATION: READ HIS LETTER HERE

“Our records indicate only one exit that matches this description and we can state unequivocally that no claims related to Lauer or sexual harassment of any kind were raised in that process. Farrow says this person ‘mentioned Lauer and sexual harassment’ to a ‘senior vice president’ but offers no details on who, when, or what exactly she said,” Oppenheim wrote. “She signed a completely standard separation agreement, including a routine confidentiality provision that was in her original employment contract. Once again, in no way was it designed to prevent her from reporting misconduct. Her severance was commensurate with her salary.”

Oppenheim, who many industry insiders feel will take the fall for the situation if NBC’s parent company decides to take action amid an onslaught of embarrassing headlines, wrote that Farrow’s book “is built on a series of distortions, confused timelines and outright inaccuracies.”

“I feel absolutely terrible that these three employees were subjected to Matt Lauer’s horrific behavior, but the facts do not support Farrow’s allegation of a ‘cover-up,’ and he offers no further evidence,” Oppenheim wrote. “There is no evidence of any reports of Lauer's misconduct before his firing, no settlements, no ‘hush money’ – no way we have found that NBC's current leadership could have been aware of his misdeeds in the past.”

Oppenheim then appeared to blame past NBC leadership for much of the ongoing public relations debacle.

CNN BOSS JEFF ZUCKER ESCAPES QUESTIONS ABOUT OLD COLLEAGUE MATT LAUER

“We can all agree those misdeeds should have come to light sooner, and that we should have had a culture in which anyone who knew about his abuse would have felt comfortable telling management. And if anyone on any past management team knew, they should have taken action. But we cannot undo mistakes that may have been made by people who have long since left the company,” Oppenheim wrote.

Current CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker was the executive producer of “Today” when Lauer was hired in 1994 and had oversight of the morning show anchor while in various roles until leaving NBC in 2010. Zucker has denied knowledge of Lauer’s alleged misconduct.

“We can make sure the culture today ensures this can never happen again,” Oppenheim wrote. “And that is what we have tried to do, each and every day since the moment Matt's offenses first came to light.”

Oppenheim added that, “Farrow takes the first false allegation – that we knew about Lauer's offenses – and uses it to sustain another, that we obstructed his reporting on Harvey Weinstein,” and then listed a series of fact-checks related to “Catch and Kill.”

Oppenheim also included an NBC News “fact sheet” that details the network’s side of the story."

Subject: Staff Note

Dear Colleagues

Matt Lauer's actions were abhorrent, and the anger and sadness he caused continue to this day. As we've said since the moment he was fired, his abuses should never have happened.

Ronan Farrow's book takes that undeniable fact and twists it into a lie – alleging we were a ""company with a lot of secrets.""

We have no secrets and nothing to hide.

Now that we’ve read Farrow’s book, it’s clear – his smear rests on the allegation that NBC’s management knew about and took steps to hide Matt Lauer’s misconduct before his firing in November of 2017. Without that, he has no basis on which to rest his second conspiracy theory -- that his Harvey Weinstein reporting was squashed to protect Lauer.

Farrow alleges there were employees who reported Lauer’s behavior prior to November of 2017 and were paid settlements to silence them. Not only is this false, the so-called evidence Farrow uses in his book to support the charge collapses under the slightest scrutiny.

Kim Harris and the NBCU Legal Team have reviewed both the book and the referenced agreements and I’d like to share their analysis. The only three examples we can find that Farrow alleges are Lauer-related before 2017, with even minimal detail, involve employees who by their own admission made no complaint to management, and whose departure agreements were unrelated to Lauer and completely routine:

A woman who is named in the book. Farrow says she disclosed her allegation to Ann Curry in 2010, and asked her not to share it. Curry says she then told two executives – both of whom are no longer with the company – that Lauer “had a problem with women.” By her own account, Curry relayed no specific complaint, nor did she say Lauer’s “problem” regarded any specific workplace misconduct. NBCU was able to speak with one of those former executives during the 2018 review and she denied having been told even this. At the time of the employee’s exit, three years later, she still had made no complaint about Lauer, was paid 22 weeks of severance based on her years of service, and was asked to sign a separation agreement that was standard for departing employees at the time. The standard separation agreement included a routine confidentiality clause that was designed to protect proprietary company information. It was not drafted to prevent an employee from reporting misconduct, and it has never been used that way. (This employee made a complaint to management about Lauer, for the first time, after his 2017 firing.) An “on-air personality” who departed in 2012. Farrow says this individual received inappropriate messages from Lauer, and showed them to “colleagues,” not management, made no report, and we’ve found no record of one. She signed a completely standard separation agreement, including a routine confidentiality provision that was in her original employment contract. Again, that provision was designed to protect proprietary company information, not prevent an employee from reporting misconduct, nor has it ever been used that way. A “senior member of the Today show team” who departed in 2017 with a “seven figure payout.” Our records indicate only one exit that matches this description and we can state unequivocally that no claims related to Lauer or sexual harassment of any kind were raised in that process. Farrow says this person “mentioned Lauer and sexual harassment” to a “senior vice president” but offers no details on who, when, or what exactly she said. She signed a completely standard separation agreement, including a routine confidentiality provision that was in her original employment contract. Once again, in no way was it designed to prevent her from reporting misconduct. Her severance was commensurate with her salary.

I feel absolutely terrible that these three employees were subjected to Matt Lauer’s horrific behavior, but the facts do not support Farrow’s allegation of a “cover-up”, and he offers no further evidence.

In fact, Harris and the Legal team have determined that nothing in the book undermines any of the conclusions of the May 2018 investigation conducted by NBCUniversal in the wake of Lauer’s firing. (Attached is Kim Harris's original report.) There is no evidence of any reports of Lauer's misconduct before his firing, no settlements, no ""hush money"" – no way we have found that NBC's current leadership could have been aware of his misdeeds in the past.

We can all agree those misdeeds should have come to light sooner, and that we should have had a culture in which anyone who knew about his abuse would have felt comfortable telling management. And if anyone on any past management team knew, they should have taken action. But we cannot undo mistakes that may have been made by people who have long since left the company.

We can make sure the culture today ensures this can never happen again. And that is what we have tried to do, each and every day since the moment Matt's offenses first came to light. Our senior leadership is now 63% women, a 20% improvement in the last 2 years. Almost every significant senior editorial role is now held by a woman. We have instituted in-person training for all employees (2,135 of you participated), developed a new training course for managers focused on trust (562 of you have completed it), significantly raised awareness of the multiple ways to lodge complaints, built a new team within NBCUniversal (outside of NBC News) to take and investigate concerns, and worked hard to create an environment that is safe and respectful in every way.

Farrow takes the first false allegation – that we knew about Lauer's offenses – and uses it to sustain another, that we obstructed his reporting on Harvey Weinstein. Attached is the detailed accounting of that reporting, which we released in September 2018. Once, again, we stand by every word of it.

In the meantime, Farrow’s effort to defame NBC News is clearly motivated not by a pursuit of truth, but an axe to grind. It is built on a series of distortions, confused timelines, and outright inaccuracies. Below are a few more of the most egregious examples.

Sincerely,

Noah

Fact-Check

CLAIM: Weinstein and AMI/The National Enquirer threatened to expose Lauer while Farrow was reporting on Weinstein.

FACTS: Farrow asserts this based entirely on third-hand rumor. Farrow cites William Arkin, a former NBC employee, who says he was “told” this by anonymous third parties. Farrow says two anonymous sources at AMI also “heard the same thing”. He offers no corroboration. Because it did not happen. Not to mention, Farrow describes a meeting in the book between Weinstein and AMI, involving a “kill file of unpublished reporting about Lauer…” implying that Weinstein might have used this material to threaten NBC over Farrow’s reporting. By Farrow’s own timeline, the meeting took place “not long after” Sept 5. Farrow left NBC News for the New Yorker on August 17.

CLAIM: NBC didn’t want to pursue the Weinstein story because it wanted to “protect its secrets”.

FACTS: Over the last decade, NBC News has been on the front line of exposing sexual misconduct involving USA Gymnastics, Silicon Valley, Penn State and many other universities and prep schools, the Jehovah’s Witnesses, the State Department, the Secret Service, Capitol Hill, Bill Cosby, professional athletes, Fox News, the Catholic Church, Jeffrey Epstein, Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Roman Polanski, the US Military, sex trafficking rings in the US and abroad, and hundreds more -- all stories that pre-dated Farrow’s Weinstein reporting and Lauer’s firing . The notion that this one story, among all the others, equally sensitive and difficult, would be handled differently is illogical and absurd.

CLAIM: “Enhanced Severance” was a technicality used to cover harassment settlements.

FACTS: “Enhanced Severance” was a standard option for departing employees prior to May 2014, and the severance amount paid was based on years of service. Enhanced severance was the norm; it was paid to hundreds if not thousands of employees regardless of whether the employee had any claim against the company.

CLAIM: Farrow writes that there were “at least fifteen calls between Weinstein and three NBC executives” – Andy Lack, Noah Oppenheim, and Phil Griffin.

FACT: Intentionally omitted – of those calls, only one was to Oppenheim, one was answered by Lack, and thirteen were to Griffin. Griffin had no role whatsoever in Farrow’s investigation and told Weinstein in the small fraction of the incoming calls he answered only that Weinstein, like anyone else, would be given the chance to comment before we aired any allegations. Lack, completely unaware of Farrow’s work when reached by Weinstein, told him that. The only call with Oppenheim took place in August. In it, Weinstein ranted about Rose McGowan’s credibility and was told, again, only that he’d be given the chance to comment when we had a story ready for air. None of this was different from the calls we receive other difficult stories our investigative unit regularly breaks. And none of it played any role in our decision-making.

CLAIM: Farrow and his producer, Rich McHugh, were told to “stand down” and stop reporting the Weinstein story.

FACTS: McHugh writes in Vanity Fair that he was called into Rich Greenberg’s office on August 18 2017 and told to “stand down”. He intentionally omits the fact that one day prior, on August 17, Farrow had asked to take his reporting to a national magazine that he claimed was ready to publish immediately and NBC had agreed to that. McHugh was told to stand down because Farrow had chosen to leave the previous day.

CLAIM: NBC “obstructed” or “discouraged” Farrow’s Weinstein reporting.

FACTS: As he now acknowledges, NBC assigned Farrow the Weinstein story and actively supported it, editorially and financially, for seven months. We encouraged Farrow to go back to Rose McGowan and get her to name Harvey Weinstein on camera, we encouraged him to get the full Gutierrez recording and to arrange for his editor and an NBC lawyer to meet with her, and we repeatedly encouraged him to get a victim or witness on camera, on the record. He was unable to do so during his time at NBC.

CLAIM: NBC “delayed” Farrow’s reporting on Weinstein.

FACTS: Farrow submitted a draft script for the first time on July 25. It did not have a single victim or witness on the record, on camera and contained multiple claims not supported by the underlying reporting – detailed in our September 2018 memo. Farrow said he’d secured another interview with Rose McGowan on July 27. She cancelled that interview by July 30, and her lawyer sent a cease-and-desist on August 2. Farrow continued to revise his script and on August 8 was told two of the most seasoned investigative reporters at NBC News would work with him to advance the story. They immediately recognized it was not ready for air. While they worked to review his reporting and chart a path forward, he announced his desire to leave.

CLAIM: Farrow says the colleagues brought in to join his work— two of the most seasoned investigative reporters at NBC News — did not listen to the Ambra Gutierrez tape. He writes: “They didn’t ask to listen to the tape. As it turned out, they never would.”

FACTS: Farrow emailed Rich Greenberg at 2:36pm on August 16, 2017 stating “we played Liz the audio” — directly contradicting this claim in the book. In fact, Farrow largely omits the entire existence of the editorial review conducted by his colleagues because it fundamentally contradicts his conspiracy theory. These producers, completely independently, read Farrow’s interview transcripts, reviewed his notes of off-camera interviews, made fact-checking calls, and spoke to Farrow about the status of the women in his reporting, and as of the morning he left NBC, confirmed none had agreed to speak on the record

CLAIM: Farrow describes his script for NBC as follows: “The script we developed, over the course of late July, was spare and economical. It included the tape, naming Gutierrez with her cooperation, as well as McGowan’s on-camera, on-the-record interview, and Nestor’s interview with her face in shadow, accompanied by images of her messages from Irwin Reiter, documenting how Weinstein’s behavior was seen as a serial problem within the company. The evidence we’d uncovered of the two settlements in London was included, based on multiple firsthand accounts of the negotiations and the check from Bob Weinstein’s account. And there were sound bites from the four former employees who had gone on camera.”

FACTS: Farrow’s characterization is fundamentally deceptive in several critical ways as he attempts to gloss over the script’s most fundamental shortcoming — that he did not have any victims or witnesses on the record:"

On the roster: Biden son: Ukraine deals ‘poor judgement’ in ‘a swamp’ - Fight night in Ohio - Bolton called foul on Trump-Giuliani Ukraine moves - Giuliani got big bucks from indicted Ukrainian - For the long run



BIDEN SON: UKRAINE DEALS ‘POOR JUDGEMENT’ IN ‘A SWAMP’

ABC News: “As President Donald Trump continues to fill his Twitter feed and campaign speeches with attacks on Hunter Biden over his foreign business deals, the former vice president’s son defended the ethical implications of his private ventures in an interview with ABC News, but conceded taking a misstep in failing to foresee the political implications on his father’s career. ‘In retrospect, look, I think that it was poor judgment on my part. Is that I think that it was poor judgment because I don't believe now, when I look back on it -- I know that there was -- did nothing wrong at all,’ said Biden. However, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is...a swamp in—in—in many ways? Yeah.’”



Fight night in Ohio - Politico: “Bernie Sanders is recovering from his heart attack. Joe Biden is under siege, and laying into Donald Trump. And the entire Democratic presidential field has become consumed with the House’s impeachment inquiry into the Republican president. With so many candidates responding to circumstances beyond their control — and the threat of a destabilizing moment running high on a stage that’s expanding to 12 candidates from 10 — it’s raising the specter of a debate Tuesday that finally breaks the Democratic primary logjam. Not only is it the first debate since Sanders was hospitalized and the impeachment inquiry began, it also comes as many lower-polling candidates become increasingly desperate to make a mark on the campaign. At a fundraiser in Los Angeles last week, Biden acknowledged how much of the debate is out of any candidate's hands. … Biden said, ‘One of the problems I’m finding, I’ve got to be more aggressive.’”



Will Buttigieg throw elbows? - Politico: “Pete Buttigieg sees a path to the top tier of the Democratic primary field, elbowing his way between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren on one side and Joe Biden on the other. At the center of Buttigieg’s push is his health care plan, which the South Bend, Ind., mayor has dubbed ‘Medicare for all who want it.’ The plan would extend a public health insurance option to Americans without ending the private insurance market, an effect of the plan put forward by Sanders and endorsed by Warren. … Buttigieg also argued that his health care plan is tougher on insurance providers than Biden’s own public option proposal to build on Obamacare. ‘It turns out that setting up the exchanges has not been enough to empower all Americans to have good coverage,’ Buttigieg said.”



Beto says he need to ‘break through’ - Texas Tribune: “Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke raised $4.5 million in the third quarter, his campaign announced Friday as he acknowledged it was more urgent than ever to ‘break through’ in the still-crowded primary. The third-quarter total is an improvement over the $3.6 million that the former El Paso congressman took in during the previous quarter, and it came despite a halt to fundraising for roughly two weeks in August after the deadly El Paso shooting. Still, the total puts him behind a majority of primary rivals who have released their third-quarter figures so far, including two leading candidates who each raised around $25 million.”



Bloomberg back to floating trial balloons - CNBC: “Mike Bloomberg might end up running for president, after all. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, has indicated to associates in recent weeks that Joe Biden’s recent struggles against Sen. Elizabeth Warren are making him rethink his decision to stay out of the 2020 Democratic primary. That’s according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were deemed private. Bloomberg has signaled he’s ‘still looking at’ running for president, but people close him say that the only way he could even go down that path is if Biden’s fortunes suffer so much that he drops out before or during the early stages of the primary. Bloomberg could then enter the race as one of the rare moderates with enough name recognition and campaign funding to make a run.”



Dems on edge over cyberattacks - Politico: “The Democratic National Committee sent an urgent alert on Monday to every presidential campaign aimed at avoiding a repeat of the cybersecurity fiasco the party suffered at the hands of Russia and Wikileaks in 2016. The subject of the email was ‘Counter-Disinformation Update,’ and it was part of a regular series of communications by DNC Tech, the party’s in-house group responsible for internal security and monitoring the spread of fake news about Democrats. POLITICO obtained the full archive of DNC’s Tech’s missives to the presidential campaigns. They reveal a party struggling to combat the continued onslaught of the twin threats faced by the Democratic Party: cyber penetration from state actors abroad and the spread of disinformation about its top presidential candidates by Donald Trump and his allies at home. … It was a moment, the DNC warned, to be hyper vigilant about fake news.”



Seven years later, Warren changes tune on health care - Politico: “Seven years before Elizabeth Warren said ‘I’m with Bernie on Medicare for All,’ she was campaigning for the Senate and didn’t want to talk about single-payer health care. Running a tough race against Republican incumbent Scott Brown, the first-time candidate repeatedly distanced herself from the idea. … But during her first Senate campaign in 2012, she … dodged the question again and again, according to an analysis of newspaper reports, TV, and interviews with health care reform activists at the time. … Warren's refusal to embrace single-payer during that campaign came four years after she co-wrote an essay that called it the ‘most obvious’ solution to the nation's health care woes — though perhaps ‘politically unacceptable.’ Warren’s remarks in 2012, as well as her more circumspect attitude toward Medicare for All at the beginning of her presidential campaign, has exposed her to criticisms from the left.”



Warren strong in Q Poll, but still lags on electability - Quinnipiac University: “One day before the next Democratic debate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden remain locked in a close race for the top spot in the Democratic primary, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. Warren receives 30 percent of the vote among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, while Biden gets 27 percent.. … However, on the question of electability - which candidate has the best chance of winning against Donald Trump - Biden retains his commanding lead with 48 percent saying he has the best chance, compared to 49 percent in August. While still trailing Biden, Warren has increased her support from 9 percent in August to 21 percent today. No other candidate gets into double digits.”

TIME OUT: TO THE HOLY LAND

Smithsonian: “On April 1483, a German politician named Bernhard von Breydenbach embarked on a religious pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Breydenbach and his companions—among others, Dutch artist Erhard Reuwich—traveled at a leisurely clip, touring destinations including Venice, Corfu, Modon and Rhodes while en route. Two years after his pilgrimage, Breydenbach created an illustrated guide detailing the farflung locales he had visited on his trip. The text, titled Peregrinatio in Terram Sanctam, or A Pilgrimage to the Holy Land, was an instant sensation, with eleven editions in six languages published between 1486 and 1505. Now, one of the few surviving first editions of Breydenbach’s ‘15th-century bestseller’ is set to go on view at the British Museum… Giulia Bartrum, curator of German prints at the British Museum, [says] that prior to the text’s publication, ‘most of the depictions of places such as Jerusalem or Venice were totally made up.’”

BOLTON CALLED FOUL ON TRUMP-GIULIANI UKRAINE MOVES

Fox News: “Fiona Hill, the former senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs, told lawmakers on Monday that a July meeting with Ukrainian and U.S. officials about unspecified investigations left her and John Bolton, the former national security adviser, so concerned that he directed her to alert a lawyer in the National Security Council, Fox News confirmed. Hill, who exited the administration days before the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky, testified on Monday for about nine hours in front of three House panels where she reportedly raised concerns about a July 10 meeting. The Wall Street Journal reported that those at the hearing took her comments to refer to the ‘investigation that could implicate Biden and his son.’”



Giuliani got big bucks from indicted Ukrainian - Reuters: “President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was paid $500,000 for work he did for a company co-founded by the Ukrainian-American businessman arrested last week on campaign finance charges, Giuliani told Reuters on Monday. The businessman, Lev Parnas, is a close associate of Giuliani and was involved in his effort to investigate Trump’s political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, who is a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic Party nomination. Giuliani said Parnas’ company, Boca Raton-based Fraud Guarantee, whose website says it aims to help clients ‘reduce and mitigate fraud’, engaged Giuliani Partners, a management and security consulting firm, around August 2018. Giuliani said he was hired to consult on Fraud Guarantee’s technologies and provide legal advice on regulatory issues.”



Feds dig deeper - WSJ: “Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are examining Rudy Giuliani’s business dealings in Ukraine, including his finances, meetings and work for a city mayor there, according to people familiar with the matter. Investigators also have examined Giuliani’s bank records, according to the people. Witnesses have been questioned about Giuliani since at least August by investigators, who also want to know more about Giuliani’s role in an alleged conspiracy involving two of his business associates, the people said. The investigation is being led by the U.S. attorney’s office in the Southern District of New York. Giuliani has denied wrongdoing and on Monday said he hadn’t been informed of any investigation. ‘They can look at my Ukraine business all they want,’ he said.”



Dems return from recess more united on impeachment - WaPo: “…Just days after suddenly embracing an impeachment inquiry of President Trump — a moment of seeming political crisis — House leaders sent lawmakers home for their scheduled two-week recess. But as Congress returns to work Tuesday, fears of lost momentum, internal dissension and dissipating interest in impeachment have mostly evaporated among House Democrats, who view the past two weeks as among the most damaging to Trump as they dig in for their constitutional showdown with the president. … But on the central question of whether Trump ought to be investigated for potentially committing high crimes and misdemeanors worthy of removal from office, Democrats are now largely united: Only seven of 235 House Democrats have stopped short of endorsing the impeachment inquiry, and the White House position, laid out in a letter sent to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and three committee chairmen last week, has hardened the resolve of many Democrats.”

WNEP: “The Steamtown Marathon [in Scranton, Pa.] brings out hundreds of spectators each year to cheer for the runners… For the last 24 years, 90-year-old Marie Rupp has been hosting a water station for the thousands of runners that make their way through the borough. … But this year is different. After a fall, Marie went to live at a rehab facility. It would be the first marathon she would not be out cheering for the runners. That's when her neighbors stepped in. ‘We felt it very important to get her out of there for the day and bring her back to the tradition that she started,’ said Sean Osborne of Archbald. Wrapped in a blanket with a space heater for extra warmth, Marie was on Laurel Street with her neighbors as runners passed by. And while she says she is no longer in charge, her neighbors know she still calls the shots. … ‘It's exciting! It puts life in our bones,’ Marie said.”

BIDENS ACKNOWLEDGE ETHICS WOES

NYT: “Hunter Biden, whose overseas business dealings have drawn relentless attacks from President Trump and posed a threat to the candidacy of his father, Joseph R. Biden Jr., intends to step down from the board of a Chinese company, BHR, by the end of the month, his lawyer said on Sunday, a move his father later lauded in a forceful defense of his son’s integrity. The lawyer also said in a statement that if Mr. Biden were to be elected president, his son would ‘agree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign-owned companies.’ The decision is the first action the pro-Biden camp has taken that appears to acknowledge the extent to which Hunter Biden’s business practices have created an untenable problem for his father’s 2020 campaign. With the fourth Democratic primary debate only two days away … Mr. Biden’s lower-polling Democratic rivals have suggested his son’s work overseas raises questions about conflict of interest.”



Rolls out ethics, campaign finance plan in reply - Reuters: “Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden would look to ban private money from federal elections, his campaign said on Monday in a plan for government ethics that doubled as an attack on President Donald Trump. … The former U.S. vice president is promising to match individual donations for elections with government funding, and to block cash from private sources. Biden would also establish a new commission to enforce anti-corruption laws, bar lobbying by foreign governments and require candidates to disclose their tax returns.”



Dems still hedging on Warren - NYT: “Senator Elizabeth Warren has built her following in part by taking pictures with thousands of voters deep into evening after campaign events, but her dinner audience [in Washington] one night last month was far smaller. And Ms. Warren’s guests were more interested in hearing, and politely challenging, her campaign pitch… Addressing a few dozen members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus at a Chinese restaurant a few blocks from the Capitol, she laid out her case… But just under a month since the family-style meal, the Massachusetts senator has the same small number of endorsements from congressional colleagues beyond her home state as she did beforehand: three. … [H]er growing crowd sizes, soaring fund-raising and surge to the top of a number of national and early-state polls only shine a brighter light on one of the most revealing elements of this primary: the widening gap between the preferences of many Democratic voters and the lawmakers who represent them.”



Trump said to still want Warren - Axios: “President Trump's allies still fear a general election matchup against a banged-up Joe Biden more than a run against an invigorated Elizabeth Warren, people close to the president tell Axios. Warren has surpassed Biden in some primary polls, seemingly helped by the early coverage of Trump's efforts to get Ukraine to investigate conspiracy theories involving Biden and his son Hunter. And a Fox News poll now shows Biden and Warren each would lead Trump, 50% to 40%. … Several advisers in Trumpworld told [Axios] that Warren is arguably a better candidate in terms of being quick on her feet and prepared on a debate stage. But those advisers say her liberal stances on some issues and her ‘likeability’ problem with segments of general election voters make her weaker against Trump than even a Biden hindered by gaffes, generational dissonances and a son with personal drama and a lobbying record.”



Sanders slams Warren as ‘capitalist’ - Fox News: “Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders … is seeking to cut into the support of his rival by dismissing her as a ‘capitalist.’ ‘There are differences between Elizabeth and myself,’ Sanders said during an interview Sunday on ABC’s ‘This Week.’ ‘Elizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I’m not.’ The comments come amid a rise in socialism in the Democratic Party, as candidates become more willing to openly embrace socialism over capitalism. It also follows polling showing that Democrats now view socialism more positively than they do capitalism. Last year, when asked if she was a capitalist, Warren reportedly said, ‘I am a capitalist to my bones.’ Sanders explained he is not a capitalist because he ‘will not tolerate for one second the kind of greed and corruption and income and wealth inequality and so much suffering that is going on in this country today, which is unnecessary.’”

History: “[On this day 72 years ago] U.S. Air Force Captain Chuck Yeager becomes the first person to fly faster than the speed of sound. Yeager, born in Myra, West Virginia, in 1923, was a combat fighter during World War II and flew 64 missions over Europe. He shot down 13 German planes and was himself shot down over France, but he escaped capture with the assistance of the French Underground. After the war, he was among several volunteers chosen to test-fly the experimental X-1 rocket plane, built by the Bell Aircraft Company to explore the possibility of supersonic flight. … Yeager flew the X-1 over Rogers Dry Lake in Southern California. The X-1 was lifted to an altitude of 25,000 feet by a B-29 aircraft and then released through the bomb bay, rocketing to 40,000 feet and exceeding 662 miles per hour (the sound barrier at that altitude). The rocket plane, nicknamed ‘Glamorous Glennis,’ was designed with thin, unswept wings and a streamlined fuselage modeled after a .50-caliber bullet.”

AMBASSADOR LAYS UKRAINE CLAIMS OFF ON TRUMP

AP: “A U.S. ambassador is expected to tell Congress that his text message reassuring another envoy that there was no quid pro quo in their interactions with Ukraine was based solely on what President Donald Trump told him, according to a person familiar with his coming testimony in the impeachment probe. Gordon Sondland, Trump’s hand-picked ambassador to the European Union, is among administration officials being subpoenaed to appear on Capitol Hill this week against the wishes of the White House.”



Former top Russia aide talks, too - Politico: “President Donald Trump’s former top Russia aide arrived on Capitol Hill Monday to testify before House impeachment investigators, as Democrats accelerate efforts to unearth the facts of Rudy Giuliani’s shadow diplomacy with top Ukrainian officials. Democrats view Fiona Hill’s closed-door testimony as critical to their understanding of the extent to which Giuliani, the president’s personal attorney, bypassed official U.S. government channels by pressuring Ukrainian officials to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump’s possible opponent in the 2020 presidential election.”



Hairy situation: Inside the botched effort to hire Trey Gowdy - NYT: “For 24 hours last week, Trey Gowdy, the former South Carolina congressman best known for leading congressional investigations of Hillary Clinton, was the new face of President Trump’s outside legal defense and a symbol of a streamlined effort to respond to a fast-moving impeachment inquiry. A day later, the arrangement fell apart, with lobbying rules prohibiting Mr. Gowdy from starting until January, possibly after the inquiry is over. Now, according to two people familiar with events, Mr. Gowdy is never expected to join the team. And Trump advisers are back to square one, searching for a different lawyer.”



House impeachment roadmap shaping up - Axios: “Ahead of this week's subpoenas and depositions, new documents obtained by Axios show how Democrats are taking the impeachment inquiry in two tightly focused directions: Ukraine and obstruction of justice. Why it matters: There are new temptations for Democrats to broaden the scope of their inquiry after developments last week including President Trump's gift to Turkey, new questions about coordination with the Chinese over Hunter Biden, and the dramatic airport arrests of two of Rudy Giuliani's associates with Eastern European backgrounds and their indictments on campaign finance violations. But for now, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appears to be sticking with her instincts to keep the probe tight and as simple as possible for Americans to understand.”



RNC spends to tweak vulnerable House Dems on impeachment - McClatchy: “Republicans are planning to target Democrats in swing districts with a new round of ads on impeachment this week as lawmakers return from their fall recess. The Republican National Committee will spend $350,000 on a multi-media buy as part of a strategy that includes digital ads, text messages and phone calls starting Tuesday calling on Democratic House members to 'stop the madness.' The effort is primarily targeted at the 31 Democrats in districts President Donald Trump carried in 2016. ‘We’ll emphasize it’s time to move on,’ RNC spokesman Rick Gorka told McClatchy. ‘There are real issues they could be working on, anything but this.’ Rep. Lucy McBath, D-Georgia, who supports an impeachment inquiry, is one of the GOP targets.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Was Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch an Obama appointee or a Trump appointee? If she was a holdover from the Obama years doesn’t make a little bit of sense for Trump to do some housecleaning? From what I understand some Ambassador appointments are given to friends and people who do something (in the campaign) to help the president get into office.” – Mary Blanton, Alpharetta, Ga.



[Ed. note: There are all different kinds of ambassadors, Ms. Blanton. There are two main categories: political appointees and career diplomats. Among the “political” there are two broad groups: Positions of such import that presidents want trusted confidantes and loyalists. Then there are postings to places so safe and stable that they can be doled out to donors and key supporters as patronage plums. The divide on the “career” side is similar. Some are to places of little strategic importance but are so poor and/or remote that fat cats wouldn’t want to perch there. But many are to places where the work is just too sensitive to risk amateurism. Our ambassadors face terrible risks on a regular basis in places around the world where, but do so in service of crucial American goals. We want top people with deep knowledge of the language, culture and history of places like Iraq, Turkey and, yes, Ukraine, to serve in such posts. Yovanovitch is one of these folks. She was appointed to her former post by then-President Obama. But before that, George W. Bush appointed her to the strategically important former Soviet republics of Kyrgyzstan and Armenia. She started in the Foreign Service in 1986. She’s a lifer. So while it’s true that she was an Obama appointee, it’s probably better to think of her as a product of our Foreign Service system more than anything else.]



“I would love to hear your reaction to the following idea: There should be a law that the federal government cannot tax any citizen at a rate in excess of 33 1/3%. This is to prevent any candidate from getting votes by simply suggesting that they will tax ‘the rich’ at 50%, 60% or 70%. Low income people are apt to vote for those candidates for the wrong reason. What say you?” – Ted Boers, Grand Rapids, Mich.



[Ed. note: I hear you, Mr. Boers, but you’d have to quickly come up with a LOT of additional dough. Rich people – the 40 percent of highest earners – pay something like 70 percent of all the taxes. If you knock down the two top tax rates – 37 percent and 35 percent – that would be a lot of money off the table. Leaving aside that practical consideration, there’s this one: You’d really need a constitutional amendment to do what you’re describing. It’s very hard to imagine getting supermajority support for something that would immediately be unpopular with the bottom 60 percent of earners. In the coming fiscal disasters awaiting America, we’re going to have some tough fights over taxes and spending – the very fights lawmakers have been pushing off for decades. It’s going to be ugly and weird and a number of proposals once considered unthinkable will suddenly sound mainstream. Fiscal conservatives would probably do better to get ready for that moment.]



“In quite deservedly praising Cardinal shortstop Paul DeJong you parenthetically asked ‘(whoever heard of a slugger shortstop?).’ Does the name Ernie (Let’s play two) Banks ring a bell? In the four years from 1957 through 1960 when he was the Cubs regular shortstop he hit 176 home runs (yearly average 44), leading the league twice. Over that same period, he drove in 491 runs (yearly average 123), again twice leading the league. He wasn’t just an offensive force, winning a Gold Glove for his defensive play in 1960. Additionally, he was the National League Most Valuable Player in both 1958 and 1959 despite playing for a sorry team that in both years finished fifth in an eight team league. So, to answer your question — I have, as have the many others who undoubtedly have written to point out your egregious error. (I still love you).” – Bob Foys, Chicago



[Ed. note: There’s always a Cubs fan out there! Always! You are quite right, Mr. Foys. Other than to a lesser degree Robin Yount and Derek Jeter, Banks is the cream of the power hitting shortstop crop. I’m including your note for two reasons: 1) Goodness knows Cubs fans need something to be cheerful about in October 2) Maybe this expression of goodwill will help snap the Cardinals out of their slough of despair against the Nats!]

Metro: “A rhino was filmed going for a walkabout in a crowded market. The animal casually strolled past liquor shops and clothes showrooms in Nepal as shocked members of the public looked on. What was probably more surprising is no-one seemed to be scared of the rhino, which had strayed from the popular Chitwan National Park. Some tourists were so comfortable they even took selfies with the large beast on Thursday. Shankar Kandu Ravi, 31, from Uttar Pradesh in India, followed the elusive animal for about ten minutes and then took a picture with it. … Mr. Ravi said the rhino even came face-to-face with a couple but didn’t attack anyone. He added: ‘It was just acting to scare the couple. It warned people to not come close.’ ‘Next morning, I had inquired about it and learnt that it returned to the jungle early in the morning.’”

* There was a lively Democratic presidential primary debate in Westerville, Ohio, last night. The next gathering will be in Georgia on Nov. 20.

* Bernie Sanders hasn’t picked up many congressional endorsements for his presidential campaign, but he’s now picking up two fairly high-profile backers: first-year Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).

* Joe Biden’s campaign appears to have a rather serious financial problem: as the 2020 race enters the next stage, the former vice president only had about $9 million cash on hand as of two weeks ago. In contrast, Bernie Sanders had $33.7 million in the bank, Elizabeth Warren had $25.7 million, Pete Buttigieg had $23.3 million, and Kamala Harris had $10.5 million.

* With only three weeks remaining in Kentucky’s gubernatorial race, the latest Mason-Dixon poll shows incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin (R) tied with state Attorney General Andy Beshear (D), with each garnering 46% support.

* On a related note, Bevin’s fate is reportedly of keen interest to the White House, and Team Trump is reportedly “planning an 11th-hour push to stave off an embarrassing defeat” for the far-right governor.

* And speaking of the Bluegrass State, a judge yesterday sided with the Kentucky Democratic Party and ordered State Board of Elections to keep 175,000 purged voters on the state’s voter rolls.

* In Maine., the latest survey from Public Policy Polling found Sen. Susan Collins (R) trailing a generic Democrat in next year’s U.S. Senate race, 41% to 44%. The incumbent Republican hasn’t yet officially declared whether she’ll run for another term.

* In a newly released audio recording, Texas state House Speaker Dennis Bonnen (R) is heard telling a far-right activist that Donald Trump is “killing” the party “in the urban-suburban districts.”

* And though the president’s GOP primary rivals stand no realistic chance of success, it seemed notable that a Franklin Pierce University-Boston Herald poll found former Gov. Bill Weld with 14% support in New Hampshire, up from 3% in the same poll last month."

Smith originally joined the franchise in The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. She even had a leading role in the PlayStation 2 title Enter the Matrix. There are currently no details as to how large a role Niobe will play in the upcoming film, but many are speculating how she could return to the franchise given the ending of the trilogy, similar to returning stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss.

Many even believe this collection of returning characters will shepherd the franchise off to newcomer and lead star Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, who is speculated to have some sort of relation to Lawrence Fishburne’s Morpheus.

Kamala Harris, who had 4% support in the poll, was the only other candidate above 2%.

* The New York Times published quite a report on the planned voter purge in Ohio’s Republican-led state government: “When Ohio released a list of people it planned to strike from its voting rolls, around 40,000 people shouldn’t have been on it. The state only found out because of volunteer sleuthing.” In all, Ohio intended to purge 235,000 Americans from the state voter rolls, and roughly one-in-five voters on the purge list weren’t supposed to be there.

* In Louisiana over the weekend, voters handed Republicans significant state legislative gains, which will likely cause headaches for Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) if he wins a gubernatorial runoff next month.

Harris previously sent a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in which she listed a series of problems she had with the president's Twitter activity. When asked about the idea, Warren laughed it off and flatly rejected it at the beginning of October.

Harris apparently saw that and referenced her answer during Tuesday's Democratic debate. ""I would urge you to join me,"" she said before claiming that Trump used Twitter to ""obstruct justice.""

Harris also pointed to August's mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, claiming the perpetrator was ""informed"" by how Trump used the platform.

WARREN LAUGHS OFF SUGGESTION THAT TWITTER BAN AFTER TRUMP AFTER HARRIS' CALL FOR SUSPENSION

""This is a matter of corporate responsibility. Twitter should be held accountable and shut down that site,"" she said. ""It is a matter of safety.""

Warren seemed to agree Trump should leave Twitter but didn't explicitly endorse his suspension. ""So look, I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter, I want to push him out of the White House. That's our job,"" she said.

When Harris pressed Warren on joining her call to suspend Trump, Warren shook her head and said ""no."" Harris, apparently surprised, smiled and said ""wow.""

Harris ignited a Twitter controversy in October after she alerted Dorsey to one of Trump's tweets. At that point, she had already sent her letter in which she told the company: ""I believe the president's recent tweets rise to the level that Twitter should consider suspending his account. When this kind of abuse is being spewed from the most powerful office in the United States, the stakes are too high to do nothing.""

While taking questions at a United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) candidate forum in Altoona, Iowa, the White House contender was asked by UFCW President Marc Perrone if she would prosecute Trump for impeachment.

""I've been calling for the impeachment of this president for a long time,"" replied Harris, a former prosecutor in San Francisco. ""And, based on everything I know, yes.""

She claimed Trump already has confessed to trying to using the power of his office to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, who previously was on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings.

""We have a confession. We have a coverup,"" Harris said, referring to reports alleging that White House lawyers moved the transcript of Trump's phone call with Zelensky from the computer system where they're normally kept to a more secure system.

Trump, on the contrary, repeatedly has denied doing anything wrong. He called his phone call with Zelensky ""perfect.""

She added: ""Just two days ago, The New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia -- completely despicable.""

After the three-hour televised event, viewers and some Democratic hopefuls slammed debate moderator Anderson Cooper’s final question of the evening, which did not focus on what many thought could have been more important issues, like climate change.

“Last week, Ellen DeGeneres was criticized after she and former President George W. Bush were seen laughing together at a football game. Ellen defended their friendship, saying, ‘We’re all different and I think that we’ve forgotten that that’s OK, that we’re all different,’” Cooper said to the 12 candidates onstage.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joe Biden locked in a close race for their party’s nomination.

Warren stood at 30 percent support in a Quinnipiac University survey Monday of Democratic voters and independents who leaned toward the party. Biden, the unrivaled front-runner until Warren’s surge in the polls the past couple of months, was at 27 percent.

Warren’s three percentage point advantage was within the survey’s margin of error.

GABBARD BACKS DOWN AFTER DEBATE BOYCOTT THREAT

The poll was the third conducted by Quinnipiac since late last month showing Warren with a slight edge over Biden.

“For Senator Warren, the third straight time essentially tied at the top is the charm,” Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy emphasized. “Her candidacy clearly has staying power going into the debate.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont stood at 11 percent, with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent and Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 4 percent.

Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang and billionaire environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer each registered at 2 percent in the poll. The other candidates in the shrinking – but still large – field of contenders stood at 1 percent or less.

Quinnipiac’s survey differed from a Fox News poll released last week that indicated Biden at 32 percent, with Warren ten points back at 22 percent and Sanders at 17 percent. No other candidate cracked double digits in the Fox News survey.

THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL IN THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

Twelve candidates qualified for Tuesday’s debate, which is set to be held at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. They are – in alphabetical order – Biden, Booker, Buttigieg, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Harris, Klobuchar, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, Sanders, Steyer, Warren and Yang.

While national primary horserace polls have grabbed plenty of attention, the battle for the nomination is a fight for the states and their delegates. And, a new poll in New Hampshire, the state holding the first presidential primary, indicated a three-way tie at the top.

Warren stood at 25 percent support among likely Democratic primary voters in the Granite State in a Boston Herald-Franklin Pierce University survey, with Biden at 24 percent and Sanders at 22 percent. Buttigieg stood at 9 percent and Harris at 5 percent, with no one else in the field topping 2 percent.

In New Hampshire’s Republican presidential contest, President Trump remained the overwhelming favorite against three extreme long-shot primary challengers, but his support has deteriorated from 88 percent a month ago to 71 percent in the survey. One of the primary challengers, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, saw his support jump from 3 percent in early September to 14 percent in the new survey.

The Boston Herald-Franklin Pierce University poll was conducted Oct. 9-13, with 422 likely Democratic primary voters and 405 likely Republican primary voters in New Hampshire questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s margin of error was plus or minus 4.8 percentage points for Democratic primary questions and plus or minus 4.9 percentage points for GOP primary questions.

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted October 11-13, with 1,195 self-identified registered voters nationwide questioned by live telephone operators.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was the big winner Tuesday night in Westerville, Ohio in the most crowded presidential debate ever held. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., also delivered strong performances.

Former Vice President Joe Biden and the other eight candidates on stage came out the losers in the three-hour Democratic presidential primary debate.

BIGGEST WINNER: Elizabeth Warren

Warren’s strong performance will likely solidify her frontrunner status ahead of Biden and Sanders. She emerged the clear winner of the night by showing she was sharp and prepared as she fended off attacks from candidates who were looking to cut into her polling lead.

WARREN COMES UNDER ATTACK FROM ALL SIDES AT DEM DEBATE, AS BIDEN DEFENDS SON'S BUSINESS PRACTICES

Even during the heated exchanges over health care and a wealth tax, Warren was able to turn attacks leveled against her around, and still deliver the best answers of the evening.

Warren questioned why the other candidates “think it is more important to protect billionaires than to invest in Americans” when responding to an attack on her plan for a wealth tax.

And importantly, Warren remained the focal point of the debate, speaking for the most amount of time of all of the candidates.

The senator from Massachusetts now has unmatched fundraising and polling momentum, along with a series of strong debate performances. This, coupled with the fact that Biden and Sanders have been weakened in dissimilar but debilitating ways recently, almost guarantees that Warren will take over as the front-runner.

SURPRISE WINNER: Bernie Sanders

Sanders has faced a precipitous decline in the most recent polls given the significant questions about his health and stamina following his recent heart attack.

However, Sanders delivered a strong, forceful performance in the debate, succeeding in showing voters that he has not lost a step, making him the second-place finisher of the night.

But it is clear that Warren has supplanted Sanders as the leader of the progressive movement in the Democratic field. As a result, it will be difficult – if not impossible – for Sanders to reestablish himself ahead of Warren.

It is clear that Warren has supplanted Sanders as the leader of the progressive movement in the Democratic field. As a result, it will be difficult – if not impossible – for Sanders to reestablish himself ahead of Warren.

SURPRISE WINNER: Pete Buttigieg

Buttigieg has been called the breakout star of the Democratic field – though he has recently struggled to distinguish himself. He had several strong moments in the Tuesday night debate. He was able to make a compelling case as a young, center-left candidate from a swing state with a military background.

Buttigieg was particularly strong during a tense exchange with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii over President Trump’s decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria, delivering a response that elicited cheers from the audience.

“Respectfully congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong,” the mayor said. “The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it's a consequence of a withdrawal and betrayal by this president of American allies and American values.”

Ultimately, Buttigieg’s performance will likely result in a post-debate polling bump with moderate voters, especially given Biden’s relatively weak debate performance.

LOSERS

BIGGEST LOSER: Joe Biden

All eyes, particularly those of Democratic leaders, strategists, and donors were on Biden, who needed deliver a strong performance to reassure voters that he is ready for a general election fight against Trump.

However, Biden was unable to break through and deliver the forceful showing that he needed, dodging a question regarding his son’s work with Ukraine and delivering several other uneven answers throughout the night.

With each passing day, Biden seems to move further from securing the Democratic presidential nomination, and his unimpressive performance Tuesday night will likely result in a post-debate polling decline.

LOSER: Amy Klobuchar

Additionally, although Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota had a number of well-executed lines taking aim at Warren, many felt similar to the inconsequential attacks leveled against Warren by former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland during the first debate. Thus, Klobuchar’s performance is unlikely to result in the post-debate polling spike her campaign needed.

LOSER: Kamala Harris

Sen. Kamala Harris of California similarly fell short, as she failed to distinguish herself in any meaningful way at a time when her campaign desperately needs a boost. Given that recent polls have her hoovering at around 5 percent, she will likely not be able to regain the momentum she had just over two months ago.

LOSERS: Gabbard, Castro, Steyer, Booker, O’Rourke and Yang

The remaining candidates – all barely registering in polls – were the biggest losers of the night. Rep. Gabbard, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, philanthropist Tom Steyer, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas and entrepreneur Andrew Yang failed to have the breakout moment they all desperately needed to show voters they could defeat Trump in November 2020.

Project Veritas, whose founder, James O'Keefe, describes himself as a “guerrilla journalist,” built up the release on social media with an “#ExposeCNN” hashtag. The CNN/New York Times Democratic presidential debate is scheduled to feature 12 leading 2020 hopefuls duking it out from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio -- but the latest batch of alleged undercover recordings could indicate which candidates are preferred by CNN brass.

CNN'S BRIAN STELTER WIDELY RIDICULED AFTER BLAMING TECH ISSUES FOR BIZARRE ANTI-TRUMP SEGMENT

Fox News has not independently verified what Project Veritas says is a clandestine recording of CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker and members of his staff discussing their thoughts on the 2020 presidential race. The network has “already picked its winners and losers,” the Project Veritas narrator says.

“It's incredible that CNN is holding the debate when it's not a neutral referee, it's an advocate for the most-radical leftist policies. The Project Veritas videos are showing CNN for what it has become, the TV headquarters of The Resistance,” Media Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor told Fox News.

CNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

CNN HAS BAD WEEK AMID APRIL RYAN, CHRIS CUOMO AND DON LEMON NEWS: ‘IT WAS QUITE EMBARRASSING’

CNN’s previous Democratic debate, a two-night summer marathon, was criticized by both sides of the aisle. Viewers complained that CNN’s format did not allow articulate answers because of time restrictions and that questions were specifically designed to create tension between candidates. “It was not CNN’s finest hour,” Poynter’s Tom Jones wrote.

CNN hosts Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper are set to moderate the follow-up event on Tuesday, along with New York Times editor Marc Lacey. But the debate comes amid another public relations headache for the network.

A person identified as CNN’s senior justice correspondent, Evan Perez, is claimed to be featured on a recording saying “Joe Biden has a problem, because his son was trading in his name.” Another CNN staffer is claimed to be heard saying the network is less fair to candidates Andrew Yang and Amy Klobuchar than other 2020 hopefuls.

CNN BOSS JEFF ZUCKER ESCAPES QUESTIONS ABOUT OLD COLLEAGUE MATT LAUER

“I think they like Warren a lot,” a person identified as CNN Media Coordinator Christian Sierra says in the video. “They’re pro-Warren for now.”

Sierra is also claimed to have said, “They don’t like Tulsi Gabbard” and detailed Cooper’s disdain for Trump. “Every day, he’s always like mocking him and stuff.”

PROJECT VERITAS’ ALLEGED CNN WHISTLEBLOWER CLAIMS NETWORK IS ‘PUMPING OUT PROPAGANDA'

The Project Veritas videos feature now-former CNN satellite uplink technician Cary Poarch (he was fired after the first batch of recordings were released), who secretly recorded some of the network’s morning editorial meetings. Poarch said he still considers himself a Democrat but, “spent many sleepless night” pondering the bias within CNN and hope to ensure a “free and fair” election.

“It’s very obvious. It's an unwritten rule that if you are center, center right, or heaven forbid, full-right Republican Trump supporter, then you are not welcome at CNN,” Poarch said in the second installment of videos.

Zucker is also heard pushing coverage of Kamala Harris’ demand for Twitter to suspend President Trump’s account despite admitting it wasn’t actually going to happen.

TRUMP SAYS AMERICA WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT 'CNNs OF THE WORLD' AFTER FIERY NEWS CONFERENCE

“It’s not gonna happen, but it’s a good segment in the show, ‘Should Trump’s Twitter account be suspended?,’ It’s obviously what Kamala Harris has… others are talking about it. Not gonna happen, but it’s a good talk, it’s a good segment,” Zucker said.

Monday’s initial release featured recordings made by Poarch capturing Zucker telling top news executives to focus solely on impeachment even at the expense of other important news.

“I don’t care about the MSNBC event, OK? I don’t care about them. Let’s just stay very focused on impeachment,” a person identified as Zucker says in the recording on the day of an MSNBC town hall event. “We shouldn’t just pretend, oh, this is going one way. And so all of these moves are toward impeachment.”

Poarch said he decided to wear a hidden camera because of CNN's perceived bias, and said he secretly recorded Zucker’s 9 a.m. rundown conference call because the network was “pumping out propaganda.”

MAINSTREAM MEDIA SHREDS CNN DEMOCRATIC DEBATE: ‘THE CLEAR INTENT WAS TO SPARK FIGHTS’

“I noticed after… that there was a strong group-think that permeated through the halls and that everyone was onboard the ‘I hate Trump Train,” Poarch said.

Poarch said on “Hannity” during an exclusive interview on Monday night that he no longer works for CNN as a result of the secret recording.

Zucker, who began his career at NBC, rose from researcher all the way to president and CEO of NBC Universal. Along the way, he was responsible for increasing Donald Trump’s fame when he greenlighted “The Apprentice.”

Zucker and the president famously have feuded since Trump’s foray into politics, with the president attacking the liberal network on a regular basis and accusing CNN of unfair coverage. CNN has filled its primetime lineup with anti-Trump opinion hosts and the network’s White House correspondent, Jim Acosta, has made a name for himself by quarreling with members of the administration when they are available to the press.

“Its employees have been opposing the president and pushing for his removal so much that it is obvious it's the corporate position of the network,” Gainor said.

Barely registering the polls and with less than $700,000 of campaign cash on hand, the former San Antonio, Texas mayor who later served as Housing and Urban Development secretary under President Barack Obama is facing the possibility that his appearance at the debate at Otterbein University in suburban Columbus, Ohio may well be the last time he makes the stage.

BUTTIGIEG AND O'ROURKE CLASH OVER GUNS DURING DEBATE

Castro grabbed only 8.2 minutes of speaking time at the debate – the third least amount among the record-setting 12 candidates on the stage – and didn’t score a breakout moment.

But in an interview with Fox News in the spin room following the debate, Castro vowed that he’ll fight on even if fails to make November’s cut and optimistically said he’ll qualify for the next debate.

“I’m going to keep fighting on. I believe that with hard work, we can make the next debate in Atlanta. We have about three and a half weeks to do that. So I’m going to keep working hard to get there,” he said.

Castro’s comments stand in contrast to his dire warning to supporters in a fundraising email late last week.

""I don’t say this lightly: If I don’t make the next debate stage, it will be the end of my campaign,"" Castro emphasized.

FOX NEWS' BRETT BAIER ON DEBATE WINNERS AND LOSERS

To date, eight candidates say they’ve qualified: They are – in alphabetical order – are former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Kamala Harris of California and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, businessman and progressive and environmental advocate Tom Steyer, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

After the debate, it was hard to find a political pundit who praised Castro’s performance.

But asked by Fox News if his debate performance helped him in his goal to make the next debate stage, the candidate said, “I think so. It’s always a scramble for time with 12 people up there but I made the best use of the time that I did get. I was very sharp on issues that people care about and I think that will make a difference.”

And he touted on Twitter that “donations are coming in from all around the country.”

Castro also took aim at the media hosts for the debate - CNN and the New York Times – telling reporters in the spin room and highlighting on Twitter that there were “three hours and no questions tonight about climate, housing, or immigration. Climate change is an existential threat. America has a housing crisis. Children are still in cages at our border.”"

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., announced that she would no longer be accepting campaign donations of more than $200 from big businesses and challenged her fellow White House hopefuls to be more transparent about how they’re funding their own campaigns.

Warren blasted some of her Democratic primary rivals in a post on Medium, in which she accused them of “hobnobbing with the rich and powerful” and “handing out secret titles and honors to rich donors.”

“I’m proud to be running a grassroots-funded campaign for president, and I hope my fellow candidates for the Democratic nomination will do the same,” Warren wrote. “That’s why I’m also calling on every candidate in this race to disclose any donor or fundraiser who has a special title on their campaign…and to disclose the dates and locations of their fundraising events and the names of every person who appears on a host committee on invitations tied to those events.”

THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL IN THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

Warren added: “If Democratic candidates for president want to spend their time hobnobbing with the rich and powerful, it is currently legal for them to do so – but they shouldn’t be handing out secret titles and honors to rich donors. Voters have a right to know who is buying access and recognition — and how much it costs.”

In her post, Warren does not specifically call out any of her fellow candidates, but her words appear to be a rebuke of Democratic presidential primary hopefuls like former Vice President Joe Bide, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif, and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Each of these candidates have raised millions of dollars through fundraisers and private events with wealthy donors — a practice that is common in both major political parties in the U.S.

Warren, along with fellow candidate and Vermont lawmaker Bernie Sanders, have spurned big-dollar donors this campaign season, in favor of relying on small-dollar, online donations. The results have surprisingly seen them outraising other candidates last quarter.

Warren’s critics have slammed her for holding fundraisers in the past and using some of the money left in her war chest to launch her 2020 presidential bid. But since announcing her candidacy, Warren has not taken any PAC or big-dollar donations.

“I’m not going to take any contributions over $200 from executives at big tech companies, big banks, private equity firms, or hedge funds,” Warren wrote. “And when I’m the Democratic nominee for president, I’m not going to change a thing in how I run my campaign: No PACs. No federal lobbyists. No special access or call time with rich donors or big dollar fundraisers to underwrite my campaign.”

Despite outraising most other candidates last quarter, Warren’s rivals still say that the small-dollar donations will hinder her chances of defeating President Trump should she win the Democratic nomination.

“We're not going to beat him with pocket change,"" Buttigieg said in a Snapchat post, adding that Democrats ""need the full spectrum of support in order to compete.”"

The company, FCTRY, showcased its ""AOC"" doll design through an online fundraising site, asking supporters to help finance its product along with other political action figures. The fundraiser started on Tuesday but has already surpassed its goal of $15,000, which it hoped to achieve by mid-November.

""But we've got a pretty good track record of spotting real-life heroes in the making and from where we sit, AOC has the makings of a legend. So we're doing what we do best and turning her into an action figure.""

A promotional video debuts the ""AOC"" toy with a series of cheers describing her as a model feminist, activist and Democrat. ""Tell me what a role model looks like. This is what a role model looks like,"" voices on the video say in a call-and-response fashion typical of street protests.

FCTRY also displays infographics detailing the congresswoman's rise to prominence and touting her activism.

""Just two years ago, AOC was an anonymous 20-something waiting tables and tending bars in New York City, and now she is literally one of the most influential politicians in the United States. Things like this don't happen in real life, right?"" the company asked.

The promotional video also praises AOC for supporting a climate protest outside of then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's office in November of 2018. Since becoming House speaker, Pelosi, D-Calif., has clashed with the congresswoman -- suggesting her social media following was relatively insignificant when compared with the amount of power she and other progressives had in Congress.

But FCTRY touted her Twitter following -- 5.5. million followers -- along with her status as the youngest congresswoman ever elected.

The Hill media reporter Joe Concha told Fox News that CNN’s debate enhanced its already not-so-respectable reputation.

TULSI GABBARD SLAMS CNN, NEW YORK TIMES DURING DEBATE FOR 'DESPICABLE' 'SMEARS' OVER SYRIA, RUSSIA

“The network is under heavy criticism from the left and right today, and rightly so,” Concha said. “Its pursuit of sizzle over steak and focus on social issues over truly substantiate matters – economy, jobs, opioid crisis, border crisis, all-things China – has damaged the network's credibility even further.”

CNN partnered up with The New York Times for the event, which was moderated by CNN's Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper and Gray Lady editor Marc Lacey. While viewers complained about several issues with the moderators, a question Cooper asked about Ellen DeGeneres and former President George W. Bush’s friendship was perhaps the most lampooned.

“Three hours and no questions tonight about climate, housing, or immigration,” Julian Castro tweeted. “Climate change is an existential threat. America has a housing crisis. Children are still in cages at our border. But you know, Ellen.”

Sen. Kamala Harris also took to Twitter to criticize the moderators, noting there weren’t questions about climate change, LGBTQ rights or immigration.

“These issues are too important to ignore,” Harris wrote.

While Castro and Harris used social media, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hi., slammed CNN and The Times directly from the debate stage over what she described as ""smears"" against her on foreign policy.

""The New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime-change war,"" Gabbard said. ""Just two days ago, The New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia -- completely despicable.""

CNN BOSS JEFF ZUCKER ESCAPES QUESTIONS ABOUT OLD COLLEAGUE MATT LAUER

DePauw University professor and media critic Jeffrey McCall said the major flaw was that moderators allowed Sen. Elizabeth Warren to dominate the proceedings.

“The time imbalance was so obvious and quite unfair to Gabbard, Castro and the others. That Warren is now or at the top of recent polls is no excuse for allowing such an imbalance,” McCall told Fox News. “A candidate forum is supposed to give all candidates a fair opportunity to engage the dialogue and that absolutely did not happen. The debate moderators apparently don't own stopwatches.”

McCall said the imbalance “lends credence to the critics who say these forums are all about promoting some candidates over others” and Warren was clearly the favorite.

“The moderators were also quite powerless at times when they tried to move on or determine who would speak next. Candidates tended to ignore the moderators’ directions and interrupt as they wanted,” McCall said, adding that talking over the moderators is nothing new.

“This is standard procedure now in these televised spectacles, but it remains a weakness in the format and relegates moderators to bystanders at times,” he said.

The debate came hours after a secretly recorded video appeared to show a CNN staffer saying the network likes Warren “a lot” and dislikes Gabbard. CNN’s own Twitter account even pointed out that Gabbard received less time than other candidates. According to CNN itself, Warren spoke for over 22 minutes, followed by Biden’s 16-plus minutes, while Gabbard only spoke for roughly eight minutes.

Following the debate, Gabbard’s sister criticized CNN via a tweet sent by the candidate’s verified account that accused the network of cutting off Gabbard to “protect Warren.”

PROJECT VERITAS’ ALLEGED CNN WHISTLEBLOWER CLAIMS NETWORK IS ‘PUMPING OUT PROPAGANDA'

“It was no surprise that CNN began with almost 20 minutes talking about impeachment and defending the Bidens seeing as how CNN's been obsessed with impeachment for at least three years now,” NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck told Fox News.

“Between cutting off Tulsi Gabbard and asking far-left, leading questions on abortion, gun control, and the Supreme Court, CNN reminded America last night just how invested they are in defeating and removing the President from office,” Houck added.

Conservative strategist Chris Barron told Fox News that the debate was harmful to candidates because liberal moderators were so easy on them.

“CNN is actually doing a disservice to the Democratic candidates and to Democratic voters by refusing to ask tough questions of the front runners,” Barron said. “Whoever the Democrats nominate will have to square off against President Trump on the debate stage and I promise you he won’t treat the nominee with kid gloves”

Media Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor told Fox News that CNN wouldn’t be a “neutral referee” because of its own bias and that was before the debate even started -- and the moderators didn’t do anything to change his mind.

DAN GAINOR: ELIZABETH WARREN DRAWS MOST ATTENTION FROM MEDIA AND CANDIDATES IN DEMOCRATIC DEBATE

“CNN, which has done as much as any outlet in America to promote impeachment, began the entire debate with 12 questions on the subject – one easy one for each candidate,” Gainor wrote following the debate.

CNN and The Times were also heavily criticized for overlooking China, which has been a focal point of the recent news cycle. China made headlines in recent weeks between its trade war with the United States and the growing tensions between the communist nation and the NBA – but the moderators didn’t seem to care what 2020 candidates thought about the situation.

""There hasn’t been one question about China in this entire 3 hour debate. It is shameful,"" ""The View"" co-host Meghan McCain tweeted.

The ""foreign policy"" portion of the debate featured questions predominately about Trump's recent troop withdrawal from Syria as well as handling Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“It's patently amazing that the network couldn't find the time over three hours to ask one question about arguably a Top-3 topic going into the 2020 election, China, but did ask as its final question of the night about the friendship between Ellen DeGeneres and George W. Bush,” Concha said.

Plenty of others took to Twitter to chime in on the debate, too:

Given Joe Biden’s refusal to do any interviews since impeachment cast a spotlight on his family’s conduct, it was striking that he handed the ball to his son before the one forum where he couldn’t duck questions: the CNN/New York Times marathon.

And 17 minutes into the Ohio debate, when Anderson Cooper asked Biden the question, he retreated to “my son’s statement speaks for itself”—precisely the point of orchestrating the ABC interview.

JOE BIDEN DEFENDS SON HUNTER'S UKRAINE WORK: 'MY SON DID NOTHING WRONG. I DID NOTHING WRONG'

Cooper asked a key question: If Hunter Biden now says he won’t do any foreign work if his dad becomes president, why was it okay when Joe was vice president?

Biden ignored that, saying “my son did nothing wrong, I did nothing wrong,” then pivoted to denouncing Rudy Giuliani, President Trump and his “thugs” as liars. He would not acknowledge the lousy optics that even Hunter conceded.

The striking aftermath: None of the other Democrats on the stage said a negative word about Biden or his son’s lucrative deal in Ukraine. They deemed it off limits. Cory Booker defended Biden, saying no one should be “attacking a statesman.”

But Cooper also softened the question by saying “the president has made false accusations against your son” and “there is no evidence of wrongdoing by you and your son.” Why not let Biden make that case? Why appear to take sides? And is there absolutely no wrongdoing by Hunter, who was unqualified for the Ukrainian gas gig, as opposed to no evidence of criminal wrongdoing?

The only real action was on health care, though it wasn’t as exciting as the Washington Nationals scoring seven first-inning runs on their way to the World Series. In fact, that part of the debate seemed more like an old replay.

Once again, a journalist—in this case Marc Lacey of the Times—asked Elizabeth Warren if the middle class would pay more under the Medicare for All measure she is pushing.

Once again, Warren rolled out her standard response: The rich and big corporations will pay more, the middle class will pay less.

Lacey followed up—will you raise middle-class taxes?—and once again, the Massachusetts senator sidestepped: “I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.” Notice she said costs, not taxes. (Bernie Sanders, who wrote the damn bill, admits middle-class taxes will rise.)

Pete Buttigieg was more blunt, saying Warren had failed to answer a yes or no question. She dodged it again.

Amy Klobuchar, showing unusual aggressiveness, said Warren would kick 150 million Americans off their private insurance. I don’t know why the debate questioners don’t focus on this rather crucial point.

Biden said what he said in the last debate, that Medicare for All would cost $30 trillion over a decade and taxes would go up, but his rejoinder had less force.

After that, the debate settled into something of a wonkfest. What about auto jobs? Should there be a wealth tax? Can gun buybacks work? CNN’s practice of usually letting each of the 12 candidates answer the same question added to the drone factor.

Something else was at work. It’s now clear that the race has settled into a contest between Biden and Warren, with Sanders (looking vigorous despite his heart attack) continuing to slip. Everyone else has been mired in single digits for many months. So there’s far less media excitement if Kamala Harris has a strong moment or Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke get into a spat on gun control. Impeachment dominated the pregame programming, with the debate a secondary story.

The moderators, who included Erin Burnett, were fine, but could have done far more to sharpen the contrasts between the contenders.

On Trump’s pullout from northern Syria, Biden was strikingly emotional, saying of the Kurds: “They lost their lives. This is shameful, shameful, what this man has done!” Warren accused Trump of giving ISIS a new lease on life. Buttigieg called it a “betrayal.” The only dissenter was Tulsi Gabbard, who wants to end the ""endless war"" and accused CNN and the Times of smearing her.

But such brief fireworks were the exception, and that was the weakness of the debate. Far too much time was spent on the candidates denouncing Trump in unison, sometimes just changing the adjectives. That undoubtedly made Democratic viewers feel good, but did little to distinguish among the contenders.

That pattern began at the outset, when Cooper asked about impeachment. While he tried mixing up the questions—why not let the voters evict Trump instead, is impeachment a distraction?—every Democrat on the stage competed to castigate the president in stronger terms (Bernie won with “most corrupt in history""). Biden and Warren talked about the Mueller report, making clear that they were primed for impeachment before the Ukraine mess surfaced.

The only real change from the last three debates was that Biden briefly had to defend his son’s buckraking in Ukraine. Impeachment has frozen the race, and that’s bad news for anyone not named Joe or Elizabeth."

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was seen by the moderators and her fellow candidates as the one to beat.

That point was evident with time allotted to each candidate. Warren had the most with nearly 23 minutes to answer questions – or about equal to what the bottom three candidates mustered, according to The New York Times.

There were some advantages to that. John Harwood of CNBC proclaimed “this debate crowning Warren the new 2020 front-runner.”

CNN, NYT SLAMMED FOR AVOIDING CHINA DURING PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'THIS IS LITERALLY A JOKE,' 'SHAMEFUL'

But former CBS News anchor Dan Rather said that “the stage is more crowded than a Times Square subway stop.” And almost everyone on that stage was targeting Warren.

It didn’t go well for the senator from Massachusetts. The regular attacks often turned her into a whiny scold.

As CNN anchor John King later explained: “The candidates on the stage clearly thought it was in their best interest to go after Warren.”

Former CNN commentator Roland Martin said it even better, noting: “How do we know @ewarren is leading? She has a bullseye on her tonight.”

The Washington Post sold the debate with a headline sounding like it watched a far-more entertaining contest: “Warren faces first sustained attack in raucous debate.” At least it was right about the attacking.

The New York Times was more accurate in tone about the tedious three-hour marathon: “Warren Draws Fire From All Sides, Reflecting a Shift in Fortunes in Race.”

CNN host Van Jones reflected on the attacks, calling Warren: “Mortal. Mortal. Somebody grabbed the cape and pulled on it.” Jones explained that the “moderates” struck back, “tired of the woke-enomics.”

PBS White House Correspondent Yamiche Alcindor said it was a “BIG MOMENT” when the “Elizabeth Warren attacks begin.” As she described it: “Warren gives a tough stare” after “Mayor Pete Buttigieg says to Warren: Your signature is to have a plan for everything except health care.”

Even far-left Hollywood director Michael Moore wasn’t entirely happy with Warren’s prescriptions for change. He said: “Senator Warren (whom I love) just said she believes in ‘accountable capitalism’. There is no such thing. The only thing capitalism is accountable to is weath [sic] and more wealth for the wealthy. It’s only mission is to economically enslave the citizenry so the rich can get richer.”

But there was more to the debate than just attacks on Warren. There were also attacks on President Trump. Of course. CNN, which has done as much as any outlet in America to promote impeachment, began the entire debate with 12 questions on the subject – one easy one for each candidate.

The result was laughably predictable – all the candidates showed that they hate Trump. The Post’s phrasing was a “unified condemnation of Trump.” Like no one saw that coming.

NBC News Correspondent Mike Memoli called the beginning of the debate “a moment of history,” adding that “1 participant may vote on articles of impeachment. 5 participants would sit as jurors in an impeachment trial.”

This is sure to please the major media that not only hate Trump but have financial interests in the impeachment. Axios reported that news outlets are “building pop-up newsletters, podcasts, and sections solely to cover the day-to-day developments of the impeachment process.” Those include Vox Media, CNN and The New York Times.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California scored one of the night’s few applause lines and news outlets went with her extreme narrative backing abortion, after she said: “And it is not an exaggeration to say women will die, poor women, women of color will die, because these Republican legislatures in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with our bodies.”

The debate was also predictably left-wing. Van Jones asked Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota a scary post-debate question for Democrats: “And I wonder, are you afraid that the party is going in a direction that is just going to get us killed here in the middle of the country?” Klobuchar responded about the party can “come together,” but it’s the kind of comment that will set the left and media worrying.

Add it to the amazingly quiet crowd. The Root’s Politics Editor Jason Johnson called it “the quietest audience I've ever seen in a debate.” Trump would have called that “low energy.” He’d have been right.

Even liberals weren’t always happy with all the candidates, especially the newest entrant into the race. Vox Senior Correspondent Zack Beauchamp made fun of the billionaire who just joined the campaign, but who always seems to wear the same tie. “While Tom Steyer wasted an unconscionable amount of money getting on stage and did absolutely nothing to justify his presence here, his tie is pretty good.”

Bustle Deputy News Editor Catherine Thompson took her own shot at his debating style: “Tom Steyer is gesticulating and speaking like he’s a ventriloquist’s dummy carved out of wood.”

But CNN had Steyer’s back. It initially listed him as a “former hedge fund manager.” That wasn’t nice enough to a guy who buys so much TV advertising. So it somehow got changed to “Businessman.”

Because CNN is neutral. And not in it for the money.

And Washington Post Opinion Writer Elizabeth Bruenig was equally critical of former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke after a few candidates were asked about their age. “i mean look. yes, as you get older, your brain gets worse. but that's just a general trend. look at beto. he's very young and his brain is very bad.”

There was one especially unusual highlight of the debate. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii bashed the “mainstream media” like she was running in the Republican primary. She explained that The “New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime change war.” Those news organizations were the two hosts of the debate.

Bolton told aide to alert National Security Council lawyer after meeting with Ukrainians about investigations: impeachment testimony

Fiona Hill, the former senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs, told lawmakers investigating possible impeachment charges against President Trump on Monday that a July meeting with Ukrainian and U.S. officials about unspecified investigations left her and John Bolton, the former national security adviser, so concerned that he directed her to alert a lawyer in the National Security Council, Fox News confirmed. The meeting in question took place July 10, a little more than two weeks before President Trump's controversial call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. Both Bolton and Hill, who were present at the meeting, had concerns about the conversation, she testified.

Hill, who exited the administration days before the July 25 phone call, testified on Monday for about nine hours in front of three House panels. The Wall Street Journal reported that those at the hearing took her comments to refer to the ""investigation that could implicate Biden and his son."" Click here for more on our top story.

In addition, Hill had high praise for ousted U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch during testimony before the House Intelligence Committee. Yovanovitch, who herself testified before congressional lawmakers last Friday as part of the impeachment inquiry, was recalled from her ambassadorship in May by Trump, around the same time that Rudy Giuliani — Trump's personal attorney — pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate corruption allegations against Democrat Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who was involved with the board of a gas company there.

Democratic dozen at fourth presidential primary debate will be a record-breaker

A really big stage is set the fourth round of Democrats' presidential primary debate Tuesday night. Twelve candidates have qualified, meeting the polling and fundraising criteria. That means the showdown tonight will be the largest in presidential primary history, topping the 11 Republicans who faced off in a primary debate in September 2015, according to political research from Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a political newsletter and website.

The dozen Democratic White House contenders who made the cut are – in alphabetical order: former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; businessman and environmental advocate Tom Steyer; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

Twelve candidates on the same stage at the same time could make for an unwieldy debate and a lot of jockeying for time and attention. The debate will be held at Otterbein University, a liberal arts institution in Westerville, Ohio. The Democratic National Committee's media partners for the showdown are CNN and The New York Times. All eyes will be on Bernie Sanders, who just two weeks ago was rushed to the hospital when he suffered a heart attack.

Trump imposes sanctions on Turkey, threatens more severe penalties, to stop invasion into Syria

President Trump on Monday authorized sanctions and raised steel tariffs on Turkey and threatened more severe financial penalties if Ankara continued its military offensive in northern Syria launched the president decided to withdraw U.S. troops from the region more than a week ago. Trump also urged Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to negotiate a peaceful end to the violence is sending Vice President Mike Pence and White House National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien to lead a delegation to Turkey to seek a resolution to the conflict.

In addition, the president announced, U.S. troops in northeastern Syria will be withdrawn from the country as planned and redeployed “in the region to monitor the situation and prevent a repeat of 2014,” when the Islamic State made major territorial gains.

Trump mulls idea of lawsuit against CNN over recording of network 'bias'

President Trump on Monday floated a lawsuit threat against CNN over reports that the network’s president, Jeff Zucker, launched an internal bias campaign to undermine his presidency. In a tweet posted Monday evening, Trump said, “’Project Veritas-Obtained Undercover Videos Highlight Jeff Zucker’s (@CNN) Campaign To Destroy Trump. Videos Reveal @CNN’s BIAS!’ @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Does this sound like a good, or even great, lawsuit?”

The president’s latest gripe with CNN comes after conservative activist group Project Veritas published undercover recordings from an alleged “whistleblower” that capture CNN employees casually confirming the network's anti-Trump bias and show Zucker telling top news executives to focus solely on impeachment even at the expense of other important news.

Elizabeth Warren came under attack from all sides during Tuesday night's presidential debate, as former Vice President Joe Biden defiantly defended his son's business practices overseas and vehemently denied any wrongdoing.

All of the 12 Democrats onstage in Westerville, Ohio, meanwhile, backed the ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Trump. In a sign of apparent disunity and hesitation among Democrats, though, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said only minutes before the debate began that there would be no vote on formally commencing the inquiry.

The debate marked the first time the candidates met since Pelosi's news conference last month at which she unilaterally declared the inquiry had begun -- a move that the White House has said is legally insufficient. The candidate lineup set a record for most politicians on a single debate stage, topping the 11 Republican candidates who assembled in 2016.

JOE BIDEN DEFENDS SON HUNTER'S UKRAINE WORK: 'MY SON DID NOTHING WRONG. I DID NOTHING WRONG'

""Sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that's the case with this impeachment inquiry,"" Warren, D-Mass., asserted at the outset of the debate, when asked why Congress should bother with the process given the impending election.

Biden has been at the top of the crowded field for months, but has come under withering assault from the White House concerning his son Hunter's lucrative overseas business dealings.

The elder Biden faced something of a timid confrontation over the issue during the debate, when CNN anchor and debate moderator Anderson Cooper broached the topic by stating, without evidence, that President Trump's accusations of misconduct by the Bidens were ""false.""

But Cooper pressed Joe Biden on Hunter's admission in a televised interview earlier in the day that he made a mistake by obtaining a lucrative role on the board of a Ukraine company, with no relevant expertise, while his father was vice president and handled Ukraine policy. (“I know I did nothing wrong at all. Was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is a swamp in many ways? Yeah,” the younger Biden said Tuesday morning.)

Joe Biden recently pledged that no members of his family would engage in foreign deals if he were to be elected president -- a tacit admission, Republicans said, of previous poor judgment or even wrongdoing.

""Look, my son's statement speaks for itself,"" Biden said. “My son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government which was to root out corruption in Ukraine, and that’s what we should be focusing on.”

Biden insisted he never discussed Ukraine matters with Hunter, although Hunter separately told The New Yorker magazine that the dealings had come up in one instance.

PROOF OF LINKS: FOX NEWS OBTAINS PHOTO SHOWING BIDENS GOLFING WITH UKRAINE EXEC, SEEMINGLY CONTRADICTING FORMER VP'S CLAIMS

He concluded: ""The fact of the matter is, this is about Trump's corruption. That's what we should be focused on.""

Later on, as the debate heated up, Biden remarked: “These debates are kinda crazy."" In a head-turning moment, he also stumbled over his words, saying wealthy individuals might be found ""clipping coupons in the stock market.""

Separately, asked about Trump's policy in Syria, Biden appeared to give an extended answer in which he meant to talk about Turkish President Recep Erdoğan -- but kept referencing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad instead.

HUNTER BIDEN BREAKS SILENCE ON HOW HE OBTAINED LUCRATIVE GIGS WITH NO RELEVANT EXPERTISE, BUT A VERY POWERFUL FATHER

Asked about his health toward the end of the debate, Biden vowed to release his medical records before the Iowa caucuses are held, and said his age (76) gives him ""wisdom.""

Hunter Biden obtained other high-paying board positions domestically and internationally, with no relevant expertise, while his father was a senator and vice president. For example, Hunter became an executive at the financial services company MBNA just two years after leaving law school. MBNA sources told Fox News this week that the company was trying to curry favor with Joe Biden, who was shepherding a bill favored by MBNA to passage in the Senate.

Meanwhile, Warren has climbed to co-front runner status but faces new questions about her dubious claims to Native American ancestry.

She was under attack from all sides at the debate for refusing to answer whether her ""Medicare for All"" plan would raise taxes for the middle class. Warren once again dodged the issue, insisting only that ""costs will go down"" for the middle class.

""I appreciate Elizabeth's work, but again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something you can actually get done,"" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said to Warren. ""At least Bernie’s being honest here. ... I’m sorry, Elizabeth.”

“These debates are kinda crazy."" — Joe Biden

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg also lambasted Warren on health care: “Your signature is to have a plan for everything, except this,"" he said.

Buttigieg specifically knocked Warren for the nonanswer, saying her failure to offer a direct answer is ""why people are so frustrated with politicians"" and arguing that ""Medicare-for-All"" would ""unnecessarily divide this country.""

""We heard it tonight,"" Buttigieg said. ""A yes-or-no question that didn't get a yes-or-no answer."" He said he wanted a plan that could be summed up as ""Medicare-for-All"" if you choose it, not whether you want it or not.

Former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke also pressed Warren on the tax issue, to no avail. (Later on, O'Rourke had no answer when Cooper asked how he could confiscate Americans' firearms, given that the government has no way of knowing where the vast majority of AR-15s are located. He said only that he believes Americans ""will do the right thing"" voluntarily.)

Sen. Bernie Sanders, who wrote the ""Medicare-for-All"" legislation that Warren has embraced, said it was ""appropriate to acknowledge taxes will go up.""

Sanders, who Fox News has confirmed will soon be endorsed by New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, also spoke about his recent heart attack: “But let me take this moment, if I might, to thank so many people from all over this country, including many of my colleagues up here, for their love, for their prayers, for their well wishes. ... And I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, and I'm so happy to be back here with you this evening.”

Also during the debate, Democrats also piled onto Warren for her signature proposal, a 2 percent wealth tax to raise the trillions needed for many of her ambitious proposals. Technology entrepreneur Andrew Yang noted that such a measure has failed in almost every European country where it's been tried.

The event, hosted by CNN and The New York Times, was on the campus of Otterbein University, just outside Columbus in Ohio, a state that has long helped decide presidential elections but has drifted away from Democrats in recent years.

Many of the candidates were struggling just to get noticed — trying to make up ground in a race that kicks off officially in just over three months with the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3. Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., are trying to crack the top tier.

In one possible indicator the debate was a lengthy one, Harris briefly mentioned her proposal to have Twitter take Trump's account down, and demanded that Warren explain why she felt that approach was unwise. Warren, who last week laughed openly when informed by a reporter of Harris' idea, responded that she wants Trump out of the White House, not just banned from Twitter.

Progressives and right-wing commentators alike were aghast at Harris' decision to again bring up the unrealistic and unpopular idea of somehow suspending Trump from Twitter.

""I cannot believe @KamalaHarris is pushing this suspend Donald Trump's twitter account bullshit at a presidential debate,"" former Obama administration official and Pod Save America cohost Tommy Vietor wrote on Twitter. ""It's so small ball. She is bigger and better than this.""

Fellow Obama administration alumnus and podcast host Ben Rhodes added: ""Seems like there are bigger issues in the world.""

Also debating were Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Obama housing chief Julián Castro and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii. Making his debate debut — and likely angling for a splash — was billionaire activist Tom Steyer.

Gabbard hit The New York Times and CNN for waging what she called a propaganda campaign against her, while also promoting endless ""regime-change wars.""

""The New York Times and CNN have smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime change war,"" Gabbard said. ""Just two days ago, The New York Times put out an article saying I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist, and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.""

Gabbard has criticized Trump for how he's conducted the withdrawal in Syria, but said Tuesday that while Trump has ""the blood of the Kurds on his hands. ... So do many of the politicians in both parties who supported this regime change war.""

Gabbard, who was one of the last Democratic House members to back an impeachment inquiry, additionally lamented that some Democrats had been calling for Trump's impeachment since right after the 2016 election, undermining the party's case against him.

The debate's foreign policy discussion concluded without any mention by the moderators of the ongoing push by China to censor American companies, including the NBA and Blizzard Entertainment, from making or tolerating pro-Hong Kong statements. Buttigieg briefly mentioned that the Hong Kong protests were not receiving support from the White House.

Yang's plan for a universal basic income spurred a discussion onstage concerning whether a federal jobs guarantee is a better plan -- something of a remarkable achievement for Yang, who has struggled in the polls while advancing his own unique agenda.

On abortion, the Democrats agreed they would support a federal law ""codifying"" the Supreme Court's holding in Roe v. Wade, which found a constitutional right to abortion, as a kind of defense in case the Supreme Court overturned Roe. At the same time, Biden emphasized he would not support ""court packing,"" or passing a federal law to expand the size of the Supreme Court to load it with Democratic justices.

Buttigieg then said he did not support court packing, but wanted ""reforms"" to make the court less significant -- including possibly a ""fifteen member court, where five of the members can only be appointed by unanimous agreement of the other ten."" A similar idea was being debated in the Yale Law Journal, Buttigieg said, in a shout-out to the left-wing student publication.

Gabbard said that Democrats were right decades ago when they said abortion should be ""safe, legal, and rare"" -- highlighting a shift to the left among Democrats.

The 2020 field, which once had swelled to two dozen, has been shrinking as the Democratic Party's rules have mandated that candidates meet higher donor and fundraising thresholds to debate.

Just 10 White House contenders qualified for September's debate, but Gabbard and Steyer made Tuesday's lineup a record.

Earlier contests featuring 20 candidates were divided between two nights.

Author Marianne Williamson, who was not physically present at the debate on Tuesday because she failed to meet polling thresholds, remarked on Twitter as it unfolded: ""No, they're not the only Democratic candidates for President of the United States.""

But, that’s just the first of many factors that could make this showdown – the first in a month – stand out.

BERNIE SANDERS SLAMS ELIZABETH WARREN AS A 'CAPITALIST'

“Since the last Democratic debate, the presidential race has dramatically shifted. Tonight is the first major gathering since the opening of the impeachment inquiry,” former Democratic National Committee chair and Fox News contributor Donna Brazile said.

The debate also comes as Joe Biden lost his long-held status as the unrivaled front-runner. The former vice president suddenly has been neck-and-neck with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts for the top spot in many of the recent national and early-voting-state polls. And, Biden was left in the dust in the race for campaign cash, with both Warren and fellow progressive champion Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont each topping him by roughly $10 million in the July-September third quarter of fundraising.

The showdown also comes two weeks after the 78-year old Sanders suffered a heart attack. The debate is set to mark his return to the campaign trail and with questions regarding his health and stamina, the independent senator making his second straight White House run will be under the microscope.

With all that in mind, here are eight things to watch at the debate.

Impeachment

The debate is the first held since House Democrats launched a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter over their dealings in the eastern European country. Fueled by whistleblower complaints and a transcript of the call released by the White House, Democrats argued the president was pressuring a foreign country to interfere in a U.S. election.

Adding to the controversy was the fact that before the phone call, millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been put on hold; it ultimately was released in September. Despite allegations that Trump was using that money as leverage, the president insisted repeatedly that he did nothing wrong. He said there was no “quid pro quo” and on numerous occasions has described his conversation with the Ukrainian leader as “perfect.”

While all the candidates on the stage supported impeaching the president, the impeachment inquiry clearly will overshadow the showdown -- but will it dominate the debate to the detriment of other top issues in the Democrats’ presidential nomination race?

“There is a real danger that the substance of the debate is limited by the impeachment inquiry,” warned veteran political scientist Wayne Lesperance, the vice president of academic affairs at New England College.

Biden and Biden

While only one Biden will be on the stage, another certainly will be part of the conversation. While the former vice president is expected to use impeachment to frame the race as a fight between himself and the Republican incumbent, he likely will face questions about his son just hours after Hunter Biden’s first public interview since the start of the Ukrainian controversy.

As the president has fought back against impeachment, he and his allies instead have tried to put the spotlight on the Bidens.

Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned how Biden – as vice president – pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor – who had faced widespread accusations of overlooking corruption in his own office – later was dismissed.

Biden, defending his actions in Ukraine, said, “there’s no truth to [Trump's] charges and attacks against me and my son. Zero.”

Trump’s also repeatedly raised questions about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of a Chinese private equity firm. This past Sunday, Hunter Biden resigned from the company – and on Tuesday morning – just hours before the debate – broke his silence in an interview with ABC News’ “Good Morning America.""

The younger Biden maintained that he did nothing improper while he served on the board of the Ukrainian energy company. But he acknowledged that accepting the lucrative position was, in retrospect, ""poor judgment.""

Some of Biden’s lower-tier rivals, looking for a breakout moment, may be tempted to criticize him over the optics of having his son sit on the boards of foreign companies while he served as vice president. However, it may be a slippery slope, as none of the Democrats seeking to unseat Trump may want to play into his playbook of targeting the Bidens.

Sanders’ health

“I’m ready,” Sanders emphasized in an email to supporters on Monday.

While all the candidates will be under the spotlight, it will shine extra bright for Sanders, who would have a unique challenge in needing to showcase that he hasn’t lost a step, and quell concerns that he may not be up to speed.

Analysts pointed out Sanders would need to show strength and agility, but the question for his rivals would be whether it’s a fair game for them to raise concerns about his health. Questions were raised about the late Sen. John McCain’s medical condition during the 2008 campaign and about the health of both candidates four years ago.

Sanders vs. Warren

Aside from some sniping by some of his top advisors, Sanders has not criticized Warren, as she’s mostly passed him by in the polls the past two months.

That’s why his labeling of his friend and populist senator – who’s produced one progressive policy proposal after another – as a “capitalist” made so much news this weekend.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

“There are differences between Elizabeth and myself,” Sanders said during an interview Sunday on ABC News’ “This Week.” “Elizabeth, I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I’m not.”

Will Sanders continue to draw contrasts with the rising Warren at the debate?

A former Sanders adviser – who for months raised alarms that Warren, rather than Biden, was the real threat – said the drawing of distinctions may be a necessity.

“Unfortunately, it’s a sign of concern on the part of Bernie and his camp that Warren is beating him with the voters that he needs,” noted Kurt Ehrenberg, a top adviser for Sanders in New Hampshire and the 2016 and 2020 campaigns who recently parted ways with the campaign.

A more aggressive Biden?

The former vice president seemed to get a second wind last week during two speeches in New Hampshire, when Biden gave a full-throated thrashing of Trump as he called for the president’s impeachment for the first time. Will that aggressive style of campaigning continue on the debate stage in Ohio?

“One of the problems I’m finding, I’ve got to be more aggressive,” Biden acknowledged during a fundraiser late last week in California. “I’ve had some difficulties on knowing to counterattack.”

A senior Biden campaign adviser told Fox News hours before the debate that ""what you'll hear tonight from the VP is that first and foremost, we have to keep the focus on Donald Trump's unprecedented abuse of power.""

Back in the spotlight

Health care – specifically the intra-party battle over “Medicare-for-all,” immigration, race relations and other domestically focused issues – has dominated the discourse at the first three rounds of debates. Foreign policy mostly has been relegated to the garbage time late in the showdowns, when the number of viewers dwindled.

But, with Turkey’s attack on northern Syria, unfolding soon after the president’s move to withdraw U.S. troops who had been fighting alongside Kurdish forces against ISIS militants, questions about Trump’s record on the world stage could be back in the spotlight.

That may benefit the candidates with foreign policy experience. Besides the obvious – Biden – such a discussion could give the two veterans in the field who’ve served in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii – a moment to shine.

Looking for a breakout moment

The debate could provide the opportunity the mid-tier candidates have been seeking – a standout moment in front of millions of viewers with less than four months to go until the voting begins in Iowa. Buttigieg, Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas all have been looking to gain some traction and break up the narrative that the race has been a three-candidate contest between Biden, Warren, and Sanders.

So will businessman and billionaire environment and progressive activist Tom Steyer, who’s making his first appearance on the debate stage.

Buttigieg – in a likely tease of things to come – took aim at Warren and Sanders for proposing to scrap private insurance as he touted his Medicare-for-all-who-want-it plan a new digital ad hours before the debate.

“Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren believe that we have to force ourselves into Medicare for all, where private insurance is abolished,” the narrator says in the ad.

Unpredictable moments

Gabbard made headlines in the second round of debates in July when she took aim at Harris, firing away at the former California attorney general’s record as a prosecutor. Last week, she made headlines when she threatened to boycott the debate to protest the “rigging” of the debates and the race for the nomination by the Democratic National Committee and its media partners.

Gabbard announced Monday morning that she would take part in the debate after all, and her planned appearance – after failing to qualify for the September showdown – had analysts wondering what she had next up here sleeve.

Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro also has been looking to make some news. Castro – whose attacks on Biden’s age and memory at the September debate backfired, according to many analysts – is set to appear on the stage for what could possibly be the last time.

With the thresholds rising for the November showdown, Castro made a fundraising pitch to supporters, telling them ""I refuse to let tonight be my last time on the debate stage.""

A big debate moment would give him a boost to reach the new qualifying criteria."

Ronan Farrow’s book, “Catch and Kill,” hit stores this week and details allegations that NBC refused to expose Harvey Weinstein as a sexual predator. The book also suggests the Peacock Network wasn’t truthful regarding knowledge of alleged sexual misconduct by former “Today” co-host Matt Lauer.

Farrow reported that Weinstein leveraged information regarding Lauer to keep NBC off his back. Farrow’s former NBC News producer Rich McHugh, who is a key figure of the book, also penned a recent Vanity Fair column that said NBC News Chairman Andy Lack, and his top deputy Noah Oppenheim, breached “journalistic integrity” when they put the kibosh on the Weinstein story.

“Mounting reports show that NBC News executives – namely Noah Oppenheim – failed to hold sexual abusers accountable, failed to combat a toxic culture across newsrooms, and that the network’s so-called investigation into its culture was little more than a sham to provide cover for executives,” Thomas said.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI PUBLICLY SUPPORTED NEWS VET BROKAW AMID MISCONDUCT CLAIMS, PRIVATELY APOLOGIZED

NBC famously told Farrow that his reporting on Weinstein wasn’t fit to print, so he took it to The New Yorker where it won the Pulitzer Prize and helped launch the #MeToo movement. “Catch and Kill” details Farrow’s side of the story and features additional accusations against NBC News bigwigs.

“Additional reports that MSNBC executive Phil Griffin showed staff graphic images of Access Hollywood personality Maria Menounos prove that this toxic culture is an epidemic that extends across nearly all newsrooms and networks at the company,” Thomas said. “Taken together, these initial reports demonstrate that NBC’s current leadership is either unable or unwilling to take appropriate steps to combat the culture of sexual abuse at the networks.”

After the Weinstein and Lauer bombshells were reported in 2017, NBC refused to hire an outside investigator to determine who knew about Lauer’s sexual misconduct and whether NBC executives looked the other way. NBC relied on in-house general counsel Kim Harris despite widespread calls for an outside law firm to conduct the review.

NBC eventually declared that management was completely oblivious to Lauer’s behavior and Harris’ high-powered colleagues were cleared by the network. Lack and Oppenheim remain atop NBC News.

Tennessee will start Ryan Tannehill at quarterback instead of Marcus Mariota on Sunday against the Los Angeles Chargers, a person familiar with the decision told The Associated Press on Tuesday night. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the team has not announced the change.

Coach Mike Vrabel benched Mariota in the third quarter of a 16-0 loss in Denver, the first time the No. 2 pick overall in the 2015 draft had been pulled from a game for poor play and not because of injury. Vrabel said Monday the Titans (2-4) would decide who would start against the Chargers (2-4) by Tuesday and then tell both quarterbacks and the rest of the team.

Now Tannehill will get his first start since the Titans acquired the veteran in March from Miami through a trade initially designed to improve Tennessee's backup to Mariota.

""Ryan was an elite quarterback in this league ... no longer than a year ago,"" Titans tight end Delanie Walker said Monday before the decision was made to start Tannehill. ""He can take over a team. He can make plays, control the offense. I mean, I seen him do it in Miami.""

NFL.com first reported the switch at quarterback Tuesday night.

The Titans had made it clear all offseason that Mariota was their starter until the No. 2 pick overall in the 2015 draft turned in his worst performance in Denver. Mariota was 7 of 18 for 63 yards and was intercepted twice for his first turnovers of the season. He also was sacked three times.

Mariota went into that game as the NFL's only quarterback without a turnover, but his interception-free streak ended late in the first half at 205 straight passes when Chris Harris picked him off. Mariota is being paid $20.9 million under the fifth-year option of his rookie contract, and he has a 91.7 passer rating with seven touchdown passes and the two picks.

Tannehill was 13 of 16 for 144 yards while being sacked four times after coming off the bench for the second time this season. He also played at the end of a season-opening rout in Cleveland. He started 88 games in Miami, including 11 last season.

This is the eighth NFL season for Tannehill, who has a career quarterback rating of 62.9, having thrown for 20,578 yards with 123 touchdowns and 76 interceptions. The eighth overall pick out of Texas A&M in 2012, Tannehill is being paid $1.75 million under a one-year deal.

The Titans hope Tannehill jump-starts an offense that has scored 98 points all season, including one touchdown over its past 10 quarters. Tennessee has lost four of five."

BIDEN SON: UKRAINE DEALS ‘POOR JUDGEMENT’ IN ‘A SWAMP’

ABC News: “As President Donald Trump continues to fill his Twitter feed and campaign speeches with attacks on Hunter Biden over his foreign business deals, the former vice president’s son defended the ethical implications of his private ventures in an interview with ABC News, but conceded taking a misstep in failing to foresee the political implications on his father’s career. ‘In retrospect, look, I think that it was poor judgment on my part. Is that I think that it was poor judgment because I don't believe now, when I look back on it -- I know that there was -- did nothing wrong at all,’ said Biden. However, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is...a swamp in—in—in many ways? Yeah.’”



Fight night in Ohio - Politico: “Bernie Sanders is recovering from his heart attack. Joe Biden is under siege, and laying into Donald Trump. And the entire Democratic presidential field has become consumed with the House’s impeachment inquiry into the Republican president. With so many candidates responding to circumstances beyond their control — and the threat of a destabilizing moment running high on a stage that’s expanding to 12 candidates from 10 — it’s raising the specter of a debate Tuesday that finally breaks the Democratic primary logjam. Not only is it the first debate since Sanders was hospitalized and the impeachment inquiry began, it also comes as many lower-polling candidates become increasingly desperate to make a mark on the campaign. At a fundraiser in Los Angeles last week, Biden acknowledged how much of the debate is out of any candidate's hands. … Biden said, ‘One of the problems I’m finding, I’ve got to be more aggressive.’”



Will Buttigieg throw elbows? - Politico: “Pete Buttigieg sees a path to the top tier of the Democratic primary field, elbowing his way between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren on one side and Joe Biden on the other. At the center of Buttigieg’s push is his health care plan, which the South Bend, Ind., mayor has dubbed ‘Medicare for all who want it.’ The plan would extend a public health insurance option to Americans without ending the private insurance market, an effect of the plan put forward by Sanders and endorsed by Warren. … Buttigieg also argued that his health care plan is tougher on insurance providers than Biden’s own public option proposal to build on Obamacare. ‘It turns out that setting up the exchanges has not been enough to empower all Americans to have good coverage,’ Buttigieg said.”



Beto says he need to ‘break through’ - Texas Tribune: “Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke raised $4.5 million in the third quarter, his campaign announced Friday as he acknowledged it was more urgent than ever to ‘break through’ in the still-crowded primary. The third-quarter total is an improvement over the $3.6 million that the former El Paso congressman took in during the previous quarter, and it came despite a halt to fundraising for roughly two weeks in August after the deadly El Paso shooting. Still, the total puts him behind a majority of primary rivals who have released their third-quarter figures so far, including two leading candidates who each raised around $25 million.”



Bloomberg back to floating trial balloons - CNBC: “Mike Bloomberg might end up running for president, after all. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, has indicated to associates in recent weeks that Joe Biden’s recent struggles against Sen. Elizabeth Warren are making him rethink his decision to stay out of the 2020 Democratic primary. That’s according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were deemed private. Bloomberg has signaled he’s ‘still looking at’ running for president, but people close him say that the only way he could even go down that path is if Biden’s fortunes suffer so much that he drops out before or during the early stages of the primary. Bloomberg could then enter the race as one of the rare moderates with enough name recognition and campaign funding to make a run.”



Dems on edge over cyberattacks - Politico: “The Democratic National Committee sent an urgent alert on Monday to every presidential campaign aimed at avoiding a repeat of the cybersecurity fiasco the party suffered at the hands of Russia and Wikileaks in 2016. The subject of the email was ‘Counter-Disinformation Update,’ and it was part of a regular series of communications by DNC Tech, the party’s in-house group responsible for internal security and monitoring the spread of fake news about Democrats. POLITICO obtained the full archive of DNC’s Tech’s missives to the presidential campaigns. They reveal a party struggling to combat the continued onslaught of the twin threats faced by the Democratic Party: cyber penetration from state actors abroad and the spread of disinformation about its top presidential candidates by Donald Trump and his allies at home. … It was a moment, the DNC warned, to be hyper vigilant about fake news.”



Seven years later, Warren changes tune on health care - Politico: “Seven years before Elizabeth Warren said ‘I’m with Bernie on Medicare for All,’ she was campaigning for the Senate and didn’t want to talk about single-payer health care. Running a tough race against Republican incumbent Scott Brown, the first-time candidate repeatedly distanced herself from the idea. … But during her first Senate campaign in 2012, she … dodged the question again and again, according to an analysis of newspaper reports, TV, and interviews with health care reform activists at the time. … Warren's refusal to embrace single-payer during that campaign came four years after she co-wrote an essay that called it the ‘most obvious’ solution to the nation's health care woes — though perhaps ‘politically unacceptable.’ Warren’s remarks in 2012, as well as her more circumspect attitude toward Medicare for All at the beginning of her presidential campaign, has exposed her to criticisms from the left.”



Warren strong in Q Poll, but still lags on electability - Quinnipiac University: “One day before the next Democratic debate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden remain locked in a close race for the top spot in the Democratic primary, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. Warren receives 30 percent of the vote among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, while Biden gets 27 percent.. … However, on the question of electability - which candidate has the best chance of winning against Donald Trump - Biden retains his commanding lead with 48 percent saying he has the best chance, compared to 49 percent in August. While still trailing Biden, Warren has increased her support from 9 percent in August to 21 percent today. No other candidate gets into double digits.”

TIME OUT: TO THE HOLY LAND

Smithsonian: “On April 1483, a German politician named Bernhard von Breydenbach embarked on a religious pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Breydenbach and his companions—among others, Dutch artist Erhard Reuwich—traveled at a leisurely clip, touring destinations including Venice, Corfu, Modon and Rhodes while en route. Two years after his pilgrimage, Breydenbach created an illustrated guide detailing the farflung locales he had visited on his trip. The text, titled Peregrinatio in Terram Sanctam, or A Pilgrimage to the Holy Land, was an instant sensation, with eleven editions in six languages published between 1486 and 1505. Now, one of the few surviving first editions of Breydenbach’s ‘15th-century bestseller’ is set to go on view at the British Museum… Giulia Bartrum, curator of German prints at the British Museum, [says] that prior to the text’s publication, ‘most of the depictions of places such as Jerusalem or Venice were totally made up.’”

BOLTON CALLED FOUL ON TRUMP-GIULIANI UKRAINE MOVES

Fox News: “Fiona Hill, the former senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs, told lawmakers on Monday that a July meeting with Ukrainian and U.S. officials about unspecified investigations left her and John Bolton, the former national security adviser, so concerned that he directed her to alert a lawyer in the National Security Council, Fox News confirmed. Hill, who exited the administration days before the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky, testified on Monday for about nine hours in front of three House panels where she reportedly raised concerns about a July 10 meeting. The Wall Street Journal reported that those at the hearing took her comments to refer to the ‘investigation that could implicate Biden and his son.’”



Giuliani got big bucks from indicted Ukrainian - Reuters: “President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was paid $500,000 for work he did for a company co-founded by the Ukrainian-American businessman arrested last week on campaign finance charges, Giuliani told Reuters on Monday. The businessman, Lev Parnas, is a close associate of Giuliani and was involved in his effort to investigate Trump’s political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, who is a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic Party nomination. Giuliani said Parnas’ company, Boca Raton-based Fraud Guarantee, whose website says it aims to help clients ‘reduce and mitigate fraud’, engaged Giuliani Partners, a management and security consulting firm, around August 2018. Giuliani said he was hired to consult on Fraud Guarantee’s technologies and provide legal advice on regulatory issues.”



Feds dig deeper - WSJ: “Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are examining Rudy Giuliani’s business dealings in Ukraine, including his finances, meetings and work for a city mayor there, according to people familiar with the matter. Investigators also have examined Giuliani’s bank records, according to the people. Witnesses have been questioned about Giuliani since at least August by investigators, who also want to know more about Giuliani’s role in an alleged conspiracy involving two of his business associates, the people said. The investigation is being led by the U.S. attorney’s office in the Southern District of New York. Giuliani has denied wrongdoing and on Monday said he hadn’t been informed of any investigation. ‘They can look at my Ukraine business all they want,’ he said.”



Dems return from recess more united on impeachment - WaPo: “…Just days after suddenly embracing an impeachment inquiry of President Trump — a moment of seeming political crisis — House leaders sent lawmakers home for their scheduled two-week recess. But as Congress returns to work Tuesday, fears of lost momentum, internal dissension and dissipating interest in impeachment have mostly evaporated among House Democrats, who view the past two weeks as among the most damaging to Trump as they dig in for their constitutional showdown with the president. … But on the central question of whether Trump ought to be investigated for potentially committing high crimes and misdemeanors worthy of removal from office, Democrats are now largely united: Only seven of 235 House Democrats have stopped short of endorsing the impeachment inquiry, and the White House position, laid out in a letter sent to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and three committee chairmen last week, has hardened the resolve of many Democrats.”

FOR THE LONG RUN

WNEP: “The Steamtown Marathon [in Scranton, Pa.] brings out hundreds of spectators each year to cheer for the runners… For the last 24 years, 90-year-old Marie Rupp has been hosting a water station for the thousands of runners that make their way through the borough. … But this year is different. After a fall, Marie went to live at a rehab facility. It would be the first marathon she would not be out cheering for the runners. That's when her neighbors stepped in. ‘We felt it very important to get her out of there for the day and bring her back to the tradition that she started,’ said Sean Osborne of Archbald. Wrapped in a blanket with a space heater for extra warmth, Marie was on Laurel Street with her neighbors as runners passed by. And while she says she is no longer in charge, her neighbors know she still calls the shots. … ‘It's exciting! It puts life in our bones,’ Marie said.”

On the roster: Welcome to the Thunderdome, Elizabeth Warren - Pelosi still not biting on impeachment vote - Gallup: Majority now supports removing Trump from office - Bevin recovers in Kentucky poll - Sláinte, Mr. Bradley



WELCOME TO THE THUNDERDOME, ELIZABETH WARREN

WaPo: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose steady stream of plans have propelled her to the top of the Democratic presidential field, came under sustained attack for the first time during a raucous primary debate here Tuesday that revealed Democrats’ ongoing public struggle to define their beliefs and choose a standard-bearer to take on President Trump. Warren (Mass.) faced direct challenges from several of the 11 other candidates onstage, who took her on over her policies, her fitness to serve as commander in chief and her willingness to question the motives of Democrats who support less transformational ideas. … The focus on Warren deflected attention from others facing scrutiny entering Tuesday’s debate, which was hosted by CNN and the New York Times. Former vice president Joe Biden went for long stretches without surfacing… Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), meanwhile, showed no signs of lingering health trouble.”



Klobuchar, Buttigieg shone through - National Review: “The October Democratic presidential-primary debate finally brought a genuine surprise, in that a pair of second-tier candidates who were in danger of being forgotten woke up, smelled the coffee, and brought their A-games: Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg. Considering how other second-tier candidates have turned in good performances in past months and seen little movement in the polls, this may not be a turning point in the race for either candidate. But in a way-too-long, often-boring debate that was stuck in the middle of an otherwise jam-packed news environment, Klobuchar and Buttigieg managed to stand out.”



Sanders and Warren have deep pockets as Biden burns cash - AP: “Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren don’t just lead the Democratic presidential primary in fundraising. They’ve stockpiled millions more than their rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden, who burned through money at a fast clip over the past three months while posting an anemic fundraising haul. Sanders held $33.7 million cash on hand on his third-quarter fundraising report. Warren had $25.7 million during the same period, while South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg came next $23.3 million. Biden, meanwhile, held just $8.9 million, a small fraction of what his leading rivals have at their disposal. With the first votes of the Democratic contest just months away, the candidates are entering a critical and expensive period when having an ample supply of cash can make or break a campaign. Biden’s total raises questions about his durability as a front-runner.”



Squad to endorse Sanders - Fox News: “Three members of the so-called ‘Squad’ of far-left freshman members of Congress are lining up behind Sen. Bernie Sanders for president. Fox News has learned that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., will appear with Sanders on Saturday in Queens, N.Y., at a ‘Bernie’s Back’ rally designed to generate excitement for the senator’s campaign following his recent heart procedure. Rep. Ihan Omar, D-Minn., will also endorse the candidate, Fox News confirmed. In addition, CNN reported that Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., will endorse Sanders as well. It was not immediately clear if Omar and Tlaib will appear at Saturday's event. … The endorsements would be a significant blow to the campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren…”



Steyer spending stupendous - WSJ: “Billionaire Tom Steyer appeared on the Democratic presidential debate stage for the first time Tuesday night, but voters in early states have already seen him on TV thousands of times. Mr. Steyer, who new federal filings show has poured nearly $48 million of his own money into his long-shot bid, is dominating television screens in the first four states that will hold nominating contests early next year. Since entering the race in July, Mr. Steyer has spent more than $26 million on TV ads, airing more than 53,000 spots in markets that reach Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada voters, data from ad-tracking firm Kantar/CMAG shows. All told, that is more than six times as many as the rest of the Democratic field combined.”

“Where the whole power of the government is in the hands of the people, there is the less pretense for the use of violent remedies in partial or occasional distempers of the State.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 21



TIME OUT: AN INVENTOR’S SLAP SHOT

Smithsonian: “Invented by Frank Zamboni, the eponymous ice-clearing machine celebrates its 70th anniversary this year. He applied for his first U.S. patent in 1949, for this innovative idea that totally transformed winter sports by giving chopped-up ice surfaces a fresh-frozen smoothness in a matter of minutes. ‘At the time, he was just trying to address a need of his,’ says Frank Zamboni, the inventor’s grandson and now president of the Zamboni Company. ‘He saw a need for the ice rink he owned with his brother and cousins… Instead of taking 1 1/2 hours to clean the ice, that was time somebody could be paying to skate on it.’ Contrary to popular belief, the Zamboni machine was not invented in Canada—the place of snow and ice—but in Southern California—the land of sun and fun. … As time went on, he saw a need to quickly clean the ice, so he started improvising with war-surplus equipment.”

PELOSI STILL NOT BITING ON IMPEACHMENT VOTE

Politico: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic leaders will hold off on a full House vote authorizing an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, according to multiple lawmakers and aides. Democratic leadership sources caution, however, that the decision could be ‘reassessed at some point.’ The move came amid opposition from key chairmen and members of leadership, as well as a number of centrist Democrats facing tough reelection bids. Trump, White House officials and Republicans on Capitol Hill have seized on the absence of such a vote as an unacceptable break with House precedent and have vowed to resist what they describe as an illegitimate probe. But Democrats defended their current impeachment process, which has multiple House committees interviewing witnesses in private and gathering evidence related to allegations that Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, pressured Ukrainian officials to begin an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son — potentially at the risk of losing U.S. military aid.”



Gallup: Majority now supports removing Trump from office - Gallup: “Public opinion on whether Trump should be impeached remains mixed, but Americans now lean slightly more in favor of impeachment and removal from office compared with where they stood in June. Currently, 52% say Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 46% say he should not be. This is roughly the opposite of what Gallup found in June when asked in the context of special counselor Robert Mueller's investigation.”



Staffers fear White House seeking scapegoat on Ukraine call - NYT: “President Trump has for weeks sought to unmask the whistle-blower who shed light on his Ukraine dealings. But instead aides have fixated on one another: Advisers began a fact-finding review that some fear is a hunt for a scapegoat, according to White House aides and other people familiar with it. Even as the impeachment inquiry intensifies in Congress, White House lawyers are leading their own review, the people said. They are seeking to understand White House officials’ actions around Mr. Trump’s July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, which is central to the whistle-blower’s allegation that Mr. Trump abused his power. The lawyers’ inquiry centers on why one of their colleagues, the deputy White House counsel John A. Eisenberg, placed a rough transcript of the call in a computer system typically reserved for the country’s most closely guarded secrets. Mr. Trump later directed that a reconstructed transcript be released amid intensifying scrutiny from House Democrats.”



Mulvaney emerges as key figure in impeachment probe - WaPo: “In late May, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney organized a meeting that stripped control of the country’s relationship with Ukraine from those who had the most expertise at the National Security Council and the State Department. Instead, Mulvaney put an unlikely trio in charge of managing the U.S.-Ukraine account amid worrisome signs of a new priority, congressional officials said Tuesday: pressuring the fledgling government in Kiev to deliver material that would be politically valuable to President Trump. The work of those ‘three amigos,’ as they came to call themselves — diplomats Gordon Sondland and Kurt Volker, plus Energy Secretary Rick Perry — has come to light in recent days through newly disclosed text messages and the testimony of government witnesses appearing before an impeachment inquiry in Congress.”



BEVIN RECOVERS IN KENTUCKY POLL

WYMT: “The Mason-Dixon Kentucky Poll was released early Wednesday morning, and the results are interesting. The poll shows that statewide, 46 percent of likely voters support Republican Governor Matt Bevin, while 46 percent back Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear. At the beginning of the year, Beshear held a 48 percent-40 percent lead over Bevin, but the incumbent has pulled into a tie with his challenger. One percent of respondents voted for Libertarian nominee John Hicks, while seven percent were undecided. The poll also shows Bevin's GOP support grew from 67 percent in December to 77 percent. He is pulling in 22 percent of Democrat respondents for the cross-over vote, while Beshear is drawing 15 percent from Republicans. Among the Mason-Dixon poll participants, Bevin led among men, older voters and rural voters. … The poll credits some of Bevin's resurgence to President Donald Trump's popularity in Kentucky and resistance to his impeachment.”



Second debate was heavy with personal attacks - Louisville Courier Journal: “Republican incumbent Matt Bevin and Democratic challenger Andy Beshear had their ugliest public exchange Tuesday at the second gubernatorial debate of the fall campaign. Throughout the discussion, hosted before a raucous crowd of supporters on the University of Kentucky campus, the two rivals called each other liars and regularly interrupted one another as they were peppered with policy questions. When moderators asked about ways they would encourage students to pursue a career in public education, including the state's colleges and universities, the conversation took a turn into the gutter. … The high stakes debate touched on health care, pension reform, medical marijuana and supporting out-of-work coal miners. But it underscored how Kentucky's race for governor this year is defined by Bevin and Beshear's enmity as much as their deep differences on tackling the state's woes.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“If Trump is impeached and the Senate is mad at him, votes him out, then the GOP could have a primary too. That would take up a lot of news from the Democrats. I think we need a law for 6 months of elections, period.” – Karen Morrow, Tampa, Fla.



[Ed. note: It would be a comfort to have such constraints, it’s true. But our Constitution just wouldn’t allow for it. The government can’t tell people when they can talk about issues, therefore there’s no way to keep candidates from campaigning and reporters from reporting. I’m increasingly in favor, though, of doing away with primary elections. Our 40-year experiment with them has been a miserable bust and has unnecessarily prolonged our election calendars. Bring back conventions and spare the American people!]



“I have pretty much come to the opinion that two things will happen…one, the 2020 election is not going to be over on election night (owing to huge court battles to follow many very close races) and…two, at some point our Agitator-in-Chief is going to leave office of his own volition…having become tired of the battle and wanting to go back to his business dealings and such. What say youse (that’s a Michigan (born & raised there) UP term)?” – Rick Randell, Bradenton, Fla.



[Ed. note: I say that I know better not to say, Mr. Randell! I think there are lots of potential scenarios for 2020 that could still be in the offing. We may yet see a landslide or even, dare I say, a political realignment. As for Trump leaving early, it’s pretty hard for me to fathom. I doubt he’d give his enemies the pleasure.]



“I miss Chris’ input during events like the debates on Twitter. I understand why he left, and it is best for his happiness. But there were so many Whhhooo Doogie moments last night, I would have loved watching it with him. But since I have found Fox Nation I can see his more candid takes on the events of the day. I just cannot interact with my clever comments! I would love to have him join The Dispatch so he could participate in the discussion groups. I will send them a note to suggest his inclusion! Thank you for being so glorious. (Sorry about the Cardinals, but Charles is happy!)” – Polly Barrett, Waco, Texas

SLÁINTE, MR. BRADLEY

HuffPo: “A man in Dublin, Ireland, decided to inject a little humor into his funeral Saturday by playing a prank on his loved ones. Shay Bradley, a Defense Forces veteran who died Oct. 8 ‘after a long illness bravely borne’ according to his obituary, shocked then delighted funeralgoers when they suddenly heard his voice shouting from his coffin as it was being lowered into the ground. ‘Hello? Hello. Hello? Let me out!’ stunned attendees heard in a prerecorded message that also included ‘knocking’ against the coffin’s lid. … Those at the funeral can be seen giggling and wiping away tears as Bradley’s voice begins to sing: ‘Hello again, hello. Hello, I just called to say goodbye.’ His daughter Andrea Bradley told HuffPost that her father recorded the audio about a year ago — and that no one really knew about it other than her brother Jonathan and her nephew, Ben. Two days before Shay Bradley’s funeral, Jonathan Bradley decided to tell his mom and the rest of his siblings about the prank. He told them that playing the audio at the funeral was his dad’s dying wish.”

* There was a lively Democratic presidential primary debate in Westerville, Ohio, last night. The next gathering will be in Georgia on Nov. 20.

* Bernie Sanders hasn’t picked up many congressional endorsements for his presidential campaign, but he’s now picking up two fairly high-profile backers: first-year Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).

* Joe Biden’s campaign appears to have a rather serious financial problem: as the 2020 race enters the next stage, the former vice president only had about $9 million cash on hand as of two weeks ago. In contrast, Bernie Sanders had $33.7 million in the bank, Elizabeth Warren had $25.7 million, Pete Buttigieg had $23.3 million, and Kamala Harris had $10.5 million.

* With only three weeks remaining in Kentucky’s gubernatorial race, the latest Mason-Dixon poll shows incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin (R) tied with state Attorney General Andy Beshear (D), with each garnering 46% support.

* On a related note, Bevin’s fate is reportedly of keen interest to the White House, and Team Trump is reportedly “planning an 11th-hour push to stave off an embarrassing defeat” for the far-right governor.

* And speaking of the Bluegrass State, a judge yesterday sided with the Kentucky Democratic Party and ordered State Board of Elections to keep 175,000 purged voters on the state’s voter rolls.

* In Maine., the latest survey from Public Policy Polling found Sen. Susan Collins (R) trailing a generic Democrat in next year’s U.S. Senate race, 41% to 44%. The incumbent Republican hasn’t yet officially declared whether she’ll run for another term.

* In a newly released audio recording, Texas state House Speaker Dennis Bonnen (R) is heard telling a far-right activist that Donald Trump is “killing” the party “in the urban-suburban districts.”

* And though the president’s GOP primary rivals stand no realistic chance of success, it seemed notable that a Franklin Pierce University-Boston Herald poll found former Gov. Bill Weld with 14% support in New Hampshire, up from 3% in the same poll last month."

Harris previously sent a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in which she listed a series of problems she had with the president's Twitter activity. When asked about the idea, Warren laughed it off and flatly rejected it at the beginning of October.

Harris apparently saw that and referenced her answer during Tuesday's Democratic debate. ""I would urge you to join me,"" she said before claiming that Trump used Twitter to ""obstruct justice.""

Harris also pointed to August's mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, claiming the perpetrator was ""informed"" by how Trump used the platform.

WARREN LAUGHS OFF SUGGESTION THAT TWITTER BAN AFTER TRUMP AFTER HARRIS' CALL FOR SUSPENSION

""This is a matter of corporate responsibility. Twitter should be held accountable and shut down that site,"" she said. ""It is a matter of safety.""

Warren seemed to agree Trump should leave Twitter but didn't explicitly endorse his suspension. ""So look, I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter, I want to push him out of the White House. That's our job,"" she said.

When Harris pressed Warren on joining her call to suspend Trump, Warren shook her head and said ""no."" Harris, apparently surprised, smiled and said ""wow.""

Harris ignited a Twitter controversy in October after she alerted Dorsey to one of Trump's tweets. At that point, she had already sent her letter in which she told the company: ""I believe the president's recent tweets rise to the level that Twitter should consider suspending his account. When this kind of abuse is being spewed from the most powerful office in the United States, the stakes are too high to do nothing.""

In a blog post from 2018, Twitter seemed to respond to other requests that it punish Trump for his tweets.

Harris’ rural plan comes with a more than $100 billion price tag and will be paid for through a broad increase in corporate taxes.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has responded to calls for social media companies to curtail President Trump's activities on platforms such as Twitter.

""My belief is that in a democracy, I don’t think that we want private companies censoring politicians in the news,"" Zuckerberg told Dana Perino in an exclusive interview airing Friday on ""The Daily Briefing.""

KAMALA HARRIS CALLS FOR SUSPENSION OF TRUMP'S TWITTER ACCOUNT AMID WHISTLEBLOWER TWEETS

During the interview, Perino asked Zuckerberg about Sen. Kamala Harris' demand that Twitter shut down Trump's account, which the president uses regularly to share his views on a multitude of issues.

Zuckerberg said Silicon Valley shouldn't be taking such actions.

""I generally believe that as a principle, people should decide what is credible and what they want to believe, who they want to vote for,"" he said. ""And I don’t think that should be something that we want tech companies or any kind of company doing.""

Earlier this month, Harris, D-Calif., claimed Trump was using Twitter to inappropriately criticize an intelligence community whistleblower who filed a complaint regarding the president's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky.

""The President's tweets and his behaviors about this are just further evidence of the fact that he uses his power in a way that is designed to beat people down instead of lift people up,"" the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate told CNN.

FACEBOOK CEO SAYS HE WON'T FURTHER ANTAGONIZE ELIZABETH WARREN AFTER THREATENING LAWSUIT

""Frankly, when you look at what he's been tweeting ... directed at the whistleblower, directed at so many people, you know, I, frankly, think that based on this and all we've seen him do before, including attacking members of Congress, that he, frankly, should be -- his Twitter account should be suspended.”

In the interview with Perino, Zuckerberg also responded to another 2020 Democratic presidential candidate's criticism of Facebook.

Last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren's campaign account tweeted it had created a ""Facebook ad with false claims"" and submitted it to the social media site's platform, which approved it.

In that same series of tweets, Warren's team claimed Facebook had ""changed their ads policy to allow politicians to run ads with known lies — explicitly turning the platform into a disinformation-for-profit machine.""

In a recent live-streamed company meeting, Zuckerberg said that he would ""try not to antagonize her [Warren] further.""

""Even when people disagree with what I think would be good to happen in the world, I still want to give them a voice — that's what we're here to do,"" Zuckerberg told his employees.

The 35-year-old billionaire told Perino it is important for Americans to ""think for themselves"" about what politicians say.

""Political speech is one of the most scrutinized [forms of] speech that is out there, so that’s already happening,"" he added. ""Our position on this is not an outlier.""

But in a resurfaced tweet from last year, Buttigieg professed support for it.

A Buttigieg aide Wednesday said that he had not changed his position on Medicare for all, explaining that he supports it as an end goal but he wants to take a ""glide path"" to get there, The Hill reported.

“What I'll say is that I've laid out a plan that now explains how we're going to get there, that makes Medicare available to all and at the same time doesn't do away with private plans,"" Buttigieg told a reporter Wednesday who asked if his position had changed.

He added that he doesn’t think private plans need to be gotten rid of to make Medicare available to everyone, according to The Hill.

At the debate, Warren said Buttiegieg’s plan was really “Medicare-for-all-who-can-afford-it.”

The network landed an average of 8.3 million views during the three-hour telecast. That marked quite a dip from its previous two-part debates in July, where viewership peaked at 10.7 million. CNN's debate also saw an almost 50-percent drop from the first debate hosted by NBC News back in June, which received 15.3 million viewers.

In addition, 449,000 viewers watched live streams on various platforms from CNN and The New York Times, who co-hosted the debate.

The fourth debate featured 12 candidates on one stage. They were: former Vice President Joe Biden,; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Sen. Kamala Harris of California; tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas; Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; and billionaire donor Tom Steyer.

CNN DEBATE SLAMMED BY CRITICS, CANDIDATES: 'DAMAGED THE NETWORK'S CREDIBILITY EVEN FURTHER'

CNN and The Times faced an avalanche of criticism during and after the debate. The hosting news outlets received backlash for not asking the 12 candidates about topics including China, which has made big headlines in recent weeks amid the ongoing trade war with the U.S.; the mounting tensions in Hong Kong; and the growing controversy with the NBA.

Even the candidates slammed the debate hosts. Castro blasted the debate for not asking any questions about climate change but making time for a question about Ellen DeGeneres' friendship with former President George W. Bush. Harris similarly called out the news organizations for overlooking climate change, immigration and LGBT issues.

Gabbard, however, may have had the fiercest attack, which she made on the debate stage.

After the three-hour televised event, viewers and some Democratic hopefuls slammed debate moderator Anderson Cooper’s final question of the evening, which did not focus on what many thought could have been more important issues, like climate change.

“Last week, Ellen DeGeneres was criticized after she and former President George W. Bush were seen laughing together at a football game. Ellen defended their friendship, saying, ‘We’re all different and I think that we’ve forgotten that that’s OK, that we’re all different,’” Cooper said to the 12 candidates onstage.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was the big winner Tuesday night in Westerville, Ohio in the most crowded presidential debate ever held. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., also delivered strong performances.

Former Vice President Joe Biden and the other eight candidates on stage came out the losers in the three-hour Democratic presidential primary debate.

BIGGEST WINNER: Elizabeth Warren

Warren’s strong performance will likely solidify her frontrunner status ahead of Biden and Sanders. She emerged the clear winner of the night by showing she was sharp and prepared as she fended off attacks from candidates who were looking to cut into her polling lead.

WARREN COMES UNDER ATTACK FROM ALL SIDES AT DEM DEBATE, AS BIDEN DEFENDS SON'S BUSINESS PRACTICES

Even during the heated exchanges over health care and a wealth tax, Warren was able to turn attacks leveled against her around, and still deliver the best answers of the evening.

Warren questioned why the other candidates “think it is more important to protect billionaires than to invest in Americans” when responding to an attack on her plan for a wealth tax.

And importantly, Warren remained the focal point of the debate, speaking for the most amount of time of all of the candidates.

The senator from Massachusetts now has unmatched fundraising and polling momentum, along with a series of strong debate performances. This, coupled with the fact that Biden and Sanders have been weakened in dissimilar but debilitating ways recently, almost guarantees that Warren will take over as the front-runner.

SURPRISE WINNER: Bernie Sanders

Sanders has faced a precipitous decline in the most recent polls given the significant questions about his health and stamina following his recent heart attack.

However, Sanders delivered a strong, forceful performance in the debate, succeeding in showing voters that he has not lost a step, making him the second-place finisher of the night.

But it is clear that Warren has supplanted Sanders as the leader of the progressive movement in the Democratic field. As a result, it will be difficult – if not impossible – for Sanders to reestablish himself ahead of Warren.

It is clear that Warren has supplanted Sanders as the leader of the progressive movement in the Democratic field. As a result, it will be difficult – if not impossible – for Sanders to reestablish himself ahead of Warren.

SURPRISE WINNER: Pete Buttigieg

Buttigieg has been called the breakout star of the Democratic field – though he has recently struggled to distinguish himself. He had several strong moments in the Tuesday night debate. He was able to make a compelling case as a young, center-left candidate from a swing state with a military background.

Buttigieg was particularly strong during a tense exchange with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii over President Trump’s decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria, delivering a response that elicited cheers from the audience.

“Respectfully congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong,” the mayor said. “The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it's a consequence of a withdrawal and betrayal by this president of American allies and American values.”

Ultimately, Buttigieg’s performance will likely result in a post-debate polling bump with moderate voters, especially given Biden’s relatively weak debate performance.

LOSERS

BIGGEST LOSER: Joe Biden

All eyes, particularly those of Democratic leaders, strategists, and donors were on Biden, who needed deliver a strong performance to reassure voters that he is ready for a general election fight against Trump.

However, Biden was unable to break through and deliver the forceful showing that he needed, dodging a question regarding his son’s work with Ukraine and delivering several other uneven answers throughout the night.

With each passing day, Biden seems to move further from securing the Democratic presidential nomination, and his unimpressive performance Tuesday night will likely result in a post-debate polling decline.

LOSER: Amy Klobuchar

Additionally, although Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota had a number of well-executed lines taking aim at Warren, many felt similar to the inconsequential attacks leveled against Warren by former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland during the first debate. Thus, Klobuchar’s performance is unlikely to result in the post-debate polling spike her campaign needed.

LOSER: Kamala Harris

Sen. Kamala Harris of California similarly fell short, as she failed to distinguish herself in any meaningful way at a time when her campaign desperately needs a boost. Given that recent polls have her hoovering at around 5 percent, she will likely not be able to regain the momentum she had just over two months ago.

LOSERS: Gabbard, Castro, Steyer, Booker, O’Rourke and Yang

The remaining candidates – all barely registering in polls – were the biggest losers of the night. Rep. Gabbard, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, philanthropist Tom Steyer, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas and entrepreneur Andrew Yang failed to have the breakout moment they all desperately needed to show voters they could defeat Trump in November 2020.

One day after reports emerged that the group of far-left House Democrats planned to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders in the 2020 presidential race, it seemed only one of them – Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. – was officially aboard the Bernie Bus:

As for the others:

-- Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had made no official endorsement but was still rumored to be attending a Sanders rally scheduled for this weekend in Queens, N.Y. – one of two New York city boroughs that include a portion of Ocasio-Cortez’s home district.

BIDEN DISMISSIVE OF OCASIO-CORTEZ'S EXPECTED ENDORSEMENT OF BERNIE SANDERS

-- Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., clarified Wednesday that she had not yet endorsed a 2020 presidential candidate – even though CNN and Omar claimed Tlaib had backed Sanders.

-- Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., also hadn’t made an endorsement.

Pressley’s camp stressed that while the Squad members support one another in Congress, they don’t necessarily speak with one voice on all issues.

“Ayanna has tremendous respect for her sisters-in-service,” a Pressley spokesperson told Vox. “Ultimately, these political decisions are made as individuals.”

“Ayanna has tremendous respect for her sisters-in-service. Ultimately, these political decisions are made as individuals.” — Spokeswoman for U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.

One factor possibly stalling a Pressley endorsement of Sanders: She hails from the same state as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, so she might not be as eager to oppose a presidential candidate from her home area – the way that Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., for example, backed former Vice President Joe Biden instead of her fellow Californian, Sen. Kamala Harris.

According to Boston.com, Pressley’s ties to the Sanders campaign aren’t as strong as those of Ocasio-Cortez and Omar, with Pressley having backed Hillary Clinton over Sanders in 2016. In addition, Pressley has worked with Warren on legislation in Congress and also has close relationships with Harris and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who have been seeking her endorsement, the report said.

Tlaib, meanwhile, hasn’t ruled out a Sanders endorsement down the road, telling the Detroit Free Press she will host the U.S. senator from Vermont in her district later this month – just as she recently did recently with Warren. (Warren posted video from that visit online Wednesday -- and Tlaib retweeted it.)

""I am looking forward to bringing Senator Sanders to Michigan on Oct. 27 for a tour of our district that will highlight economic justice issues and corporate tax giveaways, and (include) a roundtable with housing justice advocates,” Tlaib said. “I need to know that anyone I choose to endorse will fight for my residents, and I appreciate the opportunity for them to have a dialogue with Sen. Sanders about these critically important issues.”

But regardless of what Tlaib and Pressley ultimately decide to do, the Sanders endorsement by Omar – and rumored endorsement by Ocasio-Cortez – were blows to the Warren campaign, coming on the same night that the senator fended off fierce attacks from fellow Democrats at the party’s presidential debate in Ohio.

As Boston.com noted, Warren has courted Ocasio-Cortez, having lunch with her in March, writing a blurb for Ocasio-Cortez’s entry in Time magazine’s “Time 100” listing, and filming a video with Ocasio-Cortez in which the pair reviewed the final episode of “Game of Thrones.”"

Barely registering the polls and with less than $700,000 of campaign cash on hand, the former San Antonio, Texas mayor who later served as Housing and Urban Development secretary under President Barack Obama is facing the possibility that his appearance at the debate at Otterbein University in suburban Columbus, Ohio may well be the last time he makes the stage.

BUTTIGIEG AND O'ROURKE CLASH OVER GUNS DURING DEBATE

Castro grabbed only 8.2 minutes of speaking time at the debate – the third least amount among the record-setting 12 candidates on the stage – and didn’t score a breakout moment.

But in an interview with Fox News in the spin room following the debate, Castro vowed that he’ll fight on even if fails to make November’s cut and optimistically said he’ll qualify for the next debate.

“I’m going to keep fighting on. I believe that with hard work, we can make the next debate in Atlanta. We have about three and a half weeks to do that. So I’m going to keep working hard to get there,” he said.

Castro’s comments stand in contrast to his dire warning to supporters in a fundraising email late last week.

""I don’t say this lightly: If I don’t make the next debate stage, it will be the end of my campaign,"" Castro emphasized.

FOX NEWS' BRETT BAIER ON DEBATE WINNERS AND LOSERS

To date, eight candidates say they’ve qualified: They are – in alphabetical order – are former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Kamala Harris of California and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, businessman and progressive and environmental advocate Tom Steyer, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

After the debate, it was hard to find a political pundit who praised Castro’s performance.

But asked by Fox News if his debate performance helped him in his goal to make the next debate stage, the candidate said, “I think so. It’s always a scramble for time with 12 people up there but I made the best use of the time that I did get. I was very sharp on issues that people care about and I think that will make a difference.”

And he touted on Twitter that “donations are coming in from all around the country.”

Castro also took aim at the media hosts for the debate - CNN and the New York Times – telling reporters in the spin room and highlighting on Twitter that there were “three hours and no questions tonight about climate, housing, or immigration. Climate change is an existential threat. America has a housing crisis. Children are still in cages at our border.”"

Elizabeth Warren to attacks on the specific questions asked by moderators.

The Hill media reporter Joe Concha told Fox News that CNN’s debate enhanced its already not-so-respectable reputation.

TULSI GABBARD SLAMS CNN, NEW YORK TIMES DURING DEBATE FOR 'DESPICABLE' 'SMEARS' OVER SYRIA, RUSSIA

“The network is under heavy criticism from the left and right today, and rightly so,” Concha said. “Its pursuit of sizzle over steak and focus on social issues over truly substantiate matters – economy, jobs, opioid crisis, border crisis, all-things China – has damaged the network's credibility even further.”

CNN partnered up with The New York Times for the event, which was moderated by CNN's Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper and Gray Lady editor Marc Lacey. While viewers complained about several issues with the moderators, a question Cooper asked about Ellen DeGeneres and former President George W. Bush’s friendship was perhaps the most lampooned.

“Three hours and no questions tonight about climate, housing, or immigration,” Julian Castro tweeted. “Climate change is an existential threat. America has a housing crisis. Children are still in cages at our border. But you know, Ellen.”

CNN FACES MORE ACCUSATIONS OF POLITICAL BIAS AHEAD OF DEMOCRATIC DEBATE

Sen. Kamala Harris also took to Twitter to criticize the moderators, noting there weren’t questions about climate change, LGBTQ rights or immigration.

“These issues are too important to ignore,” Harris wrote.

While Castro and Harris used social media, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hi., slammed CNN and The Times directly from the debate stage over what she described as ""smears"" against her on foreign policy.

""The New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime-change war,"" Gabbard said. ""Just two days ago, The New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia -- completely despicable.""

CNN BOSS JEFF ZUCKER ESCAPES QUESTIONS ABOUT OLD COLLEAGUE MATT LAUER

DePauw University professor and media critic Jeffrey McCall said the major flaw was that moderators allowed Sen. Elizabeth Warren to dominate the proceedings.

“The time imbalance was so obvious and quite unfair to Gabbard, Castro and the others. That Warren is now or at the top of recent polls is no excuse for allowing such an imbalance,” McCall told Fox News. “A candidate forum is supposed to give all candidates a fair opportunity to engage the dialogue and that absolutely did not happen. The debate moderators apparently don't own stopwatches.”

McCall said the imbalance “lends credence to the critics who say these forums are all about promoting some candidates over others” and Warren was clearly the favorite.

“The moderators were also quite powerless at times when they tried to move on or determine who would speak next. Candidates tended to ignore the moderators’ directions and interrupt as they wanted,” McCall said, adding that talking over the moderators is nothing new.

“This is standard procedure now in these televised spectacles, but it remains a weakness in the format and relegates moderators to bystanders at times,” he said.

The debate came hours after a secretly recorded video appeared to show a CNN staffer saying the network likes Warren “a lot” and dislikes Gabbard. CNN’s own Twitter account even pointed out that Gabbard received less time than other candidates. According to CNN itself, Warren spoke for over 22 minutes, followed by Biden’s 16-plus minutes, while Gabbard only spoke for roughly eight minutes.

Following the debate, Gabbard’s sister criticized CNN via a tweet sent by the candidate’s verified account that accused the network of cutting off Gabbard to “protect Warren.”

PROJECT VERITAS’ ALLEGED CNN WHISTLEBLOWER CLAIMS NETWORK IS ‘PUMPING OUT PROPAGANDA'

“It was no surprise that CNN began with almost 20 minutes talking about impeachment and defending the Bidens seeing as how CNN's been obsessed with impeachment for at least three years now,” NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck told Fox News.

“Between cutting off Tulsi Gabbard and asking far-left, leading questions on abortion, gun control, and the Supreme Court, CNN reminded America last night just how invested they are in defeating and removing the President from office,” Houck added.

Conservative strategist Chris Barron told Fox News that the debate was harmful to candidates because liberal moderators were so easy on them.

“CNN is actually doing a disservice to the Democratic candidates and to Democratic voters by refusing to ask tough questions of the front runners,” Barron said. “Whoever the Democrats nominate will have to square off against President Trump on the debate stage and I promise you he won’t treat the nominee with kid gloves”

Media Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor told Fox News that CNN wouldn’t be a “neutral referee” because of its own bias and that was before the debate even started -- and the moderators didn’t do anything to change his mind.

DAN GAINOR: ELIZABETH WARREN DRAWS MOST ATTENTION FROM MEDIA AND CANDIDATES IN DEMOCRATIC DEBATE

“CNN, which has done as much as any outlet in America to promote impeachment, began the entire debate with 12 questions on the subject – one easy one for each candidate,” Gainor wrote following the debate.

CNN and The Times were also heavily criticized for overlooking China, which has been a focal point of the recent news cycle. China made headlines in recent weeks between its trade war with the United States and the growing tensions between the communist nation and the NBA – but the moderators didn’t seem to care what 2020 candidates thought about the situation.

""There hasn’t been one question about China in this entire 3 hour debate. It is shameful,"" ""The View"" co-host Meghan McCain tweeted.

The ""foreign policy"" portion of the debate featured questions predominately about Trump's recent troop withdrawal from Syria as well as handling Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“It's patently amazing that the network couldn't find the time over three hours to ask one question about arguably a Top-3 topic going into the 2020 election, China, but did ask as its final question of the night about the friendship between Ellen DeGeneres and George W. Bush,” Concha said.

Plenty of others took to Twitter to chime in on the debate, too:

Given Joe Biden’s refusal to do any interviews since impeachment cast a spotlight on his family’s conduct, it was striking that he handed the ball to his son before the one forum where he couldn’t duck questions: the CNN/New York Times marathon.

And 17 minutes into the Ohio debate, when Anderson Cooper asked Biden the question, he retreated to “my son’s statement speaks for itself”—precisely the point of orchestrating the ABC interview.

JOE BIDEN DEFENDS SON HUNTER'S UKRAINE WORK: 'MY SON DID NOTHING WRONG. I DID NOTHING WRONG'

Cooper asked a key question: If Hunter Biden now says he won’t do any foreign work if his dad becomes president, why was it okay when Joe was vice president?

Biden ignored that, saying “my son did nothing wrong, I did nothing wrong,” then pivoted to denouncing Rudy Giuliani, President Trump and his “thugs” as liars. He would not acknowledge the lousy optics that even Hunter conceded.

The striking aftermath: None of the other Democrats on the stage said a negative word about Biden or his son’s lucrative deal in Ukraine. They deemed it off limits. Cory Booker defended Biden, saying no one should be “attacking a statesman.”

But Cooper also softened the question by saying “the president has made false accusations against your son” and “there is no evidence of wrongdoing by you and your son.” Why not let Biden make that case? Why appear to take sides? And is there absolutely no wrongdoing by Hunter, who was unqualified for the Ukrainian gas gig, as opposed to no evidence of criminal wrongdoing?

The only real action was on health care, though it wasn’t as exciting as the Washington Nationals scoring seven first-inning runs on their way to the World Series. In fact, that part of the debate seemed more like an old replay.

Once again, a journalist—in this case Marc Lacey of the Times—asked Elizabeth Warren if the middle class would pay more under the Medicare for All measure she is pushing.

Once again, Warren rolled out her standard response: The rich and big corporations will pay more, the middle class will pay less.

Lacey followed up—will you raise middle-class taxes?—and once again, the Massachusetts senator sidestepped: “I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.” Notice she said costs, not taxes. (Bernie Sanders, who wrote the damn bill, admits middle-class taxes will rise.)

Pete Buttigieg was more blunt, saying Warren had failed to answer a yes or no question. She dodged it again.

Amy Klobuchar, showing unusual aggressiveness, said Warren would kick 150 million Americans off their private insurance. I don’t know why the debate questioners don’t focus on this rather crucial point.

Biden said what he said in the last debate, that Medicare for All would cost $30 trillion over a decade and taxes would go up, but his rejoinder had less force.

After that, the debate settled into something of a wonkfest. What about auto jobs? Should there be a wealth tax? Can gun buybacks work? CNN’s practice of usually letting each of the 12 candidates answer the same question added to the drone factor.

Something else was at work. It’s now clear that the race has settled into a contest between Biden and Warren, with Sanders (looking vigorous despite his heart attack) continuing to slip. Everyone else has been mired in single digits for many months. So there’s far less media excitement if Kamala Harris has a strong moment or Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke get into a spat on gun control. Impeachment dominated the pregame programming, with the debate a secondary story.

The moderators, who included Erin Burnett, were fine, but could have done far more to sharpen the contrasts between the contenders.

On Trump’s pullout from northern Syria, Biden was strikingly emotional, saying of the Kurds: “They lost their lives. This is shameful, shameful, what this man has done!” Warren accused Trump of giving ISIS a new lease on life. Buttigieg called it a “betrayal.” The only dissenter was Tulsi Gabbard, who wants to end the ""endless war"" and accused CNN and the Times of smearing her.

But such brief fireworks were the exception, and that was the weakness of the debate. Far too much time was spent on the candidates denouncing Trump in unison, sometimes just changing the adjectives. That undoubtedly made Democratic viewers feel good, but did little to distinguish among the contenders.

That pattern began at the outset, when Cooper asked about impeachment. While he tried mixing up the questions—why not let the voters evict Trump instead, is impeachment a distraction?—every Democrat on the stage competed to castigate the president in stronger terms (Bernie won with “most corrupt in history""). Biden and Warren talked about the Mueller report, making clear that they were primed for impeachment before the Ukraine mess surfaced.

The only real change from the last three debates was that Biden briefly had to defend his son’s buckraking in Ukraine. Impeachment has frozen the race, and that’s bad news for anyone not named Joe or Elizabeth."

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was seen by the moderators and her fellow candidates as the one to beat.

That point was evident with time allotted to each candidate. Warren had the most with nearly 23 minutes to answer questions – or about equal to what the bottom three candidates mustered, according to The New York Times.

There were some advantages to that. John Harwood of CNBC proclaimed “this debate crowning Warren the new 2020 front-runner.”

CNN, NYT SLAMMED FOR AVOIDING CHINA DURING PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'THIS IS LITERALLY A JOKE,' 'SHAMEFUL'

But former CBS News anchor Dan Rather said that “the stage is more crowded than a Times Square subway stop.” And almost everyone on that stage was targeting Warren.

It didn’t go well for the senator from Massachusetts. The regular attacks often turned her into a whiny scold.

As CNN anchor John King later explained: “The candidates on the stage clearly thought it was in their best interest to go after Warren.”

Former CNN commentator Roland Martin said it even better, noting: “How do we know @ewarren is leading? She has a bullseye on her tonight.”

The Washington Post sold the debate with a headline sounding like it watched a far-more entertaining contest: “Warren faces first sustained attack in raucous debate.” At least it was right about the attacking.

The New York Times was more accurate in tone about the tedious three-hour marathon: “Warren Draws Fire From All Sides, Reflecting a Shift in Fortunes in Race.”

CNN host Van Jones reflected on the attacks, calling Warren: “Mortal. Mortal. Somebody grabbed the cape and pulled on it.” Jones explained that the “moderates” struck back, “tired of the woke-enomics.”

PBS White House Correspondent Yamiche Alcindor said it was a “BIG MOMENT” when the “Elizabeth Warren attacks begin.” As she described it: “Warren gives a tough stare” after “Mayor Pete Buttigieg says to Warren: Your signature is to have a plan for everything except health care.”

Even far-left Hollywood director Michael Moore wasn’t entirely happy with Warren’s prescriptions for change. He said: “Senator Warren (whom I love) just said she believes in ‘accountable capitalism’. There is no such thing. The only thing capitalism is accountable to is weath [sic] and more wealth for the wealthy. It’s only mission is to economically enslave the citizenry so the rich can get richer.”

But there was more to the debate than just attacks on Warren. There were also attacks on President Trump. Of course. CNN, which has done as much as any outlet in America to promote impeachment, began the entire debate with 12 questions on the subject – one easy one for each candidate.

The result was laughably predictable – all the candidates showed that they hate Trump. The Post’s phrasing was a “unified condemnation of Trump.” Like no one saw that coming.

NBC News Correspondent Mike Memoli called the beginning of the debate “a moment of history,” adding that “1 participant may vote on articles of impeachment. 5 participants would sit as jurors in an impeachment trial.”

This is sure to please the major media that not only hate Trump but have financial interests in the impeachment. Axios reported that news outlets are “building pop-up newsletters, podcasts, and sections solely to cover the day-to-day developments of the impeachment process.” Those include Vox Media, CNN and The New York Times.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California scored one of the night’s few applause lines and news outlets went with her extreme narrative backing abortion, after she said: “And it is not an exaggeration to say women will die, poor women, women of color will die, because these Republican legislatures in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with our bodies.”

The debate was also predictably left-wing. Van Jones asked Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota a scary post-debate question for Democrats: “And I wonder, are you afraid that the party is going in a direction that is just going to get us killed here in the middle of the country?” Klobuchar responded about the party can “come together,” but it’s the kind of comment that will set the left and media worrying.

Add it to the amazingly quiet crowd. The Root’s Politics Editor Jason Johnson called it “the quietest audience I've ever seen in a debate.” Trump would have called that “low energy.” He’d have been right.

Even liberals weren’t always happy with all the candidates, especially the newest entrant into the race. Vox Senior Correspondent Zack Beauchamp made fun of the billionaire who just joined the campaign, but who always seems to wear the same tie. “While Tom Steyer wasted an unconscionable amount of money getting on stage and did absolutely nothing to justify his presence here, his tie is pretty good.”

Bustle Deputy News Editor Catherine Thompson took her own shot at his debating style: “Tom Steyer is gesticulating and speaking like he’s a ventriloquist’s dummy carved out of wood.”

But CNN had Steyer’s back. It initially listed him as a “former hedge fund manager.” That wasn’t nice enough to a guy who buys so much TV advertising. So it somehow got changed to “Businessman.”

Because CNN is neutral. And not in it for the money.

And Washington Post Opinion Writer Elizabeth Bruenig was equally critical of former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke after a few candidates were asked about their age. “i mean look. yes, as you get older, your brain gets worse. but that's just a general trend. look at beto. he's very young and his brain is very bad.”

There was one especially unusual highlight of the debate. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii bashed the “mainstream media” like she was running in the Republican primary. She explained that The “New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime change war.” Those news organizations were the two hosts of the debate.

UltraViolet Action, a leading national women’s organization, thinks the fifth Democratic presidential debate – which is currently scheduled to air on MSNBC next month – shouldn’t happen if NBC keeps its beleaguered leadership in place.

NBC NEWS BOSS ANDY LACK’S LEADERSHIP SCRUTINIZED AS RONAN FARROW TELL-ALL APPROACHES

“The DNC needs to make it clear that they support survivors of sexual abuse and cancel the upcoming 2020 Democratic presidential primary debate on MSNBC until Comcast and NBC News take clear steps to clean up the toxic culture that exists across their networks,” UltraViolet co-founder Shaunna Thomas said in a statement.

Ronan Farrow’s book, “Catch and Kill,” hit stores this week and details allegations that NBC refused to expose Harvey Weinstein as a sexual predator. The book also suggests the Peacock Network wasn’t truthful regarding knowledge of alleged sexual misconduct by former “Today” co-host Matt Lauer.

Farrow reported that Weinstein leveraged information regarding Lauer to keep NBC off his back. Farrow’s former NBC News producer Rich McHugh, who is a key figure of the book, also penned a recent Vanity Fair column that said NBC News Chairman Andy Lack, and his top deputy Noah Oppenheim, breached “journalistic integrity” when they put the kibosh on the Weinstein story.

“Mounting reports show that NBC News executives – namely Noah Oppenheim – failed to hold sexual abusers accountable, failed to combat a toxic culture across newsrooms, and that the network’s so-called investigation into its culture was little more than a sham to provide cover for executives,” Thomas said.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI PUBLICLY SUPPORTED NEWS VET BROKAW AMID MISCONDUCT CLAIMS, PRIVATELY APOLOGIZED

NBC famously told Farrow that his reporting on Weinstein wasn’t fit to print, so he took it to The New Yorker where it won the Pulitzer Prize and helped launch the #MeToo movement. “Catch and Kill” details Farrow’s side of the story and features additional accusations against NBC News bigwigs.

“Additional reports that MSNBC executive Phil Griffin showed staff graphic images of Access Hollywood personality Maria Menounos prove that this toxic culture is an epidemic that extends across nearly all newsrooms and networks at the company,” Thomas said. “Taken together, these initial reports demonstrate that NBC’s current leadership is either unable or unwilling to take appropriate steps to combat the culture of sexual abuse at the networks.”

After the Weinstein and Lauer bombshells were reported in 2017, NBC refused to hire an outside investigator to determine who knew about Lauer’s sexual misconduct and whether NBC executives looked the other way. NBC relied on in-house general counsel Kim Harris despite widespread calls for an outside law firm to conduct the review.

NBC eventually declared that management was completely oblivious to Lauer’s behavior and Harris’ high-powered colleagues were cleared by the network. Lack and Oppenheim remain atop NBC News.

Tennessee will start Ryan Tannehill at quarterback instead of Marcus Mariota on Sunday against the Los Angeles Chargers, a person familiar with the decision told The Associated Press on Tuesday night. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the team has not announced the change.

Coach Mike Vrabel benched Mariota in the third quarter of a 16-0 loss in Denver, the first time the No. 2 pick overall in the 2015 draft had been pulled from a game for poor play and not because of injury. Vrabel said Monday the Titans (2-4) would decide who would start against the Chargers (2-4) by Tuesday and then tell both quarterbacks and the rest of the team.

Now Tannehill will get his first start since the Titans acquired the veteran in March from Miami through a trade initially designed to improve Tennessee's backup to Mariota.

""Ryan was an elite quarterback in this league ... no longer than a year ago,"" Titans tight end Delanie Walker said Monday before the decision was made to start Tannehill. ""He can take over a team. He can make plays, control the offense. I mean, I seen him do it in Miami.""

NFL.com first reported the switch at quarterback Tuesday night.

The Titans had made it clear all offseason that Mariota was their starter until the No. 2 pick overall in the 2015 draft turned in his worst performance in Denver. Mariota was 7 of 18 for 63 yards and was intercepted twice for his first turnovers of the season. He also was sacked three times.

Mariota went into that game as the NFL's only quarterback without a turnover, but his interception-free streak ended late in the first half at 205 straight passes when Chris Harris picked him off. Mariota is being paid $20.9 million under the fifth-year option of his rookie contract, and he has a 91.7 passer rating with seven touchdown passes and the two picks.

Tannehill was 13 of 16 for 144 yards while being sacked four times after coming off the bench for the second time this season. He also played at the end of a season-opening rout in Cleveland. He started 88 games in Miami, including 11 last season.

This is the eighth NFL season for Tannehill, who has a career quarterback rating of 62.9, having thrown for 20,578 yards with 123 touchdowns and 76 interceptions. The eighth overall pick out of Texas A&M in 2012, Tannehill is being paid $1.75 million under a one-year deal.

The Titans hope Tannehill jump-starts an offense that has scored 98 points all season, including one touchdown over its past 10 quarters. Tennessee has lost four of five."

On the roster: Welcome to the Thunderdome, Elizabeth Warren - Pelosi still not biting on impeachment vote - Gallup: Majority now supports removing Trump from office - Bevin recovers in Kentucky poll - Sláinte, Mr. Bradley



WELCOME TO THE THUNDERDOME, ELIZABETH WARREN

WaPo: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose steady stream of plans have propelled her to the top of the Democratic presidential field, came under sustained attack for the first time during a raucous primary debate here Tuesday that revealed Democrats’ ongoing public struggle to define their beliefs and choose a standard-bearer to take on President Trump. Warren (Mass.) faced direct challenges from several of the 11 other candidates onstage, who took her on over her policies, her fitness to serve as commander in chief and her willingness to question the motives of Democrats who support less transformational ideas. … The focus on Warren deflected attention from others facing scrutiny entering Tuesday’s debate, which was hosted by CNN and the New York Times. Former vice president Joe Biden went for long stretches without surfacing… Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), meanwhile, showed no signs of lingering health trouble.”



Klobuchar, Buttigieg shone through - National Review: “The October Democratic presidential-primary debate finally brought a genuine surprise, in that a pair of second-tier candidates who were in danger of being forgotten woke up, smelled the coffee, and brought their A-games: Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg. Considering how other second-tier candidates have turned in good performances in past months and seen little movement in the polls, this may not be a turning point in the race for either candidate. But in a way-too-long, often-boring debate that was stuck in the middle of an otherwise jam-packed news environment, Klobuchar and Buttigieg managed to stand out.”



Sanders and Warren have deep pockets as Biden burns cash - AP: “Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren don’t just lead the Democratic presidential primary in fundraising. They’ve stockpiled millions more than their rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden, who burned through money at a fast clip over the past three months while posting an anemic fundraising haul. Sanders held $33.7 million cash on hand on his third-quarter fundraising report. Warren had $25.7 million during the same period, while South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg came next $23.3 million. Biden, meanwhile, held just $8.9 million, a small fraction of what his leading rivals have at their disposal. With the first votes of the Democratic contest just months away, the candidates are entering a critical and expensive period when having an ample supply of cash can make or break a campaign. Biden’s total raises questions about his durability as a front-runner.”



Squad to endorse Sanders - Fox News: “Three members of the so-called ‘Squad’ of far-left freshman members of Congress are lining up behind Sen. Bernie Sanders for president. Fox News has learned that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., will appear with Sanders on Saturday in Queens, N.Y., at a ‘Bernie’s Back’ rally designed to generate excitement for the senator’s campaign following his recent heart procedure. Rep. Ihan Omar, D-Minn., will also endorse the candidate, Fox News confirmed. In addition, CNN reported that Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., will endorse Sanders as well. It was not immediately clear if Omar and Tlaib will appear at Saturday's event. … The endorsements would be a significant blow to the campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren…”



Steyer spending stupendous - WSJ: “Billionaire Tom Steyer appeared on the Democratic presidential debate stage for the first time Tuesday night, but voters in early states have already seen him on TV thousands of times. Mr. Steyer, who new federal filings show has poured nearly $48 million of his own money into his long-shot bid, is dominating television screens in the first four states that will hold nominating contests early next year. Since entering the race in July, Mr. Steyer has spent more than $26 million on TV ads, airing more than 53,000 spots in markets that reach Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada voters, data from ad-tracking firm Kantar/CMAG shows. All told, that is more than six times as many as the rest of the Democratic field combined.”

“Where the whole power of the government is in the hands of the people, there is the less pretense for the use of violent remedies in partial or occasional distempers of the State.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 21



TIME OUT: AN INVENTOR’S SLAP SHOT

Smithsonian: “Invented by Frank Zamboni, the eponymous ice-clearing machine celebrates its 70th anniversary this year. He applied for his first U.S. patent in 1949, for this innovative idea that totally transformed winter sports by giving chopped-up ice surfaces a fresh-frozen smoothness in a matter of minutes. ‘At the time, he was just trying to address a need of his,’ says Frank Zamboni, the inventor’s grandson and now president of the Zamboni Company. ‘He saw a need for the ice rink he owned with his brother and cousins… Instead of taking 1 1/2 hours to clean the ice, that was time somebody could be paying to skate on it.’ Contrary to popular belief, the Zamboni machine was not invented in Canada—the place of snow and ice—but in Southern California—the land of sun and fun. … As time went on, he saw a need to quickly clean the ice, so he started improvising with war-surplus equipment.”

PELOSI STILL NOT BITING ON IMPEACHMENT VOTE

Politico: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic leaders will hold off on a full House vote authorizing an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, according to multiple lawmakers and aides. Democratic leadership sources caution, however, that the decision could be ‘reassessed at some point.’ The move came amid opposition from key chairmen and members of leadership, as well as a number of centrist Democrats facing tough reelection bids. Trump, White House officials and Republicans on Capitol Hill have seized on the absence of such a vote as an unacceptable break with House precedent and have vowed to resist what they describe as an illegitimate probe. But Democrats defended their current impeachment process, which has multiple House committees interviewing witnesses in private and gathering evidence related to allegations that Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, pressured Ukrainian officials to begin an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son — potentially at the risk of losing U.S. military aid.”



Gallup: Majority now supports removing Trump from office - Gallup: “Public opinion on whether Trump should be impeached remains mixed, but Americans now lean slightly more in favor of impeachment and removal from office compared with where they stood in June. Currently, 52% say Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 46% say he should not be. This is roughly the opposite of what Gallup found in June when asked in the context of special counselor Robert Mueller's investigation.”



Staffers fear White House seeking scapegoat on Ukraine call - NYT: “President Trump has for weeks sought to unmask the whistle-blower who shed light on his Ukraine dealings. But instead aides have fixated on one another: Advisers began a fact-finding review that some fear is a hunt for a scapegoat, according to White House aides and other people familiar with it. Even as the impeachment inquiry intensifies in Congress, White House lawyers are leading their own review, the people said. They are seeking to understand White House officials’ actions around Mr. Trump’s July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, which is central to the whistle-blower’s allegation that Mr. Trump abused his power. The lawyers’ inquiry centers on why one of their colleagues, the deputy White House counsel John A. Eisenberg, placed a rough transcript of the call in a computer system typically reserved for the country’s most closely guarded secrets. Mr. Trump later directed that a reconstructed transcript be released amid intensifying scrutiny from House Democrats.”



Mulvaney emerges as key figure in impeachment probe - WaPo: “In late May, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney organized a meeting that stripped control of the country’s relationship with Ukraine from those who had the most expertise at the National Security Council and the State Department. Instead, Mulvaney put an unlikely trio in charge of managing the U.S.-Ukraine account amid worrisome signs of a new priority, congressional officials said Tuesday: pressuring the fledgling government in Kiev to deliver material that would be politically valuable to President Trump. The work of those ‘three amigos,’ as they came to call themselves — diplomats Gordon Sondland and Kurt Volker, plus Energy Secretary Rick Perry — has come to light in recent days through newly disclosed text messages and the testimony of government witnesses appearing before an impeachment inquiry in Congress.”



BEVIN RECOVERS IN KENTUCKY POLL

WYMT: “The Mason-Dixon Kentucky Poll was released early Wednesday morning, and the results are interesting. The poll shows that statewide, 46 percent of likely voters support Republican Governor Matt Bevin, while 46 percent back Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear. At the beginning of the year, Beshear held a 48 percent-40 percent lead over Bevin, but the incumbent has pulled into a tie with his challenger. One percent of respondents voted for Libertarian nominee John Hicks, while seven percent were undecided. The poll also shows Bevin's GOP support grew from 67 percent in December to 77 percent. He is pulling in 22 percent of Democrat respondents for the cross-over vote, while Beshear is drawing 15 percent from Republicans. Among the Mason-Dixon poll participants, Bevin led among men, older voters and rural voters. … The poll credits some of Bevin's resurgence to President Donald Trump's popularity in Kentucky and resistance to his impeachment.”



Second debate was heavy with personal attacks - Louisville Courier Journal: “Republican incumbent Matt Bevin and Democratic challenger Andy Beshear had their ugliest public exchange Tuesday at the second gubernatorial debate of the fall campaign. Throughout the discussion, hosted before a raucous crowd of supporters on the University of Kentucky campus, the two rivals called each other liars and regularly interrupted one another as they were peppered with policy questions. When moderators asked about ways they would encourage students to pursue a career in public education, including the state's colleges and universities, the conversation took a turn into the gutter. … The high stakes debate touched on health care, pension reform, medical marijuana and supporting out-of-work coal miners. But it underscored how Kentucky's race for governor this year is defined by Bevin and Beshear's enmity as much as their deep differences on tackling the state's woes.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“If Trump is impeached and the Senate is mad at him, votes him out, then the GOP could have a primary too. That would take up a lot of news from the Democrats. I think we need a law for 6 months of elections, period.” – Karen Morrow, Tampa, Fla.



[Ed. note: It would be a comfort to have such constraints, it’s true. But our Constitution just wouldn’t allow for it. The government can’t tell people when they can talk about issues, therefore there’s no way to keep candidates from campaigning and reporters from reporting. I’m increasingly in favor, though, of doing away with primary elections. Our 40-year experiment with them has been a miserable bust and has unnecessarily prolonged our election calendars. Bring back conventions and spare the American people!]



“I have pretty much come to the opinion that two things will happen…one, the 2020 election is not going to be over on election night (owing to huge court battles to follow many very close races) and…two, at some point our Agitator-in-Chief is going to leave office of his own volition…having become tired of the battle and wanting to go back to his business dealings and such. What say youse (that’s a Michigan (born & raised there) UP term)?” – Rick Randell, Bradenton, Fla.



[Ed. note: I say that I know better not to say, Mr. Randell! I think there are lots of potential scenarios for 2020 that could still be in the offing. We may yet see a landslide or even, dare I say, a political realignment. As for Trump leaving early, it’s pretty hard for me to fathom. I doubt he’d give his enemies the pleasure.]



“I miss Chris’ input during events like the debates on Twitter. I understand why he left, and it is best for his happiness. But there were so many Whhhooo Doogie moments last night, I would have loved watching it with him. But since I have found Fox Nation I can see his more candid takes on the events of the day. I just cannot interact with my clever comments! I would love to have him join The Dispatch so he could participate in the discussion groups. I will send them a note to suggest his inclusion! Thank you for being so glorious. (Sorry about the Cardinals, but Charles is happy!)” – Polly Barrett, Waco, Texas

SLÁINTE, MR. BRADLEY

HuffPo: “A man in Dublin, Ireland, decided to inject a little humor into his funeral Saturday by playing a prank on his loved ones. Shay Bradley, a Defense Forces veteran who died Oct. 8 ‘after a long illness bravely borne’ according to his obituary, shocked then delighted funeralgoers when they suddenly heard his voice shouting from his coffin as it was being lowered into the ground. ‘Hello? Hello. Hello? Let me out!’ stunned attendees heard in a prerecorded message that also included ‘knocking’ against the coffin’s lid. … Those at the funeral can be seen giggling and wiping away tears as Bradley’s voice begins to sing: ‘Hello again, hello. Hello, I just called to say goodbye.’ His daughter Andrea Bradley told HuffPost that her father recorded the audio about a year ago — and that no one really knew about it other than her brother Jonathan and her nephew, Ben. Two days before Shay Bradley’s funeral, Jonathan Bradley decided to tell his mom and the rest of his siblings about the prank. He told them that playing the audio at the funeral was his dad’s dying wish.”

THE CHAOS CAUCUS GETS ITS WAY

If you read this note you certainly have more than a passing interest in politics. In fact, you’re probably one of the people to whom your friends and family turn when it comes to sorting out questions political or governmental.



That's why one of our goals each day is to so equip you. We like it if you’re the smartest political person in the room.



So if they ask you today what in the h-e-double-hockey-sticks is going on, just tell them this: The two most powerful people in the American government – the system conceived by the Founders, purchased and defended with the lives of more than a million men at arms – is the specific insult the president used toward the speaker of the house.



Hoo-boy…



President Trump said that he called Nancy Pelosi a “third-grade politician.” Pelosi and others at the brief, useless meeting on the ongoing debacle in Syria say that Trump called her a “third-rate politician.”



We will not waste your time or test your credulity by talking about how unworthy this is of our republic or of the armed forces the two were supposedly meeting to discuss, or any of that “School House Rock” goody-goody stuff. It’s 2019. We get it.



But ask yourselves what comes next.



On the 1,000th day of Trump’s presidency we find a city and a system unraveled. If we take the long view we can observe that this is, in fact, what Americans voted for in 2016. Trump promised to bring combative, disruptive partisan warfare to levels unseen even during recent low points like the Clinton impeachment and the Iraq War.



Trump has delivered on his promise to disrupt, a promise he made to core supporters starting in June 2015. One of the reasons that his devotees are attached to him in a way that sometimes border on the religious is because he has kept faith with these voters every day of his presidency. Trump likes to boast that he is a builder, but his base hired him for a demolition job.



To win the presidency, though, Trump relied on the support of voters who felt differently – a bloc at least as large as his core followership. The mandate from these voters was not to turn Washington into an apocalyptic hellscape of turgid partisanship but rather just not be Hillary Clinton.



We imagine that those voters have watched the events of the past two months in some combination of fascination, shock, amusement and horror. The cause of such consternation is pretty simple: There is very little left in Trump’s administration that reflects the winning coalition of 2016 between Trump’s populist pitchforkers and the center-right Republican establishment.



Think of it this way – Trump succeeded in an audacious hostile takeover of the Republican Party. But after the establishment was defeated, many members of the old firm stayed on in this new joint venture.



Reince Priebus, Nikki Haley, James Mattis, Rex Tillerson, John Kelly, Kirstjen Nielsen, Jeff Sessions, Tom Price, Elaine Chao, Dan Coats, Mick Mulvaney and Mike Pence all hitched up for the new joint venture between Trump Inc. and the GOP.



It’s down to Mulvaney, Chao and Pence, and if we were Mulvaney we wouldn’t worry about renewing our parking pass for next month.



What that means is that Trump is substantially getting the government he wanted and promised, one in which he is unconstrained by convention, tradition or nearly any rules of the road. He envisioned that as president he could operate in the same way he did as the CEO of his family business.



Of course, as it turns out, he cannot. But he has run out of those individuals who, for the first 900-or-so days, managed to make things run in some kind of orderly way.



Consider the twin snares in which Trump now finds himself bound: Impending impeachment and the foreign policy meltdown in Syria. Both are the result of Trump doing things his way rather than the Washington way.



Any chief of staff worth his salt would have dived in front of that phone call to the Ukrainian president like it was a runaway dump truck. Whether you think Trump acted appropriately or not, he conducted himself in such a way that gave his critics all the ammunition that they needed. One day after Robert Mueller’s testimony snuffed out the already dying embers of impeachment talk in Congress, Trump picked up the phone and started a conflagration.



Any national security adviser in any previous administration would have done everything but swat the phone out of the president’s hand if he was telling Turkey’s strongman president that the U.S. would clear the way for Turkish forces to pummel our Kurdish allies.



Again, you may actually agree with the policy of feeding the Kurds to the Turks, but we are left in a situation where the American Air Force is bombing American military installations to keep them out of the hands of rapidly advancing hostile forces. Those are procedural, not policy problems.



The next 12 months will determine what, if any, legacy Trump will leave behind. Trump re-elected, Trump defeated, Trump impeached but preserved by the Senate and Trump impeached and removed are all real possibilities. And no one will have as much to say about which of those eventualities comes to pass as Trump himself.



His team is in disarray and his administration lurches daily from disaster to disaster. If he does not find a way to change that it won’t matter how bad the Democrats’ nominee is, Trump will never see a second term.



Given the fact that today’s White House press conference was to announce Trump’s decision to host world leaders next year at one of his family’s golf resorts, we get the sense that maybe that reality has not yet taken root in the West Wing.



THE RULEBOOK: FOCUS ON THE POSITIVES

TIME OUT: TIMELESS JULIE ANDREWS

Atlantic: “Home Work, [Julie Andrews] second memoir (this one co-published with her eldest daughter, Emma Walton Hamilton), is an account of what happened between Andrews’s film debut in 1964’s Mary Poppins and her performance in the 1982 movie Victor/Victoria. The motivation for the book, Andrews told [The Atlantic], was twofold. After the 2008 publication of her first memoir, Home, which detailed her difficult childhood and her earliest days as a performer, fans and friends had urged her to dive into the next phase. ‘The first one ended as I was heading to Hollywood,’ she said, ‘so of course everybody said, ‘When, when, when are you going to do the next one?’ Because they wanted to hear all that.’ Home, in other words, ended right before the moment when Andrews took the role that would change her life. The book is a dance between candor and diplomacy, as Andrews navigates the imperative of honesty with the courteousness that seems to be her governing instinct.”

OUTPOURING FOR ELIJAH CUMMINGS, LION OF THE HOUSE

Baltimore Sun: “U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings of Baltimore, a committee chairman known for his devotion to Baltimore and civil rights and for blunt and passionate speechmaking, died of longstanding health problems early Thursday morning, his office said. He was 68 years old. The Democrat, a key figure in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump as chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, died at Gilchrist Hospice Care, a Johns Hopkins affiliate, at approximately 2:45 A.M., a spokeswoman said. Cummings, who had been absent from Capitol Hill in recent weeks while under medical attention, had health issues in recent years. In 2017, he underwent an aortic valve replacement. The procedure, which aides described as minimally invasive in Cummings’ case, is used to correct narrowing of the aortic valve in the heart. The surgery led to an infection that kept him in the hospital longer than expected.”



LATE IN THE RACE, DEM FAULT LINES EMERGE

WaPo: “As the party’s fourth debate concluded, the Democratic primary contest opened a more robust and unpredictable clash over the ideological direction of the party, with moderates attempting to ignite the kind of passion that the liberal candidates have harnessed with large crowds and grass-roots donor networks. After months in which the race was largely static amid a crowded, free-ranging field, the nomination fight is showing signs of narrowing its focus to fewer candidates, divided into parallel feuds in the liberal and moderate wings of the party. [Elizabeth] Warren (Mass.) is entering a crucial phase of her campaign, taking attacks from all sides for the first time since she ascended in popularity, and attempting to demonstrate she can withstand the kind of scrutiny that previously fell mostly on [Joe] Biden, who until recently held an unchallenged lead in the polls. Yet as she attempts to coalesce support on the party’s left flank, Warren faces a renewed challenge from liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)… The left’s feud is replicated in the center, where Biden faces challenges from [Pete] Buttigieg, [Amy] Klobuchar and others.”



Biden dismisses Warren as a fellow front-runner - Fox News: “One day after being overshadowed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren at the Democrats’ latest debate, Joe Biden repeatedly criticized the progressive senator from Massachusetts, whose status has risen in recent months, making her a presidential primary front-runner alongside the former vice president. In Columbus, Ohio, Biden questioned Warren’s honesty and pushed back against the media’s labeling of Warren as a ‘co-front-runner.’ ‘I haven’t seen any polling showing that nationally, on average, that anybody else is a front-runner,’ Biden said. ‘You guys keep talking about that.’ Biden did acknowledge, in referencing the latest polls, that ‘Warren has done very well. She’s moved.’”



RNC raises record-setting $27.3 million in September - Fox News: “The Republican National Committee raised a record-setting $27.3 million in September and had $59.2 million cash on hand last month amid the impeachment push against President Trump -- which has fueled GOP campaign contributions heading into the 2020 election. The RNC’s September fundraising haul is the best off-cycle month in the history of both the Republican and Democratic parties. This cycle, to date, the RNC has almost tripled the Democratic National Committee’s fundraising efforts, according to the GOP, which also noted that the Democrats, as of last month, carried $7.3 million in debt. ‘While Democrats focus on fighting President Trump, Republicans have prioritized voters and we have another record-breaking fundraising month—the highest ever off-cycle—to show for it,’ RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told Fox News.”



DEMS FACE TIMING QUESTION WITH IMPEACHMENT

Politico: “Democrats are in an impeachment bind. For the first time, they’re receiving a gusher of evidence to support charges that President Donald Trump abused his power for political and personal gain, pressuring Ukraine’s fledgling government to investigate his political rival Joe Biden. But as more witnesses come forward to spill more secrets, the more Democrats are nervously eyeing the dwindling congressional calendar and wondering: When should we be satisfied with what we have and bring articles of impeachment to the floor? … Some Democrats say the investigation should continue until the evidence is so overwhelming it pries loose a few Republican votes, delivering a symbolic victory as Democrats hold out hope that impeachment isn’t a purely party-line issue. Others believe Democrats should exhaust the list of willing witnesses before drafting formal articles. And still others say the House already has enough evidence to move forward with impeachment immediately — from Trump’s own admission…”



McConnell readies party members for impeachment trial - WaPo: “Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told Republican senators Wednesday to be ready for an impeachment trial of President Trump as soon as Thanksgiving, as the Senate began to brace for a political maelstrom that would engulf the nation. An air of inevitability has taken hold in Congress, with the expectation Trump will become the third president in history to be impeached — and Republicans believe they need to prepare to defend the president. While McConnell briefed senators on what would happen during a Senate trial, House GOP leaders convened what they expect will be regular impeachment strategy sessions. In their closed-door weekly luncheon, McConnell gave a PowerPoint presentation about the impeachment process and fielded questions alongside his staff and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who was a manager for the 1998 impeachment of President Bill Clinton.”



Perry says Trump sent him to Giuliani - Fox News: “Energy Secretary Rick Perry, whose name has been mentioned in connection with President Trump’s Ukraine dealings, said in an interview published late Wednesday that the president told him to seek out Rudy Giuliani earlier this year to look into possible Ukrainian corruption. The Wall Street Journal sat down with Perry for an extensive interview and reported that the spring conversation was a sign of how closely Giuliani — a personal lawyer for Trump — worked on Ukraine policy. Giuliani's business dealings with the country were reportedly looked at by federal investigators. He denied any wrongdoing. ‘Visit with Rudy,’ Perry recalled Trump telling him. He told the paper that Trump was not convinced that Kiev ‘straightened up’ its act. Perry told the paper he never heard Trump or Giuliani talk about an investigation into the Bidens.”



Volker’s testimony revealed more concerns about Giuliani - Axios: “New details from Kurt Volker's closed-door interview indicate Bill Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine, was deeply conflicted about whether to take the job because of concerns about Rudy Giuliani's shadow involvement. Why it matters: The testimony by Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, earlier this month may help the president in the sense that it paints Giuliani, not President Trump, as the mastermind behind a campaign to get foreign leaders to investigate the Biden family and Burisma, according to sources with direct knowledge of his testimony. But it also amplifies concerns that Trump was more interested in what his personal lawyer had to say than the professionals in government. Taylor was also worried that Trump might be willing to trade away Ukraine's interests as part of a grand bargain with Russia, Volker told lawmakers. Taylor is expected to appear before members of Congress next week.”



The Judge’s Ruling: It’s impeachable if the House says it is - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano explains if President Trump right when he says the impeachment inquiry is unfair: “The illegitimacy argument contended that since the House has yet to vote to authorize an investigation of the president, its committees lack subpoena power. This argument contends that since impeachment seeks to overturn a valid election, it is a thinly veiled coup and thus is in violation of the Constitution. And the argument about unfairness states that the president is entitled to due process at every stage of the impeachment proceedings. These are valid political arguments. But as legal offerings, they are profoundly misguided. … Impeachment is always constitutional if it originates in the House and if its basis is arguably for treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” More here.

FLEA MARKET CHEESE? REALLY?

Fresno [Calif.] Bee: “Lemoore [Calif.] police are investigating the theft of $50,000 in cheese in a crime that is believed to reach back to 2017. The investigation, launched in late August, centers around products from Leprino Foods Plant in the 300 block of Belle Haven Drive in the South Valley city. A police spokeswoman said multiple subjects have been linked to the thefts and the cheese has been sold from Fresno to Riverside counties: door-to-door, on the street, at flea markets and on social media sites. After serving warrants, detectives recovered a large amount of cheese and arrested Jairo Mariano Osorio Alvarez, 24, and Roderick Domingo Ransom, 34, both of Lemoore.”

The tax credit would apply to companies in ""designated rural zones"" defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and is capped at $250,000 a year. To be eligible, businesses must hire three or more new full-time workers, one of whom must live in the community.

KAMALA HARRIS TAKES ON ELIZABETH WARREN FOR NOT WANTING TWITTER TO DELETE TRUMP'S ACCOUNT

Harris' rural plan slams President Trump, saying, “Donald Trump lied to rural America to get their votes, but has since turned his back on them. When I am president, rural America will have a partner ready and willing to listen and work together on real solutions to the problems they face every day.”

Harris’ rural plan comes with a more than $100 billion price tag and will be paid for through a broad increase in corporate taxes.

In addition to the tax credit, her proposal says she will use executive action to eliminate “Trump’s tariffs,” expand rural health care and guarantee broadband access to all households by 2024.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has responded to calls for social media companies to curtail President Trump's activities on platforms such as Twitter.

""My belief is that in a democracy, I don’t think that we want private companies censoring politicians in the news,"" Zuckerberg told Dana Perino in an exclusive interview airing Friday on ""The Daily Briefing.""

KAMALA HARRIS CALLS FOR SUSPENSION OF TRUMP'S TWITTER ACCOUNT AMID WHISTLEBLOWER TWEETS

During the interview, Perino asked Zuckerberg about Sen. Kamala Harris' demand that Twitter shut down Trump's account, which the president uses regularly to share his views on a multitude of issues.

Zuckerberg said Silicon Valley shouldn't be taking such actions.

""I generally believe that as a principle, people should decide what is credible and what they want to believe, who they want to vote for,"" he said. ""And I don’t think that should be something that we want tech companies or any kind of company doing.""

Earlier this month, Harris, D-Calif., claimed Trump was using Twitter to inappropriately criticize an intelligence community whistleblower who filed a complaint regarding the president's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky.

""The President's tweets and his behaviors about this are just further evidence of the fact that he uses his power in a way that is designed to beat people down instead of lift people up,"" the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate told CNN.

FACEBOOK CEO SAYS HE WON'T FURTHER ANTAGONIZE ELIZABETH WARREN AFTER THREATENING LAWSUIT

""Frankly, when you look at what he's been tweeting ... directed at the whistleblower, directed at so many people, you know, I, frankly, think that based on this and all we've seen him do before, including attacking members of Congress, that he, frankly, should be -- his Twitter account should be suspended.”

In the interview with Perino, Zuckerberg also responded to another 2020 Democratic presidential candidate's criticism of Facebook.

Last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren's campaign account tweeted it had created a ""Facebook ad with false claims"" and submitted it to the social media site's platform, which approved it.

In that same series of tweets, Warren's team claimed Facebook had ""changed their ads policy to allow politicians to run ads with known lies — explicitly turning the platform into a disinformation-for-profit machine.""

In a recent live-streamed company meeting, Zuckerberg said that he would ""try not to antagonize her [Warren] further.""

""Even when people disagree with what I think would be good to happen in the world, I still want to give them a voice — that's what we're here to do,"" Zuckerberg told his employees.

The 35-year-old billionaire told Perino it is important for Americans to ""think for themselves"" about what politicians say.

""Political speech is one of the most scrutinized [forms of] speech that is out there, so that’s already happening,"" he added. ""Our position on this is not an outlier.""

Zuckerberg discussed allegations of anti-conservative bias among tech companies.

He has criticized single-payer at the last few debates, claiming it would ""obliterate private plans.""

But in a resurfaced tweet from last year, Buttigieg professed support for it.

""I, Pete Buttigieg, politician, do henceforth and forthwith declare, most affirmatively and indubitably, unto the ages, that I do favor Medicare for all, as I do favor any measure that would help get all Americans covered,"" Buttigieg wrote in a February 2018 tweet, responding to whether he supported it.

A Buttigieg aide Wednesday said that he had not changed his position on Medicare for all, explaining that he supports it as an end goal but he wants to take a ""glide path"" to get there, The Hill reported.

“What I'll say is that I've laid out a plan that now explains how we're going to get there, that makes Medicare available to all and at the same time doesn't do away with private plans,"" Buttigieg told a reporter Wednesday who asked if his position had changed.

He added that he doesn’t think private plans need to be gotten rid of to make Medicare available to everyone, according to The Hill.

At the debate, Warren said Buttiegieg’s plan was really “Medicare-for-all-who-can-afford-it.”

Former President Obama aide and ""Pod Save America"" host Jon Favreau tweeted Wednesday that both Buttigieg and Kamala Harris have changed their positions on Medicare-for-all.

""And there can be perfectly legitimate reasons for that,"" he wrote. ""The difference is, Harris hasn’t been openly attacking her old position. Trickier to pull off!"""

The network landed an average of 8.3 million views during the three-hour telecast. That marked quite a dip from its previous two-part debates in July, where viewership peaked at 10.7 million. CNN's debate also saw an almost 50-percent drop from the first debate hosted by NBC News back in June, which received 15.3 million viewers.

In addition, 449,000 viewers watched live streams on various platforms from CNN and The New York Times, who co-hosted the debate.

The fourth debate featured 12 candidates on one stage. They were: former Vice President Joe Biden,; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Sen. Kamala Harris of California; tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas; Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; and billionaire donor Tom Steyer.

CNN DEBATE SLAMMED BY CRITICS, CANDIDATES: 'DAMAGED THE NETWORK'S CREDIBILITY EVEN FURTHER'

CNN and The Times faced an avalanche of criticism during and after the debate. The hosting news outlets received backlash for not asking the 12 candidates about topics including China, which has made big headlines in recent weeks amid the ongoing trade war with the U.S.; the mounting tensions in Hong Kong; and the growing controversy with the NBA.

Even the candidates slammed the debate hosts. Castro blasted the debate for not asking any questions about climate change but making time for a question about Ellen DeGeneres' friendship with former President George W. Bush. Harris similarly called out the news organizations for overlooking climate change, immigration and LGBT issues.

Gabbard, however, may have had the fiercest attack, which she made on the debate stage.

""The New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime-change war,"" she said, apparently gesturing toward the moderators. ""Just two days ago, The New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia -- completely despicable.""

He argued that many conservative media platforms perform ""quite well"" on Facebook and other sites, pointing out that California is overwhelmingly liberal and he understands why there are suspicions.

""California is an overwhelmingly left-leaning place.

Earlier this month, Harris, D-Calif., claimed Trump was using Twitter to inappropriately criticize an intelligence community whistleblower who filed a complaint regarding the president's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky.

A few months back, the Menlo Park, Calif. firm conducted a yearlong audit in consultation with 133 conservative organizations or politicians. The audit, led by former Republican Sen. Jon Kyl, found that interviewees had concerns about Facebook's content distribution and algorithms, content policies and enforcement, ad policies and ad enforcement, and workplace viewpoint diversity.

It concluded the company needs to do ""significant work"" to satisfy the concerns of conservatives over alleged bias, though it prompted a backlash from conservatives and liberals alike.

""Merely asking somebody to listen to conservatives' concerns isn't an 'audit,' it's a smokescreen disguised as a solution,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., in August, calling on Facebook to conduct a third-party audit.

Hawley said last month Zuckerberg was ""stunned"" when he demanded in a face-to-face meeting on Capitol Hill that Facebook ""open up"" their books and make employees available for interviews.

One day after reports emerged that the group of far-left House Democrats planned to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders in the 2020 presidential race, it seemed only one of them – Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. – was officially aboard the Bernie Bus:

As for the others:

-- Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had made no official endorsement but was still rumored to be attending a Sanders rally scheduled for this weekend in Queens, N.Y. – one of two New York city boroughs that include a portion of Ocasio-Cortez’s home district.

BIDEN DISMISSIVE OF OCASIO-CORTEZ'S EXPECTED ENDORSEMENT OF BERNIE SANDERS

-- Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., clarified Wednesday that she had not yet endorsed a 2020 presidential candidate – even though CNN and Omar claimed Tlaib had backed Sanders.

-- Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., also hadn’t made an endorsement.

Pressley’s camp stressed that while the Squad members support one another in Congress, they don’t necessarily speak with one voice on all issues.

“Ayanna has tremendous respect for her sisters-in-service,” a Pressley spokesperson told Vox. “Ultimately, these political decisions are made as individuals.”

“Ayanna has tremendous respect for her sisters-in-service. Ultimately, these political decisions are made as individuals.” — Spokeswoman for U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.

One factor possibly stalling a Pressley endorsement of Sanders: She hails from the same state as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, so she might not be as eager to oppose a presidential candidate from her home area – the way that Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., for example, backed former Vice President Joe Biden instead of her fellow Californian, Sen. Kamala Harris.

According to Boston.com, Pressley’s ties to the Sanders campaign aren’t as strong as those of Ocasio-Cortez and Omar, with Pressley having backed Hillary Clinton over Sanders in 2016. In addition, Pressley has worked with Warren on legislation in Congress and also has close relationships with Harris and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who have been seeking her endorsement, the report said.

Tlaib, meanwhile, hasn’t ruled out a Sanders endorsement down the road, telling the Detroit Free Press she will host the U.S. senator from Vermont in her district later this month – just as she recently did recently with Warren. (Warren posted video from that visit online Wednesday -- and Tlaib retweeted it.)

""I am looking forward to bringing Senator Sanders to Michigan on Oct. 27 for a tour of our district that will highlight economic justice issues and corporate tax giveaways, and (include) a roundtable with housing justice advocates,” Tlaib said. “I need to know that anyone I choose to endorse will fight for my residents, and I appreciate the opportunity for them to have a dialogue with Sen. Sanders about these critically important issues.”

But regardless of what Tlaib and Pressley ultimately decide to do, the Sanders endorsement by Omar – and rumored endorsement by Ocasio-Cortez – were blows to the Warren campaign, coming on the same night that the senator fended off fierce attacks from fellow Democrats at the party’s presidential debate in Ohio.

As Boston.com noted, Warren has courted Ocasio-Cortez, having lunch with her in March, writing a blurb for Ocasio-Cortez’s entry in Time magazine’s “Time 100” listing, and filming a video with Ocasio-Cortez in which the pair reviewed the final episode of “Game of Thrones.”"

Turkey-Syria cease-fire in question after reported fighting, shelling

Just hours after President Trump announced a cease-fire between Turkish and Kurdish-led forces in Syria, journalists have reported continued fighting in the Syrian town of Ras al-Ayn on Friday morning, while other areas have reported relative calm since the agreement.

Journalists from the Associated Press reported witnessing shelling and said they could see smoke billowing around the town, which sits along the border with Turkey. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, reported intermittent clashes in Ras al-Ayn, but calm elsewhere. Reuters also reported machine-gun fire and shelling that could be heard from a border town in Turkey near Ra al-Ayn.

On Thursday Trump declared it ""a great day for civilization"" after Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, following a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara, announced terms of a cease-fire agreement that intended to end the violence between Turkey and the Kurds. At a Dallas campaign rally, he likened the Turkish offensive against the Syrian Kurds to a schoolyard fight and credited his ""unconventional"" approach for enabling the truce.

The deal was for a 120-hour cease-fire, during which time the Kurdish-led forces could pull back from the roughly 20-mile-wide safe zone on the Turkish-Syrian border. All Turkish military operations under the recent offensive known as Operation Peace Spring are to pause during that time, with the operation coming to an end upon completion of the Kurdish withdrawal, under terms of the deal.

Some U.S. military sources told Fox News they were skeptical of the cease-fire deal. Click here to read more on our top story.

Trump labels Pelosi ‘crazy,’ O'Rourke ‘dumb,’ as he slams Dems at Dallas rally

President Trump slammed Democrats as unpatriotic and referred to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as ""Crazy Nancy"" while giving an extended critique of his potential 2020 opponents before a large and friendly rally crowd in Dallas Thursday night. The “Keep America Great” event came just hours after Energy Secretary and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry announced he would soon step aside amid scrutiny from House Democrats conducting an impeachment inquiry -- and a week after chaos and violence broke out at a Trump event in Democratic-leaning Minnesota.

Outside the rally, some 30,000 Trump supporters watched the speech on a large screen, as the president blasted 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. He derided former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas as ""very dumb"" for pushing to confiscate guns and tax religious institutions, and said Joe Biden's family overtly profited from the former vice president’s political career. He also denounced Pelosi a day after she and other top Democrats walked out of a White House meeting, telling the crowd, ""She's nuts."" Click more on this story.

Mulvaney comments seized on by critics saying it's proof of Ukraine quid pro quo

Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney says his comments about the Trump administration's decision to hold up military aid to Ukraine have been misinterpreted after he initially seemed to contradict President Trump’s claim that there was no “quid pro quo” during his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky.

At a briefing at the White House on Thursday, Mulvaney told reporters that the release of $400 million in military aid to Ukraine was tied to the administration’s demands that Kiev investigate purported corruption by the Democrats during the 2016 presidential election campaign. Trump also mentioned to him that the corruption was related to the DNC server and ""that’s why we held up the money,"" Mulvaney said.

In a statement later Thursday, Mulvaney declared there was “absolutely no quid pro quo” between aid and any investigations. “There was never any condition on the flow of aid related to the matter of the DNC server,” he said.

China's economic growth sinks to a 26-year low

China's economy took another hit last quarter as the tariff war with the United States continued to take its toll. Its economic growth decelerated to a 26-year low in the latest quarter, adding to a deepening slump that is weighing on global growth. The world's second-largest economy expanded by 6 percent in the three months ending in September, down from the previous quarter's 6.2 percent, data showed Friday. The slump increases pressure on Chinese leaders to avert politically dangerous job losses as they fight a tariff war with President Trump over Beijing's trade surplus and technology ambitions.

A harshly worded letter that was obtained by Fox News calls on parent company, Comcast's, board of directors to “override NBC’s decision and launch a full investigation of sexual misconduct within the news division,” allowed current and former staffers to speak out despite non-disclosure agreements and have an in-person meeting with sexual harassment victims and advocacy leaders.

WOMEN’S GROUP CALLS FOR DEMS TO PULL MSNBC DEBATE AMID ‘CULTURE OF SEXUAL ABUSE’ AT NBC NEWS

Megyn Kelly, Addie Zinone, Linda Vester, Greta Van Susteren, Eleanor McManus and Gretchen Carlson signed the letter that is addressed to Comcast CEO Brian Roberts and the company’s board.

Ronan Farrow’s book, “Catch and Kill,” details claims that NBC News refused to expose movie mogul Harvey Weinstein as a sexual predator and wasn’t truthful regarding knowledge of alleged sexual misconduct by former “Today” co-host Matt Lauer.

“These were not isolated incidents. His years of predatory behavior toward female colleagues was tolerated by executives with the same attitudes toward women – some were even predators themselves,” the letter states.

NBC NEWS BOSS ANDY LACK TAKES AIM AT FARROW'S CLAIMS HE WAS BLOCKED FROM REPORTING ON ALLEGED WEINSTEIN CRIMES

“Certain network executives have enabled a corporate culture of widespread sexual harassment and abuse, and are still trying to cover it up today,” the letter said. “Comcast must prove to its shareholders that it will pursue the truth on behalf of NBC staffers. If necessary, it should remove executives who have abused or silenced women.”

The letter specifically calls out NBC News chairman Andy Lack and his top deputy, Noah Oppenheim, along with MSNBC president Phil Griffin.

“Are these the men you want running a news network news reliant on the FCC for license renewal?” the letter asked.

NBC NEWS BOSS ANDY LACK’S LEADERSHIP SCRUTINIZED AS RONAN FARROW TELL-ALL APPROACHES

Oppenheim, the president of NBC News, has downplayed Farrow’s reporting, but the book’s release has put the scandal back in the national spotlight, adding pressure to NBCUniversal and its parent company Comcast.

Hilary Smith, NBCUniversal senior vice president of communications, recently told NPR that “top leaders of NBC News still have the confidence of senior leadership within the company.” Smith also told The Hollywood Reporter that a new investigation

After the Weinstein and Lauer bombshells were reported in 2017, NBC refused to hire an outside investigator to determine who knew about Lauer’s sexual misconduct and whether NBC executives looked the other way. NBC relied on in-house general counsel Kim Harris despite widespread calls for an outside law firm to conduct the review.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

NBC’s internal review eventually declared that management was completely oblivious to Lauer’s behavior and Harris’ colleagues were cleared by the network.

""There is no additional investigation being launched. We are very confident in the report that was conducted,” Smith told THR. ""We fired Matt Lauer within 24 hours of learning what he did, and promptly launched a corporate investigation. Based on our investigative findings, we have swiftly taken appropriate actions to address the situation and improve workplace culture. It is also worth noting that this was a corporate investigation that was conducted by an almost entirely female team, none of whom are part of the News division.""

NBCUniversal did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

BUTTIGIEG, KLOBUCHAR GET BIG POST-DEBATE BOOST

Fox News: “Sen. Amy Klobuchar – giddy after a lack of sleep and rave reviews for her debate performance – touted to the jam-packed crowd inside a café in New Hampshire’s capital city that she raised $1.1 million in the 24 hours after Tuesday’s Democratic presidential nomination showdown. The haul was nearly a quarter of what she brought in during the entire July-September third quarter of fundraising. Highlighting that most of the money was from small-dollar contributions, the Minnesota Democrat told reporters ‘that shows something happened, that people were watching and they responded. And that is a very big deal for us.’ As Klobuchar spotlighted her post-debate haul, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who also excelled during the showdown, reported bringing in $1.1 million in the same 24-hours following the debate. His campaign touted that Wednesday was ‘one of our biggest fundraising days yet.’”



Buttigieg draws heat from black activists over fundraiser - AP: “Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg is scheduled to attend a Chicago fundraiser that will be co-hosted by a former city attorney who vigorously tried to block the release of a video depicting the shooting of Laquan McDonald , a black teenager whose death at the hands of police stirred months of protest and resulted in an officer’s conviction. Steve Patton, who led Chicago’s law department under former Mayor Rahm Emanuel, is listed as a sponsor of the Friday event, according to an invitation obtained by The Associated Press. For months, Buttigieg has faced criticism over his own handling of race as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, a racially divided city where decades of simmering racial tension erupted this summer when a white police officer shot and killed an African American man. … ‘He should adjust his schedule,’ said the Rev.

Analysis finds Warren $30 trillion short on single-payer plan - Bloomberg: “Elizabeth Warren took a lot of flak at this week’s Democratic presidential debate for being evasive about the taxes needed to pay for the $30 trillion Medicare for All plan she champions. There’s a reason for being vague: Her team hasn’t yet figured out how to pay for it. ‘Her taxes as they currently exist are not enough yet to cover fully replacing health insurance,’ University of California, Berkeley economics professor Emmanuel Saez, who advised the Warren campaign… Warren -- who campaigns on the theme that she has a plan for everything -- is relying on the wealthy and big corporations to pay for her vision of restructuring American society, including funding student debt, free college, universal childcare, green energy and affordable housing plans. … But she has made the strategic decision to adopt Bernie Sanders’ government-run health care plan rather than develop one of her own. … The Warren campaign said they are continuing to review revenue options to fund Medicare for All…”



Tim Alberta: Watching the Dem debate with Michael Bennet - Politico: “The instincts that guide [Michael] Bennet—being pragmatic, deliberative, restrained—are what many Americans say are precisely what’s needed to run the White House. But now, perhaps more than ever, those instincts are the opposite of what’s needed to win the White House. Once upon a time, there was a limited return on investing in outrage and demagoguery; statesmen were in high demand no matter the supply. That’s no longer the case, and not simply because a celebrity showman named Donald Trump is president of the United States. The painful reality of this political moment slides over Bennet like a barbed-wire blanket as he flops onto the couch and kicks off his faded brown dress shoes, preparing for a three-hour reality-television show that will help determine who leads the free world. All the more irksome to Bennet is the fact that five of his fellow senators are staring back at him from beneath the bright lights; he is the only member of the ‘world’s greatest deliberative body’ seeking a promotion who is excluded from the festivities.”



David Brooks: If it’s Trump vs. Warren, then what? - WaPo: “This is a memo for the politically homeless. It’s a memo to those of us who could never support Donald Trump but think the Bernie-Squad-Warren Democratic Party is sprinting too far left. It’s a memo built around the following question: If the general election campaign turns out to be Trump vs. Warren, what the heck are we supposed to do? The first thing we could do, of course, is pray for a miracle. Maybe the Democrats will nominate one of the five B’s or the K: Biden, Buttigieg, Booker, Bennet, Bullock or Klobuchar. These candidates are pluralists, not purists. … And yet, if it comes to Trump vs. Warren in a general election, the only plausible choice is to support Warren. Over the past month Donald Trump has given us fresh reminders of the unique and exceptional ways he corrupts American life. … Politics is downstream from morality and culture. Warren represents a policy wrong turn, in my view, but policies can be argued about and reversed.”



THE RULEBOOK: BUT STILL PROBLEMATIC

“It is at least problematical, whether the decisions of this body do not, in several instances, misconstrue the limits prescribed for the legislative and executive departments, instead of reducing and limiting them within their constitutional places.” – Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, Federalist No. 50



TIME OUT: LE EWW, LE GROSS

AFP: “The Paris zoo's latest attraction is a brainless, eyeless, single-celled organism with no limbs or stomach but more than 700 genders. Meet the ‘blob’, also known by its scientific name Physarum polycephalum or ‘many-headed slime.’ Preceding humans on Earth by some 500 million years, the creature resembles a kind of slippery sponge. It appears stationary, but does cover ground – at a leisurely pace of up to [0.4 inches] per hour – in search of prey, such as mushroom spores, bacteria, and other microbes. From Saturday, members of the public can become better acquainted with ‘le blob’, which has taken up residence in a large tank at the zoo in Paris' Bois de Vincennes park. Named after the 1958 sci-fi horror movie ‘The Blob’ about an alien creature that crashes to Earth and devours residents of Pennsylvania, the real-life blob consists of a single cell, sometimes with many nuclei that can replicate their DNA and divide.”

MULVANEY INCREASES WHITE HOUSE MISERY INDEX

WaPo: “For 39 minutes Thursday, White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney turned the press briefing room into a sort of confession chamber, openly admitting to several acts that could deepen the legal predicament for the president. [Donald] Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry into whether he has abused his office for personal and political gain. … In admitting that Trump had personally intervened to award a multimillion-dollar summit to his own company, and that the president had also used taxpayer money as leverage to push a Ukrainian investigation into Democrats, Mulvaney embraced a classic Trumpian tactic: saying the quiet — and potentially illegal — part out loud. But that strategy with regard to Ukraine came in for withering criticism after Mulvaney’s appearance, and he later tried to walk back his comments. In a statement late Thursday, Mulvaney denied the quid pro quo he had previously defended as appropriate and normal.”



State Department official: Obama administration ignored Biden warnings - Fox News: “A State Department official focused on Ukraine policy told Congress this week he raised concerns about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas firm in 2015, but was rebuffed by former Vice President Joe Biden’s staff, Fox News has confirmed. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, who testified behind closed doors before committees spearheading the formal House impeachment inquiry, told congressional investigators that he had qualms about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings. … A congressional source confirmed to Fox News on Friday that Kent testified that when he brought his concerns to the office of the vice president in 2016, his staff ‘blew him off’ and ignored the issue involving the younger Biden's role at the firm.”



Support steady for impeachment probe - Pew Research Center: “The new survey by Pew Research Center … finds that 54% currently approve of the House’s decision to conduct an impeachment inquiry, while 44% disapprove. Neither party engenders a great deal of confidence that they will be ‘fair and reasonable’ during the impeachment inquiry, the survey finds. About four-in-ten (43%) expect that the Republicans in Congress will be fair in handling the inquiry, while slightly more (47%) say the same about the Democrats in Congress. The survey, conducted on Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel, enables us to examine opinions about impeachment among the same group of respondents over the past month.”



Rick Perry announces year-end departure amid increasing scrutiny - NPR: “Secretary of Energy Rick Perry plans to leave his position at the end of the year, President Trump confirmed to reporters Thursday in Fort Worth, Texas. Trump praised Perry and said he already has a replacement in mind. ‘Rick has done a fantastic job,’ Trump said. ‘But it was time.’ Trump said that Perry's resignation didn't come as a surprise and that he has considered leaving for six months because ‘he's got some very big plans.’ Perry, 69, is one of Trump's original Cabinet members and recently has emerged as a central figure in the impeachment inquiry of Trump. Perry was part of what was dubbed ‘the three amigos’ — in addition to Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union, and Kurt Volker, former envoy to Ukraine — charged with managing the U.S.-Ukraine relationship after the White House removed the core of its Ukraine policy team last spring.”



DEMS BUILD CASH CASTELLATION AROUND HOUSE MAJORITY

Politico: “Democrats are building a financial bulwark around their House majority that’s going to be tough for Republicans to breach in 2020. Thirty-three of the 44 most vulnerable House Democrats have stashed an impressive $1 million or more in the bank well before the election year even begins. And their fundraising pace is not slowing down as they gear up to defend the chamber. Federal Election Commission reports filed this week illustrate Democrats’ formidable advantage: The 44 Democrats in the most competitive seats banked a collective $59 million so far. Nearly 30 raised $500,000 or more in the third quarter, according to a POLITICO analysis of the fundraising filings. And all but six of the so-called ‘frontliners’ have at least half a million more banked than their challengers, if they have any challenger at all. … The GOP is struggling to adapt to a changing landscape; They can no longer dismiss the strong fundraising as an anomaly when it has remained steady throughout the first three quarters of 2019.”



Can anyone beat AOC? - NYT: “It is hard to imagine a scenario where Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez loses her seat next year. She has raised more than $3.4 million, is better known than some presidential candidates and handily won a district that is among the bluest in the nation. But that hasn’t stopped people — lots of them — from trying to unseat her. So far, eight Republicans and three Democrats have filed to run for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s seat in the Bronx and Queens. Two of the Republicans have each raised more than $420,000, even though no Republican has represented the Bronx in Congress in at least 50 years. … The campaigns also highlight a broader strategy by the Republican Party: turning voters’ resentment toward Ms. Ocasio-Cortez into a conduit for the party’s other electoral goals.”



POLL SHOWS GARDNER TRAILING HICKENLOOPER

KMGH: “New Colorado polling released Thursday shows that John Hickenlooper leads Sen. Cory Gardner in a theoretical Senate matchup next year by 11 percentage points and that a majority of Coloradans support the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. The Keating Research-OnSight Public Affairs-Martin Campaigns (KOM) survey released Thursday afternoon was conducted by the Democratic pollsters Oct. 10-14 and polled 500 active statewide voters who cast ballots in 2016, 2017 or 2018 or signed up to vote since last November. The poll was weighted to be in line with voter turnout demographics and the margin of error was ±4.4% and was paid for by KOM.”



Former Republican launches Kansas Senate bid as a Democrat - The Wichita [Kan.] Eagle: “A Kansas lawmaker who left the Republican Party last year now hopes to become the first Kansas Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate in decades. State Sen. Barbara Bollier launched her campaign for U.S. Senate on Wednesday by promising an independent approach. She condemned dysfunction in Washington as she seeks to replace retiring Republican Sen. Pat Roberts. … Bollier, of Mission Hills in Johnson County, is the fourth Democrat in the race and the ninth candidate overall – joining a sprawling field that includes Republicans Rep. Roger Marshall and former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. In the Democratic contest, she will have to overcome serious campaigns by former federal prosecutor Barry Grissom and Manhattan Mayor Pro Tem Usha Reddi.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“A small, but important correction. It is not the American Air Force at work in Syria. It is either the American air force or it is the United States Air Force/U.S. Air Force, from which I am retired with 21 years of service. The same goes for the American army or the American navy. I agree with capitalizing proper names, but prefer that it be done properly. I'm a faithful reader, an independent politically, and I appreciate your non-partisan approach. Sometimes it feels as though we who prefer listening, thinking and discussing rationally are but drowning voices in a maelstrom of partisan fury. The Halftime Report is one of the very few media outlets that I feel I can trust to report accurately and to make projections which are supported reasonably. Thank you for the time and effort you and your team put into keeping us informed.” – Dave Riley, Kasilof, Alaska



[Ed. note: Good point, Mr. Riley! Certainly no disrespect intended. I was swerving from overuse of U.S. and ran off the other side of the road. Thank you so much for your kind words, readership and, most of all, your service.]



“Chris, I hope the new Syrian ceasefire lasts longer than your pledge to remain neutral about Trump in your Halftime Report.” – Scott Lyddon, Savannah, Ga.



[Ed. note: I’ve got to give it to you, Mr. Lyddon. That was pretty good! And since the cease fire seems to have ended before it really began, you may be now doubly right from your own perspective. I would remind you though that the goal here isn’t to be “neutral,” but rather to be useful. Fair analysis will necessarily include criticism. If there were no criticism – true neutrality – we would lose the capacity to render necessary judgments. My promise to you, however, is that I do not and will not make judgement about ideological rights and wrongs. As we wrote Thursday, we hold harmless those who either support or oppose the president’s policies in Syria. The same goes for the competing opinions about whether the president should be removed from office for leaning on the Ukrainians to investigate his political foes. Both positions are defensible and substantially irrelevant to my work. Our point Thursday was that however you feel about the policies, Trump’s chaotic governance and indiscipline is creating political liabilities. This week has been a brutal one for the administration, most of it needlessly so. I hope, whatever resentments you may hold for my rejection of neutrality, you still find the analysis useful.]



“As much as I admire moderation in the body politic, it seems that we are rapidly approaching a choice for those of us with (R) on our voting status. I find much of the President's language and combative behavior appalling, however he is generally consistent with my views on policy. But I am APPALLED by the full throated embrace of Socialism that is occurring on the other ‘side of the aisle.’ If we ‘moderate conservatives’ sit this one out (as probably occurred with the evangelical Christians in 2012), I believe the result could be an upheaval of our American way of life, facilitated by the most massive transfer of wealth in history.” – Patsy Fields, Aliso Viejo, Calif.



[Ed. note: Well, I’ve got good news and bad news for you, Ms. Fields. The bad news is that we are indeed already in the midst of an upheaval of American life. The changes we’re seeing in how we live, work, play, worship, mate, learn and communicate are massive in scope. You would have to go back a century or more to find a moment that even comes close to the enormous societal and, consequently, political change that has wracked American society over the past 20 years. No matter how you vote, that toothpaste isn’t going back in the tube. Neither party nor any politician has the answer for dealing with all of these changes. The far left believes economic collectivism based on an ambition for social justice is the answer, while the far right champions a sort of cultural collectivism supported by economic nationalism in which the government works to engineer a new American culture to its supporters liking. Both will probably fail to achieve their highest aims. And that’s the good news. As we have done many times before, the rest of us will just have to figure it out, making it up as we go. It’s going to be bumpy, but I remain confident that it’s going to be great.]

OH, FLOYD

NY Daily News: “A leisurely Sunday afternoon hike on a mountain trail outside of Salt Lake City turned into an animal rescue after Floyd, a 3-year-old, 190-pound Mastiff, decided he was too tired to descend and wouldn’t budge. Around 6:30 p.m. as temperatures were dropping, rescuers were called after other hikers stumbled upon Floyd and his owner. Luckily, the all-volunteer Salt Lake County Sheriff’s Office search and rescue team was able strap Floyd into a stretcher and carry the big fella down to the trailhead without further incident. ‘They had no hesitation whatsoever, even when they heard it was a dog,’ Sgt. Melody Gray of the Unified Police Department, which works with the sheriff’s search and rescue team, told CNN. She added the whole operation lasted about four hours.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“What’s so remarkable is that constitutions are highly reactionary documents. The very essence of a constitution is to constrain the enthusiasms of a future that one cannot even see.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) in a column from Krauthammer’s posthumous book, “The Point of It All,” published in the Washington Post on Nov. 29, 2018.

THE CHAOS CAUCUS GETS ITS WAY

If you read this note you certainly have more than a passing interest in politics. In fact, you’re probably one of the people to whom your friends and family turn when it comes to sorting out questions political or governmental.



That's why one of our goals each day is to so equip you. We like it if you’re the smartest political person in the room.



So if they ask you today what in the h-e-double-hockey-sticks is going on, just tell them this: The two most powerful people in the American government – the system conceived by the Founders, purchased and defended with the lives of more than a million men at arms – is the specific insult the president used toward the speaker of the house.



Hoo-boy…



President Trump said that he called Nancy Pelosi a “third-grade politician.” Pelosi and others at the brief, useless meeting on the ongoing debacle in Syria say that Trump called her a “third-rate politician.”



We will not waste your time or test your credulity by talking about how unworthy this is of our republic or of the armed forces the two were supposedly meeting to discuss, or any of that “School House Rock” goody-goody stuff. It’s 2019. We get it.



But ask yourselves what comes next.



On the 1,000th day of Trump’s presidency we find a city and a system unraveled. If we take the long view we can observe that this is, in fact, what Americans voted for in 2016. Trump promised to bring combative, disruptive partisan warfare to levels unseen even during recent low points like the Clinton impeachment and the Iraq War.



Trump has delivered on his promise to disrupt, a promise he made to core supporters starting in June 2015. One of the reasons that his devotees are attached to him in a way that sometimes border on the religious is because he has kept faith with these voters every day of his presidency. Trump likes to boast that he is a builder, but his base hired him for a demolition job.



To win the presidency, though, Trump relied on the support of voters who felt differently – a bloc at least as large as his core followership. The mandate from these voters was not to turn Washington into an apocalyptic hellscape of turgid partisanship but rather just not be Hillary Clinton.



We imagine that those voters have watched the events of the past two months in some combination of fascination, shock, amusement and horror. The cause of such consternation is pretty simple: There is very little left in Trump’s administration that reflects the winning coalition of 2016 between Trump’s populist pitchforkers and the center-right Republican establishment.



Think of it this way – Trump succeeded in an audacious hostile takeover of the Republican Party. But after the establishment was defeated, many members of the old firm stayed on in this new joint venture.



Reince Priebus, Nikki Haley, James Mattis, Rex Tillerson, John Kelly, Kirstjen Nielsen, Jeff Sessions, Tom Price, Elaine Chao, Dan Coats, Mick Mulvaney and Mike Pence all hitched up for the new joint venture between Trump Inc. and the GOP.



It’s down to Mulvaney, Chao and Pence, and if we were Mulvaney we wouldn’t worry about renewing our parking pass for next month.



What that means is that Trump is substantially getting the government he wanted and promised, one in which he is unconstrained by convention, tradition or nearly any rules of the road. He envisioned that as president he could operate in the same way he did as the CEO of his family business.



Of course, as it turns out, he cannot. But he has run out of those individuals who, for the first 900-or-so days, managed to make things run in some kind of orderly way.



Consider the twin snares in which Trump now finds himself bound: Impending impeachment and the foreign policy meltdown in Syria. Both are the result of Trump doing things his way rather than the Washington way.



Any chief of staff worth his salt would have dived in front of that phone call to the Ukrainian president like it was a runaway dump truck. Whether you think Trump acted appropriately or not, he conducted himself in such a way that gave his critics all the ammunition that they needed. One day after Robert Mueller’s testimony snuffed out the already dying embers of impeachment talk in Congress, Trump picked up the phone and started a conflagration.



Any national security adviser in any previous administration would have done everything but swat the phone out of the president’s hand if he was telling Turkey’s strongman president that the U.S. would clear the way for Turkish forces to pummel our Kurdish allies.



Again, you may actually agree with the policy of feeding the Kurds to the Turks, but we are left in a situation where the American Air Force is bombing American military installations to keep them out of the hands of rapidly advancing hostile forces. Those are procedural, not policy problems.



The next 12 months will determine what, if any, legacy Trump will leave behind. Trump re-elected, Trump defeated, Trump impeached but preserved by the Senate and Trump impeached and removed are all real possibilities. And no one will have as much to say about which of those eventualities comes to pass as Trump himself.



His team is in disarray and his administration lurches daily from disaster to disaster. If he does not find a way to change that it won’t matter how bad the Democrats’ nominee is, Trump will never see a second term.



Given the fact that today’s White House press conference was to announce Trump’s decision to host world leaders next year at one of his family’s golf resorts, we get the sense that maybe that reality has not yet taken root in the West Wing.



THE RULEBOOK: FOCUS ON THE POSITIVES

“They have chosen rather to dwell on the inconveniences which must be unavoidably blended with all political advantages; and on the possible abuses which must be incident to every power or trust, of which a beneficial use can be made.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 41



TIME OUT: TIMELESS JULIE ANDREWS

Atlantic: “Home Work, [Julie Andrews] second memoir (this one co-published with her eldest daughter, Emma Walton Hamilton), is an account of what happened between Andrews’s film debut in 1964’s Mary Poppins and her performance in the 1982 movie Victor/Victoria. The motivation for the book, Andrews told [The Atlantic], was twofold. After the 2008 publication of her first memoir, Home, which detailed her difficult childhood and her earliest days as a performer, fans and friends had urged her to dive into the next phase. ‘The first one ended as I was heading to Hollywood,’ she said, ‘so of course everybody said, ‘When, when, when are you going to do the next one?’ Because they wanted to hear all that.’ Home, in other words, ended right before the moment when Andrews took the role that would change her life. The book is a dance between candor and diplomacy, as Andrews navigates the imperative of honesty with the courteousness that seems to be her governing instinct.”

I’LL TELL YOU WHAT: RESTING PETE FACE

This week Dana Perino and Chris Stirewalt give their thoughts on the fourth Democratic Presidential primary debate, the continued controversy between the NBA and China and Dana has fun with Chris's new memoji. Plus, Chris answers some primary trivia. LISTEN AND SUBSCRIBE HERE



OUTPOURING FOR ELIJAH CUMMINGS, LION OF THE HOUSE

Baltimore Sun: “U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings of Baltimore, a committee chairman known for his devotion to Baltimore and civil rights and for blunt and passionate speechmaking, died of longstanding health problems early Thursday morning, his office said. He was 68 years old. The Democrat, a key figure in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump as chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, died at Gilchrist Hospice Care, a Johns Hopkins affiliate, at approximately 2:45 A.M., a spokeswoman said. Cummings, who had been absent from Capitol Hill in recent weeks while under medical attention, had health issues in recent years. In 2017, he underwent an aortic valve replacement. The procedure, which aides described as minimally invasive in Cummings’ case, is used to correct narrowing of the aortic valve in the heart. The surgery led to an infection that kept him in the hospital longer than expected.”



LATE IN THE RACE, DEM FAULT LINES EMERGE

WaPo: “As the party’s fourth debate concluded, the Democratic primary contest opened a more robust and unpredictable clash over the ideological direction of the party, with moderates attempting to ignite the kind of passion that the liberal candidates have harnessed with large crowds and grass-roots donor networks. After months in which the race was largely static amid a crowded, free-ranging field, the nomination fight is showing signs of narrowing its focus to fewer candidates, divided into parallel feuds in the liberal and moderate wings of the party. [Elizabeth] Warren (Mass.) is entering a crucial phase of her campaign, taking attacks from all sides for the first time since she ascended in popularity, and attempting to demonstrate she can withstand the kind of scrutiny that previously fell mostly on [Joe] Biden, who until recently held an unchallenged lead in the polls. Yet as she attempts to coalesce support on the party’s left flank, Warren faces a renewed challenge from liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)… The left’s feud is replicated in the center, where Biden faces challenges from [Pete] Buttigieg, [Amy] Klobuchar and others.”



Biden dismisses Warren as a fellow front-runner - Fox News: “One day after being overshadowed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren at the Democrats’ latest debate, Joe Biden repeatedly criticized the progressive senator from Massachusetts, whose status has risen in recent months, making her a presidential primary front-runner alongside the former vice president. In Columbus, Ohio, Biden questioned Warren’s honesty and pushed back against the media’s labeling of Warren as a ‘co-front-runner.’ ‘I haven’t seen any polling showing that nationally, on average, that anybody else is a front-runner,’ Biden said. ‘You guys keep talking about that.’ Biden did acknowledge, in referencing the latest polls, that ‘Warren has done very well. She’s moved.’”



RNC raises record-setting $27.3 million in September - Fox News: “The Republican National Committee raised a record-setting $27.3 million in September and had $59.2 million cash on hand last month amid the impeachment push against President Trump -- which has fueled GOP campaign contributions heading into the 2020 election. The RNC’s September fundraising haul is the best off-cycle month in the history of both the Republican and Democratic parties. This cycle, to date, the RNC has almost tripled the Democratic National Committee’s fundraising efforts, according to the GOP, which also noted that the Democrats, as of last month, carried $7.3 million in debt. ‘While Democrats focus on fighting President Trump, Republicans have prioritized voters and we have another record-breaking fundraising month—the highest ever off-cycle—to show for it,’ RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told Fox News.”



DEMS FACE TIMING QUESTION WITH IMPEACHMENT

Politico: “Democrats are in an impeachment bind. For the first time, they’re receiving a gusher of evidence to support charges that President Donald Trump abused his power for political and personal gain, pressuring Ukraine’s fledgling government to investigate his political rival Joe Biden. But as more witnesses come forward to spill more secrets, the more Democrats are nervously eyeing the dwindling congressional calendar and wondering: When should we be satisfied with what we have and bring articles of impeachment to the floor? … Some Democrats say the investigation should continue until the evidence is so overwhelming it pries loose a few Republican votes, delivering a symbolic victory as Democrats hold out hope that impeachment isn’t a purely party-line issue. Others believe Democrats should exhaust the list of willing witnesses before drafting formal articles. And still others say the House already has enough evidence to move forward with impeachment immediately — from Trump’s own admission…”



McConnell readies party members for impeachment trial - WaPo: “Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told Republican senators Wednesday to be ready for an impeachment trial of President Trump as soon as Thanksgiving, as the Senate began to brace for a political maelstrom that would engulf the nation. An air of inevitability has taken hold in Congress, with the expectation Trump will become the third president in history to be impeached — and Republicans believe they need to prepare to defend the president. While McConnell briefed senators on what would happen during a Senate trial, House GOP leaders convened what they expect will be regular impeachment strategy sessions. In their closed-door weekly luncheon, McConnell gave a PowerPoint presentation about the impeachment process and fielded questions alongside his staff and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who was a manager for the 1998 impeachment of President Bill Clinton.”



Perry says Trump sent him to Giuliani - Fox News: “Energy Secretary Rick Perry, whose name has been mentioned in connection with President Trump’s Ukraine dealings, said in an interview published late Wednesday that the president told him to seek out Rudy Giuliani earlier this year to look into possible Ukrainian corruption. The Wall Street Journal sat down with Perry for an extensive interview and reported that the spring conversation was a sign of how closely Giuliani — a personal lawyer for Trump — worked on Ukraine policy. Giuliani's business dealings with the country were reportedly looked at by federal investigators. He denied any wrongdoing. ‘Visit with Rudy,’ Perry recalled Trump telling him. He told the paper that Trump was not convinced that Kiev ‘straightened up’ its act. Perry told the paper he never heard Trump or Giuliani talk about an investigation into the Bidens.”



Volker’s testimony revealed more concerns about Giuliani - Axios: “New details from Kurt Volker's closed-door interview indicate Bill Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine, was deeply conflicted about whether to take the job because of concerns about Rudy Giuliani's shadow involvement. Why it matters: The testimony by Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, earlier this month may help the president in the sense that it paints Giuliani, not President Trump, as the mastermind behind a campaign to get foreign leaders to investigate the Biden family and Burisma, according to sources with direct knowledge of his testimony. But it also amplifies concerns that Trump was more interested in what his personal lawyer had to say than the professionals in government. Taylor was also worried that Trump might be willing to trade away Ukraine's interests as part of a grand bargain with Russia, Volker told lawmakers. Taylor is expected to appear before members of Congress next week.”



The Judge’s Ruling: It’s impeachable if the House says it is - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano explains if President Trump right when he says the impeachment inquiry is unfair: “The illegitimacy argument contended that since the House has yet to vote to authorize an investigation of the president, its committees lack subpoena power. This argument contends that since impeachment seeks to overturn a valid election, it is a thinly veiled coup and thus is in violation of the Constitution. And the argument about unfairness states that the president is entitled to due process at every stage of the impeachment proceedings. These are valid political arguments. But as legal offerings, they are profoundly misguided. … Impeachment is always constitutional if it originates in the House and if its basis is arguably for treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” More here.

FLEA MARKET CHEESE? REALLY?

Fresno [Calif.] Bee: “Lemoore [Calif.] police are investigating the theft of $50,000 in cheese in a crime that is believed to reach back to 2017. The investigation, launched in late August, centers around products from Leprino Foods Plant in the 300 block of Belle Haven Drive in the South Valley city. A police spokeswoman said multiple subjects have been linked to the thefts and the cheese has been sold from Fresno to Riverside counties: door-to-door, on the street, at flea markets and on social media sites. After serving warrants, detectives recovered a large amount of cheese and arrested Jairo Mariano Osorio Alvarez, 24, and Roderick Domingo Ransom, 34, both of Lemoore.”

""I haven’t seen a lot of data that suggest that there’s a negative impact,"" Zuckerberg answered during the sit-down, which airs in full Friday on ""The Daily Briefing.""

He argued that many conservative media platforms perform ""quite well"" on Facebook and other sites, pointing out that California is overwhelmingly liberal and he understands why there are suspicions.

""California is an overwhelmingly left-leaning place. If you look at the political donations from the tech companies, it’s 90-plus percent of them go towards Democratic candidates, so I understand why people would ask the question of 'are my ideas getting a fair shake.' And all that I can say on this is this is something I care deeply about. I want to make sure we can be a platform for all ideas,"" he said.

Earlier in the interview, Perino asked Zuckerberg about Sen. Kamala Harris' demand that Twitter shut down President Trump's account, which he uses regularly to share his views on a multitude of issues.

Zuckerberg said Silicon Valley shouldn't be taking such actions.

""I generally believe that as a principle, people should decide what is credible and what they want to believe, who they want to vote for,"" he said. ""And I don’t think that should be something that we want tech companies or any kind of company doing.""

Earlier this month, Harris, D-Calif., claimed Trump was using Twitter to inappropriately criticize an intelligence community whistleblower who filed a complaint regarding the president's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky.

A few months back, the Menlo Park, Calif. firm conducted a yearlong audit in consultation with 133 conservative organizations or politicians. The audit, led by former Republican Sen. Jon Kyl, found that interviewees had concerns about Facebook's content distribution and algorithms, content policies and enforcement, ad policies and ad enforcement, and workplace viewpoint diversity.

It concluded the company needs to do ""significant work"" to satisfy the concerns of conservatives over alleged bias, though it prompted a backlash from conservatives and liberals alike.

""Merely asking somebody to listen to conservatives' concerns isn't an 'audit,' it's a smokescreen disguised as a solution,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., in August, calling on Facebook to conduct a third-party audit.

Hawley said last month Zuckerberg was ""stunned"" when he demanded in a face-to-face meeting on Capitol Hill that Facebook ""open up"" their books and make employees available for interviews.

Turkey-Syria cease-fire in question after reported fighting, shelling

Just hours after President Trump announced a cease-fire between Turkish and Kurdish-led forces in Syria, journalists have reported continued fighting in the Syrian town of Ras al-Ayn on Friday morning, while other areas have reported relative calm since the agreement.

Journalists from the Associated Press reported witnessing shelling and said they could see smoke billowing around the town, which sits along the border with Turkey. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, reported intermittent clashes in Ras al-Ayn, but calm elsewhere. Reuters also reported machine-gun fire and shelling that could be heard from a border town in Turkey near Ra al-Ayn.

On Thursday Trump declared it ""a great day for civilization"" after Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, following a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara, announced terms of a cease-fire agreement that intended to end the violence between Turkey and the Kurds. At a Dallas campaign rally, he likened the Turkish offensive against the Syrian Kurds to a schoolyard fight and credited his ""unconventional"" approach for enabling the truce.

The deal was for a 120-hour cease-fire, during which time the Kurdish-led forces could pull back from the roughly 20-mile-wide safe zone on the Turkish-Syrian border. All Turkish military operations under the recent offensive known as Operation Peace Spring are to pause during that time, with the operation coming to an end upon completion of the Kurdish withdrawal, under terms of the deal.

Some U.S. military sources told Fox News they were skeptical of the cease-fire deal. Click here to read more on our top story.

Trump labels Pelosi ‘crazy,’ O'Rourke ‘dumb,’ as he slams Dems at Dallas rally

President Trump slammed Democrats as unpatriotic and referred to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as ""Crazy Nancy"" while giving an extended critique of his potential 2020 opponents before a large and friendly rally crowd in Dallas Thursday night. The “Keep America Great” event came just hours after Energy Secretary and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry announced he would soon step aside amid scrutiny from House Democrats conducting an impeachment inquiry -- and a week after chaos and violence broke out at a Trump event in Democratic-leaning Minnesota.

Outside the rally, some 30,000 Trump supporters watched the speech on a large screen, as the president blasted 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. He derided former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas as ""very dumb"" for pushing to confiscate guns and tax religious institutions, and said Joe Biden's family overtly profited from the former vice president’s political career. He also denounced Pelosi a day after she and other top Democrats walked out of a White House meeting, telling the crowd, ""She's nuts."" Click more on this story.

Mulvaney comments seized on by critics saying it's proof of Ukraine quid pro quo

Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney says his comments about the Trump administration's decision to hold up military aid to Ukraine have been misinterpreted after he initially seemed to contradict President Trump’s claim that there was no “quid pro quo” during his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky.

At a briefing at the White House on Thursday, Mulvaney told reporters that the release of $400 million in military aid to Ukraine was tied to the administration’s demands that Kiev investigate purported corruption by the Democrats during the 2016 presidential election campaign. Trump also mentioned to him that the corruption was related to the DNC server and ""that’s why we held up the money,"" Mulvaney said.

In a statement later Thursday, Mulvaney declared there was “absolutely no quid pro quo” between aid and any investigations. “There was never any condition on the flow of aid related to the matter of the DNC server,” he said.

China's economic growth sinks to a 26-year low

China's economy took another hit last quarter as the tariff war with the United States continued to take its toll. Its economic growth decelerated to a 26-year low in the latest quarter, adding to a deepening slump that is weighing on global growth. The world's second-largest economy expanded by 6 percent in the three months ending in September, down from the previous quarter's 6.2 percent, data showed Friday. The slump increases pressure on Chinese leaders to avert politically dangerous job losses as they fight a tariff war with President Trump over Beijing's trade surplus and technology ambitions.

A harshly worded letter that was obtained by Fox News calls on parent company, Comcast's, board of directors to “override NBC’s decision and launch a full investigation of sexual misconduct within the news division,” allowed current and former staffers to speak out despite non-disclosure agreements and have an in-person meeting with sexual harassment victims and advocacy leaders.

WOMEN’S GROUP CALLS FOR DEMS TO PULL MSNBC DEBATE AMID ‘CULTURE OF SEXUAL ABUSE’ AT NBC NEWS

Megyn Kelly, Addie Zinone, Linda Vester, Greta Van Susteren, Eleanor McManus and Gretchen Carlson signed the letter that is addressed to Comcast CEO Brian Roberts and the company’s board.

Ronan Farrow’s book, “Catch and Kill,” details claims that NBC News refused to expose movie mogul Harvey Weinstein as a sexual predator and wasn’t truthful regarding knowledge of alleged sexual misconduct by former “Today” co-host Matt Lauer.

“These were not isolated incidents. His years of predatory behavior toward female colleagues was tolerated by executives with the same attitudes toward women – some were even predators themselves,” the letter states.

NBC NEWS BOSS ANDY LACK TAKES AIM AT FARROW'S CLAIMS HE WAS BLOCKED FROM REPORTING ON ALLEGED WEINSTEIN CRIMES

“Certain network executives have enabled a corporate culture of widespread sexual harassment and abuse, and are still trying to cover it up today,” the letter said. “Comcast must prove to its shareholders that it will pursue the truth on behalf of NBC staffers. If necessary, it should remove executives who have abused or silenced women.”

The letter specifically calls out NBC News chairman Andy Lack and his top deputy, Noah Oppenheim, along with MSNBC president Phil Griffin.

“Are these the men you want running a news network news reliant on the FCC for license renewal?” the letter asked.

NBC NEWS BOSS ANDY LACK’S LEADERSHIP SCRUTINIZED AS RONAN FARROW TELL-ALL APPROACHES

Oppenheim, the president of NBC News, has downplayed Farrow’s reporting, but the book’s release has put the scandal back in the national spotlight, adding pressure to NBCUniversal and its parent company Comcast.

Hilary Smith, NBCUniversal senior vice president of communications, recently told NPR that “top leaders of NBC News still have the confidence of senior leadership within the company.” Smith also told The Hollywood Reporter that a new investigation

After the Weinstein and Lauer bombshells were reported in 2017, NBC refused to hire an outside investigator to determine who knew about Lauer’s sexual misconduct and whether NBC executives looked the other way. NBC relied on in-house general counsel Kim Harris despite widespread calls for an outside law firm to conduct the review.

NBC’s internal review eventually declared that management was completely oblivious to Lauer’s behavior and Harris’ colleagues were cleared by the network.

""There is no additional investigation being launched. We are very confident in the report that was conducted,” Smith told THR. ""We fired Matt Lauer within 24 hours of learning what he did, and promptly launched a corporate investigation. Based on our investigative findings, we have swiftly taken appropriate actions to address the situation and improve workplace culture. It is also worth noting that this was a corporate investigation that was conducted by an almost entirely female team, none of whom are part of the News division.""

BUTTIGIEG, KLOBUCHAR GET BIG POST-DEBATE BOOST

Fox News: “Sen. Amy Klobuchar – giddy after a lack of sleep and rave reviews for her debate performance – touted to the jam-packed crowd inside a café in New Hampshire’s capital city that she raised $1.1 million in the 24 hours after Tuesday’s Democratic presidential nomination showdown. The haul was nearly a quarter of what she brought in during the entire July-September third quarter of fundraising. Highlighting that most of the money was from small-dollar contributions, the Minnesota Democrat told reporters ‘that shows something happened, that people were watching and they responded. And that is a very big deal for us.’ As Klobuchar spotlighted her post-debate haul, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who also excelled during the showdown, reported bringing in $1.1 million in the same 24-hours following the debate. His campaign touted that Wednesday was ‘one of our biggest fundraising days yet.’”



Buttigieg draws heat from black activists over fundraiser - AP: “Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg is scheduled to attend a Chicago fundraiser that will be co-hosted by a former city attorney who vigorously tried to block the release of a video depicting the shooting of Laquan McDonald , a black teenager whose death at the hands of police stirred months of protest and resulted in an officer’s conviction. Steve Patton, who led Chicago’s law department under former Mayor Rahm Emanuel, is listed as a sponsor of the Friday event, according to an invitation obtained by The Associated Press. For months, Buttigieg has faced criticism over his own handling of race as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, a racially divided city where decades of simmering racial tension erupted this summer when a white police officer shot and killed an African American man. … ‘He should adjust his schedule,’ said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, when asked about the fundraiser.”



Analysis finds Warren $30 trillion short on single-payer plan - Bloomberg: “Elizabeth Warren took a lot of flak at this week’s Democratic presidential debate for being evasive about the taxes needed to pay for the $30 trillion Medicare for All plan she champions. There’s a reason for being vague: Her team hasn’t yet figured out how to pay for it. ‘Her taxes as they currently exist are not enough yet to cover fully replacing health insurance,’ University of California, Berkeley economics professor Emmanuel Saez, who advised the Warren campaign… Warren -- who campaigns on the theme that she has a plan for everything -- is relying on the wealthy and big corporations to pay for her vision of restructuring American society, including funding student debt, free college, universal childcare, green energy and affordable housing plans. … But she has made the strategic decision to adopt Bernie Sanders’ government-run health care plan rather than develop one of her own. … The Warren campaign said they are continuing to review revenue options to fund Medicare for All…”



Tim Alberta: Watching the Dem debate with Michael Bennet - Politico: “The instincts that guide [Michael] Bennet—being pragmatic, deliberative, restrained—are what many Americans say are precisely what’s needed to run the White House. But now, perhaps more than ever, those instincts are the opposite of what’s needed to win the White House. Once upon a time, there was a limited return on investing in outrage and demagoguery; statesmen were in high demand no matter the supply. That’s no longer the case, and not simply because a celebrity showman named Donald Trump is president of the United States. The painful reality of this political moment slides over Bennet like a barbed-wire blanket as he flops onto the couch and kicks off his faded brown dress shoes, preparing for a three-hour reality-television show that will help determine who leads the free world. All the more irksome to Bennet is the fact that five of his fellow senators are staring back at him from beneath the bright lights; he is the only member of the ‘world’s greatest deliberative body’ seeking a promotion who is excluded from the festivities.”



David Brooks: If it’s Trump vs. Warren, then what? - WaPo: “This is a memo for the politically homeless. It’s a memo to those of us who could never support Donald Trump but think the Bernie-Squad-Warren Democratic Party is sprinting too far left. It’s a memo built around the following question: If the general election campaign turns out to be Trump vs. Warren, what the heck are we supposed to do? The first thing we could do, of course, is pray for a miracle. Maybe the Democrats will nominate one of the five B’s or the K: Biden, Buttigieg, Booker, Bennet, Bullock or Klobuchar. These candidates are pluralists, not purists. … And yet, if it comes to Trump vs. Warren in a general election, the only plausible choice is to support Warren. Over the past month Donald Trump has given us fresh reminders of the unique and exceptional ways he corrupts American life. … Politics is downstream from morality and culture. Warren represents a policy wrong turn, in my view, but policies can be argued about and reversed.”



THE RULEBOOK: BUT STILL PROBLEMATIC

TIME OUT: LE EWW, LE GROSS

AFP: “The Paris zoo's latest attraction is a brainless, eyeless, single-celled organism with no limbs or stomach but more than 700 genders. Meet the ‘blob’, also known by its scientific name Physarum polycephalum or ‘many-headed slime.’ Preceding humans on Earth by some 500 million years, the creature resembles a kind of slippery sponge. It appears stationary, but does cover ground – at a leisurely pace of up to [0.4 inches] per hour – in search of prey, such as mushroom spores, bacteria, and other microbes. From Saturday, members of the public can become better acquainted with ‘le blob’, which has taken up residence in a large tank at the zoo in Paris' Bois de Vincennes park. Named after the 1958 sci-fi horror movie ‘The Blob’ about an alien creature that crashes to Earth and devours residents of Pennsylvania, the real-life blob consists of a single cell, sometimes with many nuclei that can replicate their DNA and divide.”

MULVANEY INCREASES WHITE HOUSE MISERY INDEX

WaPo: “For 39 minutes Thursday, White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney turned the press briefing room into a sort of confession chamber, openly admitting to several acts that could deepen the legal predicament for the president. [Donald] Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry into whether he has abused his office for personal and political gain. … In admitting that Trump had personally intervened to award a multimillion-dollar summit to his own company, and that the president had also used taxpayer money as leverage to push a Ukrainian investigation into Democrats, Mulvaney embraced a classic Trumpian tactic: saying the quiet — and potentially illegal — part out loud. But that strategy with regard to Ukraine came in for withering criticism after Mulvaney’s appearance, and he later tried to walk back his comments. In a statement late Thursday, Mulvaney denied the quid pro quo he had previously defended as appropriate and normal.”



State Department official: Obama administration ignored Biden warnings - Fox News: “A State Department official focused on Ukraine policy told Congress this week he raised concerns about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas firm in 2015, but was rebuffed by former Vice President Joe Biden’s staff, Fox News has confirmed. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, who testified behind closed doors before committees spearheading the formal House impeachment inquiry, told congressional investigators that he had qualms about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings. … A congressional source confirmed to Fox News on Friday that Kent testified that when he brought his concerns to the office of the vice president in 2016, his staff ‘blew him off’ and ignored the issue involving the younger Biden's role at the firm.”



Support steady for impeachment probe - Pew Research Center: “The new survey by Pew Research Center … finds that 54% currently approve of the House’s decision to conduct an impeachment inquiry, while 44% disapprove. Neither party engenders a great deal of confidence that they will be ‘fair and reasonable’ during the impeachment inquiry, the survey finds. About four-in-ten (43%) expect that the Republicans in Congress will be fair in handling the inquiry, while slightly more (47%) say the same about the Democrats in Congress. The survey, conducted on Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel, enables us to examine opinions about impeachment among the same group of respondents over the past month.”



Rick Perry announces year-end departure amid increasing scrutiny - NPR: “Secretary of Energy Rick Perry plans to leave his position at the end of the year, President Trump confirmed to reporters Thursday in Fort Worth, Texas. Trump praised Perry and said he already has a replacement in mind. ‘Rick has done a fantastic job,’ Trump said. ‘But it was time.’ Trump said that Perry's resignation didn't come as a surprise and that he has considered leaving for six months because ‘he's got some very big plans.’ Perry, 69, is one of Trump's original Cabinet members and recently has emerged as a central figure in the impeachment inquiry of Trump. Perry was part of what was dubbed ‘the three amigos’ — in addition to Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union, and Kurt Volker, former envoy to Ukraine — charged with managing the U.S.-Ukraine relationship after the White House removed the core of its Ukraine policy team last spring.”



DEMS BUILD CASH CASTELLATION AROUND HOUSE MAJORITY

Politico: “Democrats are building a financial bulwark around their House majority that’s going to be tough for Republicans to breach in 2020. Thirty-three of the 44 most vulnerable House Democrats have stashed an impressive $1 million or more in the bank well before the election year even begins. And their fundraising pace is not slowing down as they gear up to defend the chamber. Federal Election Commission reports filed this week illustrate Democrats’ formidable advantage: The 44 Democrats in the most competitive seats banked a collective $59 million so far. Nearly 30 raised $500,000 or more in the third quarter, according to a POLITICO analysis of the fundraising filings. And all but six of the so-called ‘frontliners’ have at least half a million more banked than their challengers, if they have any challenger at all. … The GOP is struggling to adapt to a changing landscape; They can no longer dismiss the strong fundraising as an anomaly when it has remained steady throughout the first three quarters of 2019.”



Can anyone beat AOC? - NYT: “It is hard to imagine a scenario where Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez loses her seat next year. She has raised more than $3.4 million, is better known than some presidential candidates and handily won a district that is among the bluest in the nation. But that hasn’t stopped people — lots of them — from trying to unseat her. So far, eight Republicans and three Democrats have filed to run for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s seat in the Bronx and Queens. Two of the Republicans have each raised more than $420,000, even though no Republican has represented the Bronx in Congress in at least 50 years. … The campaigns also highlight a broader strategy by the Republican Party: turning voters’ resentment toward Ms. Ocasio-Cortez into a conduit for the party’s other electoral goals.”



POLL SHOWS GARDNER TRAILING HICKENLOOPER

KMGH: “New Colorado polling released Thursday shows that John Hickenlooper leads Sen. Cory Gardner in a theoretical Senate matchup next year by 11 percentage points and that a majority of Coloradans support the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. The Keating Research-OnSight Public Affairs-Martin Campaigns (KOM) survey released Thursday afternoon was conducted by the Democratic pollsters Oct. 10-14 and polled 500 active statewide voters who cast ballots in 2016, 2017 or 2018 or signed up to vote since last November. The poll was weighted to be in line with voter turnout demographics and the margin of error was ±4.4% and was paid for by KOM.”



Former Republican launches Kansas Senate bid as a Democrat - The Wichita [Kan.] Eagle: “A Kansas lawmaker who left the Republican Party last year now hopes to become the first Kansas Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate in decades. State Sen. Barbara Bollier launched her campaign for U.S. Senate on Wednesday by promising an independent approach. She condemned dysfunction in Washington as she seeks to replace retiring Republican Sen. Pat Roberts. … Bollier, of Mission Hills in Johnson County, is the fourth Democrat in the race and the ninth candidate overall – joining a sprawling field that includes Republicans Rep. Roger Marshall and former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. In the Democratic contest, she will have to overcome serious campaigns by former federal prosecutor Barry Grissom and Manhattan Mayor Pro Tem Usha Reddi.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“A small, but important correction. It is not the American Air Force at work in Syria. It is either the American air force or it is the United States Air Force/U.S. Air Force, from which I am retired with 21 years of service. The same goes for the American army or the American navy. I agree with capitalizing proper names, but prefer that it be done properly. I'm a faithful reader, an independent politically, and I appreciate your non-partisan approach. Sometimes it feels as though we who prefer listening, thinking and discussing rationally are but drowning voices in a maelstrom of partisan fury. The Halftime Report is one of the very few media outlets that I feel I can trust to report accurately and to make projections which are supported reasonably. Thank you for the time and effort you and your team put into keeping us informed.” – Dave Riley, Kasilof, Alaska



[Ed. note: Good point, Mr. Riley! Certainly no disrespect intended. I was swerving from overuse of U.S. and ran off the other side of the road. Thank you so much for your kind words, readership and, most of all, your service.]



“Chris, I hope the new Syrian ceasefire lasts longer than your pledge to remain neutral about Trump in your Halftime Report.” – Scott Lyddon, Savannah, Ga.



[Ed. note: I’ve got to give it to you, Mr. Lyddon. That was pretty good! And since the cease fire seems to have ended before it really began, you may be now doubly right from your own perspective. I would remind you though that the goal here isn’t to be “neutral,” but rather to be useful. Fair analysis will necessarily include criticism. If there were no criticism – true neutrality – we would lose the capacity to render necessary judgments. My promise to you, however, is that I do not and will not make judgement about ideological rights and wrongs. As we wrote Thursday, we hold harmless those who either support or oppose the president’s policies in Syria. The same goes for the competing opinions about whether the president should be removed from office for leaning on the Ukrainians to investigate his political foes. Both positions are defensible and substantially irrelevant to my work. Our point Thursday was that however you feel about the policies, Trump’s chaotic governance and indiscipline is creating political liabilities. This week has been a brutal one for the administration, most of it needlessly so. I hope, whatever resentments you may hold for my rejection of neutrality, you still find the analysis useful.]



“As much as I admire moderation in the body politic, it seems that we are rapidly approaching a choice for those of us with (R) on our voting status. I find much of the President's language and combative behavior appalling, however he is generally consistent with my views on policy. But I am APPALLED by the full throated embrace of Socialism that is occurring on the other ‘side of the aisle.’ If we ‘moderate conservatives’ sit this one out (as probably occurred with the evangelical Christians in 2012), I believe the result could be an upheaval of our American way of life, facilitated by the most massive transfer of wealth in history.” – Patsy Fields, Aliso Viejo, Calif.



[Ed. note: Well, I’ve got good news and bad news for you, Ms. Fields. The bad news is that we are indeed already in the midst of an upheaval of American life. The changes we’re seeing in how we live, work, play, worship, mate, learn and communicate are massive in scope. You would have to go back a century or more to find a moment that even comes close to the enormous societal and, consequently, political change that has wracked American society over the past 20 years. No matter how you vote, that toothpaste isn’t going back in the tube. Neither party nor any politician has the answer for dealing with all of these changes. The far left believes economic collectivism based on an ambition for social justice is the answer, while the far right champions a sort of cultural collectivism supported by economic nationalism in which the government works to engineer a new American culture to its supporters liking. Both will probably fail to achieve their highest aims. And that’s the good news. As we have done many times before, the rest of us will just have to figure it out, making it up as we go. It’s going to be bumpy, but I remain confident that it’s going to be great.]

OH, FLOYD

NY Daily News: “A leisurely Sunday afternoon hike on a mountain trail outside of Salt Lake City turned into an animal rescue after Floyd, a 3-year-old, 190-pound Mastiff, decided he was too tired to descend and wouldn’t budge. Around 6:30 p.m. as temperatures were dropping, rescuers were called after other hikers stumbled upon Floyd and his owner. Luckily, the all-volunteer Salt Lake County Sheriff’s Office search and rescue team was able strap Floyd into a stretcher and carry the big fella down to the trailhead without further incident. ‘They had no hesitation whatsoever, even when they heard it was a dog,’ Sgt. Melody Gray of the Unified Police Department, which works with the sheriff’s search and rescue team, told CNN. She added the whole operation lasted about four hours.”

“What’s so remarkable is that constitutions are highly reactionary documents. The very essence of a constitution is to constrain the enthusiasms of a future that one cannot even see.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) in a column from Krauthammer’s posthumous book, “The Point of It All,” published in the Washington Post on Nov. 29, 2018.

The 37-year old mayor – the youngest candidate in the White House race -- stands at 13 percent in a Suffolk University/USA Today poll of likely Iowa caucus-goers released Monday. Biden, at 18 percent, and Warren, at 17 percent, were tied for the top spot in the survey.

WALLACE CHALLENGES BUTTIGIEG ON 'FOX NEWS SUNDAY'

Buttigieg -- who served in the U.S. Naval Reserve in the Afghanistan War and would be the nation’s first openly gay president if elected -- was up seven percentage points since the previous Suffolk University/USA Today poll in Iowa, in June.

The new poll was conducted Wednesday through Friday, entirely after last Tuesday’s fourth round Democratic presidential nomination debate. Political pundits gave a more aggressive Buttigieg high marks for taking on Warren over how she’d pay for her Medicare-for-all health care plan, targeting Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii over her anti-interventionist stance, and clashing with former Rep. Beto O’Rourke over his mandatory gun buy back proposal.

Buttigieg was followed in the poll by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who stood at 9 percent.

""Iowa is unquestionably up for grabs,"" Suffolk Political Research Center director David Paleologos said.

Paleologos added that Buttigieg ""has found a lane and is accelerating toward the front of the pack, surpassing Bernie Sanders. All of this is happening while the number of undecided voters continues to grow as Democratic caucusgoers pause to reevaluate the changing field.""

TUCKER CARLSON: POLS WHO USE KIDS TO GAIN POWER MAY BE A GREATER 'EXISTENTIAL THREAT' THAN CLIMATE CHANGE?

As part of their required Federal Election Commission quarterly filings, the candidates disclosed how their finances and each campaign have been spending a lot of money on private jet travel. After all, how else does one get from Iowa to New Hampshire? In coach? Taking off shoes at TSA? With campaign donations picking up the tab, private jets make the campaign trail much better.

For a collective group of Democrats who decry fossil fuels, who embrace the radical Green New Deal, who demand we change our habits and diets to reflect the “existential crisis” of climate change, they sure don’t put their campaign money with their mouth is.

Every one of the 2020 candidates supports the Green New Deal (GND) as part of their campaign, and as a reminder, this radical, socialist proposal of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez seeks to make air travel ""obsolete."" Air travel is such a no-no amongst environmentalists that ""flight shaming"" has become a common tactic the green radicals use.

So, why do these candidates get a pass? If they want us to stop flying commercial, why are they justified in flying private?

The Buttigieg campaign said it needs private jets because South Bend isn't convenient to campaign stops and the mayor has a vigorous schedule. Here’s a question for Mayor Pete: If I live in rural America and am busy, can I get an exemption under the Green New Deal you support?

We all know the answer to that question, plebeian.

Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., say their flights are actually ""carbon neutral"" because they buy carbon offsets, presumably with campaign contributions. That's like justifying a cheesecake for dinner by purchasing my neighbor a treadmill. For his dog. And the treadmill company donates to my campaign. Yet, in the silly and slimy world of D.C. politics and sympathetic press, somehow that excuse evens out.

All these candidates are too cowardly to admit what we all know: They travel on private jets because they can. Playing us for fools just adds insult to injury.

Their private air travel is possible for one reason, and one reason alone: America is great. Right now, there are millions of Americans in rural places like Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, and Artesia, New Mexico, working in the energy industry. These are the men and women who power America doing hard, difficult, even dangerous work, and we all benefit from the fruit of their labor.

We have an incredible amount of oil and gas reserves across this nation, and many are still yet untapped. Our abundant energy means prices are low. A decade ago, oil consistently hovered around $100 a barrel. Today, it is half that. This means cheaper gas and home utility bills. Information technology is reflected in the manufacturing and shipping costs of consumer goods. Abundant energy means we spend less. This is something we should celebrate.

What happens when the Green New Deal does make air travel ""obsolete"" and the 10 million American jobs in the airline industry are lost? What happens when Sanders gets his wish to make fracking illegal by executive order and consequently half our oil and two-thirds our gas comes off the market?

I’ll tell you what happens: You won't fly home for Christmas. You won't buy fruit in winter. Cold weather and athletic clothing with lycra and Core-Tex and nylon won’t be affordable. Food prices will skyrocket. Shipping costs will make European goods unaffordable, and speaking of Europe, forget about going. You can't afford it, because with oil around $200 a barrel, even a cruise is out of the question.

What happens when politicians destroy the fossil fuel industry is, they destroy the economy and our way of life.

Next time you see a candidate in a stump speech decrying climate change, demanding a Green New Deal, even calling energy industry workers ""Criminals,"" just ask a simple question: Will you, candidate, stop using these fossil fuels, the cheap gas, the plastics, the oil, the private jets, in your campaign?

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

We all know the answer to that, plebeian.

Any candidate who does not live in his private life what he wants government to mandate you live in yours is not worthy of your vote to elected office. And none of these hypocrites is worthy to be your president.

Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who was initially seen as a long-shot presidential contender, has surged within striking distance of former vice president Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses, a Suffolk University/USA TODAY Poll finds. … The poll, taken Wednesday through Friday, put Biden at 18%, Warren at 17% and Buttigieg at 13% among 500 likely Democratic caucusgoers. Those standings reflect significant changes since the Suffolk/USA TODAY poll taken in Iowa at the end of June, when Biden led Warren by double digits and Buttigieg trailed at a distant 6%. California Sen. Kamala Harris, who was then in second place after a strong showing in the first Democratic debate, has plummeted 13 percentage points and is now in a three-way tie for sixth. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders earned 9% support, the same number as in the June poll.”



Buttigieg, Klobuchar try to capitalize - Politico: “Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar shot out of the last Democratic debate with the most precious commodity a presidential candidate can get before the Iowa caucuses: momentum. … The new round of attention for both Midwesterners comes at a key moment: Klobuchar has yet to qualify for the November debate stage, while Buttigieg faced new questions about his campaign’s attention to racial issues. And both of them still have significant ground to make up in the polls. … Based on money and staff footprint, Buttigieg is better positioned: He ended September with $23.4 million in his campaign account — third in the Democratic field — while Klobuchar has $3.7 million to spend. She’s only reached 3 percent in one early-state poll, and she needs three more to qualify for the November debate. On the ground in Iowa, Buttigieg’s staff is about double the size of Klobuchar’s. Both candidates are currently airing TV ads in Iowa.”



Are Dems ready for a Midwest moment? - LAT: “Both long shots are now trying — with swings through early-voting states, new ads and endorsements, and intensified fundraising efforts — to keep their post-debate sizzle hot and find an opening in the contest that has been shaping up as a showdown between Biden and Warren. In the process, they are surfacing a long-simmering debate about the dominance of the party’s liberal wing on the East and West coasts — making a more pointed case than Biden, whose campaign pitch builds on his experience more than ideology. ‘It’s the Midwest versus the rest of the country,’ said Rufus Gifford, who was finance director of President Obama’s reelection campaign in 2012 and is uncommitted in the 2020 race. ‘Both Pete and Amy really focused on the fact that this is the part of the country we need to win, and we are losing.’”



Klobuchar says she’s peaking at the right time - WaPo: “Klobuchar, who struggled for attention in the Democratic primary, says this week's debate helped her catch on at exactly the right time. Her town halls are crowded, with staffers running to get more chairs to pack breweries or event centers. She leads the field in local endorsements, especially state legislators, ‘with more to come,’ she says. She kicked off her bus tour with the support of Andy McKean, a Republican state legislator who bolted his party six months ago and who pronounced Klobuchar the kind of Democrat who could unite America again. ‘If you want to peak in this race,’ she said after a stop in Waterloo, ‘you want to peak now, instead of six months before [the caucuses].’ A few other candidates still draw larger crowds, but Klobuchar is going for a particular kind of caucus-goer: the loyal Democrat who wants to win back those mysterious Trump voters.”



Zuckerberg gave hiring recommendations to Buttigieg campaign - Bloomberg: “Facebook Inc. chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg has privately recommended several potential hires to Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign, a rare example of direct political involvement from one of tech’s most powerful executives. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg sent multiple emails to Mike Schmuhl, Buttigieg’s campaign manager, with names of individuals that he might consider hiring, campaign spokesman Chris Meagher confirmed. Priscilla Chan, Zuckerberg’s wife, also sent multiple emails to Schmuhl with staff recommendations. Ultimately, two of the people recommended were hired.”



WARREN SCRAMBLES ON HEALTH INSURANCE

Fox News: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Sunday that in the upcoming weeks she would detail how to pay for her proposal for a government-run ‘Medicare-for-all’ plan. The Massachusetts Democrat and White House candidate said at a town hall in Indianola, Iowa: ‘What I see … is that we need to talk about the cost, and I plan over the next few weeks to put out a plan that talks about specifically the cost of ‘Medicare-for-all,’ and specifically how we pay for it.’ Estimates place the 10-year cost of the ‘Medicare-for-all’ plans at $32-34 trillion. She added about the universal health insurance plan: ‘This is something I’ve been working on for months and months, and it’s got just a little more work until it’s finished.’”



Gabbard uses Hillary in bid for relevancy - Fox News: “Speaking directly to the camera in a video message posted on social media on Sunday, 2020 presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard suggested that Hillary Clinton recently ‘smeared’ her as a ‘Russian asset’ as payback for Gabbard's defiance of the party establishment in 2016. … [In the video Gabbard said,] ‘If you stand up to Hillary and the party power brokers -- if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message. But, here is the truth: They will not intimidate us. They will not silence us.’ … Several candidates, including Beto O'Rourke, Andrew Yang and Marianne Williamson, have criticized Clinton's unfounded suggestion that Russians have been ‘grooming’ Gabbard to be a third-party spoiler in the race.”

TIME OUT: FROM WAY BACK WHEN

AP: “A crew of deep-sea explorers and historians looking for lost World War II warships have found a second Japanese aircraft carrier that went down in the historic Battle of Midway. Vulcan Inc.’s director of undersea operations Rob Kraft and Naval History and Heritage Command historian Frank Thompson reviewed high frequency sonar images of the warship Sunday and say that its dimensions and location mean it has to be the carrier Akagi. The Akagi was found in the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument resting in nearly 18,000 feet (5,490 meters) of water more than 1,300 miles (2,090 kilometers) northwest of Pearl Harbor. The researchers used an autonomous underwater vehicle, or AUV, equipped with sonar to find the ship. The vehicle had been out overnight collecting data, and the image of a warship appeared in the first set of readings Sunday morning.”

MULVANEY AGONISTES

Politico: “Mick Mulvaney’s week went from bad to worse on Sunday, as he again tried to explain why President Donald Trump and the administration had withheld aid to Ukraine for weeks — one of Democrats’ central questions in their impeachment inquiry. Mulvaney fumbled during an interview on ‘Fox News Sunday’ when he cited two reasons for the delay, whereas he had listed three during his Thursday news briefing at the White House. He continued to blame reporters for any misunderstanding, a feat that can be tough to pull off when his answers were all delivered on camera and when the host, Chris Wallace, let the tape keep rolling. And he threw red meat to liberals and Democratic presidential candidates who have long questioned the appropriateness of the Trump family continuing to profit from their business holdings while Trump serves as president. … Mulvaney’s interview did not play well among Trump allies and advisers, with one calling it a ‘self-immolation.’”



Party support for Trump gets tested - WSJ: “President Trump faces increasing public and private scrutiny from his own party over a series of recent White House moves, as the House impeachment inquiry reduces his margin for error with fellow Republicans and makes him more vulnerable to attacks. In the past several days, Mr. Trump has been forced to drop plans to host next year’s Group of Seven summit at his Doral golf resort, and a top aide has tried to walk back comments linking Ukraine military aid to an investigation of the president’s political opponents. The fallout of Mr. Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria has continued to draw widespread criticism, including from Republicans. Mr. Trump’s support within his party will face fresh tests this week, as key witnesses from the State Department and Pentagon are expected to testify in closed hearings before a trio of House committees on the president’s dealings with Ukraine.”



Continetti: Trump fatigue syndrome - National Review: “I was surprised to read Robert J. Samuelson’s column in the Washington Post arguing for the impeachment and removal of President Trump. Samuelson is, above all, a realist who has looked on economics and politics with a tough and somewhat cynical eye for some 30 years. … Samuelson has reached his breaking point. And he isn’t alone. A large part of the country suffers from Trump Fatigue Syndrome. This is related but not identical to Trump Derangement Syndrome. The sufferers of Trump Fatigue aren’t driven mad by the president. They are just tired of having to wake up every morning to another of his sudden attacks, reversals, exaggerations, and boasts. They want the show to end.”



Dems ready more witnesses for impeachment probe - Reuters: “Democrats on Monday laid out their case for the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump and pressed Republicans to stop supporting Trump by releasing a fact sheet and video they said expose Trump’s efforts to secure victory in the 2020 presidential election with the assistance of Ukraine. The releases ‘encapsulate all the evidence uncovered to date about the president’s months-long pressure campaign to undermine the 2020 election and the extent to which he abused his power by using the levers of government to advance the scheme,’ according to the office of Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives. They also showed how Democrats may approach the charges, or articles of impeachment, they are expected to draw up at the conclusion of the probe. The articles of impeachment, if approved by the House, would then be sent to Senate for a trial on whether to remove Trump from office.”



TRUMP OVERWHELMS DEMS ON SOCIAL MEDIA

NYT: “That campaigns are now being fought largely online is hardly a revelation, yet only one political party seems to have gotten the message. While the Trump campaign has put its digital operation firmly at the center of the president’s re-election effort, Democrats are struggling to internalize the lessons of the 2016 race and adapt to a political landscape shaped by social media. Mr. Trump’s first campaign took far better advantage of Facebook and other platforms that reward narrowly targeted — and, arguably, nastier — messages. And while the president is now embattled on multiple fronts and disfavored by a majority of Americans in most polls, he has one big advantage: His 2020 campaign, flush with cash, is poised to dominate online again, according to experts on both ends of the political spectrum, independent researchers and tech executives. The difference between the parties’ digital efforts, they said, runs far deeper than the distinction between an incumbent’s general-election operation and challengers’ primary campaigns.”



Dems also worry about Trump’s money machine - Politico: “Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee have raised more than $300 million this year for his reelection — more than any other sitting president in history at this point in the campaign. Trump has nearly twice as much cash on hand — $158 million, between his campaign account and the RNC — as Barack Obama and the Democratic National Committee had at this time in his successful re-election run. … Democrats, meanwhile, are still four or five months away — at the earliest — from settling on a nominee. ‘We don’t know if the Democratic candidate is going to be able to even compete with such a shorter timeline, even if they have significant resources after the convention,’ said Tara McGowan, founder and chief executive officer of the progressive group ACRONYM. With the Democratic primary in full swing, McGowan said, ‘There’s two separate elections going on, and the really unfortunate part is Trump is the only one involved in the general election today.’”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I've a sad sense of déjà vu: 2020 is shaping up to be another election which leaves no major candidate for whom I can vote. As a conservative, I had serious concerns about Trump's temperament but was long done with the Clintons’ modus operandi. Now I face a similar situation: Vote for someone who, against all military advice and in one stroke, abruptly abandoned allies in the field to danger and death and diminished (if not killed outright) our chances of creating such alliances in the future, or vote for a socialist. As for David Brooks ‘policies can be argued about and reversed,’ in what world? I can think of quite a few bad policies that have never been reversed, amended or fixed because once created, they spawn dependent bureaucracies and constituencies. Attempt to touch them and you'll meet Paul Ryan's fate. Worse, voting for a Democrat lends legitimacy to the vicious, hateful behavior displayed toward Brett Kavanaugh and the underhanded, partisan impeachment inquiry. (Impeachment is a political process, but as you've pointed out, it wasn't intended to be a partisan one.) Many Republican Senators might prefer to remove him, have Pence and peace and be done with it. (Sounds good to me.) But how many will be able to bring themselves to vote for removal, thereby legitimizing a process that locked out their House counterparts? It's growing very grey days in voter land.” – Triche Osborne, Baton Rouge, La.



[Ed. note: I hear you! Another few weeks like the ones we’ve had and I may seek out an island in the Aleutians to live out my days with the polar bears. But… We are very privileged to be alive in this moment. Life, especially as free people, is always a privilege, but how lucky are we to be alive at a moment when America, the West, and really, our whole species is fundamentally re-evaluating what it’s all about. I choose not to despair because history tells me that we will figure it out. Maybe not in a straight line, but we will get there. I base this not on the fact that there is an arc to history (there isn’t) but rather because we have all of the necessary ingredients to make what comes next freer, fairer and more dedicated the American creed.]



“As you note, there are many indicators supporting your observation that we are in the midst of enormous societal and hence political change. But I would dispute your conclusion that no politician is addressing this change. Andrew Yang had built his campaign explicitly around this change which he believes will accelerate over the next two decades. I am disappointed that you and the rest of the political press have paid so little attention. You may well not agree with his prescriptions, but he has clearly diagnosed the disease and deserves serious consideration. In the last debate, I was struck by his quiet observation about Sweden's wealth tax proposal - it has been tried by several other developed nations and failed - adding - why can't we learn from the experience of others?” – Matt Lincoln, Portola Valley, Calif.



[Ed. note: Yang may be prescient, Mr. Lincoln, but he also is a pessimist. One of the reasons he has connected so well with younger males is that he matches the sense of foreboding common among many millennial dudes. I do grant you that he is one of the few candidates who is even talking about this Gutenberg-level (Johannes not Steve) disruption that’s working its way through our society. I wish politicians in both parties would think about the same stuff.]



“Well I live in the UK and I am 72 years old, but I watch and read Fox News every day without fail… Before Trump decided to run for President I loved this man to death, he is just what I wanted to see in a President of the USA. Today at times I cringe when Trump opens his mouth or goes off on one on Twitter, he is the making of all his problems to date… Now I want Trump to get a 2nd term but he must CONTROL his mouth and have more respect for people who he talks to after all this is the most powerful man on planet Earth…” – Michael O'Connor, West Yorkshire, England

YA BASIC

AP: “A BASE jumper who jumped illegally from a northwestern Wisconsin cellphone tower ended up calling the police on himself after his parachute became caught on a guy wire, leaving him dangling perilously 50 feet (15 meters) from the ground. Police say the 20-year-old man jumped from the 300-foot (90-meter) Charter Communications tower in Menomonie on Thursday morning. After his rescue at around 9:30 a.m., the man was treated at Mayo Clinic Health System and arrested for criminal trespass. BASE jumping stands for building, antenna, span and earth — the four common objects from which BASE jumpers launch their descent.”

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

The 37-year old mayor – the youngest candidate in the White House race -- stands at 13 percent in a Suffolk University/USA Today poll of likely Iowa caucus-goers released Monday. Biden, at 18 percent, and Warren, at 17 percent, were tied for the top spot in the survey.

WALLACE CHALLENGES BUTTIGIEG ON 'FOX NEWS SUNDAY'

Buttigieg -- who served in the U.S. Naval Reserve in the Afghanistan War and would be the nation’s first openly gay president if elected -- was up seven percentage points since the previous Suffolk University/USA Today poll in Iowa, in June.

The new poll was conducted Wednesday through Friday, entirely after last Tuesday’s fourth round Democratic presidential nomination debate. Political pundits gave a more aggressive Buttigieg high marks for taking on Warren over how she’d pay for her Medicare-for-all health care plan, targeting Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii over her anti-interventionist stance, and clashing with former Rep. Beto O’Rourke over his mandatory gun buy back proposal.

Buttigieg was followed in the poll by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who stood at 9 percent.

""Iowa is unquestionably up for grabs,"" Suffolk Political Research Center director David Paleologos said.

Paleologos added that Buttigieg ""has found a lane and is accelerating toward the front of the pack, surpassing Bernie Sanders. All of this is happening while the number of undecided voters continues to grow as Democratic caucusgoers pause to reevaluate the changing field.""

BUTTIGIEG RETURNS FIRE AFTER AOC FUNDRAISING DIG

The survey – which has a has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 points -- also indicates Sen. Kamala Harris of California plunging 13 points from the June poll, which was conducted following Harris’ strong performance in the first round of primary debates.

The poll is the second piece of evidence pointing toward a post-debate bump for Buttigieg. He also raised $1.1 million in fundraising in the first 24-hours following the debate."

Robert ""Beto"" O’Rourke plays it cool with slang: ""It’s Gonna Take All of Us.""

Clearly the polls say Americans want to feel like they are part of the team. Inclusive. A musical montage from a teen movie where everyone chips in and they save the day. But don’t be fooled: These candidates are not like you, and the policies they support are actually bad for regular Americans. In fact, their slogans should all be the same: ""Do as I say, not as I do.""

Nowhere is this more obvious than when it comes to being green.

TUCKER CARLSON: POLS WHO USE KIDS TO GAIN POWER MAY BE A GREATER 'EXISTENTIAL THREAT' THAN CLIMATE CHANGE?

As part of their required Federal Election Commission quarterly filings, the candidates disclosed how their finances and each campaign have been spending a lot of money on private jet travel. After all, how else does one get from Iowa to New Hampshire? In coach? Taking off shoes at TSA? With campaign donations picking up the tab, private jets make the campaign trail much better.

For a collective group of Democrats who decry fossil fuels, who embrace the radical Green New Deal, who demand we change our habits and diets to reflect the “existential crisis” of climate change, they sure don’t put their campaign money with their mouth is.

Every one of the 2020 candidates supports the Green New Deal (GND) as part of their campaign, and as a reminder, this radical, socialist proposal of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez seeks to make air travel ""obsolete."" Air travel is such a no-no amongst environmentalists that ""flight shaming"" has become a common tactic the green radicals use.

So, why do these candidates get a pass? If they want us to stop flying commercial, why are they justified in flying private?

The Buttigieg campaign said it needs private jets because South Bend isn't convenient to campaign stops and the mayor has a vigorous schedule. Here’s a question for Mayor Pete: If I live in rural America and am busy, can I get an exemption under the Green New Deal you support?

We all know the answer to that question, plebeian.

Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., say their flights are actually ""carbon neutral"" because they buy carbon offsets, presumably with campaign contributions. That's like justifying a cheesecake for dinner by purchasing my neighbor a treadmill. For his dog. And the treadmill company donates to my campaign. Yet, in the silly and slimy world of D.C. politics and sympathetic press, somehow that excuse evens out.

All these candidates are too cowardly to admit what we all know: They travel on private jets because they can. Playing us for fools just adds insult to injury.

Their private air travel is possible for one reason, and one reason alone: America is great. Right now, there are millions of Americans in rural places like Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, and Artesia, New Mexico, working in the energy industry. These are the men and women who power America doing hard, difficult, even dangerous work, and we all benefit from the fruit of their labor.

We have an incredible amount of oil and gas reserves across this nation, and many are still yet untapped. Our abundant energy means prices are low. A decade ago, oil consistently hovered around $100 a barrel. Today, it is half that. This means cheaper gas and home utility bills. Information technology is reflected in the manufacturing and shipping costs of consumer goods. Abundant energy means we spend less. This is something we should celebrate.

What happens when the Green New Deal does make air travel ""obsolete"" and the 10 million American jobs in the airline industry are lost? What happens when Sanders gets his wish to make fracking illegal by executive order and consequently half our oil and two-thirds our gas comes off the market?

I’ll tell you what happens: You won't fly home for Christmas. You won't buy fruit in winter. Cold weather and athletic clothing with lycra and Core-Tex and nylon won’t be affordable. Food prices will skyrocket. Shipping costs will make European goods unaffordable, and speaking of Europe, forget about going. You can't afford it, because with oil around $200 a barrel, even a cruise is out of the question.

What happens when politicians destroy the fossil fuel industry is, they destroy the economy and our way of life.

Next time you see a candidate in a stump speech decrying climate change, demanding a Green New Deal, even calling energy industry workers ""Criminals,"" just ask a simple question: Will you, candidate, stop using these fossil fuels, the cheap gas, the plastics, the oil, the private jets, in your campaign?

We all know the answer to that, plebeian.

Any candidate who does not live in his private life what he wants government to mandate you live in yours is not worthy of your vote to elected office. And none of these hypocrites is worthy to be your president.

Starting in January of 2020, the mandate forbids city-funded travel to those states and bans city employees from making new deals with businesses headquartered there.

San Francisco Mayor London Breed announced the measure last week.

SAN FRANCISCO HOMELESS STATS SOAR: CITY BLAMES BIG BUSINESS, RESIDENTS BLAME OFFICIALS

In a statement, Breed said: “Every day in this country, women’s reproductive rights are threatened, and we have to fight back. Just as we restricted spending with states that have laws that discriminate against LGBTQ people, we are standing up against states that put women’s health at risk and that are actively working to limit reproductive freedoms.""

She added: “By limiting travel and contracting with certain states, we are sending a clear message to states that disregard the right to abortion.”

However, some of the representatives of the 22 states singled out aren't happy about the policy. Nebraska's Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts took to Twitter, writing that ""Nebraska is a proudly #prolife state, and this demonstrates shocking intolerance by coastal elites that is divisive to our nation.""

Host of ""Special Report"" Bret Baier said that while the money offset is unclear, this doesn't amount to nothing.

""It does amount to an issue in a political race...and I think Governor Ricketts is on to something there,"" he said.

""There is this disconnect that plays out every election cycle. Where, the middle of America says, 'Listen, that's kind of over the top,'"" he told Melissa Francis, ""And, that disconnect – he calls them coastal elites, whatever you call it – is real and present in American politics today.""

""It's dangerous, I would even say. The idea of isolating someone you don't agree with is just not a good idea. It's not American,"" added former Obama administration aide Johanna Maska.

Republican strategist and Fox News contributor Lisa Boothe told the couch that ""where you lose that [collaboration] is when you start labeling people as things"" which immediately alienates them.

However, she also noted that the issue of life has ""less common ground"" because it's ""a deeply-held belief by so many Americans.""

""And I actually, I do think there a vulnerability for the left on this issue because you look at states like New York moving forward with things like third-trimester abortions — that is outside the mainstream of America,"" said Boothe.

""I wonder about the missed opportunities too,"" Harris Faulkner added.

USA Today: “It's a new three-way race in Iowa. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who was initially seen as a long-shot presidential contender, has surged within striking distance of former vice president Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses, a Suffolk University/USA TODAY Poll finds. … The poll, taken Wednesday through Friday, put Biden at 18%, Warren at 17% and Buttigieg at 13% among 500 likely Democratic caucusgoers. Those standings reflect significant changes since the Suffolk/USA TODAY poll taken in Iowa at the end of June, when Biden led Warren by double digits and Buttigieg trailed at a distant 6%. California Sen. Kamala Harris, who was then in second place after a strong showing in the first Democratic debate, has plummeted 13 percentage points and is now in a three-way tie for sixth. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders earned 9% support, the same number as in the June poll.”



Buttigieg, Klobuchar try to capitalize - Politico: “Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar shot out of the last Democratic debate with the most precious commodity a presidential candidate can get before the Iowa caucuses: momentum. … The new round of attention for both Midwesterners comes at a key moment: Klobuchar has yet to qualify for the November debate stage, while Buttigieg faced new questions about his campaign’s attention to racial issues. And both of them still have significant ground to make up in the polls. … Based on money and staff footprint, Buttigieg is better positioned: He ended September with $23.4 million in his campaign account — third in the Democratic field — while Klobuchar has $3.7 million to spend. She’s only reached 3 percent in one early-state poll, and she needs three more to qualify for the November debate. On the ground in Iowa, Buttigieg’s staff is about double the size of Klobuchar’s. Both candidates are currently airing TV ads in Iowa.”



Are Dems ready for a Midwest moment? - LAT: “Both long shots are now trying — with swings through early-voting states, new ads and endorsements, and intensified fundraising efforts — to keep their post-debate sizzle hot and find an opening in the contest that has been shaping up as a showdown between Biden and Warren. In the process, they are surfacing a long-simmering debate about the dominance of the party’s liberal wing on the East and West coasts — making a more pointed case than Biden, whose campaign pitch builds on his experience more than ideology. ‘It’s the Midwest versus the rest of the country,’ said Rufus Gifford, who was finance director of President Obama’s reelection campaign in 2012 and is uncommitted in the 2020 race. ‘Both Pete and Amy really focused on the fact that this is the part of the country we need to win, and we are losing.’”



Klobuchar says she’s peaking at the right time - WaPo: “Klobuchar, who struggled for attention in the Democratic primary, says this week's debate helped her catch on at exactly the right time. Her town halls are crowded, with staffers running to get more chairs to pack breweries or event centers. She leads the field in local endorsements, especially state legislators, ‘with more to come,’ she says. She kicked off her bus tour with the support of Andy McKean, a Republican state legislator who bolted his party six months ago and who pronounced Klobuchar the kind of Democrat who could unite America again. ‘If you want to peak in this race,’ she said after a stop in Waterloo, ‘you want to peak now, instead of six months before [the caucuses].’ A few other candidates still draw larger crowds, but Klobuchar is going for a particular kind of caucus-goer: the loyal Democrat who wants to win back those mysterious Trump voters.”



Zuckerberg gave hiring recommendations to Buttigieg campaign - Bloomberg: “Facebook Inc. chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg has privately recommended several potential hires to Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign, a rare example of direct political involvement from one of tech’s most powerful executives. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg sent multiple emails to Mike Schmuhl, Buttigieg’s campaign manager, with names of individuals that he might consider hiring, campaign spokesman Chris Meagher confirmed. Priscilla Chan, Zuckerberg’s wife, also sent multiple emails to Schmuhl with staff recommendations. Ultimately, two of the people recommended were hired.”



WARREN SCRAMBLES ON HEALTH INSURANCE

Fox News: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Sunday that in the upcoming weeks she would detail how to pay for her proposal for a government-run ‘Medicare-for-all’ plan. The Massachusetts Democrat and White House candidate said at a town hall in Indianola, Iowa: ‘What I see … is that we need to talk about the cost, and I plan over the next few weeks to put out a plan that talks about specifically the cost of ‘Medicare-for-all,’ and specifically how we pay for it.’ Estimates place the 10-year cost of the ‘Medicare-for-all’ plans at $32-34 trillion. She added about the universal health insurance plan: ‘This is something I’ve been working on for months and months, and it’s got just a little more work until it’s finished.’”



Gabbard uses Hillary in bid for relevancy - Fox News: “Speaking directly to the camera in a video message posted on social media on Sunday, 2020 presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard suggested that Hillary Clinton recently ‘smeared’ her as a ‘Russian asset’ as payback for Gabbard's defiance of the party establishment in 2016. … [In the video Gabbard said,] ‘If you stand up to Hillary and the party power brokers -- if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message. But, here is the truth: They will not intimidate us. They will not silence us.’ … Several candidates, including Beto O'Rourke, Andrew Yang and Marianne Williamson, have criticized Clinton's unfounded suggestion that Russians have been ‘grooming’ Gabbard to be a third-party spoiler in the race.”

TIME OUT: FROM WAY BACK WHEN

AP: “A crew of deep-sea explorers and historians looking for lost World War II warships have found a second Japanese aircraft carrier that went down in the historic Battle of Midway. Vulcan Inc.’s director of undersea operations Rob Kraft and Naval History and Heritage Command historian Frank Thompson reviewed high frequency sonar images of the warship Sunday and say that its dimensions and location mean it has to be the carrier Akagi. The Akagi was found in the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument resting in nearly 18,000 feet (5,490 meters) of water more than 1,300 miles (2,090 kilometers) northwest of Pearl Harbor. The researchers used an autonomous underwater vehicle, or AUV, equipped with sonar to find the ship. The vehicle had been out overnight collecting data, and the image of a warship appeared in the first set of readings Sunday morning.”

MULVANEY AGONISTES

Politico: “Mick Mulvaney’s week went from bad to worse on Sunday, as he again tried to explain why President Donald Trump and the administration had withheld aid to Ukraine for weeks — one of Democrats’ central questions in their impeachment inquiry. Mulvaney fumbled during an interview on ‘Fox News Sunday’ when he cited two reasons for the delay, whereas he had listed three during his Thursday news briefing at the White House. He continued to blame reporters for any misunderstanding, a feat that can be tough to pull off when his answers were all delivered on camera and when the host, Chris Wallace, let the tape keep rolling. And he threw red meat to liberals and Democratic presidential candidates who have long questioned the appropriateness of the Trump family continuing to profit from their business holdings while Trump serves as president. … Mulvaney’s interview did not play well among Trump allies and advisers, with one calling it a ‘self-immolation.’”



Party support for Trump gets tested - WSJ: “President Trump faces increasing public and private scrutiny from his own party over a series of recent White House moves, as the House impeachment inquiry reduces his margin for error with fellow Republicans and makes him more vulnerable to attacks. In the past several days, Mr. Trump has been forced to drop plans to host next year’s Group of Seven summit at his Doral golf resort, and a top aide has tried to walk back comments linking Ukraine military aid to an investigation of the president’s political opponents. The fallout of Mr. Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria has continued to draw widespread criticism, including from Republicans. Mr. Trump’s support within his party will face fresh tests this week, as key witnesses from the State Department and Pentagon are expected to testify in closed hearings before a trio of House committees on the president’s dealings with Ukraine.”



Continetti: Trump fatigue syndrome - National Review: “I was surprised to read Robert J. Samuelson’s column in the Washington Post arguing for the impeachment and removal of President Trump. Samuelson is, above all, a realist who has looked on economics and politics with a tough and somewhat cynical eye for some 30 years. … Samuelson has reached his breaking point. And he isn’t alone. A large part of the country suffers from Trump Fatigue Syndrome. This is related but not identical to Trump Derangement Syndrome. The sufferers of Trump Fatigue aren’t driven mad by the president. They are just tired of having to wake up every morning to another of his sudden attacks, reversals, exaggerations, and boasts. They want the show to end.”



Dems ready more witnesses for impeachment probe - Reuters: “Democrats on Monday laid out their case for the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump and pressed Republicans to stop supporting Trump by releasing a fact sheet and video they said expose Trump’s efforts to secure victory in the 2020 presidential election with the assistance of Ukraine. The releases ‘encapsulate all the evidence uncovered to date about the president’s months-long pressure campaign to undermine the 2020 election and the extent to which he abused his power by using the levers of government to advance the scheme,’ according to the office of Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives. They also showed how Democrats may approach the charges, or articles of impeachment, they are expected to draw up at the conclusion of the probe. The articles of impeachment, if approved by the House, would then be sent to Senate for a trial on whether to remove Trump from office.”



TRUMP OVERWHELMS DEMS ON SOCIAL MEDIA

NYT: “That campaigns are now being fought largely online is hardly a revelation, yet only one political party seems to have gotten the message. While the Trump campaign has put its digital operation firmly at the center of the president’s re-election effort, Democrats are struggling to internalize the lessons of the 2016 race and adapt to a political landscape shaped by social media. Mr. Trump’s first campaign took far better advantage of Facebook and other platforms that reward narrowly targeted — and, arguably, nastier — messages. And while the president is now embattled on multiple fronts and disfavored by a majority of Americans in most polls, he has one big advantage: His 2020 campaign, flush with cash, is poised to dominate online again, according to experts on both ends of the political spectrum, independent researchers and tech executives. The difference between the parties’ digital efforts, they said, runs far deeper than the distinction between an incumbent’s general-election operation and challengers’ primary campaigns.”



Dems also worry about Trump’s money machine - Politico: “Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee have raised more than $300 million this year for his reelection — more than any other sitting president in history at this point in the campaign. Trump has nearly twice as much cash on hand — $158 million, between his campaign account and the RNC — as Barack Obama and the Democratic National Committee had at this time in his successful re-election run. … Democrats, meanwhile, are still four or five months away — at the earliest — from settling on a nominee. ‘We don’t know if the Democratic candidate is going to be able to even compete with such a shorter timeline, even if they have significant resources after the convention,’ said Tara McGowan, founder and chief executive officer of the progressive group ACRONYM. With the Democratic primary in full swing, McGowan said, ‘There’s two separate elections going on, and the really unfortunate part is Trump is the only one involved in the general election today.’”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I've a sad sense of déjà vu: 2020 is shaping up to be another election which leaves no major candidate for whom I can vote. As a conservative, I had serious concerns about Trump's temperament but was long done with the Clintons’ modus operandi. Now I face a similar situation: Vote for someone who, against all military advice and in one stroke, abruptly abandoned allies in the field to danger and death and diminished (if not killed outright) our chances of creating such alliances in the future, or vote for a socialist. As for David Brooks ‘policies can be argued about and reversed,’ in what world? I can think of quite a few bad policies that have never been reversed, amended or fixed because once created, they spawn dependent bureaucracies and constituencies. Attempt to touch them and you'll meet Paul Ryan's fate. Worse, voting for a Democrat lends legitimacy to the vicious, hateful behavior displayed toward Brett Kavanaugh and the underhanded, partisan impeachment inquiry. (Impeachment is a political process, but as you've pointed out, it wasn't intended to be a partisan one.) Many Republican Senators might prefer to remove him, have Pence and peace and be done with it. (Sounds good to me.) But how many will be able to bring themselves to vote for removal, thereby legitimizing a process that locked out their House counterparts? It's growing very grey days in voter land.” – Triche Osborne, Baton Rouge, La.



[Ed. note: I hear you! Another few weeks like the ones we’ve had and I may seek out an island in the Aleutians to live out my days with the polar bears. But… We are very privileged to be alive in this moment. Life, especially as free people, is always a privilege, but how lucky are we to be alive at a moment when America, the West, and really, our whole species is fundamentally re-evaluating what it’s all about. I choose not to despair because history tells me that we will figure it out. Maybe not in a straight line, but we will get there. I base this not on the fact that there is an arc to history (there isn’t) but rather because we have all of the necessary ingredients to make what comes next freer, fairer and more dedicated the American creed.]



“As you note, there are many indicators supporting your observation that we are in the midst of enormous societal and hence political change. But I would dispute your conclusion that no politician is addressing this change. Andrew Yang had built his campaign explicitly around this change which he believes will accelerate over the next two decades. I am disappointed that you and the rest of the political press have paid so little attention. You may well not agree with his prescriptions, but he has clearly diagnosed the disease and deserves serious consideration. In the last debate, I was struck by his quiet observation about Sweden's wealth tax proposal - it has been tried by several other developed nations and failed - adding - why can't we learn from the experience of others?” – Matt Lincoln, Portola Valley, Calif.



[Ed. note: Yang may be prescient, Mr. Lincoln, but he also is a pessimist. One of the reasons he has connected so well with younger males is that he matches the sense of foreboding common among many millennial dudes. I do grant you that he is one of the few candidates who is even talking about this Gutenberg-level (Johannes not Steve) disruption that’s working its way through our society. I wish politicians in both parties would think about the same stuff.]



“Well I live in the UK and I am 72 years old, but I watch and read Fox News every day without fail… Before Trump decided to run for President I loved this man to death, he is just what I wanted to see in a President of the USA. Today at times I cringe when Trump opens his mouth or goes off on one on Twitter, he is the making of all his problems to date… Now I want Trump to get a 2nd term but he must CONTROL his mouth and have more respect for people who he talks to after all this is the most powerful man on planet Earth…” – Michael O'Connor, West Yorkshire, England

YA BASIC

AP: “A BASE jumper who jumped illegally from a northwestern Wisconsin cellphone tower ended up calling the police on himself after his parachute became caught on a guy wire, leaving him dangling perilously 50 feet (15 meters) from the ground. Police say the 20-year-old man jumped from the 300-foot (90-meter) Charter Communications tower in Menomonie on Thursday morning. After his rescue at around 9:30 a.m., the man was treated at Mayo Clinic Health System and arrested for criminal trespass. BASE jumping stands for building, antenna, span and earth — the four common objects from which BASE jumpers launch their descent.”

Farrow’s former NBC News producer Rich McHugh, who accused Oppenheim and his boss Andy Lack of a “massive breach of journalistic integrity” in a scathing Vanity Fair column earlier this month, slammed the network's parent company for its vote of confidence.

“I take it that no Comcast board member has read Ronan’s book or my article. I am sad for all NBC News employees that the status quo has been blessed,” McHugh told Fox News.

Former NBC News correspondent Linda Vester agreed.

“Comcast/NBC Universal is extending the contract of an individual who lied to staff and shareholders when he said they ‘have no secrets and nothing to hide.’ Not only does it encourage harassment victims to start telling those secrets, it invites a shareholder lawsuit against Comcast,” Vester told Fox News. “In my view, shareholders could sue the company for breach of fiduciary duty by using corporate assets to make secret payoffs for personal wrongs. What shareholder would agree to Comcast secretly using their money for coverups?”

Vester is a vocal critic of the Peacock Network’s culture since she accused Tom Brokaw of sexual misconduct last year (a claim Brokaw denied). Vester is part of a high-powered group of women who have called for a new investigation into alleged misconduct at the network.

The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that NBC quietly renewed Oppenheim’s contract, citing “people familiar with the matter.” The reported decision raised eyebrows across the media industry, as Oppenheim has been at the center of numerous controversies in recent memory. In addition to the Weinstein scandal, Oppenheim was recently mocked by his own staffers when fielding questions about his knowledge of Matt Lauer’s alleged misconduct, while controversial columns he wrote in college were unearthed earlier this month.

NBC KILLED MY SEX ASSAULT STORY AFTER FARROW'S WEINSTEIN PIECE, AUTHOR CLAIMS

""The contract renewal is a strong endorsement for an executive who has been at the center of such a controversy. These contracts are typically renewed for several years at a time, and Mr. Oppenheim is expected to succeed [NBC News chairman Andy] Lack after the 2020 presidential election,” The Wall Street Journal wrote.

NBC News did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation.

NBCUniversal Chief Executive Steve Burke currently plans for Oppenheim to succeed Lack, according to the Journal. However, an NBCUniversal insider told Fox News that Burke is “extremely fickle” and has given extensions to executives before shortly before firing them in the past.

An online petition urging NBC News to fire Oppenheim has nearly 10,000 signatures.

“I take it that no Comcast board member has read Ronan’s book or my article. I am sad for all NBC News employees that status quo has been blessed."" — Rich McHugh

Shaunna Thomas, a co-founder of UltraViolet, a leading national women’s organization, recently blasted Oppenheim by name, saying he “failed to hold sexual abusers accountable” and “failed to combat a toxic culture across newsrooms.”

‘TODAY’ ADDRESSES ‘APPALLING’ NEW MATT LAUER REPORT: 'IT’S JUST VERY PAINFUL'

Thomas -- who called for Oppenheim to be fired earlier this month -- blasted the decision.

“It is deeply disturbing that Comcast CEO Brian Roberts would show such poor judgment and renew its contract with Noah Oppenheim knowing full well that he was facing allegations of enabling sexual abusers in the workplace and had a record of silencing survivors and stories of survivors in the newsroom."" — UltraViolet co-founder Shaunna Thomas

“It is deeply disturbing that Comcast CEO Brian Roberts would show such poor judgment and renew its contract with Noah Oppenheim knowing full well that he was facing allegations of enabling sexual abusers in the workplace and had a record of silencing survivors and stories of survivors in the newsroom,” Thomas told Fox News.

“The rot at Comcast clearly goes to the top -- with the media giant caring more about short-term profits than about protecting its employees and safeguarding long-term shareholder value. This is a mistake that Comcast and NBC Universal will regret,” Thomas added.

MADDOW CELEBRATES NYT REPORTERS WHO EXPOSED WEINSTEIN SCANDAL, IGNORES HOW NBC SPIKED SAME STORY

Oppenheim famously told Farrow that his Weinstein reporting wasn’t fit to print, so Farrow took it to The New Yorker where it won the Pulitzer Prize and helped launch the #MeToo movement. Oppenheim, who moonlights as a Hollywood screenwriter, has been under a microscope as Farrow’s book details his version of why NBC refused to expose Weinstein – which includes allegations that the disgraced movie mogul leveraged the knowledge of former NBC News anchor Matt Lauer’s own misconduct.

The book also suggests Oppenheim wasn’t truthful regarding knowledge of Lauer’s alleged misconduct. Farrow describes Oppenheim as a “doe-eyed stoner whose mellow seemed impossible to harsh” and said they “laughed about his stories of getting high.” Farrow also says he and Oppenheim “planned to spend a night in with some edibles” before their eventual fallout over the Weinstein reporting.

After the Weinstein and Lauer bombshells were reported in 2017, NBC refused to hire an outside investigator to determine who knew about Lauer’s sexual misconduct and whether NBC executives looked the other way. NBC relied on in-house general counsel Kim Harris despite widespread calls for an outside law firm to conduct the review.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI PUBLICLY SUPPORTED NEWS VET BROKAW AMID MISCONDUCT CLAIMS, PRIVATELY APOLOGIZED

NBC eventually declared that management was completely oblivious to Lauer’s behavior and Harris’ high-powered colleagues were cleared by the network.

Oppenheim, who maintains that Farrow simply has “an axe to grind” against NBC, was recently mocked by his own staff when he attempted to field questions from concerned employees as excerpts from Farrow’s book began to surface.

MSNBC’s Chris Hayes recently admitted his news division was “embroiled in a very public controversy over its conduct” and appeared to side with Farrow’s reporting over the talking points that have been provided by Oppenheim.

“Ronan Farrow walked out of NBC News after working on the Weinstein story, and within two months published an incredible article at The New Yorker that not only won a Pulitzer, but helped trigger a massive social and cultural reckoning that continues to this day,” Hayes said. “The path of least resistance for those with power was not to cross Weinstein or his army of friends and lawyers.”

RONAN FARROW FIRES BACK AT NBC NEWS BOSS WHO HAS ‘THE MOST TO LOSE FROM THE TRUTH’

On Monday, author and activist Sil Lai Abrams said her own sexual misconduct bombshell was also shut down by Oppenheim’s news operation.

“Noah Oppenheim's contract renewal is confirmation that NBC is committed to maintaining the toxic environment which led to the network's repeated victimization of survivors of sexual violence,” Abrams told Fox News on Tuesday.

“The network clearly has no interest in shifting company culture or protecting victims of sexual violence from further traumatization by NBC, whether it's by killing credibly reported stories or protecting in-house predators. It's abhorrent that Oppenheim is being richly rewarded for his poor management decisions and enabling egregious ethical violations at the network,” Abrams added.

Meanwhile, NBC News has still not explained how the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape of Donald Trump was leaked from within Oppenheim’s new division to the Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold -- an old college buddy of Oppenheim.

Fahrenthold, like Farrow, won a Pulitzer Prize for stories that NBC News passed on under Oppenheim. Fahrenthold was later given a paid consultancy with NBC News.

Oppenheim and Fahrenthold attended Harvard University together, but NBC has long denied that Oppenheim leaked the scandalous tape to Fahrenthold."

DEM ELITES SEARCHING FOR WHITE KNIGHT

NYT: “When a half-dozen Democratic donors gathered at the Whitby Hotel in Manhattan last week, the dinner began with a discussion of which presidential candidates the contributors liked. But as conversations among influential Democrats often go these days, the meeting quickly evolved into a discussion of who was not in the race — but could be lured in. Would Hillary Clinton get in, the contributors wondered, and how about Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor? One person even mused whether Michelle Obama would consider a late entry, according to two people who attended the event, which was hosted by the progressive group American Bridge. It’s that time of the election season for Democrats. ‘Since the last debate, just anecdotally, I’ve had five or six people ask me: ‘Is there anybody else?’ said Leah Daughtry, a longtime Democrat who has run two of the party’s recent conventions.”

Warren ups the ante another $800 billion - WSJ: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling for $800 billion in additional federal funding for public education, a move that would exhaust the remaining revenue to be raised by her proposed wealth tax even as she seeks ways to finance Medicare for All. Ms. Warren outlined on the blog site Medium an additional $450 billion in Title I funding to boost schools with low-income students, $200 billion in grants for students with disabilities and $100 billion in other grants over 10 years. She also vowed to invest $50 billion in school infrastructure on top of existing funding for school upgrades that are in some of her other policy proposals.”



Castro promises to quit if he can’t raise $800,000 in 10 days - Politico: “Julián Castro on Monday threatened to suspend his presidential bid unless he can raise nearly $1 million by the end of the month. ‘If I can’t raise $800,000 in the next 10 days — I will have no choice but to end my race for president,’ Castro wrote in a fundraising email to supporters. ‘If I don’t meet this deadline, I won’t have the resources to keep my campaign running.’ The strategy is nearly identical to Cory Booker’s ‘radical transparency’ gambit last month, when his campaign warned in a memo to supporters that the New Jersey senator would end his White House bid if he was unable to raise $1.7 million in the final 10 days of September.”



Buttigieg’s sexuality a hurdle with black voters - The [Columbia, S.C.] State: “Internal focus groups conducted by Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign this summer reveal a key reason why he is struggling with African-American voters: many see his sexuality as a problem. The 21-page report, conducted by the Benenson Strategy Group with black Democratic South Carolina voters in mid-July and obtained exclusively by McClatchy, found that ‘being gay was a barrier for these voters, particularly for the men who seemed deeply uncomfortable even discussing it. … [T]heir preference is for his sexuality to not be front and center. While the report stated that Buttigieg’s sexuality was not a ‘disqualifier’ for these voters, some of the focus group participants questioned why Buttigieg even brought it up.’



Facebook ramps up election security efforts ahead of 2020 - AP: “With just over a year left until the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Facebook is stepping up its efforts to ensure it is not used as a tool to interfere in politics and democracies around the world. The efforts include a special security tool for elected officials and candidates that monitors them for hacking attempts. Facebook said Monday it will also label state-controlled media as such, label fact-checks more clearly and invest $2 million in media literacy projects. The company says it will add more prominent labels on debunked posts on Facebook as well as on Instagram.

TIME OUT: ‘EVERYONE’S GOT THEIR THING’

NYT: “The pressures of sexual selection have made peacocks gorgeous, wood thrushes sonorous and birds of paradise great dancers. At first glance, the white bellbird doesn’t appear to have benefited similarly. Barrel-chested and big-mouthed, with a long wattle dangling from the top of its beak, this rainforest bird looks more like a Muppet than an avian Casanova. But everyone’s got their thing. According to a paper published Monday in Current Biology, this goofball boasts the loudest birdsong ever recorded. And he must be proud of it, because he sings the most piercing note right into potential mates’ faces. The white bellbird — one of four bellbird species in South and Central America — is a favorite among birders in Brazil. It has a ‘strange, metallic, kind of alien call,’ said Caio Brito, one of the founders of Brazil Birding Experts. When several sing at once, they are ‘deafening,’ and sound like ‘several blacksmiths trying to compete,’ said Arthur Gomes, a biology student at São Paulo State University who contributed to the new research.”

IMPEACHMENT TIMING GETS TRICKIER FOR HOUSE DEMS

NYT: “House Democrats have resigned themselves to the likelihood that impeachment proceedings against President Trump will extend into the Christmas season, as they plan a series of public hearings intended to make the simplest and most devastating possible public case in favor of removing Mr. Trump. Democratic leaders had hoped to move as soon as Thanksgiving to wrap up a narrow inquiry focused around Mr. Trump’s dealings with Ukraine, buoyed by polling data that shows that the public supports the investigation, even if voters are not yet sold on impeaching the president. But after a complicated web of damaging revelations about the president has emerged from private depositions unfolding behind closed doors, Democratic leaders have now begun plotting a full-scale — and probably more time-consuming — effort to lay out their case in a set of high-profile public hearings on Capitol Hill.”



Diplomat who raised red flag on Giuliani-Trump deal testifies today - Reuters: “William Taylor, a former Army officer and career U.S. diplomat now leading the U.S. embassy in Kiev, will be the latest in a series of current and former officials to meet behind closed doors with the Democratic-led House of Representatives Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight Committees in the month since the probe began. Committee members and staff are examining whether the Republican Trump abused his office by improperly putting pressure on Ukraine to launch an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival and leading candidate for the Democratic 2020 presidential nomination. Taylor’s testimony is of particular interest to investigators because of his leading role at the embassy in Ukraine. He raised concern about military assistance being withheld from Kiev to put pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.”



Schiff un-censured - Fox News: “The Democratic-led House of Representatives voted Monday evening to table, or set aside, a resolution to censure House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., for his handling of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump. The vote was 218 to 185 to table the resolution, which the Republican minority had introduced. All Democrats voted to table the censure resolution, with all Republicans voting against tabling. Independent Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, who left the Republican Party earlier this year, voted to table the resolution.”



President Trump draws ire of black lawmakers for ‘lynching’ claim - AP: “President Donald Trump enraged Democrats on Tuesday by comparing their impeachment inquiry to a lynching, assigning the horrors of a deadly and racist chapter in U.S. history to a process laid out in the Constitution. ‘That is one word no president ought to apply to himself,’ said Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, the highest-ranking African American in Congress. ‘That is a word that we ought to be very, very careful about using’ he said. Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., called on Trump to delete the tweet.”



MICK MULVANEY: KICKING GAFFES AND TAKING NAMES

Reuters: “U.S. President Donald Trump has been fielding suggestions from allies on who might succeed his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, amid frustration at his team’s response to the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, two sources close to the White House said on Monday. Trump’s irritation at being dogged by a variety of issues - from impeachment to his decision to move U.S. troops out of northeastern Syria - was on display on Monday in the White House Cabinet Room as the president aired his grievances at length before his senior advisers and a group of reporters. The president has been focused in part on Mulvaney’s comments to reporters last week that Trump had withheld military aid from Ukraine in an effort to get Kiev to investigate a debunked claim about the 2016 U.S. election.”



Cuccinelli blocked from DHS job - AP: “President Donald Trump has been notified by his staff that he can’t select two popular figures — Ken Cuccinelli and Mark Morgan — to serve as an acting secretary of homeland security because a federal law governing agency succession makes them ineligible. Instead, Sean Doocey, the White House director of presidential personnel, in recent days gave Trump a list of other officials to consider as acting secretary, including top DHS official Chad Wolf and Transportation Security Administration chief David Pekoske, according to three people familiar with the conversation. The news has infuriated immigration hawks inside and outside the administration who had been lobbying for Cuccinelli to fill the role and now fear Trump will tap Wolf, a former chief of staff to ousted DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen who once worked as a lobbyist on employment visas.”



TRUMP LOOKS SOUTH FOR A BOOST

Politico: “Donald Trump is going all-in on a trio of Southern governor’s races in November, gambling that a clean sweep will help him regain his political footing at the most perilous moment of his presidency. Trump is expected to barnstorm Kentucky, Mississippi, and Louisiana over the next few weeks, while dispatching prominent supporters to help in each contest. And Vice President Mike Pence is planning a bus tour through eastern Kentucky, a pivotal area on the state’s political map that could decide the fate of Republican Gov. Matt Bevin. Trump badly needs a boost right now, and the White House sees the elections in the conservative states as the best near-term hope of achieving it.”



Impeachment adds windage to Kentucky contest - WSJ: “The gubernatorial election in Kentucky next month hinges in large part on whether voters are motivated by bread-and-butter issues close to home or national politics supercharged by the impeachment inquiry into President Trump. It is one of three governor’s races this year, along with those in Louisiana and Mississippi, that can offer insights on the electorate’s mood ahead of the 2020 presidential election.”

[Ed. note: You will be so glad you did! “Opinions are luxury items” is a close cousin to one of my dad’s favorites: “You can be happy or you can be right, but not usually both.” In our relationships it matters so much more that we listen and really hear each other. The simple but always challenging act of loving our neighbors starts by talking with them, which can’t happen if we’re talking at them. This not only makes us happier people and better friends, spouses and parents it also lets us save our strongest defenses for the things that matter the most.]

PICTURE DAY IS THE WURST

WSVN: “A 4th grader had a unique outfit for his school photo. Craig Arsenault posted a photo of his son Jake’s school ID. For his school photo, Jake dressed up in a hot dog costume. ‘My wife and I dared our son to wear a hot dog costume for school pictures. The school let him do it, and I couldn’t be happier,’ Arsenault said. According to Fox 13, Arsenault said the family had the costume “laying around for (the) last year,” and the idea came up when Jake voiced his wonder about what to wear for his school photo. ‘My wife suggested the hot dog costume. He was hesitant, so we bet him 10 bucks he wouldn’t do it,’ the father said. However, Jake accepted the dare and donned the costume for his photo. … Arsenault said he only had $7 at the time, which he gave to his son, but his son is holding him to the other $3.”

But the former vice president’s lead is taking a hit as top-tier rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s support soars in the contest the Biden campaign sees as a firewall.

Biden – who has longstanding ties in the state – stands at 33 percent among South Carolina voters likely to cast a ballot in the state’s February primary, according to a new poll from Monmouth University. That’s down 6 percentage points from Monmouth’s previous survey in the Palmetto State, which was conducted in July.

THE LATEST 2020 POLLING FROM FOX NEWS

Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, stands at 16 percent in the survey, a jump of 7 points from July.

Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is in third in the new poll, at 12 percent. The populist independent senator from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House bid stood at 10 percent in the previous survey.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who stood at 12 percent in the July survey, saw her support drop in half and now comes in at 6 percent in the new poll.

Environmental and progressive advocate and former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer has the backing of 4 percent of likely South Carolina Democratic primary voters, with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 3 percent, and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang each at 2 percent. The remaining nine candidates in the record-setting Democratic presidential field all register at 1 percent or less.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Besides the topline findings, the poll also has warning signs for Biden among South Carolina’s black voters, who make up more than half of the likely Democratic primary electorate. The former vice president’s position as either a first- or second-choice candidate dropped by 10 points among black voters to 52 percent, while Warren’s position as a top-two choice contender jumped 11 points to 26 percent.

“Biden is still in a pretty good position in South Carolina, but there are some signs that he might not have a true firewall among black voters. If he does not do well in the earlier contests in February, there may be potential for current preferences to shift here,” Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray said in a statement.

The Monmouth University Poll was conducted Oct. 16-21, with 402 South Carolina voters likely to cast a ballot in the Democratic presidential primary questioned by live telephone operators. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points."

Amy Klobuchar.,2019-10-23,Fox News,"Amy Klobuchar making crucial Iowa push ahead of November debate, caucus",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/klobuchar-iowa-debate-caucus,"NEWTON, Iowa — As an Iowa native, 18-year-old Kayla Cook is no stranger to the Hawkeye State's starring political role every four years as presidential candidates make their pitch to voters.

But this year is different for her — and not just because she will be able to officially caucus for the first time. Cook, who is used to following her parents to meet-and-greets supporting the Republican Party, is switching to the other side this election cycle and planning to vote for a Democrat.

“As a Republican, I look at where our nation is right now and I see a lot of division,” she said. “I just want to see unity in our country again and I know it can happen.”

Cook is pinning her hopes on the senator from next-door Minnesota, Amy Klobuchar. That’s why the 18-year-old stopped what she was doing on a Sunday afternoon for a meet-and-greet with the senator in Newton, Iowa.

BIG POST-DEBATE CASH HAULS FOR BUTTIGIEG, KLOBUCHAR COULD SPELL TROUBLE FOR BIDEN

It was a crowded room, with a few chairs, and standing room only at the Lemon Tree Tea House and Restaurant.

“I just know it needs to be someone who is moderate who cares both about the Republicans and Democrats and I believe she’s someone who could do that,” said Cook.

While most Democratic presidential candidates are stepping up their ground game in the key early state of Iowa, Klobuchar is making a big push in the state, hoping to continue to reach people like Cook.

It’s a crucial moment for her campaign as she tries to build momentum, which starts in the first-in-the-nation caucus state.

Klobuchar only has a few weeks left to qualify for the next Democratic debate in November. She needs a boost in the polls to reach that goal, which is part of the reason why she’s launching a digital ad campaign to target voters.

The senator is also making counties won by President Trump in 2016 and former president Barack Obama in 2012 a top priority during her “All For America Bus Tour.”

For three days straight, Klobuchar’s bright green bus traveled to Dubuque, Black Hawk, Gurthie and Jasper Counties to listen to the concerns from voters.

She spoke to veterans, restaurant owners and even companies like W2 fuel, a biodiesel company whose CEO Roy Strom told the press that his biodiesel plant was forced to close due to waivers granted from the current administration for oil refineries, which hurt the price value for biodiesel products.

“At the last debate, we’ve got a lot of attention nationally and brought in over a million dollars in small contributions in just 24 hours. We did that by reaching out to people,” said Klobuchar. “I don’t have the big state and I don’t have the big-name ID as some of these other people so, it’s going to take a little more time.”

A recent poll from Suffolk University and USA Today ranks the senator as sixth among Iowa caucus-goers, tying her with California Sen. Kamala Harris and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.

Political analysts say it’s a do-or-die moment for Klobuchar’s campaign

“There’s still time for Sen. Klobuchar but the problem is she’s sort of had is that she’s looking for that middle lane or that moderate Democrat and Joe Biden was occupying that pretty strongly,” said Tim Hagle, professor of politics at the University of Iowa. “But now that he seems like he’s sort of fading a little bit, and if that continues, that opens up that lane.”

GREG GUTFELD AND JUAN WILLIAMS PICK THEIR DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE'S WINNERS AND LOSER

Complicating matters is South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who Hagle said is giving Klobuchar a run for her money as the stand-out Midwest candidate.

“With Klobuchar, at least what she has going for her is that she can say, 'I have experience in Congress, I know how to get things done,' and she can talk about all the things she has gotten done, so in that respect, she has an advantage,” Hagle said."

SUPPORT FOR IMPEACHMENT REACHES NEW HIGH

Quinnipiac University: “Approval among American voters of the U.S. House impeachment inquiry, an inquiry to determine whether or not to bring impeachment charges against President Trump, has reached its highest level, as 55 percent approve of the inquiry, while 43 percent disapprove, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. Last week, 51 percent of voters approved of the inquiry, while 45 percent disapproved. In today's poll, Democrats approve of the inquiry 93 - 7 percent and independent voters approve 58 - 37 percent, while Republicans disapprove of the inquiry 88 - 10 percent. … Nearly half of registered voters, 48 percent, say President Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 46 percent say he should not. Last week, 46 percent supported impeachment while 48 percent were opposed. In today's poll, support for impeachment is 86 - 9 percent among Democrats, and 49 - 41 percent among independents, while Republicans oppose impeachment 91 - 6 percent.”



Trump approval dropping - Quinnipiac University: “President Trump’s job approval rating has dipped below 40 percent for the first time since the impeachment inquiry began as 38 percent say they approve of the job he is doing, and 58 percent disapprove. Last week, 41 percent approved of the president’s job performance, while 54 percent disapproved. This is President Trump’s lowest net approval rating since a July 2018 poll. … Nancy Pelosi gets a mixed approval rating as 45 percent approve of the job she is doing as Speaker of the House, while 47 percent disapprove. Mitch McConnell’s approval rating is deep underwater as 57 percent of voters disapprove of the job he is doing as Senate Majority Leader, while only 24 percent approve.”



Top diplomat’s testimony rattles Congress - NYT: “[During] explosive testimony on Tuesday, William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, laid out in visceral terms the stakes of what he saw as an illegitimate scheme to pressure the Kiev government for political help by suspending American security aid. In by far the most damning account yet to become public in the House impeachment inquiry Mr. Taylor described a president holding up $391 million in assistance for the clear purpose of forcing Ukraine to help incriminate Mr. Trump’s domestic rivals. Mr. Trump’s actions, he testified, undercut American allies desperately fighting off Russia’s attempt to redraw the boundaries of Europe through force.”



Trump defenders storm deposition, shut down probe in protest - WaPo: “A group of House Republicans temporarily shut down the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry on Wednesday, barging into a secure room where a witness was set to testify and refusing to leave despite orders from top Democrats. A group of about two-dozen Trump allies stormed a room in the Capitol basement where three investigative committees were supposed to hear testimony from Laura Cooper, the Pentagon official who oversees Ukraine policy. Those members were not on the committees of jurisdiction and were not supposed to be present during the closed-door deposition. A shouting match began between Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.) and some Democrats in the room as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) left to consult with the sergeant at arms…”



Senate Republicans caution Trump on chaos - WashEx: “Senate Republicans are warning President Trump that he risks bungling impeachment politically and alienating voters, even as he survives a Senate trial, without a focused strategy prosecuted by competent political professionals. With House Democrats expected to approve articles of impeachment by Christmas, Senate Republicans are bracing for the trial, and they are imploring Trump to appreciate the gravity of the situation and prepare. Angry tweets and belligerent news conferences are not sufficient. The president is not in danger of losing anywhere near enough Republican support to be removed from office. But without an effective defense against the Democrats’ charges on the Senate floor, voters might conclude impeachment was justified and oust him in 2020.”



Biden called Clinton impeachment 'lynching' - Fox News: “Even as top Democrats rushed to condemn President Trump's comparison of their impeachment inquiry to a ‘lynching,’ footage and news reports have emerged showing several top Democrats referring matter-of-factly to Bill Clinton's impeachment proceedings as a ‘lynching’ in 1998. Among those Democrats are two African-American representatives still serving in the House, as well as House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and presidential contender Joe Biden. Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., called Clinton's impeachment a ‘persecution’ and a ‘political lynching’ on the House floor in 1998. And Danny Davis, D-Ill., condemned what he described as a ‘lynching in the People's House.’ Biden, who has condemned Trump's remarks as ‘abhorrent’ and ‘despicable,’ said in 1998 that a Clinton impeachment could be perceived as a ‘partisan lynching.’”



THE RULEBOOK: SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS

“The language of Virginia is still more pointed on this subject. Her constitution declares, ‘that the legislative, executive, and judiciary departments shall be separate and distinct; so that neither exercise the powers properly belonging to the other; nor shall any person exercise the powers of more than one of them at the same time, except that the justices of county courts shall be eligible to either House of Assembly.’” – James Madison, Federalist No. 47



TIME OUT: BETTER LATE THAN NEVER

Smithsonian: “Leonardo da Vinci wasn’t known for getting things done. He was often years or even decades late when delivering paintings, and many of the fantastical schemes he concocted… Still, new research conducted by engineers at MIT suggests one of the Renaissance giant’s unbuilt designs—a bridge poised to be the world’s longest—would have worked if the artist had actually followed through on his plans. Leonardo drafted his proposal in response to Sultan Bayezid II’s 1502 appeal for bridge designs. Bayezid, ruler of the Ottoman Empire, wanted to connect the cities of Constantinople and Galata, which were separated by a river estuary called the Golden Horn. … Bayezid was unimpressed by Leonardo’s complicated blueprints, and the bridge the artist envisioned was never built—at least until MIT engineer John Ochsendorf stepped in to test the 500-year-old design’s feasibility. …Ochsendorf and his colleagues analyzed materials available in 1502 and determined the Old Master would probably have used stone rather than wood or brick…”

BIDEN BOOMING

CNN: “Former Vice President Joe Biden's lead in the race for the Democratic nomination for president has rebounded, and now stands at its widest margin since April, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. Biden has the support of 34% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters, his best showing in CNN polling since just after his campaign's formal launch on April 25. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont are about even for second, with 19% and 16%, respectively. Behind them, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris of California each have 6% support, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke each at 3%. … Registered voters generally give Biden, Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg large advantages over President Donald Trump in hypothetical general election matchups’ Biden leads the President by 10 points…”



Still rolling in South Carolina - Monmouth University: “Former Vice President Joe Biden remains the clear front-runner among likely Democratic voters in South Carolina. The Monmouth University Poll finds little has changed in overall presidential primary support, but there is evidence that black voters’ preference for the front-runner varies significantly when age and education are taken into account. Biden currently holds 33% support among South Carolina voters who are likely to vote in the February 2020 Democratic primary. … Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (16%) and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (12%) are in the second tier of candidate preferences. … California Sen. Kamala Harris has 6% support… Tom Steyer (4%), South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg (3%), New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (2%), Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar (2%), and entrepreneur Andrew Yang (2%).”



Video shows Warren waffling on Medicare - Mediaite: “Massachusetts Senator and Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren backed off of Bernie Sanders’ ‘Medicare for All’ plan in leaked video of a private meeting with union officials, saying ‘it’s not that I have a plan that says we’re going to do this part and then we’re going to do this part,’ but that ‘we’re going to get to a table like this.’ Warren has vacillated between being ‘with Bernie’ on his health care plan and considering it a mere ‘framework,’ and most recently told CNN’s David Axelrod that Bernie’s plan is ‘my plan.’ But Mediaite has obtained leaked video from an August 23 meeting with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union executive board in which Warren is considerably more vague about the plan.”



Massachusans like Warren, but not so much her health plan - WBUR: “In the race for her party's presidential nomination, home state U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has opened up a wide lead among likely Democratic primary voters in Massachusetts, according to a new WBUR poll. … But the WBUR poll also has a note of caution for Warren. Medicare for All … is less popular among likely Democratic voters in this blue state than a plan that would include a public option… According to the survey, Warren leads a crowded Democratic field, with 33% of likely voters in the primary supporting her. Former Vice President Joe Biden is second with 18%, Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders is at 13%, and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is in fourth place with 7%. Fifteen percent refused to answer or said they didn't know their answer. While Warren probably benefits from home-field advantage, the poll is the latest in a series of recent surveys that show her moving to front-runner status.



HOW TEAM TRUMP MADE RALLIES DATA MINING MACHINES

WSJ: “The most transformational change has been turning rallies into large-scale data-mining operations. The Trump campaign has collected millions of phone numbers, email addresses and other personal information supporters hand over when signing up for text alerts or registering for rally tickets. The Trump team uses the data to reveal people’s political registrations and in which elections they have voted. Then the team cross-references that information with data on their consumer habits—already collected by the Republican Party—to forecast how likely each rallygoer is to vote in 2020 and which candidate the voter will probably support, campaign officials said.

Dem PAC spends big bashing Trump in key general election states - Axios: “A major outside Democratic group is outspending President Trump on Facebook ads in the crucial battleground states of Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Why it matters: 2020 presidential candidates have spent at least $61 million so far this cycle on Facebook and Google ads, with Trump in the lead, according to the Wesleyan Media Project. But that's national spending. The state-by-state spend (below) is important because that's where the 2020 election will be won. … Meanwhile, Priorities USA — a major Democratic super PAC — launched a digital ad campaign in late July ‘focused on holding President Trump accountable’ and highlighting how his economic policies have negatively affected some Americans. The group spent $40 million online in 2016 and they said they plan to spend more than that in 2020.”



Dick’s CEO tries on the idea of a presidential run - Politico: “Ed Stack, the CEO of Dick’s Sporting Goods and a longtime Republican donor, is testing the waters for a possible third-party presidential bid that could scramble the dynamics of the 2020 general election. Various messages were presented to a focus group in southern Wisconsin this week centering on the billionaire businessman, along with possible three-way match-ups against Donald Trump and Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren. The focus group, according to a source who took part in the testing, ran through varying themes involving Stack and heavily focused on his example of ‘showing leadership’ by halting the sale of assault-style rifles at all of Dick’s Sporting Goods stores in the wake of the high school massacre in Parkland, Florida.”



GOP HOLDS NARROW EDGE FOR MISSISSIPPI GOVERNOR

Mississippi Clarion Ledger: “A new poll shows the Mississippi gubernatorial race remains tight with less than two weeks to Election Day. It also found a majority of voters oppose impeaching and removing President Donald Trump from office. … Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves leading Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood 46% to 43%. 2% support third-party candidates Bob Hickingbottom or Dave Singletary … Other recent polls have shown a similarly competitive race, closer than any state governor contest since 2003. Republicans have controlled the governor's mansion since 2004. Mason-Dixon pollsters indicated Trump's scheduled Nov. 1 rally in Tupelo ‘could be a deciding factor’ and offer a ‘significant boost’ for Reeves with GOP turnout. They noted Trump's last-minute campaigning in Louisiana recently helped force incumbent Democrat John Bel Edwards into a runoff.”

“As American people, we do a lot of business in China. And they know and understand our values and we understand their values. And one of our best values in America is free speech.

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I’m at the point where I may hibernate this winter and avoid at all costs any media news. There are so many things I find biased, crooked and overblown, most of all the vendetta against the president. I resent the focus on this as opposed to a new trade policy, immigration reform, poor reports on education in the US, drugs and so many urgent items. Trump wasn’t my first choice for president in 2016, but I supported him when nominated. I don’t care nearly as much about his horrible personality as I do about his policies and the things he’s accomplished. … The polls say ‘Impeach! Elect Socialists! Elect people who are not only corrupt but suffering from delusions or dementia.’ I’m old, cranky and tired of the idiocy. Boo hiss.” – Susan Williams, St. Louis

“Something that is not talked about is, if college tuition became free in the United States is it reasonable for a college student to believe they can choose their college and/or major? One of the casualties of big socialized governments is there is no mechanism to afford personal individuality, uniqueness or desire. Everyone is treated the same. It then seems a reasonable conclusion that all students who want free college tuition to be tested, the government decide what the student demonstrates high aptitude in and the government choses the school and/or major for that student. This would be based on how the government decides the student can best serve the masses, not the individual student’s desires. In the United States we generally believe in mutually beneficial transactions. Meaning, both parties to a transaction receive something. One party receives the quantity and quality of a good or service, the other receives money. Both parties win. It would be a sea change to believe the student would receive both; free education and the choice of where to go and what to major in.” – Jim Hain, Omaha, Neb.



[Ed. note: Well, we do already kind of dabble in that. The federal government provides special incentives for students to choose certain disciplines and for institutions to choose certain types of students – directing research funds to preferred research, creating incentives for encouraging women into STEM, etc. But I take your larger point. If a four-year college degree becomes like high school is now, i.e. a guaranteed good available to all residents, one imagines that the government will take a similarly strong interest in what colleges teach and what students will earn. We have already seen it through the pressures applied to schools via Pell Grants and other forms of funding. But leaving aside the consideration of funding, which is a lulu, the main concern about universal college is that it will diminish the value of college for those who do attend. One of the reasons college has been such a great ladder into the middle class is that it isn’t for everyone. About a third of Americans over 25 have at least a four-year degree. But for Americans over 65, it’s only about a quarter of the population. It stands to reason that new graduates holding college degrees 40 years ago were more valuable than those today. What happens if we see college-going rates soar to 60 percent or more? There are lots of good things about higher education (and plenty of bad things, too). But many of the good things are not about what happens in the classroom – socialization, training in independent living in a controlled atmosphere, a sense of cultural belonging. Those things may or may not be degraded in a world of universal college. But the value of a degree, and thereby its utility for upward socioeconomic mobility, certainly would.]

Bloomberg: “America is sitting on a mountain of uneaten bacon. More than 40 million pounds (18,000 metric tons) of pork bellies, the cut used for bacon making, were sitting in refrigerated warehouses as of Sept. 30, according to U.S. government data released Tuesday. That’s the most for the month since 1971. The overhang came after a buildup in the American hog herd. Pork output surged over the summer months and through September, said Dennis Smith, senior account executive at Archer Financial Services Inc. Bellies have seen a magnified inventory increase because demand is mostly domestic, unlike cuts such as ham, for which overseas buying can help reduce reserves.”

Activists and sexual assault survivors from UltraViolet, a leading national women’s organization, organized the rally. UltraViolet co-founder Shaunna Thomas was front and center, blasting NBC for allegedly failing “to hold sexual abusers accountable” and failing to “combat a toxic culture across newsrooms.”

NBC NEWS REPORTEDLY RENEWS NOAH OPPENHEIM’S CONTRACT, DRAWING OUTRAGE: 'STATUS QUO HAS BEEN BLESSED'

The group called for NBCUniversal to fire NBC News president Noah Oppenheim, MSNBC president Phil Griffin and “every other person in leadership that enabled abusers and silenced survivors” at the Peacock Network.

“It's not just a Matt Lauer problem. It's a company-wide problem. And it's one that Comcast NBC needs to take seriously and demonstrate that they're taking seriously,” Thomas said outside NBC’s famed 30 Rock.

UltraViolet also demanded that the embattled network release all “survivors from non-disclosure agreements,” “end the practice of pre-dispute arbitration for sexual abuse claims” and commission an independent internal investigation into company culture.

NBC KILLED MY SEX ASSAULT STORY AFTER FARROW'S WEINSTEIN PIECE, AUTHOR CLAIMS

Oppenheim – who reportedly recently received a new contract -- has been widely criticized for his role in the handling of the Weinstein and Lauer sexual harassment scandals. Oppenheim is painted as a key figure in NBC’s decision not to run Ronan Farrow’s award-winning report that exposed Weinstein as a sexual predator throughout his book “Catch and Kill.”

Oppenheim famously told Farrow that his Weinstein reporting wasn’t fit to print, so Farrow took it to The New Yorker, where it won the Pulitzer Prize and helped launch the #MeToo movement.

Farrow’s book details his version of why NBC refused to expose Weinstein – which includes allegations that the disgraced movie mogul leveraged the knowledge of Lauer’s own misconduct.

‘TODAY’ ADDRESSES ‘APPALLING’ NEW MATT LAUER REPORT: 'IT’S JUST VERY PAINFUL'

“The fact that Comcast was renewing Noah Oppenheimer's contract while being aware of and knowing that these allegations were coming forward....I think demonstrates that this problem goes right to the top. And that's the parent company, Comcast,” Thomas said.

Farrow’s book also reported that MSNBC’s president, Griffin, once shared a revealing image of TV host Maria Menounos during a staff meeting – which irked one particular protestor.

“I am a huge fan of MSNBC and when I read what this guy did, I could not believe it. He showed a woman's private part at a meeting. You don't do that to anybody,” a protestor told Fox News.

After the Weinstein and Lauer bombshells were reported in 2017, NBC refused to hire an outside investigator to determine who knew about Lauer’s alleged sexual misconduct and whether NBC executives looked the other way. NBC relied on in-house general counsel Kim Harris despite widespread calls for an outside law firm to conduct the review.

RONAN FARROW FIRES BACK AT NBC NEWS BOSS WHO HAS ‘THE MOST TO LOSE FROM THE TRUTH’

NBC eventually declared that management was completely oblivious to Lauer’s behavior and Harris’ high-powered colleagues were cleared by the network – but UltraViolet has vowed not to give up until an independent investigation is launched.

“There is a structural problem with sexual harassment and covering up sexual harassment in a culture that permits that kind of behavior to go on inside this company,” Thomas said. “We would expect that NBC would be a place where it would be safe for women to work and to be able to have their voices heard. And that's not the case. And that's why we're here.”

Another protestor told Fox News that “NBC is particularly guilty of it and refuses to really take any responsibility” for its wrongdoings, while others expressed displeasure that the liberal MSNBC was involved.

“You know, MSNBC is like far left, you know, so those of us who believe in progressive politics, we pay a lot of attention. We listen to them. We watch them. And now to hear that all of this stuff is coming out about how they're suppressing women's voices,” a protestor said."

On Monday, a Wall Street Journal report that NBC had renewed Oppenheim's lucrative contract – despite his roles in the handling of the Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer sexual harassment scandals – sparked widespread outrage both inside and outside 30 Rock.

NBC NEWS REPORTEDLY RENEWS NOAH OPPENHEIM’S CONTRACT, DRAWING OUTRAGE: 'STATUS QUO HAS BEEN BLESSED'

Less than 24 hours later, The Daily Beast published explosive accusations from NBC staffers who were also “furious” over Oppenheim’s “self-dealing,” which includes enlisting “Today” co-anchor Savannah Guthrie to collaborate with his wife, Allison, on a money-making scheme that has been heavily promoted on the top-rated morning show.

Guthrie and Allison Oppenheim co-wrote two popular children’s books “Princesses Wear Pants” and Princesses Save the World,” which encourage female empowerment. The bestselling books have since been spun-off into an animated series and clothing line, according to The Daily Beast.

“Talent promoting books is one thing, but an executive’s spouse getting to promote her business on a program her husband controls is outrageous and borderline graft,” an NBC News insider told Fox News. “Steve Burke should be ashamed of himself letting the Oppenheims use NBC to line their already golden coffers.”

NBC KILLED MY SEX ASSAULT STORY AFTER FARROW'S WEINSTEIN PIECE, AUTHOR CLAIMS

NBCUniversal Chief Executive Steve Burke currently plans for Oppenheim to eventually succeed current NBC News chairman Andy Lack, according to the Journal.

NBC employees have been privately peeved about the arrangement for years, but didn't share their ire until Guthrie reportedly went to bat for Oppenheim amid his ongoing scandals.

The partnership could give Guthrie a financial incentive to defend Oppenheim, who is painted as a key figure in NBC’s decision not to run Ronan Farrow’s award-winning report that exposed Weinstein as a sexual predator throughout his book “Catch and Kill. ”

“The Daily Beast has confirmed that Guthrie and ‘Today’ co-host Hoda Kotb recently defended Oppenheim, and urged that he be kept on, to NBCUniversal chairman Steve Burke,” the Beast reported.

NBCUniversal and NBC News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Daily Beast pointed out that Oppenheim – who moonlights as a Hollywood screenwriter -- also used “Today” to promote his own projects. The report pointed out that Lauer once joked on-air that Oppenheim’s American history book should have been called “Noah Needs a Summer House.”

Farrow’s former NBC News producer Rich McHugh accused Oppenheim of a “massive breach of journalistic integrity” in a scathing Vanity Fair column earlier this month.

The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that NBC quietly renewed Oppenheim’s contract, citing “people familiar with the matter.” The reported decision raised eyebrows across the media industry and McHugh said he was “sad” for NBC employees.

Farrow’s book details his version of why NBC refused to expose Weinstein – which includes allegations that the disgraced movie mogul leveraged the knowledge of Lauer’s own misconduct.

The book also suggests Oppenheim wasn’t truthful regarding knowledge of Lauer’s alleged misconduct. Farrow describes Oppenheim as a “doe-eyed stoner whose mellow seemed impossible to harsh” and said they “laughed about his stories of getting high.” Farrow also says he and Oppenheim “planned to spend a night in with some edibles” before their eventual fallout over the Weinstein reporting.

San Francisco Mayor London Breed announced the measure last week.

In a statement, Breed said: “Every day in this country, women’s reproductive rights are threatened, and we have to fight back. Just as we restricted spending with states that have laws that discriminate against LGBTQ people, we are standing up against states that put women’s health at risk and that are actively working to limit reproductive freedoms.""

She added: “By limiting travel and contracting with certain states, we are sending a clear message to states that disregard the right to abortion.”

However, some of the representatives of the 22 states singled out aren't happy about the policy. Nebraska's Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts took to Twitter, writing that ""Nebraska is a proudly #prolife state, and this demonstrates shocking intolerance by coastal elites that is divisive to our nation.""

Host of ""Special Report"" Bret Baier said that while the money offset is unclear, this doesn't amount to nothing.

""It does amount to an issue in a political race...and I think Governor Ricketts is on to something there,"" he said.

""There is this disconnect that plays out every election cycle. Where, the middle of America says, 'Listen, that's kind of over the top,'"" he told Melissa Francis, ""And, that disconnect – he calls them coastal elites, whatever you call it – is real and present in American politics today.""

""It's dangerous, I would even say. The idea of isolating someone you don't agree with is just not a good idea. It's not American,"" added former Obama administration aide Johanna Maska.

Republican strategist and Fox News contributor Lisa Boothe told the couch that ""where you lose that [collaboration] is when you start labeling people as things"" which immediately alienates them.

However, she also noted that the issue of life has ""less common ground"" because it's ""a deeply-held belief by so many Americans.""

“I take it that no Comcast board member has read Ronan’s book or my article. I am sad for all NBC News employees that the status quo has been blessed,” McHugh told Fox News.

Former NBC News correspondent Linda Vester agreed.

“Comcast/NBC Universal is extending the contract of an individual who lied to staff and shareholders when he said they ‘have no secrets and nothing to hide.’ Not only does it encourage harassment victims to start telling those secrets, it invites a shareholder lawsuit against Comcast,” Vester told Fox News. “In my view, shareholders could sue the company for breach of fiduciary duty by using corporate assets to make secret payoffs for personal wrongs. What shareholder would agree to Comcast secretly using their money for coverups?”

Vester is a vocal critic of the Peacock Network’s culture since she accused Tom Brokaw of sexual misconduct last year (a claim Brokaw denied). Vester is part of a high-powered group of women who have called for a new investigation into alleged misconduct at the network.

The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that NBC quietly renewed Oppenheim’s contract, citing “people familiar with the matter.” The reported decision raised eyebrows across the media industry, as Oppenheim has been at the center of numerous controversies in recent memory. In addition to the Weinstein scandal, Oppenheim was recently mocked by his own staffers when fielding questions about his knowledge of Matt Lauer’s alleged misconduct, while controversial columns he wrote in college were unearthed earlier this month.

NBC News did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation.

NBCUniversal Chief Executive Steve Burke currently plans for Oppenheim to succeed Lack, according to the Journal. However, an NBCUniversal insider told Fox News that Burke is “extremely fickle” and has given extensions to executives before shortly before firing them in the past.

NYT: “When a half-dozen Democratic donors gathered at the Whitby Hotel in Manhattan last week, the dinner began with a discussion of which presidential candidates the contributors liked. But as conversations among influential Democrats often go these days, the meeting quickly evolved into a discussion of who was not in the race — but could be lured in. Would Hillary Clinton get in, the contributors wondered, and how about Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor? One person even mused whether Michelle Obama would consider a late entry, according to two people who attended the event, which was hosted by the progressive group American Bridge. It’s that time of the election season for Democrats. ‘Since the last debate, just anecdotally, I’ve had five or six people ask me: ‘Is there anybody else?’ said Leah Daughtry, a longtime Democrat who has run two of the party’s recent conventions.”

Warren ups the ante another $800 billion - WSJ: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling for $800 billion in additional federal funding for public education, a move that would exhaust the remaining revenue to be raised by her proposed wealth tax even as she seeks ways to finance Medicare for All. Ms. Warren outlined on the blog site Medium an additional $450 billion in Title I funding to boost schools with low-income students, $200 billion in grants for students with disabilities and $100 billion in other grants over 10 years. She also vowed to invest $50 billion in school infrastructure on top of existing funding for school upgrades that are in some of her other policy proposals.”



Castro promises to quit if he can’t raise $800,000 in 10 days - Politico: “Julián Castro on Monday threatened to suspend his presidential bid unless he can raise nearly $1 million by the end of the month. ‘If I can’t raise $800,000 in the next 10 days — I will have no choice but to end my race for president,’ Castro wrote in a fundraising email to supporters. ‘If I don’t meet this deadline, I won’t have the resources to keep my campaign running.’ The strategy is nearly identical to Cory Booker’s ‘radical transparency’ gambit last month, when his campaign warned in a memo to supporters that the New Jersey senator would end his White House bid if he was unable to raise $1.7 million in the final 10 days of September.”



Buttigieg’s sexuality a hurdle with black voters - The [Columbia, S.C.] State: “Internal focus groups conducted by Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign this summer reveal a key reason why he is struggling with African-American voters: many see his sexuality as a problem. The 21-page report, conducted by the Benenson Strategy Group with black Democratic South Carolina voters in mid-July and obtained exclusively by McClatchy, found that ‘being gay was a barrier for these voters, particularly for the men who seemed deeply uncomfortable even discussing it. … [T]heir preference is for his sexuality to not be front and center. While the report stated that Buttigieg’s sexuality was not a ‘disqualifier’ for these voters, some of the focus group participants questioned why Buttigieg even brought it up.’



Facebook ramps up election security efforts ahead of 2020 - AP: “With just over a year left until the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Facebook is stepping up its efforts to ensure it is not used as a tool to interfere in politics and democracies around the world. The efforts include a special security tool for elected officials and candidates that monitors them for hacking attempts. Facebook said Monday it will also label state-controlled media as such, label fact-checks more clearly and invest $2 million in media literacy projects. The company says it will add more prominent labels on debunked posts on Facebook as well as on Instagram. It will put labels on top of what are deemed ‘false’ and ‘partly false’ photos and videos.”



THE RULEBOOK: OF NOTE

“Every candid reader will make the proper reflections on these important facts.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 38



TIME OUT: ‘EVERYONE’S GOT THEIR THING’

NYT: “The pressures of sexual selection have made peacocks gorgeous, wood thrushes sonorous and birds of paradise great dancers. At first glance, the white bellbird doesn’t appear to have benefited similarly. Barrel-chested and big-mouthed, with a long wattle dangling from the top of its beak, this rainforest bird looks more like a Muppet than an avian Casanova. But everyone’s got their thing. According to a paper published Monday in Current Biology, this goofball boasts the loudest birdsong ever recorded. And he must be proud of it, because he sings the most piercing note right into potential mates’ faces. The white bellbird — one of four bellbird species in South and Central America — is a favorite among birders in Brazil. It has a ‘strange, metallic, kind of alien call,’ said Caio Brito, one of the founders of Brazil Birding Experts. When several sing at once, they are ‘deafening,’ and sound like ‘several blacksmiths trying to compete,’ said Arthur Gomes, a biology student at São Paulo State University who contributed to the new research.”

IMPEACHMENT TIMING GETS TRICKIER FOR HOUSE DEMS

NYT: “House Democrats have resigned themselves to the likelihood that impeachment proceedings against President Trump will extend into the Christmas season, as they plan a series of public hearings intended to make the simplest and most devastating possible public case in favor of removing Mr. Trump. Democratic leaders had hoped to move as soon as Thanksgiving to wrap up a narrow inquiry focused around Mr. Trump’s dealings with Ukraine, buoyed by polling data that shows that the public supports the investigation, even if voters are not yet sold on impeaching the president. But after a complicated web of damaging revelations about the president has emerged from private depositions unfolding behind closed doors, Democratic leaders have now begun plotting a full-scale — and probably more time-consuming — effort to lay out their case in a set of high-profile public hearings on Capitol Hill.”



Diplomat who raised red flag on Giuliani-Trump deal testifies today - Reuters: “William Taylor, a former Army officer and career U.S. diplomat now leading the U.S. embassy in Kiev, will be the latest in a series of current and former officials to meet behind closed doors with the Democratic-led House of Representatives Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight Committees in the month since the probe began. Committee members and staff are examining whether the Republican Trump abused his office by improperly putting pressure on Ukraine to launch an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival and leading candidate for the Democratic 2020 presidential nomination. Taylor’s testimony is of particular interest to investigators because of his leading role at the embassy in Ukraine. He raised concern about military assistance being withheld from Kiev to put pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.”



Schiff un-censured - Fox News: “The Democratic-led House of Representatives voted Monday evening to table, or set aside, a resolution to censure House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., for his handling of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump. The vote was 218 to 185 to table the resolution, which the Republican minority had introduced. All Democrats voted to table the censure resolution, with all Republicans voting against tabling. Independent Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, who left the Republican Party earlier this year, voted to table the resolution.”



President Trump draws ire of black lawmakers for ‘lynching’ claim - AP: “President Donald Trump enraged Democrats on Tuesday by comparing their impeachment inquiry to a lynching, assigning the horrors of a deadly and racist chapter in U.S. history to a process laid out in the Constitution. ‘That is one word no president ought to apply to himself,’ said Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, the highest-ranking African American in Congress. ‘That is a word that we ought to be very, very careful about using’ he said. Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., called on Trump to delete the tweet.”



MICK MULVANEY: KICKING GAFFES AND TAKING NAMES

Reuters: “U.S. President Donald Trump has been fielding suggestions from allies on who might succeed his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, amid frustration at his team’s response to the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, two sources close to the White House said on Monday. Trump’s irritation at being dogged by a variety of issues - from impeachment to his decision to move U.S. troops out of northeastern Syria - was on display on Monday in the White House Cabinet Room as the president aired his grievances at length before his senior advisers and a group of reporters. The president has been focused in part on Mulvaney’s comments to reporters last week that Trump had withheld military aid from Ukraine in an effort to get Kiev to investigate a debunked claim about the 2016 U.S. election.”



Cuccinelli blocked from DHS job - AP: “President Donald Trump has been notified by his staff that he can’t select two popular figures — Ken Cuccinelli and Mark Morgan — to serve as an acting secretary of homeland security because a federal law governing agency succession makes them ineligible. Instead, Sean Doocey, the White House director of presidential personnel, in recent days gave Trump a list of other officials to consider as acting secretary, including top DHS official Chad Wolf and Transportation Security Administration chief David Pekoske, according to three people familiar with the conversation. The news has infuriated immigration hawks inside and outside the administration who had been lobbying for Cuccinelli to fill the role and now fear Trump will tap Wolf, a former chief of staff to ousted DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen who once worked as a lobbyist on employment visas.”



TRUMP LOOKS SOUTH FOR A BOOST

Politico: “Donald Trump is going all-in on a trio of Southern governor’s races in November, gambling that a clean sweep will help him regain his political footing at the most perilous moment of his presidency. Trump is expected to barnstorm Kentucky, Mississippi, and Louisiana over the next few weeks, while dispatching prominent supporters to help in each contest. And Vice President Mike Pence is planning a bus tour through eastern Kentucky, a pivotal area on the state’s political map that could decide the fate of Republican Gov. Matt Bevin. Trump badly needs a boost right now, and the White House sees the elections in the conservative states as the best near-term hope of achieving it.”



Impeachment adds windage to Kentucky contest - WSJ: “The gubernatorial election in Kentucky next month hinges in large part on whether voters are motivated by bread-and-butter issues close to home or national politics supercharged by the impeachment inquiry into President Trump. It is one of three governor’s races this year, along with those in Louisiana and Mississippi, that can offer insights on the electorate’s mood ahead of the 2020 presidential election.”

[Ed. note: You will be so glad you did! “Opinions are luxury items” is a close cousin to one of my dad’s favorites: “You can be happy or you can be right, but not usually both.” In our relationships it matters so much more that we listen and really hear each other. The simple but always challenging act of loving our neighbors starts by talking with them, which can’t happen if we’re talking at them. This not only makes us happier people and better friends, spouses and parents it also lets us save our strongest defenses for the things that matter the most.]

PICTURE DAY IS THE WURST

WSVN: “A 4th grader had a unique outfit for his school photo. Craig Arsenault posted a photo of his son Jake’s school ID. For his school photo, Jake dressed up in a hot dog costume. ‘My wife and I dared our son to wear a hot dog costume for school pictures. The school let him do it, and I couldn’t be happier,’ Arsenault said. According to Fox 13, Arsenault said the family had the costume “laying around for (the) last year,” and the idea came up when Jake voiced his wonder about what to wear for his school photo. ‘My wife suggested the hot dog costume. He was hesitant, so we bet him 10 bucks he wouldn’t do it,’ the father said. However, Jake accepted the dare and donned the costume for his photo. … Arsenault said he only had $7 at the time, which he gave to his son, but his son is holding him to the other $3.”

But the former vice president’s lead is taking a hit as top-tier rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s support soars in the contest the Biden campaign sees as a firewall.

Biden – who has longstanding ties in the state – stands at 33 percent among South Carolina voters likely to cast a ballot in the state’s February primary, according to a new poll from Monmouth University. That’s down 6 percentage points from Monmouth’s previous survey in the Palmetto State, which was conducted in July.

THE LATEST 2020 POLLING FROM FOX NEWS

Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, stands at 16 percent in the survey, a jump of 7 points from July.

Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is in third in the new poll, at 12 percent. The populist independent senator from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House bid stood at 10 percent in the previous survey.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who stood at 12 percent in the July survey, saw her support drop in half and now comes in at 6 percent in the new poll.

Environmental and progressive advocate and former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer has the backing of 4 percent of likely South Carolina Democratic primary voters, with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 3 percent, and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang each at 2 percent. The remaining nine candidates in the record-setting Democratic presidential field all register at 1 percent or less.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Besides the topline findings, the poll also has warning signs for Biden among South Carolina’s black voters, who make up more than half of the likely Democratic primary electorate. The former vice president’s position as either a first- or second-choice candidate dropped by 10 points among black voters to 52 percent, while Warren’s position as a top-two choice contender jumped 11 points to 26 percent.

“Biden is still in a pretty good position in South Carolina, but there are some signs that he might not have a true firewall among black voters. If he does not do well in the earlier contests in February, there may be potential for current preferences to shift here,” Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray said in a statement.

The Monmouth University Poll was conducted Oct. 16-21, with 402 South Carolina voters likely to cast a ballot in the Democratic presidential primary questioned by live telephone operators. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points."

The independent senator and 2020 presidential primary contender announced on Thursday his plan to legalize marijuana by executive order within the first 100 days of his administration should he win the White House.

Sanders, whose home state of Vermont in 2018 legalized possession of one ounce of pot and let each adult resident grow two plants for personal use, has long been a supporter of decriminalizing marijuana nationwide. He’s argued that the criminalization of the drug has ravaged communities of color and created an unequal incarceration rate.

“Too many lives were ruined due to the disastrous criminalization of marijuana,” Sanders wrote in a tweet announcing his plan.

Along with legalizing marijuana nationwide, Sanders also proposed expunging all past marijuana-related convictions and funneling some of the revenue from the legal marijuana business into communities hardest hit by the so-called War on Drugs.

“When we talk about criminal justice reform and ending institutional racism in America, we are talking about ending the disastrous War on Drugs, which has disproportionately targeted people of color and ruined the lives of millions of Americans,” his campaign said in a statement.

“It is time to admit the criminalization of marijuana was a disaster, especially for communities of color, and allow those most impacted to move forward with their lives. Our job now is to legalize marijuana and vacate and expunge past marijuana convictions, and ensure that revenue from legal marijuana is reinvested in communities hit hardest by the War on Drugs.”

Legalizing marijuana has gone from a once-fringe issue to a mainstream topic of debate as more states have let residents buy and grow pot.

OCASIO-CORTEZ, OMAR, TLAIB TO ENDORSE BERNIE SANDERS

Ten states and the District of Columbia already have legalized recreational marijuana, while there are only nine states in the nation where the drug remains fully illegal. Most states either have decriminalized it or have allowed it to be sold for medical uses.

A recent poll from Gallup found that 66 percent of Americans supported fully legalizing marijuana, almost double the number from 2005 when only 35 percent supported the move.

The sentiment across the country has been reflected among the 2020 Democrats with all supporting at least some form of legalization or decriminalization of the drug.

While Sanders was the first candidate to lay out an extensive plan for legalizing marijuana, fellow candidates and senators such as Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California have supported the Marijuana Justice Act. Introduced by Booker, the legislation would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act and expunge existing cannabis-related criminal records.

The only major candidates who haven’t supported full legalization: former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.

Biden said he supported decriminalization and rescheduling, criminal-record expungement and increased research access to marijuana, but argued it should be up to states to decide whether to legalize the drug. Klobuchar has said she supported decriminalization and legalization, but so far has not gone into specifics on her stance."

“I have, a handful of times, a long time ago, and I’ve also encountered a lot of people whose lives have really been shaken by the old war on drugs approach,” Buttigieg told Fox News in Las Vegas.

Nevada legalized marijuana for recreational use in 2017. Several other states have made similar moves, although the drug is still considered illegal on the federal level.

Buttigieg's ambitious proposal has been to “decriminalize all drug possession” while expanding access to addiction treatments and improving drug-abuse and mental-health treatment.

Buttigieg also said legalizing pot would carry numerous business advantages.

“First of all, without legalization, you’re going to continue to see a patchwork of different state laws that create a lot of problems for legitimate businesses like this one,” Buttigieg said outside the Top Notch dispensary in Vegas on a campaign stop.

He added, “We not only need to legalize but we also need to pursue experiments, knowing the racial disparity and lives that have been ruined by sentences over marijuana possession.”

Other 2020 Democrats seemed to be on the same page.

Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke toured an Oakland, Calif., dispensary last month, and called for allocating monthly stipends to people who were previously locked up for low-level marijuana offenses as a form of recompense.

Meantime, other candidates have admitted to using the drug before. California Sen. Kamala Harris, in a radio interview earlier this year, said, “I have, and I inhaled -- I did inhale. It was a long time ago, but yes.”

ZUCKERBERG ADMITS TO ADVISING BUTTIGIEG ON HIRES, SAYS IT'S NOT AN ENDORSEMENT

Sen. Bernie Sanders, when running in the 2016 primaries, also acknowledged he tried it a couple of times.

“I smoked marijuana twice — didn’t quite work for me,” he told Yahoo! News.

Candidates have split over how they would legalize marijuana federally. Buttigieg said it would need to be done through the proper legislative channels, while Sanders has expressed that he would use an executive order to carry it out.

Buttigieg agreed that the stigma surrounding marijuana use should diminish.

He also made a pitch specifically to veterans. “Yeah, so I've met a lot of veterans who rely on cannabis for the treatment of diagnosed or undiagnosed issues, often service-connected issues like post-traumatic stress. And, another benefit of decriminalization is, it could pave the way for this to be supported with” the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Asked by another reporter if he had bought any items in the dispensary, which he compared to an Apple Store in appearance, he said: “I will not. I’m on the clock and it’s gonna be a long day.”"

Elizabeth Warren enjoys a widening lead over former Vice President Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination — though another recent survey showed Biden holding the top spot.

Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, grabs the support of 28 percent of Democrats and independent voters who lean toward the Democrats in a survey released Thursday by Quinnipiac University. Biden stands at 21 percent in the poll, with populist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 15 percent.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

In Quinnipiac’s previous survey – conducted prior to the Oct. 15 fourth round Democratic debate – Warren had a slight 30-27 percent edge over Biden. But her advantage was within the poll’s margin of error. Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House bid, was at 11 percent.

Quinnipiac’s new survey showing Warren with a clear lead outside the sampling error stands in stark contrast to a national CNN poll conducted by SSRS released a day earlier that suggested Biden at 34 percent, with Warren a distant second at 19 percent and Sanders at 16 percent. The former vice president’s 15 percentage point lead was his largest since April in CNN polling.

During the spring and summer Biden remained the unrivaled front-runner in the Democratic 2020 battle, but then Warren surged and has been tied with the former vice president in many national and early primary and caucus voting state polls this autumn.

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg grabs 10 percent support in the new Quinnipiac poll, with Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 5 percent and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota at 3 percent. According to Klobuchar’s campaign, their candidate has now reached the polling threshold and qualifies for the next debate, which will be held next month in Georgia.

No other candidate in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential contenders topped 1 percent in the poll.

""Former Vice President Joe Biden slips, Senator Elizabeth Warren steadies, Senator Bernie Sanders gets his groove back, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg breaks back into double digits,"" Quinnipiac University polling analyst Mary Snow said in a statement.

The survey indicates Biden is still viewed as the candidate who has the best chance of winning against President Trump in the 2020 election. But his electability has deteriorated, from a high of 56 percent days after he declared his candidacy in late April, to 42 percent now.

Thirty percent of those questioned say Warren has the best policy ideas, topping the rest of the field. And Sanders is viewed as the most honest Democratic White House contender, at 28 percent.

THE LATEST 2020 POLLING FROM FOX NEWS

Among the nearly three-quarters of those polled who said they either watched October’s debate or paid close attention to news stories about it, 26 percent said Warren did the best job, followed by Buttigieg with 17 percent, Biden with 12 percent, Sanders at 11 percent, and Klobuchar at 8 percent. When asked who did the worst job in the recent debate, 15 percent said Biden and 11 percent said Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii.

""Despite coming under attack at the debate, Senator Elizabeth Warren was viewed as doing the best job, followed by South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigeig, which may have helped his standing in the primary,” Snow said. ""Last week's debate didn't help Vice President Joe Biden.”

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted Oct. 17 - 21, with 1,587 self-identified registered voters — including 713 Democratic voters and independents who lean toward the Democratic Party, questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s margin of effort for Democratic primary questions is plus or minus 4.6 percentage points."

The event, to be co-hosted by The Washington Post on November 20, marks MSNBC's second debate gig this election cycle.

Maddow will be joined by MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell, NBC News White House correspondent Kristen Welker and Washington Post White House reporter Ashley Parker, an all-woman panel of moderators, the network said.

NBC raised eyebrows for including Maddow, who drew ratings for its cable network for pushing what critics have described as ""conspiracy theories"" during the two-year Russia investigation, as a debate moderator earlier this year as such a position is usually assigned to serious, unbiased journalists.

Maddow's debate performance was widely criticized for keeping much of her focus on the findings of then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report.

MSNBC OPINION HOST RACHEL MADDOW'S DEBATE PRESENCE WAS 'A LOSS FOR JOURNALISM,' CRITICS SAY

""One would think that NBC News, which purports to be a news organization, would go above and beyond to make sure its hosts’ line of questioning was fair and honest, especially given the backlash the network received for its decision to have a far-left pundit moderate a presidential debate,"" BlazeTV White House correspondent Jon Miller told Fox News.

Others slammed the ""conspiracy theorist"" on social media, saying her presence at a presidential debate was a ""disgrace.""

NBC has been under fire in recent weeks in the wake of the reporting from ""Catch and Kill"" author Ronan Farrow, who detailed the network's efforts to kill his Harvey Weinstein story and the alleged yearslong misconduct from its former star anchor Matt Lauer.

NBC NEWS REPORTEDLY RENEWS NOAH OPPENHEIM'S CONTRACT, DRAWING OUTRAGE: 'STATUS QUO HAS BEEN BLESSED'

Last week, a prominent women’s group called on the Democratic National Committee to pull its upcoming debate from MSNBC unless NBC News ""cleans house"" and launches an independent investigation into ""allegations of a culture of sexual abuse"" at the network.

UltraViolet Action, a leading national women’s organization, claimed the Democrats' fifth presidential debate shouldn’t happen if NBC didn't ditch its beleaguered leadership.

""The DNC needs to make it clear that they support survivors of sexual abuse and cancel the upcoming 2020 Democratic presidential primary debate on MSNBC until Comcast and NBC News take clear steps to clean up the toxic culture that exists across their networks,"" UltraViolet co-founder Shaunna Thomas said in a statement.

On Wednesday, a group of activists and sexual assault survivors from the organization held a protest outside NBC News' New York City headquarters.

The group called for NBCUniversal to fire NBC News president Noah Oppenheim, MSNBC president Phil Griffin and ""every other person in leadership that enabled abusers and silenced survivors"" at the Peacock Network.

""It's not just a Matt Lauer problem. It's a company-wide problem, and it's one that Comcast NBC needs to take seriously and demonstrate that they're taking seriously,"" Thomas said outside NBC’s famed 30 Rock.

Amy Klobuchar.,2019-10-23,Fox News,"Amy Klobuchar making crucial Iowa push ahead of November debate, caucus",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/klobuchar-iowa-debate-caucus,"NEWTON, Iowa — As an Iowa native, 18-year-old Kayla Cook is no stranger to the Hawkeye State's starring political role every four years as presidential candidates make their pitch to voters.

But this year is different for her — and not just because she will be able to officially caucus for the first time. Cook, who is used to following her parents to meet-and-greets supporting the Republican Party, is switching to the other side this election cycle and planning to vote for a Democrat.

“As a Republican, I look at where our nation is right now and I see a lot of division,” she said. “I just want to see unity in our country again and I know it can happen.”

Cook is pinning her hopes on the senator from next-door Minnesota, Amy Klobuchar. That’s why the 18-year-old stopped what she was doing on a Sunday afternoon for a meet-and-greet with the senator in Newton, Iowa.

BIG POST-DEBATE CASH HAULS FOR BUTTIGIEG, KLOBUCHAR COULD SPELL TROUBLE FOR BIDEN

It was a crowded room, with a few chairs, and standing room only at the Lemon Tree Tea House and Restaurant.

“I just know it needs to be someone who is moderate who cares both about the Republicans and Democrats and I believe she’s someone who could do that,” said Cook.

While most Democratic presidential candidates are stepping up their ground game in the key early state of Iowa, Klobuchar is making a big push in the state, hoping to continue to reach people like Cook.

It’s a crucial moment for her campaign as she tries to build momentum, which starts in the first-in-the-nation caucus state.

Klobuchar only has a few weeks left to qualify for the next Democratic debate in November. She needs a boost in the polls to reach that goal, which is part of the reason why she’s launching a digital ad campaign to target voters.

The senator is also making counties won by President Trump in 2016 and former president Barack Obama in 2012 a top priority during her “All For America Bus Tour.”

For three days straight, Klobuchar’s bright green bus traveled to Dubuque, Black Hawk, Gurthie and Jasper Counties to listen to the concerns from voters.

She spoke to veterans, restaurant owners and even companies like W2 fuel, a biodiesel company whose CEO Roy Strom told the press that his biodiesel plant was forced to close due to waivers granted from the current administration for oil refineries, which hurt the price value for biodiesel products.

“At the last debate, we’ve got a lot of attention nationally and brought in over a million dollars in small contributions in just 24 hours. We did that by reaching out to people,” said Klobuchar. “I don’t have the big state and I don’t have the big-name ID as some of these other people so, it’s going to take a little more time.”

A recent poll from Suffolk University and USA Today ranks the senator as sixth among Iowa caucus-goers, tying her with California Sen. Kamala Harris and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.

Political analysts say it’s a do-or-die moment for Klobuchar’s campaign

“There’s still time for Sen. Klobuchar but the problem is she’s sort of had is that she’s looking for that middle lane or that moderate Democrat and Joe Biden was occupying that pretty strongly,” said Tim Hagle, professor of politics at the University of Iowa. “But now that he seems like he’s sort of fading a little bit, and if that continues, that opens up that lane.”

GREG GUTFELD AND JUAN WILLIAMS PICK THEIR DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE'S WINNERS AND LOSER

Complicating matters is South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who Hagle said is giving Klobuchar a run for her money as the stand-out Midwest candidate.

“With Klobuchar, at least what she has going for her is that she can say, 'I have experience in Congress, I know how to get things done,' and she can talk about all the things she has gotten done, so in that respect, she has an advantage,” Hagle said."

On the roster: Support for impeachment reaches new high - Biden booming - How Team Trump made rallies data mining machines - GOP holds narrow edge for Mississippi governor - We can do it!



SUPPORT FOR IMPEACHMENT REACHES NEW HIGH

Quinnipiac University: “Approval among American voters of the U.S. House impeachment inquiry, an inquiry to determine whether or not to bring impeachment charges against President Trump, has reached its highest level, as 55 percent approve of the inquiry, while 43 percent disapprove, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. Last week, 51 percent of voters approved of the inquiry, while 45 percent disapproved. In today's poll, Democrats approve of the inquiry 93 - 7 percent and independent voters approve 58 - 37 percent, while Republicans disapprove of the inquiry 88 - 10 percent. … Nearly half of registered voters, 48 percent, say President Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 46 percent say he should not. Last week, 46 percent supported impeachment while 48 percent were opposed. In today's poll, support for impeachment is 86 - 9 percent among Democrats, and 49 - 41 percent among independents, while Republicans oppose impeachment 91 - 6 percent.”



Trump approval dropping - Quinnipiac University: “President Trump’s job approval rating has dipped below 40 percent for the first time since the impeachment inquiry began as 38 percent say they approve of the job he is doing, and 58 percent disapprove. Last week, 41 percent approved of the president’s job performance, while 54 percent disapproved. This is President Trump’s lowest net approval rating since a July 2018 poll. … Nancy Pelosi gets a mixed approval rating as 45 percent approve of the job she is doing as Speaker of the House, while 47 percent disapprove. Mitch McConnell’s approval rating is deep underwater as 57 percent of voters disapprove of the job he is doing as Senate Majority Leader, while only 24 percent approve.”



Top diplomat’s testimony rattles Congress - NYT: “[During] explosive testimony on Tuesday, William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, laid out in visceral terms the stakes of what he saw as an illegitimate scheme to pressure the Kiev government for political help by suspending American security aid. In by far the most damning account yet to become public in the House impeachment inquiry Mr. Taylor described a president holding up $391 million in assistance for the clear purpose of forcing Ukraine to help incriminate Mr. Trump’s domestic rivals. Mr. Trump’s actions, he testified, undercut American allies desperately fighting off Russia’s attempt to redraw the boundaries of Europe through force.”



Trump defenders storm deposition, shut down probe in protest - WaPo: “A group of House Republicans temporarily shut down the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry on Wednesday, barging into a secure room where a witness was set to testify and refusing to leave despite orders from top Democrats. A group of about two-dozen Trump allies stormed a room in the Capitol basement where three investigative committees were supposed to hear testimony from Laura Cooper, the Pentagon official who oversees Ukraine policy. Those members were not on the committees of jurisdiction and were not supposed to be present during the closed-door deposition. A shouting match began between Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.) and some Democrats in the room as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) left to consult with the sergeant at arms…”



Senate Republicans caution Trump on chaos - WashEx: “Senate Republicans are warning President Trump that he risks bungling impeachment politically and alienating voters, even as he survives a Senate trial, without a focused strategy prosecuted by competent political professionals. With House Democrats expected to approve articles of impeachment by Christmas, Senate Republicans are bracing for the trial, and they are imploring Trump to appreciate the gravity of the situation and prepare. Angry tweets and belligerent news conferences are not sufficient. The president is not in danger of losing anywhere near enough Republican support to be removed from office. But without an effective defense against the Democrats’ charges on the Senate floor, voters might conclude impeachment was justified and oust him in 2020.”



Biden called Clinton impeachment 'lynching' - Fox News: “Even as top Democrats rushed to condemn President Trump's comparison of their impeachment inquiry to a ‘lynching,’ footage and news reports have emerged showing several top Democrats referring matter-of-factly to Bill Clinton's impeachment proceedings as a ‘lynching’ in 1998. Among those Democrats are two African-American representatives still serving in the House, as well as House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and presidential contender Joe Biden. Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., called Clinton's impeachment a ‘persecution’ and a ‘political lynching’ on the House floor in 1998. And Danny Davis, D-Ill., condemned what he described as a ‘lynching in the People's House.’ Biden, who has condemned Trump's remarks as ‘abhorrent’ and ‘despicable,’ said in 1998 that a Clinton impeachment could be perceived as a ‘partisan lynching.’”



THE RULEBOOK: SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS

“The language of Virginia is still more pointed on this subject. Her constitution declares, ‘that the legislative, executive, and judiciary departments shall be separate and distinct; so that neither exercise the powers properly belonging to the other; nor shall any person exercise the powers of more than one of them at the same time, except that the justices of county courts shall be eligible to either House of Assembly.’” – James Madison, Federalist No. 47



TIME OUT: BETTER LATE THAN NEVER

Smithsonian: “Leonardo da Vinci wasn’t known for getting things done. He was often years or even decades late when delivering paintings, and many of the fantastical schemes he concocted… Still, new research conducted by engineers at MIT suggests one of the Renaissance giant’s unbuilt designs—a bridge poised to be the world’s longest—would have worked if the artist had actually followed through on his plans. Leonardo drafted his proposal in response to Sultan Bayezid II’s 1502 appeal for bridge designs. Bayezid, ruler of the Ottoman Empire, wanted to connect the cities of Constantinople and Galata, which were separated by a river estuary called the Golden Horn. … Bayezid was unimpressed by Leonardo’s complicated blueprints, and the bridge the artist envisioned was never built—at least until MIT engineer John Ochsendorf stepped in to test the 500-year-old design’s feasibility. …Ochsendorf and his colleagues analyzed materials available in 1502 and determined the Old Master would probably have used stone rather than wood or brick…”

BIDEN BOOMING

CNN: “Former Vice President Joe Biden's lead in the race for the Democratic nomination for president has rebounded, and now stands at its widest margin since April, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. Biden has the support of 34% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters, his best showing in CNN polling since just after his campaign's formal launch on April 25. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont are about even for second, with 19% and 16%, respectively. Behind them, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris of California each have 6% support, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke each at 3%. … Registered voters generally give Biden, Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg large advantages over President Donald Trump in hypothetical general election matchups’ Biden leads the President by 10 points…”



Still rolling in South Carolina - Monmouth University: “Former Vice President Joe Biden remains the clear front-runner among likely Democratic voters in South Carolina. The Monmouth University Poll finds little has changed in overall presidential primary support, but there is evidence that black voters’ preference for the front-runner varies significantly when age and education are taken into account. Biden currently holds 33% support among South Carolina voters who are likely to vote in the February 2020 Democratic primary. … Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (16%) and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (12%) are in the second tier of candidate preferences. … California Sen. Kamala Harris has 6% support… Tom Steyer (4%), South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg (3%), New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (2%), Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar (2%), and entrepreneur Andrew Yang (2%).”



Video shows Warren waffling on Medicare - Mediaite: “Massachusetts Senator and Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren backed off of Bernie Sanders’ ‘Medicare for All’ plan in leaked video of a private meeting with union officials, saying ‘it’s not that I have a plan that says we’re going to do this part and then we’re going to do this part,’ but that ‘we’re going to get to a table like this.’ Warren has vacillated between being ‘with Bernie’ on his health care plan and considering it a mere ‘framework,’ and most recently told CNN’s David Axelrod that Bernie’s plan is ‘my plan.’ But Mediaite has obtained leaked video from an August 23 meeting with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union executive board in which Warren is considerably more vague about the plan.”



Massachusans like Warren, but not so much her health plan - WBUR: “In the race for her party's presidential nomination, home state U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has opened up a wide lead among likely Democratic primary voters in Massachusetts, according to a new WBUR poll. … But the WBUR poll also has a note of caution for Warren. Medicare for All … is less popular among likely Democratic voters in this blue state than a plan that would include a public option… According to the survey, Warren leads a crowded Democratic field, with 33% of likely voters in the primary supporting her. Former Vice President Joe Biden is second with 18%, Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders is at 13%, and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is in fourth place with 7%. Fifteen percent refused to answer or said they didn't know their answer. While Warren probably benefits from home-field advantage, the poll is the latest in a series of recent surveys that show her moving to front-runner status.



HOW TEAM TRUMP MADE RALLIES DATA MINING MACHINES

WSJ: “The most transformational change has been turning rallies into large-scale data-mining operations. The Trump campaign has collected millions of phone numbers, email addresses and other personal information supporters hand over when signing up for text alerts or registering for rally tickets. The Trump team uses the data to reveal people’s political registrations and in which elections they have voted. Then the team cross-references that information with data on their consumer habits—already collected by the Republican Party—to forecast how likely each rallygoer is to vote in 2020 and which candidate the voter will probably support, campaign officials said. A yet-to-be released smartphone app will offer supporters certain perks, such as accelerated entry into rallies, in exchange for putting the campaign in contact with friends who might back the president and hand over personal data.”



Dem PAC spends big bashing Trump in key general election states - Axios: “A major outside Democratic group is outspending President Trump on Facebook ads in the crucial battleground states of Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Why it matters: 2020 presidential candidates have spent at least $61 million so far this cycle on Facebook and Google ads, with Trump in the lead, according to the Wesleyan Media Project. But that's national spending. The state-by-state spend (below) is important because that's where the 2020 election will be won. … Meanwhile, Priorities USA — a major Democratic super PAC — launched a digital ad campaign in late July ‘focused on holding President Trump accountable’ and highlighting how his economic policies have negatively affected some Americans. The group spent $40 million online in 2016 and they said they plan to spend more than that in 2020.”



Dick’s CEO tries on the idea of a presidential run - Politico: “Ed Stack, the CEO of Dick’s Sporting Goods and a longtime Republican donor, is testing the waters for a possible third-party presidential bid that could scramble the dynamics of the 2020 general election. Various messages were presented to a focus group in southern Wisconsin this week centering on the billionaire businessman, along with possible three-way match-ups against Donald Trump and Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren. The focus group, according to a source who took part in the testing, ran through varying themes involving Stack and heavily focused on his example of ‘showing leadership’ by halting the sale of assault-style rifles at all of Dick’s Sporting Goods stores in the wake of the high school massacre in Parkland, Florida.”



GOP HOLDS NARROW EDGE FOR MISSISSIPPI GOVERNOR

Mississippi Clarion Ledger: “A new poll shows the Mississippi gubernatorial race remains tight with less than two weeks to Election Day. It also found a majority of voters oppose impeaching and removing President Donald Trump from office. … Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves leading Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood 46% to 43%. 2% support third-party candidates Bob Hickingbottom or Dave Singletary … Other recent polls have shown a similarly competitive race, closer than any state governor contest since 2003. Republicans have controlled the governor's mansion since 2004. Mason-Dixon pollsters indicated Trump's scheduled Nov. 1 rally in Tupelo ‘could be a deciding factor’ and offer a ‘significant boost’ for Reeves with GOP turnout. They noted Trump's last-minute campaigning in Louisiana recently helped force incumbent Democrat John Bel Edwards into a runoff.”

“As American people, we do a lot of business in China. And they know and understand our values and we understand their values. And one of our best values in America is free speech.

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“I’m at the point where I may hibernate this winter and avoid at all costs any media news. There are so many things I find biased, crooked and overblown, most of all the vendetta against the president. I resent the focus on this as opposed to a new trade policy, immigration reform, poor reports on education in the US, drugs and so many urgent items. Trump wasn’t my first choice for president in 2016, but I supported him when nominated. I don’t care nearly as much about his horrible personality as I do about his policies and the things he’s accomplished. … The polls say ‘Impeach! Elect Socialists! Elect people who are not only corrupt but suffering from delusions or dementia.’ I’m old, cranky and tired of the idiocy. Boo hiss.” – Susan Williams, St. Louis

“Something that is not talked about is, if college tuition became free in the United States is it reasonable for a college student to believe they can choose their college and/or major? One of the casualties of big socialized governments is there is no mechanism to afford personal individuality, uniqueness or desire. Everyone is treated the same. It then seems a reasonable conclusion that all students who want free college tuition to be tested, the government decide what the student demonstrates high aptitude in and the government choses the school and/or major for that student. This would be based on how the government decides the student can best serve the masses, not the individual student’s desires. In the United States we generally believe in mutually beneficial transactions. Meaning, both parties to a transaction receive something. One party receives the quantity and quality of a good or service, the other receives money. Both parties win. It would be a sea change to believe the student would receive both; free education and the choice of where to go and what to major in.” – Jim Hain, Omaha, Neb.



[Ed. note: Well, we do already kind of dabble in that. The federal government provides special incentives for students to choose certain disciplines and for institutions to choose certain types of students – directing research funds to preferred research, creating incentives for encouraging women into STEM, etc. But I take your larger point. If a four-year college degree becomes like high school is now, i.e. a guaranteed good available to all residents, one imagines that the government will take a similarly strong interest in what colleges teach and what students will earn. We have already seen it through the pressures applied to schools via Pell Grants and other forms of funding. But leaving aside the consideration of funding, which is a lulu, the main concern about universal college is that it will diminish the value of college for those who do attend. One of the reasons college has been such a great ladder into the middle class is that it isn’t for everyone. About a third of Americans over 25 have at least a four-year degree. But for Americans over 65, it’s only about a quarter of the population. It stands to reason that new graduates holding college degrees 40 years ago were more valuable than those today. What happens if we see college-going rates soar to 60 percent or more? There are lots of good things about higher education (and plenty of bad things, too). But many of the good things are not about what happens in the classroom – socialization, training in independent living in a controlled atmosphere, a sense of cultural belonging. Those things may or may not be degraded in a world of universal college. But the value of a degree, and thereby its utility for upward socioeconomic mobility, certainly would.]

Bloomberg: “America is sitting on a mountain of uneaten bacon. More than 40 million pounds (18,000 metric tons) of pork bellies, the cut used for bacon making, were sitting in refrigerated warehouses as of Sept. 30, according to U.S. government data released Tuesday. That’s the most for the month since 1971. The overhang came after a buildup in the American hog herd. Pork output surged over the summer months and through September, said Dennis Smith, senior account executive at Archer Financial Services Inc. Bellies have seen a magnified inventory increase because demand is mostly domestic, unlike cuts such as ham, for which overseas buying can help reduce reserves.”

On Monday, a Wall Street Journal report that NBC had renewed Oppenheim's lucrative contract – despite his roles in the handling of the Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer sexual harassment scandals – sparked widespread outrage both inside and outside 30 Rock.

NBC NEWS REPORTEDLY RENEWS NOAH OPPENHEIM’S CONTRACT, DRAWING OUTRAGE: 'STATUS QUO HAS BEEN BLESSED'

Less than 24 hours later, The Daily Beast published explosive accusations from NBC staffers who were also “furious” over Oppenheim’s “self-dealing,” which includes enlisting “Today” co-anchor Savannah Guthrie to collaborate with his wife, Allison, on a money-making scheme that has been heavily promoted on the top-rated morning show.

Guthrie and Allison Oppenheim co-wrote two popular children’s books “Princesses Wear Pants” and Princesses Save the World,” which encourage female empowerment. The bestselling books have since been spun-off into an animated series and clothing line, according to The Daily Beast.

“Talent promoting books is one thing, but an executive’s spouse getting to promote her business on a program her husband controls is outrageous and borderline graft,” an NBC News insider told Fox News. “Steve Burke should be ashamed of himself letting the Oppenheims use NBC to line their already golden coffers.”

NBC KILLED MY SEX ASSAULT STORY AFTER FARROW'S WEINSTEIN PIECE, AUTHOR CLAIMS

NBCUniversal Chief Executive Steve Burke currently plans for Oppenheim to eventually succeed current NBC News chairman Andy Lack, according to the Journal.

NBC employees have been privately peeved about the arrangement for years, but didn't share their ire until Guthrie reportedly went to bat for Oppenheim amid his ongoing scandals.

The partnership could give Guthrie a financial incentive to defend Oppenheim, who is painted as a key figure in NBC’s decision not to run Ronan Farrow’s award-winning report that exposed Weinstein as a sexual predator throughout his book “Catch and Kill. ”

“The Daily Beast has confirmed that Guthrie and ‘Today’ co-host Hoda Kotb recently defended Oppenheim, and urged that he be kept on, to NBCUniversal chairman Steve Burke,” the Beast reported.

‘TODAY’ ADDRESSES ‘APPALLING’ NEW MATT LAUER REPORT: 'IT’S JUST VERY PAINFUL'

NBCUniversal and NBC News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Daily Beast pointed out that Oppenheim – who moonlights as a Hollywood screenwriter -- also used “Today” to promote his own projects. The report pointed out that Lauer once joked on-air that Oppenheim’s American history book should have been called “Noah Needs a Summer House.”

Farrow’s former NBC News producer Rich McHugh accused Oppenheim of a “massive breach of journalistic integrity” in a scathing Vanity Fair column earlier this month.

The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that NBC quietly renewed Oppenheim’s contract, citing “people familiar with the matter.” The reported decision raised eyebrows across the media industry and McHugh said he was “sad” for NBC employees.

“The status quo has been blessed,” McHugh told Fox News.

Oppenheim famously told Farrow that his Weinstein reporting wasn’t fit to print, so Farrow took it to The New Yorker, where it won the Pulitzer Prize and helped launch the #MeToo movement.

Farrow’s book details his version of why NBC refused to expose Weinstein – which includes allegations that the disgraced movie mogul leveraged the knowledge of Lauer’s own misconduct.

The book also suggests Oppenheim wasn’t truthful regarding knowledge of Lauer’s alleged misconduct. Farrow describes Oppenheim as a “doe-eyed stoner whose mellow seemed impossible to harsh” and said they “laughed about his stories of getting high.” Farrow also says he and Oppenheim “planned to spend a night in with some edibles” before their eventual fallout over the Weinstein reporting.

After the Weinstein and Lauer bombshells were reported in 2017, NBC refused to hire an outside investigator to determine who knew about Lauer’s alleged sexual misconduct and whether NBC executives looked the other way. NBC relied on in-house general counsel Kim Harris despite widespread calls for an outside law firm to conduct the review.

NBC eventually declared that management was completely oblivious to Lauer’s behavior and Harris’ high-powered colleagues were cleared by the network.

Oppenheim, who maintains that Farrow simply has “an axe to grind” against NBC, was recently mocked by his own staff when he attempted to field questions from concerned employees as excerpts from Farrow’s book began to surface.

On Monday, author and activist Sil Lai Abrams said her own sexual misconduct bombshell was also shut down by Oppenheim’s news operation.

“Noah Oppenheim's contract renewal is confirmation that NBC is committed to maintaining the toxic environment which led to the network's repeated victimization of survivors of sexual violence,” Abrams told Fox News on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, NBC News has still not explained how the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape of Donald Trump was leaked from within Oppenheim’s news division to the Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold -- an old college buddy of Oppenheim.

Fahrenthold, like Farrow, won a Pulitzer Prize for stories that NBC News passed on under Oppenheim. Fahrenthold was later given a paid consultancy with NBC News.

Oppenheim and Fahrenthold attended Harvard University together, but NBC has long denied that Oppenheim leaked the scandalous tape to Fahrenthold."

Activists and sexual assault survivors from UltraViolet, a leading national women’s organization, organized the rally. UltraViolet co-founder Shaunna Thomas was front and center, blasting NBC for allegedly failing “to hold sexual abusers accountable” and failing to “combat a toxic culture across newsrooms.”

The group called for NBCUniversal to fire NBC News president Noah Oppenheim, MSNBC president Phil Griffin and “every other person in leadership that enabled abusers and silenced survivors” at the Peacock Network.

“It's not just a Matt Lauer problem. It's a company-wide problem. And it's one that Comcast NBC needs to take seriously and demonstrate that they're taking seriously,” Thomas said outside NBC’s famed 30 Rock.

UltraViolet also demanded that the embattled network release all “survivors from non-disclosure agreements,” “end the practice of pre-dispute arbitration for sexual abuse claims” and commission an independent internal investigation into company culture.

NBC KILLED MY SEX ASSAULT STORY AFTER FARROW'S WEINSTEIN PIECE, AUTHOR CLAIMS

Oppenheim – who reportedly recently received a new contract -- has been widely criticized for his role in the handling of the Weinstein and Lauer sexual harassment scandals. Oppenheim is painted as a key figure in NBC’s decision not to run Ronan Farrow’s award-winning report that exposed Weinstein as a sexual predator throughout his book “Catch and Kill.”

Oppenheim famously told Farrow that his Weinstein reporting wasn’t fit to print, so Farrow took it to The New Yorker, where it won the Pulitzer Prize and helped launch the #MeToo movement.

Farrow’s book details his version of why NBC refused to expose Weinstein – which includes allegations that the disgraced movie mogul leveraged the knowledge of Lauer’s own misconduct.

“The fact that Comcast was renewing Noah Oppenheimer's contract while being aware of and knowing that these allegations were coming forward....I think demonstrates that this problem goes right to the top. And that's the parent company, Comcast,” Thomas said.

Farrow’s book also reported that MSNBC’s president, Griffin, once shared a revealing image of TV host Maria Menounos during a staff meeting – which irked one particular protestor.

“I am a huge fan of MSNBC and when I read what this guy did, I could not believe it. He showed a woman's private part at a meeting. You don't do that to anybody,” a protestor told Fox News.

“There is a structural problem with sexual harassment and covering up sexual harassment in a culture that permits that kind of behavior to go on inside this company,” Thomas said. “We would expect that NBC would be a place where it would be safe for women to work and to be able to have their voices heard. And that's not the case. And that's why we're here.”

Another protestor told Fox News that “NBC is particularly guilty of it and refuses to really take any responsibility” for its wrongdoings, while others expressed displeasure that the liberal MSNBC was involved.

“You know, MSNBC is like far left, you know, so those of us who believe in progressive politics, we pay a lot of attention. We listen to them. We watch them. And now to hear that all of this stuff is coming out about how they're suppressing women's voices,” a protestor said."

WHAT WILL WE MAKE OF OUR MOMENT?

Periods of political upheaval can be wonderful things. Needed changes once deemed politically impossible suddenly become realities. Old superstitions and their totems can finally be discarded.



But it’s never all good.



The tumult of the first half of the 1970s is instructive. After that period, which included the resignations of the vice president and then president over corruption and abuses of power, Washington ushered in much-needed ethics reforms. Congress cracked down on payola for members and mandated financial disclosure for itself and the other two branches.



But that same era resulted in the birth of the modern political primary system that wreaks increasing damage on the republic cycle after cycle. Getting rid of smoke-filled rooms may have decreased the power of party bosses, but has introduced more demagoguery – both fanatical and fantastical – to our public life.



Like last-call shots of Fireball, microwave burritos and men in skinny jeans, it sounded like a good idea at the time.



As the parties clash this time in Washington, we don’t know what the era to come will bring. Which will be the positive changes to laws and attitudes born from this era of political chaos unseen four decades? Which will be ones that linger like a Fireball hangover?



With this in mind, consider the offering from today’s WaPo: “The Constitution isn’t the cure for President Trump. It is the cause.” by Shira Lurie, a history professor at the University of Toronto who formerly taught at the University of Virginia.



We encourage you to read her piece to get a fuller understanding of the argument, but her basic effort is to caution those involved in the struggle to either oust or constrain President Trump by constitutional means are simultaneously deepening our esteem for our flawed founding charter.



“Democrats can and should seek a constitutional remedy to remove Trump,” she writes. “But we need to confront the idea that a president who lost the popular vote by millions, deceives the public, attacks the press and does not have the confidence of the majority of Americans may not be a distortion of the constitutional order, but a feature.”



We wondered whether to even call attention to the piece lest we be guilty of that version of straw man argument that The Dispatch’s David French has delightfully dubbed “nut picking.” That’s when you find a fringe character from an opposing point of view and drag them forward to suggest that some far-flung idea is really mainstream.



Lurie is not in the political mainstream. In fact, she acknowledges it by expressing concern that Democrats are expressing excessive reverence for the Constitution.



“Worshiping the Constitution as a sacred text is not patriotism, it’s fanaticism,” she warns. “We can continue to pray to it, but it won’t save us. It is high time to address the anti-democratic foundations of American government.”



But we fear that the bipartisan reverence for our founding is actually pretty surficial these days. Leaders in both parties are closer to Lurie than she knows.



When the executive branch shows absolute contempt for the clearly stated powers of the legislative branch in a letter that sounds like it was dictated by Huey Long from a balcony you don’t get that good ol’ separation-of-powers tingle.



When Democratic presidential candidates willy-nilly offer proposals that ignore not only those same separations but doing so using the kind of cheap demagoguery that defies the principles of both the Constitution and the Declaration, one doesn’t feel the gentle breezes of a return to Madisonian democracy.



Our era will produce substantial change for the generations to come. Whatever shape that takes, we would do better to avoid the mistakes of the past and use our era to strengthen, not diminish, the Constitution that has seen us through this and all of our previous crises.

TIME OUT: DEMOCRATIC DUNGAREES

Atlantic: “If you want to sell clothes in America, it helps a lot if buyers think your product is cool. Jeans have a backstory that any marketer would kill for. ‘Denim first became popular in the 1920s and 1930s in tandem with the rise of Hollywood,’ explains Emma McClendon, an associate curator at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, who orchestrated a denim retrospective at the museum in 2015. … Over the years, the cuts and washes changed, but denim’s position as a relatively democratic element of the wardrobes of stylish, influential people didn’t. … In the past, only one or two styles of jeans were “cool” at a given time. … Now denim inventory is as infinite as the internet itself. Fast-fashion retailers update their selections constantly, which means that nearly every type of denim is available simultaneously. Depending on whom you ask, the big thing right now might be mom jeans.”

GRAHAM SET TO SQUEEZE FELLOW GOPERS WITH SHOW VOTE

AP: “GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, a top ally of President Donald Trump, is introducing a resolution condemning the Democratic-controlled House for pursuing a ‘closed door, illegitimate impeachment inquiry.’ Graham announced the move Thursday and says the Senate’s top Republican, Mitch McConnell, is a co-sponsor. Graham plans a Thursday afternoon news conference. The nonbinding resolution gives Senate Republicans a chance to show support for Trump at a moment when Trump is urging his GOP allies to get tougher and fight harder for him as the House impeachment probe gathers momentum. Many Senate Republicans are taking a wait-and-see approach amid the House impeachment inquiry. Rather than commenting on the substance of the probe, they are united in complaining that the House is taking depositions from witnesses behind closed doors.”



Some senators are keeping impeachment thoughts to themselves - Politico: “[Susan Collins] is among a group of senators from both parties who are increasingly citing their role as possible jurors in an impeachment trial. They argue that as impartial jurors, they shouldn't make any foregone conclusion — especially about a scandal that could force Trump out of office. … Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee agrees, saying jurors shouldn’t be ‘running around announcing their decision until they’ve heard the arguments.’ … The reserved nature of Republicans like Alexander, who is retiring, and the moderate Collins suggests some in the president's own party are legitimately open to Democrats' arguments — an ominous sign for Trump… It also has the added side benefit of excusing senators from the noisy, day-to-day chaos of the president’s investigation by Congress.”



Dems prepare to go public with probe - WaPo: “House Democrats are preparing to move their largely private impeachment inquiry onto a more public stage as soon as mid-November and are already grappling with how best to present the complex Ukraine saga to the American people. Over the past three weeks, a parade of current and former Trump administration officials have testified behind closed doors, providing House investigators with a compelling narrative of President Trump’s campaign to extract political favors from Ukrainian officials. … Among the witnesses Democrats hope to question in open session are the acting ambassador to Ukraine, William B. Taylor Jr., and his predecessor, former ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. Both are seasoned diplomats who, in earlier House testimony, effectively conveyed outrage over a White House plan to withhold much-needed military aid from Ukraine…”



Wisconsin sees increase in support for impeachment - Marquette University: “A new Marquette Law School poll of Wisconsin registered voters finds that 46 percent think that there is enough cause now for Congress to hold hearings on impeachment of President Donald Trump, while 49 percent say there is not enough cause and 5 percent say they do not know. In April 2019, 29 percent said there was sufficient reason for impeachment hearings and 65 percent said there was not. The April poll was completed after Attorney General William Barr’s letter describing the Mueller report but before the report was publicly released. Earlier, in January 2019, 33 percent supported and 59 percent opposed hearings.”



The Judge’s Ruling: Loyalty to the Constitution - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano questions President Trump’s relationship to upholding the Constitution: “After a weekend of torrential criticism, Trump announced that he had changed his mind and said he would not host the G-7 meeting at the Miami area resort. Yet, in the process of doing so, he characterized the Emoluments Clause as ‘phony.’ Who knows what he meant by phony? The clause is in the Constitution and it means what it says. Yet, whatever Trump meant by phony, it constituted at least a disparagement of the Constitution he has sworn to uphold and at worst a threat to ignore clauses he can disparage. This is most unusual and potentially dangerous, and it raises the question: Can the president lawfully enforce only the clauses of the Constitution with which he agrees and ignore those with which he disagrees? In a word: No.” More here.



Q POLL: WARREN AHEAD, BUT WORRIES ABOUT ELECTABILITY

Quinnipiac University: “Senator Elizabeth Warren has opened up a lead in the Democratic primary race after being locked in a tight race with former Vice President Joe Biden for several weeks, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. Warren receives 28 percent of the vote among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, while Biden gets 21 percent. Sen. Bernie Sanders gets 15 percent, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg gets 10 percent, Sen. Kamala Harris is at 5 percent and Sen. Amy Klobuchar is at 3 percent. No other candidate tops one percent. … Biden is still viewed as the candidate who has the best chance of winning against Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election… In today's poll, Biden gets 42 percent, but this is down from 48 percent in the October 14 poll… Warren comes in second on this electability question with 20 percent, followed by Sanders at 14 percent.”



Biden really slipping in fundraising pack - Politico: “Joe Biden’s campaign is drawing more support from big-ticket donors than any other candidate in the race — yet he still can’t match his rivals’ cash flow. Biden has raised $20.7 million from contributions of at least $500 — $1.5 million more than his nearest competitor, despite entering the race later than all of them — thanks to the former vice president’s strong connections and goodwill among the traditional donors who have long financed the Democratic Party. … But it’s been nowhere near enough to make Biden the leader of the fundraising pack. In fact, his big-dollar dominance, and his reliance on those donors, is more evidence of how quickly small-dollar donations have become the most important component of political fundraising in a sprawling, fractured Democratic race. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg are all outraising Biden, and stockpiling cash significantly faster than him, on the back of major support from online donors that Biden has been unable to build.”



Tim Ryan bows out - NBC News: “Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, ended his long-shot presidential campaign after months of struggling to find a footing in the crowded Democratic field. Ryan announced his decision to end his campaign in a video to supporters, stating he would run again for his House seat. He isn’t throwing his support behind anyone in the 2020 field at this time, his campaign told NBC. ‘I got into this race in April to really give voice to the forgotten people of our country: the workers who have been left behind, the businesses who have been left behind, the people who need health care or aren’t getting a quality education, or are saddled by tremendous debt,’ Ryan said. 'I'm proud of this campaign because I believe we’ve done that. We’ve given voice to the forgotten communities and the forgotten people in the United States.'""



Moderators announced for November debate - NBC News: “The fifth Democratic presidential primary debate in Georgia will have four moderators, MSNBC announced on Wednesday — and all of them are women. Moderating the Nov. 20 event, which is being co-hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post, will be Rachel Maddow, host of ‘The Rachel Maddow Show’ on MSNBC; Andrea Mitchell, host of ‘Andrea Mitchell Reports’ on MSNBC and NBC News' chief foreign affairs correspondent; Kristen Welker, NBC News' White House correspondent; and Ashley Parker, a White House reporter for The Washington Post. The debate will likely feature a smaller lineup of candidates than the dozen who qualified for October's debate in Ohio — only eight candidates have qualified for the debate stage so far, according to an unofficial NBC News tally. It will also be shorter than the three-hour October debate — it's scheduled to air from 9 to 11 p.m. ET.”



BORIS JOHNSON LAUNCHES BID FOR DECEMBER ELECTION

Fox News: “Boris Johnson will launch an attempt to hold a general election in Britain on December 12 to ‘get Brexit done.’ The British prime minister will attempt to convince members of Parliament to formally back the bid on Monday, but he will need the support of two-thirds of the House of Commons. Britain's next scheduled election is not until 2022. Johnson's move comes after his Brexit bill was finally passed earlier this week, but lawmakers defeated his request to push through the legislation in a three-day timetable, saying it didn't provide enough time for scrutiny. He said he expected the European Union to grant an extension to his October 31 deadline, likely to be to the end of January. The EU is expected to give its verdict on an extension on Friday. The prime minister said the Dec. 12 date will give lawmakers time before the election to scrutinize his Brexit bill. Under his plan, Parliament would remain working until Nov. 6, when campaigning would start.”

AUDIBLE: AMEN

“Back in 2015, his city roiled by unrest, by day the congressman was here in the Capitol working and leading in these hallways of power. But every night he rode the train back home and walked the neighborhoods, bullhorn in hand, encouraging unity and peace. Here’s what he said: ‘Let’s go home. Let’s all go home.’ Now our distinguished colleague truly has gone home, home to his Father’s house.” – Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in his condolences for Rep. Elijah Cummings as he lies in state at the U.S. Capitol Thursday.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Without asking you to necessarily weigh in on the ‘wisdom’ of same (unless of course you want to), I have two ‘technical’ and hypothetical impeachment questions: If a president is impeached and IS convicted in the Senate, is he/she eligible to run for re-election? (Somewhat similar situation to Marion Barry in Washington, D.C.) If a president is impeached but is NOT convicted in the Senate, could the House vote to re-impeach the president the next day (perhaps even ad infinitum) in a political ground hog day?” – Dave Wittnebert, Seneca, S.C.



[Ed. note: Most certainly, Mr. Wittnebert. President Trump could be removed from office and seek the presidency a second time, and he could be acquitted in the Senate and be re-impeached. But you’d have to think either scenario would be vanishingly rare. We talk often about impeachment being a political, not legal proposition. But that applies to its aftermath, too. If Trump becomes such a boat anchor that Senate Republicans feel obliged to cut ties with him, it will be because he is too great a political liability/embarrassment. If he is let off by the Senate, House Democrats will move urgently to pivot away from what will almost certainly be a somewhat embarrassing anti-climax.]



“I'm doing a bit of head scratching over what I see as competing information. By this I mean that I'm seeing President Trump's approval rating on a swift downhill slide and at the same time I'm hearing that the Democrats are hand-wringing over whether they have a candidate that can defeat him in 2020. Who needs to be more concerned?” – Neil Klapthor, Evans, Ga.



[Ed. note: The one who’s trailing a year from today! I kid, I kid… mostly. The past three weeks have been brutal for Trump, partly because of Democrats’ closing ranks and prosecuting their impeachment with vigorous determination. But it’s mostly been self-inflicted. Will the trend continue? Almost certainly not. It may get worse for the incumbent over time if further revelations drive a wedge between Trump and the GOP or it may get worse for Democrats because their own penchant for infighting will re-emerge. I suspect it will probably be quite a bit of both. But there are other considerations, particularly the health of the economy in the first two quarters of 2020. Given how much farther this river runs, it’s probably best to sail with the current for now and enjoy the view. We won’t find out who’s going over Niagara for a while yet.]

A PUMPKIN SPICE FLOAT

WTVC: “Around this time of year, most people take to carving pumpkins. But a farmer in Cleveland, Tennessee took things one step further. Justin Ownby grew a massive pumpkin that weighed 910 pounds… But he was not satisfied merely by its ornamental delights that enhance the season. Ownby's wife Christin Ownby shared video with WTVC that shows Ownby hollowed out the pumpkin, and converted to a buoyant watercraft that he tested on his farm's pond. A second video has someone off camera asking him to do his impression of ‘Washington crossing the Delaware!,’ and Ownby stands up as the pumpkin submerges under the sudden weight. Ownby says Justin used a seed to grow the pumpkin that came from a record-breaking pumpkin grown in Tennessee that weighed more than 1,700 pounds. … Christin Ownby says the pumpkin remains floating in the pond at last check, saying ‘It will make a great snack for the catfish!’”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“When I was growing up, I thought ‘gyp’ was simply a synonym for ‘cheat,’ and used it accordingly. It was only when I was an adult that I learned that gyp was short for gypsy. At which point, I stopped using it. … Why? Simple decency. … It’s a question not of who or how many had their feelings hurt, but of whether you want to associate yourself with a word that, for whatever historical reason having nothing to do with you, carries inherently derogatory connotations.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on Oct. 17, 2013.

For the record, this new parenting style began decades ago when we decided to negotiate our children’s grades in school; to do our kids’ homework for them over a latte, and to give them trophies just for showing up.

COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL: MARKETING CEO GETS 3 WEEKS FOR CHEATING ON SON'S ACT EXAM

Over the years, it seems the helicopter parent has become an Apache helicopter.

As evidence, I submit to you this year’s college admissions scandal – a conspiracy where parents paid bribes to insure their children got into their college of choice. More than 50 people have been charged in the scandal, accused of paying over $25 million between 2011 and 2018. False documents were submitted; SAT scores were adjusted and money was laundered.

Celebrities involved in the scandal include “Full House” actress Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli, who have pleaded not guilty. Actress Felicity Huffman pleaded guilty and is currently serving a 14-day jail sentence and was ordered to also perform 250 hours of community service and pay a $30,000 fine.

LORI LOUGHLIN, MOSSIMO GIANNULLI INDICTED ON NEW FEDERAL CHARGES IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL

The scandal is a case study of the leadership style too many parents of Generation Z children have embraced. These parents have decided to play a more intrusive role in the lives and futures of their children. While most parents may not stoop to illegal activity, they’ve felt the need to prepare the path for the child instead of the child for the path.

I began wondering how this kind of leadership style has impacted our kids.

Our non-profit, Growing Leaders, and the Harris Poll surveyed more than 2,000 adults across America, from a variety of demographics to find out how they felt about Generation Z, the youngest population growing up today.

What we discovered confirmed my hunch. Some 66 percent of American adults have a negative emotion first when they think of kids today.

In other words, the first thing we feel is pessimism, not optimism. Before belief we feel frustration. Before hope we feel fear for them. And 64 percent of us do not believe today’s kids will be ready for adulthood in time.

This fear narrative drives us to be intrusive, especially when we feel our kid won’t be able to negotiate life for themselves. It even leads some parents to cheat to get their kids into college. And it’s had a negative net effect on how teenagers approach life.

As I reviewed how we got here, I discovered the research from Dr. Julian Rotter in 1954. Rotter created a scale to determine whether students were developing an “external locus of control” or an “internal locus of control.” Simply defined, here is the difference:

Internal Locus of Control – People who believe that they are responsible and in control of their own success.

External Locus of Control – People who believe that fate or external forces somehow determine their success.

After nine years of study, Rotter’s conclusions were that students with an “internal locus” became far more successful in life, taking better care of their health, careers and families. It makes sense. They believe they’re responsible for the outcomes.

As I reviewed the last five decades, I saw a steady rise in “external locus of control” among students.

Since 2002, U.S. kids have experienced a steep rise in this “external locus.” More of them feel their lives are out of their control.

Dr. Peter Gray, of Boston College, writes: “In fact, the shift has been so great that the average young person in 2002 was more External than were 80% of young people in the 1960s. The rise in Externality on Rotter’s scale over the 42-year period showed the same linear trend as did the rise in depression and anxiety.”

Reflect for a moment. In “Generation Z Unfiltered,” I pose the question: How do you suppose feeling “out of control of my life” affects a teen? Don’t you feel a little more anxious when someone else is in control of your life?

When kids enter their teenage years, their brains are developing significantly, desiring to take more risks; they naturally yearn for more autonomy and responsibility. It’s how we all get ready for healthy adulthood.

When we don’t equip our children to take on that independence, life gets unhealthy. We must begin to offer our kids a greater sense of ownership by believing in them and their ability to achieve on their own.

Huffman said the worst part was facing her daughter, who said with tears in her eyes: “Why didn’t you believe in me? Why didn’t you think I could do it on my own?”

“I have, a handful of times, a long time ago, and I’ve also encountered a lot of people whose lives have really been shaken by the old war on drugs approach,” Buttigieg told Fox News in Las Vegas.

Nevada legalized marijuana for recreational use in 2017. Several other states have made similar moves, although the drug is still considered illegal on the federal level.

Buttigieg's ambitious proposal has been to “decriminalize all drug possession” while expanding access to addiction treatments and improving drug-abuse and mental-health treatment.

Buttigieg also said legalizing pot would carry numerous business advantages.

“First of all, without legalization, you’re going to continue to see a patchwork of different state laws that create a lot of problems for legitimate businesses like this one,” Buttigieg said outside the Top Notch dispensary in Vegas on a campaign stop.

He added, “We not only need to legalize but we also need to pursue experiments, knowing the racial disparity and lives that have been ruined by sentences over marijuana possession.”

Other 2020 Democrats seemed to be on the same page.

Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke toured an Oakland, Calif., dispensary last month, and called for allocating monthly stipends to people who were previously locked up for low-level marijuana offenses as a form of recompense.

Meantime, other candidates have admitted to using the drug before. California Sen. Kamala Harris, in a radio interview earlier this year, said, “I have, and I inhaled -- I did inhale. It was a long time ago, but yes.”

ZUCKERBERG ADMITS TO ADVISING BUTTIGIEG ON HIRES, SAYS IT'S NOT AN ENDORSEMENT

Sen. Bernie Sanders, when running in the 2016 primaries, also acknowledged he tried it a couple of times.

“I smoked marijuana twice — didn’t quite work for me,” he told Yahoo! News.

Candidates have split over how they would legalize marijuana federally. Buttigieg said it would need to be done through the proper legislative channels, while Sanders has expressed that he would use an executive order to carry it out.

Buttigieg agreed that the stigma surrounding marijuana use should diminish.

He also made a pitch specifically to veterans. “Yeah, so I've met a lot of veterans who rely on cannabis for the treatment of diagnosed or undiagnosed issues, often service-connected issues like post-traumatic stress. And, another benefit of decriminalization is, it could pave the way for this to be supported with” the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Asked by another reporter if he had bought any items in the dispensary, which he compared to an Apple Store in appearance, he said: “I will not. I’m on the clock and it’s gonna be a long day.”"

The independent senator and 2020 presidential primary contender announced on Thursday his plan to legalize marijuana by executive order within the first 100 days of his administration should he win the White House.

Sanders, whose home state of Vermont in 2018 legalized possession of one ounce of pot and let each adult resident grow two plants for personal use, has long been a supporter of decriminalizing marijuana nationwide. He’s argued that the criminalization of the drug has ravaged communities of color and created an unequal incarceration rate.

“Too many lives were ruined due to the disastrous criminalization of marijuana,” Sanders wrote in a tweet announcing his plan.

Along with legalizing marijuana nationwide, Sanders also proposed expunging all past marijuana-related convictions and funneling some of the revenue from the legal marijuana business into communities hardest hit by the so-called War on Drugs.

“When we talk about criminal justice reform and ending institutional racism in America, we are talking about ending the disastrous War on Drugs, which has disproportionately targeted people of color and ruined the lives of millions of Americans,” his campaign said in a statement.

“It is time to admit the criminalization of marijuana was a disaster, especially for communities of color, and allow those most impacted to move forward with their lives. Our job now is to legalize marijuana and vacate and expunge past marijuana convictions, and ensure that revenue from legal marijuana is reinvested in communities hit hardest by the War on Drugs.”

Legalizing marijuana has gone from a once-fringe issue to a mainstream topic of debate as more states have let residents buy and grow pot.

OCASIO-CORTEZ, OMAR, TLAIB TO ENDORSE BERNIE SANDERS

Ten states and the District of Columbia already have legalized recreational marijuana, while there are only nine states in the nation where the drug remains fully illegal. Most states either have decriminalized it or have allowed it to be sold for medical uses.

A recent poll from Gallup found that 66 percent of Americans supported fully legalizing marijuana, almost double the number from 2005 when only 35 percent supported the move.

The sentiment across the country has been reflected among the 2020 Democrats with all supporting at least some form of legalization or decriminalization of the drug.

While Sanders was the first candidate to lay out an extensive plan for legalizing marijuana, fellow candidates and senators such as Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California have supported the Marijuana Justice Act. Introduced by Booker, the legislation would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act and expunge existing cannabis-related criminal records.

The only major candidates who haven’t supported full legalization: former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.

Biden said he supported decriminalization and rescheduling, criminal-record expungement and increased research access to marijuana, but argued it should be up to states to decide whether to legalize the drug. Klobuchar has said she supported decriminalization and legalization, but so far has not gone into specifics on her stance."

Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, grabs the support of 28 percent of Democrats and independent voters who lean toward the Democrats in a survey released Thursday by Quinnipiac University. Biden stands at 21 percent in the poll, with populist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 15 percent.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

In Quinnipiac’s previous survey – conducted prior to the Oct. 15 fourth round Democratic debate – Warren had a slight 30-27 percent edge over Biden. But her advantage was within the poll’s margin of error. Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont who’s making his second straight White House bid, was at 11 percent.

Quinnipiac’s new survey showing Warren with a clear lead outside the sampling error stands in stark contrast to a national CNN poll conducted by SSRS released a day earlier that suggested Biden at 34 percent, with Warren a distant second at 19 percent and Sanders at 16 percent. The former vice president’s 15 percentage point lead was his largest since April in CNN polling.

During the spring and summer Biden remained the unrivaled front-runner in the Democratic 2020 battle, but then Warren surged and has been tied with the former vice president in many national and early primary and caucus voting state polls this autumn.

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg grabs 10 percent support in the new Quinnipiac poll, with Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 5 percent and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota at 3 percent. According to Klobuchar’s campaign, their candidate has now reached the polling threshold and qualifies for the next debate, which will be held next month in Georgia.

No other candidate in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential contenders topped 1 percent in the poll.

""Former Vice President Joe Biden slips, Senator Elizabeth Warren steadies, Senator Bernie Sanders gets his groove back, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg breaks back into double digits,"" Quinnipiac University polling analyst Mary Snow said in a statement.

The survey indicates Biden is still viewed as the candidate who has the best chance of winning against President Trump in the 2020 election. But his electability has deteriorated, from a high of 56 percent days after he declared his candidacy in late April, to 42 percent now.

Thirty percent of those questioned say Warren has the best policy ideas, topping the rest of the field. And Sanders is viewed as the most honest Democratic White House contender, at 28 percent.

THE LATEST 2020 POLLING FROM FOX NEWS

Among the nearly three-quarters of those polled who said they either watched October’s debate or paid close attention to news stories about it, 26 percent said Warren did the best job, followed by Buttigieg with 17 percent, Biden with 12 percent, Sanders at 11 percent, and Klobuchar at 8 percent. When asked who did the worst job in the recent debate, 15 percent said Biden and 11 percent said Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii.

""Despite coming under attack at the debate, Senator Elizabeth Warren was viewed as doing the best job, followed by South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigeig, which may have helped his standing in the primary,” Snow said. ""Last week's debate didn't help Vice President Joe Biden.”

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted Oct. 17 - 21, with 1,587 self-identified registered voters — including 713 Democratic voters and independents who lean toward the Democratic Party, questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s margin of effort for Democratic primary questions is plus or minus 4.6 percentage points."

And the thresholds for the White House contenders to make the debate stage are once again rising.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

The Democratic National Committee on Friday announced that the debate will be held on Dec. 19 in Los Angeles at the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs. The DNC said that PBS NewsHour and Politico will co-host the showdown.

The debate will be the first held on the West Coast, and specifically California. The Golden State is playing a larger role this cycle in determining the Democratic presidential nominee. California moved up the date of its primary and will be the largest of the 15 states scheduled to vote on Super Tuesday, which will be held on March 3 of next year.

To make the cut for the Dec. 19 debate, candidates must now receive at least 4 percent support in at least four qualifying national polls or surveys in the early primary and caucus states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina – or hit at least 6 percent in two qualifying polls in the early voting states. Only polls released between Oct. 16 and Dec. 12 will be considered.

The DNC is also upping the fundraising threshold. Candidates will now have to hit campaign contributions from at least 200,000 individual donors – with a minimum of 800 unique contributors in at least 20 states or the District of Columbia.

The candidates have until Dec. 12 – one week before the debate – to hit the fundraising and polling criteria.

SOME 2020 DEMS FUME OVER DNC'S DEBATE CRITERIA

Nine candidates out of the remaining field of roughly 17 Democratic White House contenders say they’ve hit the lower thresholds to make the stage for next month’s fifth-round debate, which will be held Nov. 20 in Georgia. They are former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, businessman and progressive advocate Tom Steyer, and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

Three candidates who reached the October debate stage are at risk of not qualifying for the November showdown. They are Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro of Texas, and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, also of Texas.

The DNC’s qualifying criteria have been repeatedly criticized by many of the middle- and lower-tier candidates for months. Activists also argue that the job of narrowing the field belongs to the voters in the early-voting states rather than with national party leaders.

Pushing back against the criticism, DNC Chairman Tom Perez told Fox News in September that the process has been “eminently fair” and added “we’re going “to continue to be transparent.”"

NBC raised eyebrows for including Maddow, who drew ratings for its cable network for pushing what critics have described as ""conspiracy theories"" during the two-year Russia investigation, as a debate moderator earlier this year as such a position is usually assigned to serious, unbiased journalists.

Maddow's debate performance was widely criticized for keeping much of her focus on the findings of then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report.

Last week, a prominent women’s group called on the Democratic National Committee to pull its upcoming debate from MSNBC unless NBC News ""cleans house"" and launches an independent investigation into ""allegations of a culture of sexual abuse"" at the network.

UltraViolet Action, a leading national women’s organization, claimed the Democrats' fifth presidential debate shouldn’t happen if NBC didn't ditch its beleaguered leadership.

""The DNC needs to make it clear that they support survivors of sexual abuse and cancel the upcoming 2020 Democratic presidential primary debate on MSNBC until Comcast and NBC News take clear steps to clean up the toxic culture that exists across their networks,"" UltraViolet co-founder Shaunna Thomas said in a statement.

On Wednesday, a group of activists and sexual assault survivors from the organization held a protest outside NBC News' New York City headquarters.

The group called for NBCUniversal to fire NBC News president Noah Oppenheim, MSNBC president Phil Griffin and ""every other person in leadership that enabled abusers and silenced survivors"" at the Peacock Network.

""It's not just a Matt Lauer problem. It's a company-wide problem, and it's one that Comcast NBC needs to take seriously and demonstrate that they're taking seriously,"" Thomas said outside NBC’s famed 30 Rock.

So if viewers assumed the debate moderators' questions wouldn't be tough, they weren't disappointed. Here are just 10 questions that were not asked:

GUTFELD ON THE TRUMP OBSESSION AT THE DEBATE

1. About the Trump tax cuts, Democrats like Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., claim that 83 percent of the benefits would go to ""the top 1 percent, richest people in this country, and the most powerful corporations."" But the Washington Post fact-checker said: ""The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that initially more than 80 percent of taxpayers would get a tax cut, with less than 5 percent getting a tax increase."" Why, then, do you keep restating what The Washington Post said isn't true?

2. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, for years, you've said, ""We are now spending twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country."" And for years, PolitiFact has said that's false. So why do you keep saying it?

3. Many of you support reparations, but former President Obama said, ""Children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime, nine times more likely to drop out of schools and 20 times more likely to end up in prison."" Isn't family breakdown a far bigger problem than a need for reparations?

4. In 1900, government at all three levels -- state, local and federal -- took less than 10 percent of Americans' income. Today, government takes close to 31 percent. How much more income should government take from the American people?

5. In 2017, nearly 40,000 Americans were murdered or committed suicide by firearms, so you've demanded that Congress pass ""commonsense gun control laws"" to save lives. But how many Americans are alive each year because they used firearms in self-defense?

6. Some of you have proposed a ""buyback"" of AR-15s and other ""weapons of war."" In 2018, according to the FBI, there were 297 people killed by rifles -- all rifles, not just AR-15s. But 443 people were killed by hammers, clubs and other blunt objects. And 672 were killed by ""fists, feet and other 'personal weapons.'"" Gun rights advocates argue that these numbers show you have lost perspective. Please comment.

7. You criticize President Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria. But when President Obama withdrew troops from Iraq, Democrats supported the policy -- even though it ran counter to the advice Obama got from his national security team. The withdrawal allowed ISIS to grow and metastasize. Obama sent back about 4,000 troops, and the troop level remains about 5,000. Is it not hypocritical to criticize Trump for doing the same thing that Democrats applauded Obama for?

8. Does President Trump deserve any credit for an economy that's producing rising incomes and record-low unemployment for blacks and Hispanics?

9. Rep. Beto O'Rourke, you say you've benefited from ""white privilege"" and that America is built on ""endemic"" and ""foundational"" racism. On the stage with you are New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, of African descent; Andrew Yang, of Chinese descent; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who is Samoan American; and California Sen. Kamala Harris, whose background is Jamaican and Indian. Why didn't ""endemic"" and ""foundational"" racism prevent these candidates of color from being on the same stage with you, on the same night, competing for the same job?

10. About Charlottesville, where a woman was killed by a white nationalist, you claim President Trump said there were good white nationalists and good neo-Nazis on ""both sides."" In fact, at that very same press conference, Trump said, ""I'm not talking about the white nationalists and the neo-Nazis -- because they should be condemned totally."" Why do you keep misquoting the president?

Compared to previous Democratic debates, this recent three-hour long one aired on CNN rated pretty bad. Who knows? A tough question or two might have generated a bit more interest.

WHAT WILL WE MAKE OF OUR MOMENT?

Periods of political upheaval can be wonderful things. Needed changes once deemed politically impossible suddenly become realities. Old superstitions and their totems can finally be discarded.



But it’s never all good.



The tumult of the first half of the 1970s is instructive. After that period, which included the resignations of the vice president and then president over corruption and abuses of power, Washington ushered in much-needed ethics reforms. Congress cracked down on payola for members and mandated financial disclosure for itself and the other two branches.



But that same era resulted in the birth of the modern political primary system that wreaks increasing damage on the republic cycle after cycle. Getting rid of smoke-filled rooms may have decreased the power of party bosses, but has introduced more demagoguery – both fanatical and fantastical – to our public life.



Like last-call shots of Fireball, microwave burritos and men in skinny jeans, it sounded like a good idea at the time.



As the parties clash this time in Washington, we don’t know what the era to come will bring. Which will be the positive changes to laws and attitudes born from this era of political chaos unseen four decades? Which will be ones that linger like a Fireball hangover?



With this in mind, consider the offering from today’s WaPo: “The Constitution isn’t the cure for President Trump. It is the cause.” by Shira Lurie, a history professor at the University of Toronto who formerly taught at the University of Virginia.



We encourage you to read her piece to get a fuller understanding of the argument, but her basic effort is to caution those involved in the struggle to either oust or constrain President Trump by constitutional means are simultaneously deepening our esteem for our flawed founding charter.



“Democrats can and should seek a constitutional remedy to remove Trump,” she writes. “But we need to confront the idea that a president who lost the popular vote by millions, deceives the public, attacks the press and does not have the confidence of the majority of Americans may not be a distortion of the constitutional order, but a feature.”



We wondered whether to even call attention to the piece lest we be guilty of that version of straw man argument that The Dispatch’s David French has delightfully dubbed “nut picking.” That’s when you find a fringe character from an opposing point of view and drag them forward to suggest that some far-flung idea is really mainstream.



Lurie is not in the political mainstream. In fact, she acknowledges it by expressing concern that Democrats are expressing excessive reverence for the Constitution.



“Worshiping the Constitution as a sacred text is not patriotism, it’s fanaticism,” she warns. “We can continue to pray to it, but it won’t save us. It is high time to address the anti-democratic foundations of American government.”



But we fear that the bipartisan reverence for our founding is actually pretty surficial these days. Leaders in both parties are closer to Lurie than she knows.



When the executive branch shows absolute contempt for the clearly stated powers of the legislative branch in a letter that sounds like it was dictated by Huey Long from a balcony you don’t get that good ol’ separation-of-powers tingle.



When Democratic presidential candidates willy-nilly offer proposals that ignore not only those same separations but doing so using the kind of cheap demagoguery that defies the principles of both the Constitution and the Declaration, one doesn’t feel the gentle breezes of a return to Madisonian democracy.



Our era will produce substantial change for the generations to come. Whatever shape that takes, we would do better to avoid the mistakes of the past and use our era to strengthen, not diminish, the Constitution that has seen us through this and all of our previous crises.

TIME OUT: DEMOCRATIC DUNGAREES

Atlantic: “If you want to sell clothes in America, it helps a lot if buyers think your product is cool. Jeans have a backstory that any marketer would kill for. ‘Denim first became popular in the 1920s and 1930s in tandem with the rise of Hollywood,’ explains Emma McClendon, an associate curator at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, who orchestrated a denim retrospective at the museum in 2015. … Over the years, the cuts and washes changed, but denim’s position as a relatively democratic element of the wardrobes of stylish, influential people didn’t. … In the past, only one or two styles of jeans were “cool” at a given time. … Now denim inventory is as infinite as the internet itself. Fast-fashion retailers update their selections constantly, which means that nearly every type of denim is available simultaneously. Depending on whom you ask, the big thing right now might be mom jeans.”

GRAHAM SET TO SQUEEZE FELLOW GOPERS WITH SHOW VOTE

AP: “GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, a top ally of President Donald Trump, is introducing a resolution condemning the Democratic-controlled House for pursuing a ‘closed door, illegitimate impeachment inquiry.’ Graham announced the move Thursday and says the Senate’s top Republican, Mitch McConnell, is a co-sponsor. Graham plans a Thursday afternoon news conference. The nonbinding resolution gives Senate Republicans a chance to show support for Trump at a moment when Trump is urging his GOP allies to get tougher and fight harder for him as the House impeachment probe gathers momentum. Many Senate Republicans are taking a wait-and-see approach amid the House impeachment inquiry. Rather than commenting on the substance of the probe, they are united in complaining that the House is taking depositions from witnesses behind closed doors.”



Some senators are keeping impeachment thoughts to themselves - Politico: “[Susan Collins] is among a group of senators from both parties who are increasingly citing their role as possible jurors in an impeachment trial. They argue that as impartial jurors, they shouldn't make any foregone conclusion — especially about a scandal that could force Trump out of office. … Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee agrees, saying jurors shouldn’t be ‘running around announcing their decision until they’ve heard the arguments.’ … The reserved nature of Republicans like Alexander, who is retiring, and the moderate Collins suggests some in the president's own party are legitimately open to Democrats' arguments — an ominous sign for Trump… It also has the added side benefit of excusing senators from the noisy, day-to-day chaos of the president’s investigation by Congress.”



Dems prepare to go public with probe - WaPo: “House Democrats are preparing to move their largely private impeachment inquiry onto a more public stage as soon as mid-November and are already grappling with how best to present the complex Ukraine saga to the American people. Over the past three weeks, a parade of current and former Trump administration officials have testified behind closed doors, providing House investigators with a compelling narrative of President Trump’s campaign to extract political favors from Ukrainian officials. … Among the witnesses Democrats hope to question in open session are the acting ambassador to Ukraine, William B. Taylor Jr., and his predecessor, former ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. Both are seasoned diplomats who, in earlier House testimony, effectively conveyed outrage over a White House plan to withhold much-needed military aid from Ukraine…”



Wisconsin sees increase in support for impeachment - Marquette University: “A new Marquette Law School poll of Wisconsin registered voters finds that 46 percent think that there is enough cause now for Congress to hold hearings on impeachment of President Donald Trump, while 49 percent say there is not enough cause and 5 percent say they do not know. In April 2019, 29 percent said there was sufficient reason for impeachment hearings and 65 percent said there was not. The April poll was completed after Attorney General William Barr’s letter describing the Mueller report but before the report was publicly released. Earlier, in January 2019, 33 percent supported and 59 percent opposed hearings.”



The Judge’s Ruling: Loyalty to the Constitution - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano questions President Trump’s relationship to upholding the Constitution: “After a weekend of torrential criticism, Trump announced that he had changed his mind and said he would not host the G-7 meeting at the Miami area resort. Yet, in the process of doing so, he characterized the Emoluments Clause as ‘phony.’ Who knows what he meant by phony? The clause is in the Constitution and it means what it says. Yet, whatever Trump meant by phony, it constituted at least a disparagement of the Constitution he has sworn to uphold and at worst a threat to ignore clauses he can disparage. This is most unusual and potentially dangerous, and it raises the question: Can the president lawfully enforce only the clauses of the Constitution with which he agrees and ignore those with which he disagrees? In a word: No.” More here.



Q POLL: WARREN AHEAD, BUT WORRIES ABOUT ELECTABILITY

Quinnipiac University: “Senator Elizabeth Warren has opened up a lead in the Democratic primary race after being locked in a tight race with former Vice President Joe Biden for several weeks, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. Warren receives 28 percent of the vote among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, while Biden gets 21 percent. Sen. Bernie Sanders gets 15 percent, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg gets 10 percent, Sen. Kamala Harris is at 5 percent and Sen. Amy Klobuchar is at 3 percent. No other candidate tops one percent. … Biden is still viewed as the candidate who has the best chance of winning against Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election… In today's poll, Biden gets 42 percent, but this is down from 48 percent in the October 14 poll… Warren comes in second on this electability question with 20 percent, followed by Sanders at 14 percent.”



Biden really slipping in fundraising pack - Politico: “Joe Biden’s campaign is drawing more support from big-ticket donors than any other candidate in the race — yet he still can’t match his rivals’ cash flow. Biden has raised $20.7 million from contributions of at least $500 — $1.5 million more than his nearest competitor, despite entering the race later than all of them — thanks to the former vice president’s strong connections and goodwill among the traditional donors who have long financed the Democratic Party. … But it’s been nowhere near enough to make Biden the leader of the fundraising pack. In fact, his big-dollar dominance, and his reliance on those donors, is more evidence of how quickly small-dollar donations have become the most important component of political fundraising in a sprawling, fractured Democratic race. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg are all outraising Biden, and stockpiling cash significantly faster than him, on the back of major support from online donors that Biden has been unable to build.”



Tim Ryan bows out - NBC News: “Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, ended his long-shot presidential campaign after months of struggling to find a footing in the crowded Democratic field. Ryan announced his decision to end his campaign in a video to supporters, stating he would run again for his House seat. He isn’t throwing his support behind anyone in the 2020 field at this time, his campaign told NBC. ‘I got into this race in April to really give voice to the forgotten people of our country: the workers who have been left behind, the businesses who have been left behind, the people who need health care or aren’t getting a quality education, or are saddled by tremendous debt,’ Ryan said. 'I'm proud of this campaign because I believe we’ve done that. We’ve given voice to the forgotten communities and the forgotten people in the United States.'""



Moderators announced for November debate - NBC News: “The fifth Democratic presidential primary debate in Georgia will have four moderators, MSNBC announced on Wednesday — and all of them are women. Moderating the Nov. 20 event, which is being co-hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post, will be Rachel Maddow, host of ‘The Rachel Maddow Show’ on MSNBC; Andrea Mitchell, host of ‘Andrea Mitchell Reports’ on MSNBC and NBC News' chief foreign affairs correspondent; Kristen Welker, NBC News' White House correspondent; and Ashley Parker, a White House reporter for The Washington Post. The debate will likely feature a smaller lineup of candidates than the dozen who qualified for October's debate in Ohio — only eight candidates have qualified for the debate stage so far, according to an unofficial NBC News tally. It will also be shorter than the three-hour October debate — it's scheduled to air from 9 to 11 p.m. ET.”



BORIS JOHNSON LAUNCHES BID FOR DECEMBER ELECTION

Fox News: “Boris Johnson will launch an attempt to hold a general election in Britain on December 12 to ‘get Brexit done.’ The British prime minister will attempt to convince members of Parliament to formally back the bid on Monday, but he will need the support of two-thirds of the House of Commons. Britain's next scheduled election is not until 2022. Johnson's move comes after his Brexit bill was finally passed earlier this week, but lawmakers defeated his request to push through the legislation in a three-day timetable, saying it didn't provide enough time for scrutiny. He said he expected the European Union to grant an extension to his October 31 deadline, likely to be to the end of January. The EU is expected to give its verdict on an extension on Friday. The prime minister said the Dec. 12 date will give lawmakers time before the election to scrutinize his Brexit bill. Under his plan, Parliament would remain working until Nov. 6, when campaigning would start.”

AUDIBLE: AMEN

“Back in 2015, his city roiled by unrest, by day the congressman was here in the Capitol working and leading in these hallways of power. But every night he rode the train back home and walked the neighborhoods, bullhorn in hand, encouraging unity and peace. Here’s what he said: ‘Let’s go home. Let’s all go home.’ Now our distinguished colleague truly has gone home, home to his Father’s house.” – Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in his condolences for Rep. Elijah Cummings as he lies in state at the U.S. Capitol Thursday.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Without asking you to necessarily weigh in on the ‘wisdom’ of same (unless of course you want to), I have two ‘technical’ and hypothetical impeachment questions: If a president is impeached and IS convicted in the Senate, is he/she eligible to run for re-election? (Somewhat similar situation to Marion Barry in Washington, D.C.) If a president is impeached but is NOT convicted in the Senate, could the House vote to re-impeach the president the next day (perhaps even ad infinitum) in a political ground hog day?” – Dave Wittnebert, Seneca, S.C.



[Ed. note: Most certainly, Mr. Wittnebert. President Trump could be removed from office and seek the presidency a second time, and he could be acquitted in the Senate and be re-impeached. But you’d have to think either scenario would be vanishingly rare. We talk often about impeachment being a political, not legal proposition. But that applies to its aftermath, too. If Trump becomes such a boat anchor that Senate Republicans feel obliged to cut ties with him, it will be because he is too great a political liability/embarrassment. If he is let off by the Senate, House Democrats will move urgently to pivot away from what will almost certainly be a somewhat embarrassing anti-climax.]



“I'm doing a bit of head scratching over what I see as competing information. By this I mean that I'm seeing President Trump's approval rating on a swift downhill slide and at the same time I'm hearing that the Democrats are hand-wringing over whether they have a candidate that can defeat him in 2020. Who needs to be more concerned?” – Neil Klapthor, Evans, Ga.



[Ed. note: The one who’s trailing a year from today! I kid, I kid… mostly. The past three weeks have been brutal for Trump, partly because of Democrats’ closing ranks and prosecuting their impeachment with vigorous determination. But it’s mostly been self-inflicted. Will the trend continue? Almost certainly not. It may get worse for the incumbent over time if further revelations drive a wedge between Trump and the GOP or it may get worse for Democrats because their own penchant for infighting will re-emerge. I suspect it will probably be quite a bit of both. But there are other considerations, particularly the health of the economy in the first two quarters of 2020. Given how much farther this river runs, it’s probably best to sail with the current for now and enjoy the view. We won’t find out who’s going over Niagara for a while yet.]

A PUMPKIN SPICE FLOAT

WTVC: “Around this time of year, most people take to carving pumpkins. But a farmer in Cleveland, Tennessee took things one step further. Justin Ownby grew a massive pumpkin that weighed 910 pounds… But he was not satisfied merely by its ornamental delights that enhance the season. Ownby's wife Christin Ownby shared video with WTVC that shows Ownby hollowed out the pumpkin, and converted to a buoyant watercraft that he tested on his farm's pond. A second video has someone off camera asking him to do his impression of ‘Washington crossing the Delaware!,’ and Ownby stands up as the pumpkin submerges under the sudden weight. Ownby says Justin used a seed to grow the pumpkin that came from a record-breaking pumpkin grown in Tennessee that weighed more than 1,700 pounds. … Christin Ownby says the pumpkin remains floating in the pond at last check, saying ‘It will make a great snack for the catfish!’”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“When I was growing up, I thought ‘gyp’ was simply a synonym for ‘cheat,’ and used it accordingly. It was only when I was an adult that I learned that gyp was short for gypsy. At which point, I stopped using it. … Why? Simple decency. … It’s a question not of who or how many had their feelings hurt, but of whether you want to associate yourself with a word that, for whatever historical reason having nothing to do with you, carries inherently derogatory connotations.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on Oct. 17, 2013.

Those were the words a mother uttered to me following a parent event. I had just spoken on the damages that over-functioning parenting styles can cause to kids. She had just heard the data on how today’s parents often risk too little, rescue too quickly and rave too easily.

For the record, this new parenting style began decades ago when we decided to negotiate our children’s grades in school; to do our kids’ homework for them over a latte, and to give them trophies just for showing up.

COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL: MARKETING CEO GETS 3 WEEKS FOR CHEATING ON SON'S ACT EXAM

Over the years, it seems the helicopter parent has become an Apache helicopter.

As evidence, I submit to you this year’s college admissions scandal – a conspiracy where parents paid bribes to insure their children got into their college of choice. More than 50 people have been charged in the scandal, accused of paying over $25 million between 2011 and 2018. False documents were submitted; SAT scores were adjusted and money was laundered.

Celebrities involved in the scandal include “Full House” actress Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli, who have pleaded not guilty. Actress Felicity Huffman pleaded guilty and is currently serving a 14-day jail sentence and was ordered to also perform 250 hours of community service and pay a $30,000 fine.

LORI LOUGHLIN, MOSSIMO GIANNULLI INDICTED ON NEW FEDERAL CHARGES IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL

The scandal is a case study of the leadership style too many parents of Generation Z children have embraced. These parents have decided to play a more intrusive role in the lives and futures of their children. While most parents may not stoop to illegal activity, they’ve felt the need to prepare the path for the child instead of the child for the path.

I began wondering how this kind of leadership style has impacted our kids.

Our non-profit, Growing Leaders, and the Harris Poll surveyed more than 2,000 adults across America, from a variety of demographics to find out how they felt about Generation Z, the youngest population growing up today.

What we discovered confirmed my hunch. Some 66 percent of American adults have a negative emotion first when they think of kids today.

In other words, the first thing we feel is pessimism, not optimism. Before belief we feel frustration. Before hope we feel fear for them. And 64 percent of us do not believe today’s kids will be ready for adulthood in time.

This fear narrative drives us to be intrusive, especially when we feel our kid won’t be able to negotiate life for themselves. It even leads some parents to cheat to get their kids into college. And it’s had a negative net effect on how teenagers approach life.

As I reviewed how we got here, I discovered the research from Dr. Julian Rotter in 1954. Rotter created a scale to determine whether students were developing an “external locus of control” or an “internal locus of control.” Simply defined, here is the difference:

Internal Locus of Control – People who believe that they are responsible and in control of their own success.

External Locus of Control – People who believe that fate or external forces somehow determine their success.

After nine years of study, Rotter’s conclusions were that students with an “internal locus” became far more successful in life, taking better care of their health, careers and families. It makes sense. They believe they’re responsible for the outcomes.

As I reviewed the last five decades, I saw a steady rise in “external locus of control” among students.

Since 2002, U.S. kids have experienced a steep rise in this “external locus.” More of them feel their lives are out of their control.

Dr. Peter Gray, of Boston College, writes: “In fact, the shift has been so great that the average young person in 2002 was more External than were 80% of young people in the 1960s. The rise in Externality on Rotter’s scale over the 42-year period showed the same linear trend as did the rise in depression and anxiety.”

Reflect for a moment. In “Generation Z Unfiltered,” I pose the question: How do you suppose feeling “out of control of my life” affects a teen? Don’t you feel a little more anxious when someone else is in control of your life?

When kids enter their teenage years, their brains are developing significantly, desiring to take more risks; they naturally yearn for more autonomy and responsibility. It’s how we all get ready for healthy adulthood.

When we don’t equip our children to take on that independence, life gets unhealthy. We must begin to offer our kids a greater sense of ownership by believing in them and their ability to achieve on their own.

When Felicity Huffman was sentenced for her part in the college admissions scandal, she said she felt ashamed and embarrassed. Yet, in an interview she confessed that her sentencing wasn’t the worst part of the ordeal.

Huffman said the worst part was facing her daughter, who said with tears in her eyes: “Why didn’t you believe in me? Why didn’t you think I could do it on my own?”

BIDEN, FACING CASH CRUNCH, FLIPS ON SUPER PAC SPENDING

NYT: “Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s campaign effectively dropped its longstanding opposition to receiving the assistance of super PACs on Thursday, opening the door for wealthy supporters to spend unlimited amounts of money to try and lift him in the Democratic primary. The move represents a stark reversal and an implicit acknowledgment of his weakened position in the contest. He entered October with only $9 million in the bank, a fraction of his leading rivals. … As recently as a month ago, when a possible pro-Biden super PAC surfaced, his campaign denounced the effort. But on Thursday, Kate Bedingfield, his deputy campaign manager, softened that stance… ‘Let’s be clear: Donald Trump has decided that the general election has already begun,’ Ms. Bedingfield said. ‘He and his allies are already spending massive amounts of money on paid television and digital advertising to intervene directly in Democratic primaries with the goal of preventing Joe Biden, the opponent that Trump fears most, from becoming the Democratic nominee.’”



Biden still leads in Warren two-to-one in South Carolina - Fox News: “Joe Biden remains the clear front-runner in the latest poll in South Carolina – which holds the first southern primary in the race for the White House. But the former vice president’s lead is taking a hit as top-tier rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s support soars in the contest the Biden campaign sees as a firewall. Biden – who has longstanding ties in the state – stands at 33 percent among South Carolina voters likely to cast a ballot in the state’s February primary, according to a new poll from Monmouth University. That’s down 6 percentage points from Monmouth’s previous survey in the Palmetto State, which was conducted in July. Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, stands at 16 percent in the survey, a jump of 7 points from July. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is in third in the new poll, at 12 percent.”



Dems nudge debate threshold to 4 percent for December - Politico: “New thresholds announced by the Democratic National Committee for the sixth debate — which will be hosted by POLITICO and PBS on Dec. 19 in Los Angeles — represent only a modest step up from the criteria for the next debate in November. But they could still seriously endanger the participation of all but the top five candidates… To make the December debate, candidates must hit 4 percent support in at least four DNC-approved polls of primary voters nationally or in early-voting states (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina) — or, instead, they can qualify by hitting 6 percent in two approved early-state polls. Candidates must also bring in donations from 200,000 unique donors, with a minimum of 800 donors in 20 states, territories or the District of Columbia.”



Bernie’s small-donor numbers padded by repeat contributions - WSJ: “The February day that Bernie Sanders began his second Democratic presidential campaign, Christine Peloza gave him $27, the amount Mr. Sanders often boasted was the average donation in his first run. Then, she kept giving, in $3 increments, clicking donate up to 20 times a day. By the end of June, Ms. Peloza, a 34-year-old office manager at an elderly care facility in Illinois, had donated more than 850 times to Mr. Sanders… The Sanders campaign laid claim to the majority of these ‘super donors,’ the Journal found, with about 1,000 of them. The other Democrats in the race combined for at least 650 ultra-repeat givers, led by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who had at least 125. And President Trump’s re-election campaign, which began in 2017, has at least 250.”



Gabbard, facing dimming House hopes, drops re-election bid - Reuters: “Tulsi Gabbard, the last House member still in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, said Thursday she would not seek reelection for her Hawaii seat. ‘I believe I can best serve the people of Hawaii and our country as your President and Commander-in-Chief,’ she said in an announcement posted on Twitter. Gabbard’s decision clears the way for Hawaii State Senator Kai Kahele, who announced a primary challenge against her this spring. ‘I wholly respect and appreciate Congresswoman Gabbard’s decision not to pursue re-election for her Congressional seat as she pursues the Presidency,’ Kahele said in a tweet.”



THE RULEBOOK: GUT CHECK

“Let us now pause and ask ourselves whether, in the course of these papers, the proposed Constitution has not been satisfactorily vindicated from the aspersions thrown upon it; and whether it has not been shown to be worthy of the public approbation, and necessary to the public safety and prosperity.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 85



TIME OUT: LASTING LEGACY

WAMU: “There have been several stories recently highlighting the last time a Washington baseball team won a World Series. The answer most given is the Senators in 1924. Now, it’s true that the Senators were Washington’s last major league baseball team to win a World Series. But there was another very successful team to come afterward. The Homestead Grays won three Negro League World Series titles. … Now, there are plenty of reasons why baseball enthusiasts would disagree with this argument. They might say that the Grays were not exclusively a Washington team. They were founded in Pittsburgh in 1912 and didn’t start splitting time until 1940. … Like many Negro League teams, the Homestead Grays did not have a dedicated field. … Washington Senators owner Clark Griffith saw a financial benefit to letting the Grays play some of their games at his stadium in D.C.… Thus, the team became the Washington Homestead Grays.”

IMPEACHMENT WOES FOR SWING STATE GOP SENATORS

NYT: “Senate Republicans facing steep re-election races next year know the impeachment inquiry coursing steadily ahead on the other side of the Capitol will determine President Trump’s political fate. Their growing fear is that it will also determine their own. In a matter of weeks, those few senators have watched helplessly as the investigation by House Democrats has lobbed a grenade into the middle of their campaigns, putting them on the defensive amid a torrent of damaging revelations about the president’s conduct with no clear end in sight. It has tightened the squeeze they were already feeling between a political base that demands unquestioning loyalty to Mr. Trump, and the moderate swing voters who may very well decide their elections. And it is one reason that support for the president in the Republican-led Senate appears to be subtly softening, a phenomenon that some of his own advisers fear that Mr. Trump does not fully appreciate.”



Big bucks for Trump re-elect not trickling down to Senate runs - RCP: “President Donald Trump is raising record amounts of cash for his 2020 reelection. But that fundraising might isn’t spilling over to the most vulnerable Republicans fighting to hold onto their seats in a narrowly divided Senate. During the third quarter, former astronaut Mark Kelly took in $2.5 million more than Republican Sen. Martha McSally in Arizona. In Maine, state House Speaker Sara Gideon bested longtime Republican Sen. Susan Collins by over $1 million. And in Colorado, Cory Gardner, who led Senate Republicans’ campaign arm in 2018, barely outraised former Gov. John Hickenlooper, who had been in the race just five weeks before the quarter ended. The trouble for Republicans extends to states where they’re supposed to be on firmer ground. Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst didn’t crack $1 million and was outraised by the leading Democrat. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis narrowly outraised Democrat Cal Cunningham…”



OBAMA ON CUMMINGS: BEING STRONG MEANS BEING KIND

ABC News: “The funeral for Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings took place in his hometown of Baltimore Friday morning. ‘Elijah Cummings came from good soil,’ former President Barack Obama said in his eulogy. ‘A leader who once said he’d die for his people even as he lived every minute for them. His life validates the things we tell ourselves about what’s possible in this country -- not guaranteed, but possible.’ Obama went on to say that while hearing Cummings’ daughters speak at the funeral, ‘I was thinking I’d want my daughters to know how much I love them, but I’d also want them to know that being a strong man also means being kind, that there’s nothing weak about kindness and compassion. There’s nothing weak about looking out for others. There’s nothing weak about being honorable. You’re not a sucker to have integrity and to treat others with respect.’”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Per your response to a question From the Bleachers in [Thursday’s] Report, Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution provides that conviction post-impeachment can result in permanent disqualification from any federal office. My recollection is that this is an issue apart from mere conviction/removal—an additional punishment the Senate may, but need not confer. Apart from that, I suppose technically anyone can RUN for President, but if subsequent to conviction and with this disqualification applied, s/he would, if somehow elected, be legally barred from actually taking office. Love your Reports, and your appearances on FNC!” – Doug Chamberlain, Hooksett, N.H.



[Ed. note: Quite right you are. The Senate could apply that further sanction. I should have been clear on that point! Thank you for pointing it out.]



“Most batches or degrees do not prepare the recipient to do anything except further education. Taxpayer tuition is for the schools/universities, not students. Maybe ‘free’ tuition for a trade school would benefit the student and the community. I have two graduate degrees and have taught college level courses.” – Jim Fullilove, Shreveport, La.



[Ed. note: America has a most distressing educational problem. College graduation rates continue to rise while high-school graduation rates continue to fall. This is a reflection of a society in which a broad elite – maybe 30 percent of the country – sees increasingly better outcomes, while the remainder is falling farther behind. It strikes me that the important work ought to be done in improving secondary education before we just punt the problem into additional years of universal education.]



“What were you thinking when you included the beloved microwave burrito along with antiquities like Fireball shots or skinny jeans? To this day, I – who travel the roads often for business – can almost always find my comfort food, the microwave burrito, at any hour at any convenience store. It is the perfect culinary treat, containing every food group, … and prepared ‘fresh’ in an aged microwave found buried at the back of the store with pre-set numbered times - as to which you must simply guess. The cheese, beans and other contents are irregularly heated in wonderful patches, and the corners of the flour tortilla without moisture become perfectly crunchy (or just hard). The last salty savory bite from the bottom of the slightly melted plastic wrapper is like the last Oreo in a pack, and it compels you to wonder how much longer to the next highway exit or rest stop, where you might consider getting just one more. Comparing this oasis treat with unproductive party primaries and anti-constitutional, anti-‘democratic republic’ zanies is just wrong.” – Ken Levine, Lionville, Pa.



[Ed. note: Mr. Levine, you are a balm to a weary mind! But what you need, sir, are pepperoni rolls. On your next sojourn southwest, hang a left at Harrisburg down to Interstate 68 and ride down to North Central West Virginia. Buy a large bag – Country Club Bakery, if possible and under no circumstances with cheese – and toss them in your passenger seat. They are the ideal companion for long drives.]

MAYBE TRY FROOT LOOPS AFTER YOUR NEXT COMMUTE

UPI: “Researchers in Virginia said they trained rats to drive tiny cars and learned the activity was a means of stress relief for the rodents. The scientists at the University of Richmond's Lambert Behavioral Neuroscience Laboratory said they trained two groups of rats to operate the ‘rat-operated vehicle,’ or ROV, which works by having the rats push down on a copper bar that propels the tiny car forward. The rats were rewarded with Froot Loops cereal when they drove to the end of the enclosure. Kelly Lambert, head of the laboratory and lead author of the story … said researchers analyzed the rats' droppings and found both groups of rodents had an increase in hormones that control stress responses. … Lambert said the study could have implications for how researchers approach depression and other mental illnesses in humans.”

Trump received the Bipartisan Justice Award from the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center for his legislative strides on the First Step Act, which grants early release to thousands of nonviolent offenders who are currently serving time in federal prisons.

Harris herself was a supporter of the legislation, which received bipartisan support before Trump signed it into law.

KAMALA HARRIS AIDE MOCKED FOR SHARING DOCTORED TRUMP-PELOSI PHOTO, LATER DELETES TWEET

Harris, also a recipient of the award in 2016, took issue with the group's decision and called Trump -- who is facing an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats -- ""a lawless President.""

""Not only does he circumvent the laws of our country and the principles of our Constitution, but there is nothing in his career that is about justice, for justice or in celebration of justice,"" her campaign said in a statement.

She also decried that only a small minority of students at Benedict College, a historically black college in Columbia, secured tickets for Saturday's event because the majority of the seats will be filled by administration officials and Trump supporters.

“Today, when it became clear Donald Trump would receive an award after decades of celebrating mass incarceration, pushing the death penalty for innocent black Americans, rolling back police accountability measures and racist behavior that puts people’s lives at risk, and then learned all but [10] Benedict students are excluded from participating, I cannot in good faith be complicit in papering over his record,” Harris said.

""Instead, I’ll host students from all campuses, as well as the broader Columbia community, to come and discuss this critical issue that I’ve worked on for my entire career,"" she added.

The junior U.S. senator from California was among 10 Democrats expected to attend the forum but instead said she now plans to host her own criminal justice roundtable.

Harris has come under fire for her own record on criminal justice reform.

In her run for the White House, her campaign has consistently touted the progressive aspects of her career as district attorney and later attorney general of California, which include introducing a proposal for nationwide bail reform, as well as legalizing marijuana, which is a part of her comprehensive criminal justice reform agenda if she is elected president in 2020.

But her record as a San Francisco prosecutor has also been scrutinized, as detractors of her campaign point out that although she's outwardly advocated for a ban to capital punishment, Harris has defended the death penalty in court.

She also fought to keep people in prison even after they were proven to be innocent and resisted the release of prisoners from California jails after the Supreme Court deemed that they were overcrowded, and were perpetuating cruel and unusual punishment against its prisoners.

As of mid-week, Harris was polling behind former Vice President Joe Biden, the top contender for the 2020 Democratic nomination, by nearly 22 points, with only 5.3 percentage points, according to RealClear Politics.

A recent Fox News Poll also showed Harris with support from 5 percent of respondents."

“Badly failing presidential candidate @KamalaHarris will not go to a very wonderful largely African American event today because yesterday I received a major award, at the same event, for being able to produce & sign into law major Criminal Justice Reform legislation, which will greatly help the African American community (and all other communities), and which was unable to get done in past administrations despite a tremendous desire for it,” Trump tweeted Saturday morning.

He added: “This and best unemployment numbers EVER is more than Kamala will EVER be able to do for African Americans!”

The president’s tweets came after he received the Bipartisan Justice Award from the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center for his efforts to pass the First Step Act, which grants early release to thousands of nonviolent offenders who are currently serving time in federal prisons.

KAMALA HARRIS TO BOYCOTT FORUM IN PROTEST OF TRUMP AWARD: 'HE'S A LAWLESS PRESIDENT'

After Trump received the award Friday, Harris announced she would skip Saturday's 2019 Second Step Presidential Justice Forum at Benedict College in Columbia.

Later Saturday, Harris hit back at Trump on Twitter, saying: ""My whole life I've fought for justice and for the people — something you'd know nothing about. The only part of criminal justice you can claim credit for is the “criminal” part.""

Instead of attending the forum, Harris said Friday she would “host students from all campuses, as well as the broader Columbia community to come and discuss this critical issue that I’ve worked on for my entire career.”

“As the only candidate who attended an HBCU, I know the importance that these spaces hold for young Black Americans,” Harris said in a statement Friday. “Today, when it became clear Donald Trump would receive an award after decades of celebrating mass incarceration, pushing the death penalty for innocent Black Americans, rolling back police accountability measures and racist behavior that puts people’s lives at risk, and then learned all but ten Benedict students are excluded from participating, I cannot in good faith be complicit in papering over his record.”

But by midday, Harris had come around, with a campaign announcement that she would, in fact, be attending the forum, with her campaign claiming that she successfully pressured the group that awarded the president to be dropped as a sponsor.

“After Senator Kamala Harris stood up and objected to their group awarding Trump and excluding HBCU students from participating, the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center was removed as a sponsor for the criminal justice forum at Benedict College,” the Harris campaign said in a statement Saturday. “After their removal, Harris announced she will join students, Mayor Steve Benjamin and the broader Columbia community on campus at Benedict to discuss critical issues for the country’s justice system.”

Harris, at the event, explained her flip-flop in attendance to reporters.

""Let me just be clear so you can hear it from me,"" she said. ""I refused to come because frankly Benedict College students were excluded and also I said I wouldn't come because I couldn't believe that Donald Trump would be given an award as it relates to criminal justice reform.""

She added: ""This is someone who's disrespected the voices who have fought for justice and sacrificed to create leadership around justice in this system.""

""Someone who dares, dares, use the words lynching on the soil of South Carolina where blood has been spilled, he dares to compare himself to the people who have been on the wrong side of the system,"" she continued, referring to the president's usage of the word ""lynching"" this week when he described the House's formal impeachment inquiry as such. ""That is inappropriate.""

The South Bend, Indiana mayor rolled out his plan, titled “Securing Justice,” and is focused on “rebalancing” and “refocusing” the criminal system in the U.S., and reducing mass incarceration, as well as racial disparities.

TRUMP BLASTS 'BADLY FAILING PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE' KAMALA HARRIS OVER BOYCOTT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM FORUM

“It is past time to transform the criminal legal system to one that truly promotes justice, and benefits all of us,” Buttigieg said.

Buttigieg plans to reduce the number of people incarcerated in the U.S. at both the federal and state level by 50 percent. As part of that effort, Buttigieg said he would prioritize funding for programs aimed at pretrial reforms, decarceration, and expansion of alternative to incarceration programs.

As part of the incarceration reduction plan, Buttigieg said on the federal level, he would eliminate incarceration for drug possession, reduce sentences for other drug offenses, and apply the reductions “retroactively.” Buttigieg said he also would legalize marijuana and “expunge past convictions.”

Buttigieg’s plan also would eliminate mandatory minimums and would establish an “independent clemency commission” outside of the Justice Department.

In addition, Buttigieg said he would “abolish private federal prisons and reduce the use of private contractors,” as well as work with states to “cap the amount of revenue cities and counties receive from fines and fees.”

The plan would also aim to promote justice for youth, with federal support to state efforts to abolish youth prisons and replace them with community-based programs. Buttigieg said he would invest in a new $100 million federal competitive grant program for states and localities to close those prisons, and “repurpose them to serve the needs of children.”

Buttigieg is one of nine Democrats slated to speak at the Second Step Forum in Columbia, South Carolina on Saturday—a criminal justice reform forum.

In a new Fox News op-ed, he wrote that PG&E's ""drastic measures"" have resulted in ""billions lost -- just in October alone.""

Arguing that ""Democrats seeking their party’s 2020 presidential nomination have already embraced some of the same Big Government and radical environmental policies that have brought blackouts to California – and could bring power outages and shortages to our entire nation should one of them become the next president.""

PG&E WORKER TARGETED IN 'DELIBERATE ATTACK' IN CALIFORNIA

PG&E is now admitting it may have sparked one of the state's largest wildfires after a new video revealed the moment the Kincade fire broke out in wine country near a high voltage power line.

Now, the company is announcing some 2.5 million people could lose power for over 48 hours starting this weekend. But, they're not giving a timeframe to residents.

""The last shutdown cost over $2 billion to the economy of the Bay Area. Now, this is a fight between PG&E and the legislature,"" he explained.

CALIFORNIA UTILITY PG&E COULD CUT POWER TO 850,000 HOUSEHOLDS OVER 'HISTORIC WIND EVENT'

""PG&E is held liable, even if they're not fully responsible for these fires. Supposedly they have $30-40 billion in new liabilities for house burning and the like,"" said Del Beccaro.

However, Del Beccaro says that the ""real issue here is that PG&E is a government-controlled monopoly"" that haven't done maintenance for years.

""Well, at least in part, PG&E's never going to be able to recruit this money. So, the national aspect of this starts with -- they're going to need a federal bailout,"" he told Henry. ""They're coming for your tax money.""

He urged voters to remember that California is the ""crown jewel of Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris.""

""They think California's a great social justice state,"" he said.

""That's a coming thing for America and it will cause defaults like you have with PG&E,"" Del Beccaro predicted."

And the thresholds for the White House contenders to make the debate stage are once again rising.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

The Democratic National Committee on Friday announced that the debate will be held on Dec. 19 in Los Angeles at the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs. The DNC said that PBS NewsHour and Politico will co-host the showdown.

The debate will be the first held on the West Coast, and specifically California. The Golden State is playing a larger role this cycle in determining the Democratic presidential nominee. California moved up the date of its primary and will be the largest of the 15 states scheduled to vote on Super Tuesday, which will be held on March 3 of next year.

To make the cut for the Dec. 19 debate, candidates must now receive at least 4 percent support in at least four qualifying national polls or surveys in the early primary and caucus states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina – or hit at least 6 percent in two qualifying polls in the early voting states. Only polls released between Oct. 16 and Dec. 12 will be considered.

The DNC is also upping the fundraising threshold. Candidates will now have to hit campaign contributions from at least 200,000 individual donors – with a minimum of 800 unique contributors in at least 20 states or the District of Columbia.

The candidates have until Dec. 12 – one week before the debate – to hit the fundraising and polling criteria.

SOME 2020 DEMS FUME OVER DNC'S DEBATE CRITERIA

Nine candidates out of the remaining field of roughly 17 Democratic White House contenders say they’ve hit the lower thresholds to make the stage for next month’s fifth-round debate, which will be held Nov. 20 in Georgia. They are former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, businessman and progressive advocate Tom Steyer, and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

Three candidates who reached the October debate stage are at risk of not qualifying for the November showdown. They are Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro of Texas, and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, also of Texas.

The DNC’s qualifying criteria have been repeatedly criticized by many of the middle- and lower-tier candidates for months. Activists also argue that the job of narrowing the field belongs to the voters in the early-voting states rather than with national party leaders.

Pushing back against the criticism, DNC Chairman Tom Perez told Fox News in September that the process has been “eminently fair” and added “we’re going “to continue to be transparent.”"

""I look at a miracle every day when I look in the mirror and see that I'm not in a straitjacket or [have] lost my mind for what I've been through,"" he said. ""I'm a walking testimony. God moves every day through me, encourages me, inspires me to help someone else beyond myself.""

""My wife was going in to have a breast reduction surgery. We [were] married for 41 days,"" Harris recalled. ""I was on a plane... never knowing that when we land, I would get a phone call that said my wife stopped breathing on the table and I needed to hurry up and get to Oklahoma.""

""I end up flying Oklahoma. My wife was dead when I got there,"" he said. Harris said he watched his new bride languish on life support for three days before he made the decision to let her go.

""I had to pull a cord at 28 [years old], having millions of dollars, and nothing could help me at that moment. I lost all purpose for finances, for everything,"" he said.

""I think that my breath right now is being used to teach that suddenly [...] things can change. And with the faith in God, you know that He'll never put more than you can bear,"" Harris added.

Harris also told Ainsley how his experiences and faith have encouraged him to do more and reach out to others in need.

""I remember walking in the airport after I lost my wife, and I was about 300 pounds and I was just crying, walking through the airport,"" Harris recalled. ""And I wanted someone to hold me, hug me or to notice me. But I realized at that moment that everyone was on their own schedules and nothing stops for anyone.""

""So now, because of what I've [been] through, when I go to the airport, my head is on a swivel. I'm looking for the slumped-over shoulders. I'm looking for the guy that may not look approachable, but I know he needs a hug. So I've learned from that situation to take it and help serve someone else,"" he added.

The New York Times has not endorsed a Republican for president since 1956. Prior to the Mueller report, the influential paper published story after story about alleged Russian collusion with the Trump presidential campaign.

Project Veritas, the investigative reporting outfit that uses undercover video, recorded CNN employees complaining about the cable news organization's anti-Trump agenda. On one video, a voice, identified as CNN president and CEO Jeff Zucker, can be heard all but instructing his staffers to focus on impeachment, to the exclusion of what taped staffers say they considered other important news.

""There's a lot of people out here just trying to do what they think is the best of journalistic integrity,"" said one CNN staffer. ""Then you get on the 9 a.m. call and big boss Jeff Zucker f----ing tells you what to do.""

So if viewers assumed the debate moderators' questions wouldn't be tough, they weren't disappointed. Here are just 10 questions that were not asked:

GUTFELD ON THE TRUMP OBSESSION AT THE DEBATE

1. About the Trump tax cuts, Democrats like Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., claim that 83 percent of the benefits would go to ""the top 1 percent, richest people in this country, and the most powerful corporations."" But the Washington Post fact-checker said: ""The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that initially more than 80 percent of taxpayers would get a tax cut, with less than 5 percent getting a tax increase."" Why, then, do you keep restating what The Washington Post said isn't true?

2. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, for years, you've said, ""We are now spending twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country."" And for years, PolitiFact has said that's false. So why do you keep saying it?

3. Many of you support reparations, but former President Obama said, ""Children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime, nine times more likely to drop out of schools and 20 times more likely to end up in prison."" Isn't family breakdown a far bigger problem than a need for reparations?

4. In 1900, government at all three levels -- state, local and federal -- took less than 10 percent of Americans' income. Today, government takes close to 31 percent. How much more income should government take from the American people?

5. In 2017, nearly 40,000 Americans were murdered or committed suicide by firearms, so you've demanded that Congress pass ""commonsense gun control laws"" to save lives. But how many Americans are alive each year because they used firearms in self-defense?

6. Some of you have proposed a ""buyback"" of AR-15s and other ""weapons of war."" In 2018, according to the FBI, there were 297 people killed by rifles -- all rifles, not just AR-15s. But 443 people were killed by hammers, clubs and other blunt objects. And 672 were killed by ""fists, feet and other 'personal weapons.'"" Gun rights advocates argue that these numbers show you have lost perspective. Please comment.

7. You criticize President Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria. But when President Obama withdrew troops from Iraq, Democrats supported the policy -- even though it ran counter to the advice Obama got from his national security team. The withdrawal allowed ISIS to grow and metastasize. Obama sent back about 4,000 troops, and the troop level remains about 5,000. Is it not hypocritical to criticize Trump for doing the same thing that Democrats applauded Obama for?

8. Does President Trump deserve any credit for an economy that's producing rising incomes and record-low unemployment for blacks and Hispanics?

9. Rep. Beto O'Rourke, you say you've benefited from ""white privilege"" and that America is built on ""endemic"" and ""foundational"" racism. On the stage with you are New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, of African descent; Andrew Yang, of Chinese descent; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who is Samoan American; and California Sen. Kamala Harris, whose background is Jamaican and Indian. Why didn't ""endemic"" and ""foundational"" racism prevent these candidates of color from being on the same stage with you, on the same night, competing for the same job?

10. About Charlottesville, where a woman was killed by a white nationalist, you claim President Trump said there were good white nationalists and good neo-Nazis on ""both sides."" In fact, at that very same press conference, Trump said, ""I'm not talking about the white nationalists and the neo-Nazis -- because they should be condemned totally."" Why do you keep misquoting the president?

Compared to previous Democratic debates, this recent three-hour long one aired on CNN rated pretty bad. Who knows? A tough question or two might have generated a bit more interest.

There are new opportunities for some second-tier candidates – especially South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.

Both Buttigieg and Klobuchar used this month’s televised debate to hone their appeal to the moderate wing of the Democratic Party – directly by attacking Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s liberal policy proposals (especially “Medicare-for-all”) and implicitly by being younger than former Vice President Joe Biden.

Going into the debate, the emerging conventional wisdom appeared to be that – for all the energy of over 20 starting candidates – the race was quickly turning into a two-person contest between Warren and Biden.

FORMER HILLARY ADVISER REFUSES TO RULE OUT HILLARY RUNNING IN 2020 -- IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE RIGHT

Warren was running a pitch-perfect effort and consolidating the support of the liberal wing of the party, which seeks fundamental change in the U.S. economic system.

Biden was riding a tide of polling that suggested he would be the strongest general election candidate. He was appealing to a party electorate whose anger at President Trump motivates many of them to care primarily about who has the best chance of achieving their top objective: defeating Trump.

But now folks are realizing the historical truism of the nominating process: It starts in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – and results there can often depart from national polling and have an impact on subsequent contests.

The first three contests rely more on in-state retail politics than on national support, and the one-state nature of each contest enables more-focused media campaigns.

The truism comes out in the polling. In the RealClear Politics averages, Buttigieg currently garners roughly twice as much support in Iowa and New Hampshire as he does nationally.

By contrast, Biden does slightly worse in those states than he’s doing nationally, while the other two leading candidates – Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont – run basically in line with their national performance.

The most recent USA Today Poll showed the leading “candidate” – at 29 percent – is “Undecided,” scoring over 10 points ahead of supposed front-runners Biden and Warren.

Other lower-tier candidates may also benefit from the one-state focus of the first three contests.

Klobuchar, from neighboring Minnesota, is mounting a full-court press in Iowa, vowing to visit all 99 counties. She is shuttling between there and New Hampshire.

But it’s not just Midwestern moderates Buttigieg and Klobuchar who are making strong bids in the early states.

Even novelty candidates – like Andrew Yang, who cleverly uses social media to lead his #YangGang, and self-funding billionaire Tom Steyer – are able to make a push in the smaller early states.

Steyer, though he has yet to articulate a real rationale for his candidacy, is funding enormous media buys in the early states – and as a result is registering 2 or 3 percent in polling there, while barely garnering 1 percent support nationally.

But in a wide-open, in-state race, it is even possible that some of the third-tier, but more traditional candidates – such as Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California and Michael Bennet of Colorado, or Montana Gov. Steve Bullock – might figure out a way to break through or reanimate their fading campaigns.

Still, the three currently leading candidates – Biden, Warren and Sanders – retain the best chance of winning the nomination, even though the race has opened up, and they’re facing clear headwinds.

Warren has run into challenges from two sources. She’d been hoping that Sanders – currently third and, since May, consistently running at around 16 percent in national polls – would fade and enable her to consolidate the support of the left wing of the party, but that hasn’t happened.

Despite recent punditry saying Sanders was losing ground, he reported raising the most money of any candidate in the last reporting period, put in a solid debate performance not long after a heart attack, and won the support of Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.

The endorsements may not affect the bulk of the Democratic electorate, but show that Sanders still has a solid appeal to a significant segment of the left-wing of the Democratic Party.

While Warren can turn that lemon into lemonade by saying she’s more moderate than Republicans like to portray her, she ran into other challenges in the debate. She wasn’t able to articulate a good response to questions about whether “Medicare-for-all” will result in higher taxes.

Face it: “Medicare-for-all” will require tax increases, but one can argue that middle-class Americans will pay less with government-funded health insurance than they pay today separately in both taxes and for private health insurance premiums.

Similarly, Biden has run into headwinds despite a political environment that appears tailor-made for him. With an impeachment inquiry surrounding claims that President Trump sought to extort Ukraine to provide dirt against Biden, it ought to be easy for Biden to make the case that he’s the Democrat Trump fears the most.

It also ought to be easy for Biden to inoculate himself against questions of whether he helped his son get a high-paid position on the board of a Ukrainian company, but it hasn’t been. Instead, Biden seems to have trouble getting those questions behind him. Every time I watch Biden, I think: Presidents Reagan, Clinton, or Bush would’ve had enough political jiu-jitsu to turn this Ukraine story into a winner. Why can’t you?

My sense is that the troubles for Warren and Biden are not over. If the two continue to face challenges in consolidating their separate wings of the party, other candidates may soon claim their place in the spotlight, and could catapult themselves into a leading position.

Indeed, there are calls, especially from donors and uncommitted consultants, for others to join the race.

These new candidates include: former first lady Michelle Obama, who evinces zero interest in running; former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has said he might consider running if Biden falters; and presumably former senator, secretary of state and Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry.

Even one of 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s top aides has publicly said that Clinton should think about entering the race.

My own bet is that Clinton, in particular, is unlikely to run, but quite clearly is enjoying her role on Twitter as an ongoing Trump troll, giving her personal vindication.

Bottom line: the most important numbers to watch will be the polling emerging from the three early states. Those will indicate how the race is evolving.

The polling numbers – which span both before and after the most recent debate – show why one should look primarily at the results of the early states, rather than try to just use national numbers to consider how the nomination contest is shaping up.

The state polls suggest that the Democratic race remains open. None of the top candidates appears to be consolidating support – but they’re not fading, either.

The opportunity for significant changes in the character of the race remain.

“It would be impossible for me to overstate the amount of consternation inside the building around this issue,” Maddow said before bluntly rehashing the all-too-familiar details and bringing Farrow on her show to condemn her employer.

COMCAST CEO BRIAN ROBERTS URGED TO PROBE NBC NEWS’ ‘CULTURE OF WIDESPREAD SEXUAL HARASSMENT’

NBC News chairman Andy Lack and his top deputy, NBC News president Noah Oppenheim, have been adamant that Farrow’s bombshell reporting on Harvey Weinstein wasn’t good enough for their network. The NBC News leaders essentially told Farrow to take his reporting elsewhere, so he published it in The New Yorker where it won a Pulitzer Prize and helped launch the #MeToo movement.

“When you take NBC’s word for it, NBC letting the story get away is a shame. But in Ronan Farrow’s telling, it’s not a shame. It’s a scandal,” Maddow said.

“When you take NBC’s word for it, NBC letting the story get away is shame. But in Ronan Farrow’s telling, it’s not a shame. It’s a scandal."" — Rachel Maddow

Maddow pointed out that the New Yorker published Farrow’s story “less than two months” after NBC sent him packing, implying that she believed the celebrity scion’s version of events. Maddow also independently confirmed Farrow’s claim that NBC ordered him to stop reporting on Weinstein.

NBC NEWS REPORTEDLY RENEWS NOAH OPPENHEIM’S CONTRACT, DRAWING OUTRAGE: 'STATUS QUO HAS BEEN BLESSED'

“Rachel spoke for the voiceless and terrorized staff of NBC News when she described the terrible morale here."" — NBC News insider

Farrow has long claimed that NBC didn’t expose Weinstein as a sexual predator in part because the now-disgraced Hollywood mogul leveraged ex-NBC anchor Matt Lauer’s own sexual misconduct. Once Lauer was fired, Lack and Oppenheim famously refused to launch an outside investigation to determine who knew about his alleged misconduct. Instead, Peacock Network honchos allowed NBCUniversal general counsel Kim Harris to declare her colleagues were oblivious to all wrongdoing.

“There has been consternation, even inside this building, inside MSNBC and NBC News that that matter was handled with an internal investigation. That the company, in effect, investigating itself rather than hiring an external firm to do it,” Maddow admitted.

“NBC News is obviously our parent company here at MSNBC. The allegations about the behavior of Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer are gut-wrenching at baseline no matter who you are or what your connection is to this story,” Maddow continued. “But accusations that people in positions of authority, in this building, may have been complicit in some way, in shielding those guys from accountability. Those accusations are very, very hard to stomach.”

NBC NEWS BOSS ACCUSED OF 'OUTRAGEOUS AND BORDERLINE GRAFT' IN USING 'TODAY' TO FATTEN WALLET

NBC Universal spokeswoman Hillary Smith did not immediately respond when asked if Maddow’s comment will lead to an independent investigation.

Maddow read a statement that she was provided by NBC News declaring the network still stands by the internal review despite widespread scrutiny from people both inside and outside the troubled company.

Maddow began her show the way she does most evenings, delivering a lengthy monologue condemning President Trump. She eventually broke her silence on the Weinstein scandal -- almost two weeks after Farrow’s book was released as NBC News faces everything from protestors swarming its New York City headquarters to some of the most powerful women in media urging parent company Comcast to step in.

WOMEN’S GROUP CALLS FOR DEMS TO PULL MSNBC DEBATE AMID ‘CULTURE OF SEXUAL ABUSE’ AT NBC NEWS

“Rachel spoke for the voiceless and terrorized staff of NBC News when she described the terrible morale here. If her words can’t force an independent investigation -- Noah and Andy have more immunity than Donald Trump,” an NBC News insider told Fox News.

“The Rachel Maddow Show” namesake hammered that the issue is troubling and ongoing, specifically inside NBC’s headquarters -- all before Farrow joined her on set for the second half of the internal takedown.

“I can tell you that inside this building, this issue, the Weinstein story having to leave the building in order to get told, and combine that with another previous gigantic story on a related subject, the ‘Access Hollywood’ tape, Billy Bush story, also having to leave this building in order to get told, the amount of consternation this has caused among the rank and file people that work here would be almost impossible for me to overstate.”

RONAN FARROW 'BEHAVES LIKE A TERRORIST' NBCUNIVERSAL EXECUTIVE REPORTEDLY SAYS

Author and activist Sil Lai Abrams has said she is “one of the many survivors that NBC silenced” and recently detailed claims that her own sexual misconduct bombshell was also shut down by NBC News.

“Noah Oppenheim wants to keep his job. This is his attempt to do so,” Abrams told Fox News. “Letting Maddow be the messenger is smart, but doesn't change the structural issues at the network.”

Maddow also broke the news on Friday that NBC would release alleged victims of sexual misconduct from non-disclosure agreements (NDA) upon request. This is one of numerous issues that women’s groups have urged – but former NBC News correspondent Linda Vester’s Silence Breakers Alliance isn’t satisfied.

“NBC Universal’s statement is not enough. The company should not make any former employee, specifically women, go begging on their hands and knees back to NBC to be released from an NDA. Women have already been through hell with this company,” Silence Breakers Alliance told Fox News.

NBC NEWS BOSS ANDY LACK TAKES AIM AT FARROW'S CLAIMS HE WAS BLOCKED FROM REPORTING ON ALLEGED WEINSTEIN CRIMES

“Instead, here’s what NBC should do: issue a blanket statement simply releasing from NDA’s all current and former NBC News/MSNBC employees who have information regarding sexual misconduct, retaliation, silencing or coverups. Because it’s not just the harassment, it’s everything management does to enable perpetrators and harm victims,” the group continued. “

Silence Breakers Alliance pledged to help any current or former NBC News and MSNBC employees to come forward with information about wrongdoing at the company.

“Despite what Noah Oppenheim claims, the company most definitely does have secrets and something to hide,” Silence Breakers Alliance said.

NBC KILLED MY SEX ASSAULT STORY AFTER FARROW'S WEINSTEIN PIECE, AUTHOR CLAIMS

Meanwhile, as Maddow mentioned, NBC News has still not explained how the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape of Donald Trump was leaked from within Oppenheim’s new division to the Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold -- an old college buddy of Oppenheim.

Fahrenthold, like Farrow, won a Pulitzer Prize for his story that NBC News passed on under Oppenheim. Fahrenthold was later given a paid consultancy with NBC News. Oppenheim and Fahrenthold attended Harvard University together, but NBC has long denied that Oppenheim leaked the scandalous tape to Fahrenthold.

Insiders have long believed that Maddow is the only person with the clout to get away with booking Farrow to attack NBC on MSNBC. It is believed that she had planned the Farrow segment for quite some time and NBC News’ in-house media reporter Claire Atkinson even hinted at it earlier in the week.

It is unclear if Lack and Oppenheim approved of the segment, but Maddow is known to have complete control over her program.

‘TODAY’ ADDRESSES ‘APPALLING’ NEW MATT LAUER REPORT: 'IT’S JUST VERY PAINFUL'

Maddow remains MSNBC’s most-watched host despite viewers turning away when the Robert Mueller’s report failed to backup her longstanding allegations of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. While Maddow earned heavy praise on social media for calling out her own employer Friday night, not everyone was satisfied and MSNBC’s cash cow is clearly peeved at the leaders of her own network.

“Until there is an independent investigation… remains NBC’s word versus Ronan Farrow’s reporting and assertions,” she said."

BIDEN, FACING CASH CRUNCH, FLIPS ON SUPER PAC SPENDING

NYT: “Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s campaign effectively dropped its longstanding opposition to receiving the assistance of super PACs on Thursday, opening the door for wealthy supporters to spend unlimited amounts of money to try and lift him in the Democratic primary. The move represents a stark reversal and an implicit acknowledgment of his weakened position in the contest. He entered October with only $9 million in the bank, a fraction of his leading rivals. … As recently as a month ago, when a possible pro-Biden super PAC surfaced, his campaign denounced the effort. But on Thursday, Kate Bedingfield, his deputy campaign manager, softened that stance… ‘Let’s be clear: Donald Trump has decided that the general election has already begun,’ Ms. Bedingfield said. ‘He and his allies are already spending massive amounts of money on paid television and digital advertising to intervene directly in Democratic primaries with the goal of preventing Joe Biden, the opponent that Trump fears most, from becoming the Democratic nominee.’”



Biden still leads in Warren two-to-one in South Carolina - Fox News: “Joe Biden remains the clear front-runner in the latest poll in South Carolina – which holds the first southern primary in the race for the White House. But the former vice president’s lead is taking a hit as top-tier rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s support soars in the contest the Biden campaign sees as a firewall. Biden – who has longstanding ties in the state – stands at 33 percent among South Carolina voters likely to cast a ballot in the state’s February primary, according to a new poll from Monmouth University. That’s down 6 percentage points from Monmouth’s previous survey in the Palmetto State, which was conducted in July. Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, stands at 16 percent in the survey, a jump of 7 points from July. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is in third in the new poll, at 12 percent.”



Dems nudge debate threshold to 4 percent for December - Politico: “New thresholds announced by the Democratic National Committee for the sixth debate — which will be hosted by POLITICO and PBS on Dec. 19 in Los Angeles — represent only a modest step up from the criteria for the next debate in November. But they could still seriously endanger the participation of all but the top five candidates… To make the December debate, candidates must hit 4 percent support in at least four DNC-approved polls of primary voters nationally or in early-voting states (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina) — or, instead, they can qualify by hitting 6 percent in two approved early-state polls. Candidates must also bring in donations from 200,000 unique donors, with a minimum of 800 donors in 20 states, territories or the District of Columbia.”



Bernie’s small-donor numbers padded by repeat contributions - WSJ: “The February day that Bernie Sanders began his second Democratic presidential campaign, Christine Peloza gave him $27, the amount Mr. Sanders often boasted was the average donation in his first run. Then, she kept giving, in $3 increments, clicking donate up to 20 times a day. By the end of June, Ms. Peloza, a 34-year-old office manager at an elderly care facility in Illinois, had donated more than 850 times to Mr. Sanders… The Sanders campaign laid claim to the majority of these ‘super donors,’ the Journal found, with about 1,000 of them. The other Democrats in the race combined for at least 650 ultra-repeat givers, led by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who had at least 125. And President Trump’s re-election campaign, which began in 2017, has at least 250.”



Gabbard, facing dimming House hopes, drops re-election bid - Reuters: “Tulsi Gabbard, the last House member still in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, said Thursday she would not seek reelection for her Hawaii seat. ‘I believe I can best serve the people of Hawaii and our country as your President and Commander-in-Chief,’ she said in an announcement posted on Twitter. Gabbard’s decision clears the way for Hawaii State Senator Kai Kahele, who announced a primary challenge against her this spring. ‘I wholly respect and appreciate Congresswoman Gabbard’s decision not to pursue re-election for her Congressional seat as she pursues the Presidency,’ Kahele said in a tweet.”



THE RULEBOOK: GUT CHECK

“Let us now pause and ask ourselves whether, in the course of these papers, the proposed Constitution has not been satisfactorily vindicated from the aspersions thrown upon it; and whether it has not been shown to be worthy of the public approbation, and necessary to the public safety and prosperity.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 85



TIME OUT: LASTING LEGACY

WAMU: “There have been several stories recently highlighting the last time a Washington baseball team won a World Series. The answer most given is the Senators in 1924. Now, it’s true that the Senators were Washington’s last major league baseball team to win a World Series. But there was another very successful team to come afterward. The Homestead Grays won three Negro League World Series titles. … Now, there are plenty of reasons why baseball enthusiasts would disagree with this argument. They might say that the Grays were not exclusively a Washington team. They were founded in Pittsburgh in 1912 and didn’t start splitting time until 1940. … Like many Negro League teams, the Homestead Grays did not have a dedicated field. … Washington Senators owner Clark Griffith saw a financial benefit to letting the Grays play some of their games at his stadium in D.C.… Thus, the team became the Washington Homestead Grays.”

IMPEACHMENT WOES FOR SWING STATE GOP SENATORS

NYT: “Senate Republicans facing steep re-election races next year know the impeachment inquiry coursing steadily ahead on the other side of the Capitol will determine President Trump’s political fate. Their growing fear is that it will also determine their own. In a matter of weeks, those few senators have watched helplessly as the investigation by House Democrats has lobbed a grenade into the middle of their campaigns, putting them on the defensive amid a torrent of damaging revelations about the president’s conduct with no clear end in sight. It has tightened the squeeze they were already feeling between a political base that demands unquestioning loyalty to Mr. Trump, and the moderate swing voters who may very well decide their elections. And it is one reason that support for the president in the Republican-led Senate appears to be subtly softening, a phenomenon that some of his own advisers fear that Mr. Trump does not fully appreciate.”



Big bucks for Trump re-elect not trickling down to Senate runs - RCP: “President Donald Trump is raising record amounts of cash for his 2020 reelection. But that fundraising might isn’t spilling over to the most vulnerable Republicans fighting to hold onto their seats in a narrowly divided Senate. During the third quarter, former astronaut Mark Kelly took in $2.5 million more than Republican Sen. Martha McSally in Arizona. In Maine, state House Speaker Sara Gideon bested longtime Republican Sen. Susan Collins by over $1 million. And in Colorado, Cory Gardner, who led Senate Republicans’ campaign arm in 2018, barely outraised former Gov. John Hickenlooper, who had been in the race just five weeks before the quarter ended. The trouble for Republicans extends to states where they’re supposed to be on firmer ground. Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst didn’t crack $1 million and was outraised by the leading Democrat. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis narrowly outraised Democrat Cal Cunningham…”



OBAMA ON CUMMINGS: BEING STRONG MEANS BEING KIND

ABC News: “The funeral for Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings took place in his hometown of Baltimore Friday morning. ‘Elijah Cummings came from good soil,’ former President Barack Obama said in his eulogy. ‘A leader who once said he’d die for his people even as he lived every minute for them. His life validates the things we tell ourselves about what’s possible in this country -- not guaranteed, but possible.’ Obama went on to say that while hearing Cummings’ daughters speak at the funeral, ‘I was thinking I’d want my daughters to know how much I love them, but I’d also want them to know that being a strong man also means being kind, that there’s nothing weak about kindness and compassion. There’s nothing weak about looking out for others. There’s nothing weak about being honorable. You’re not a sucker to have integrity and to treat others with respect.’”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Per your response to a question From the Bleachers in [Thursday’s] Report, Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution provides that conviction post-impeachment can result in permanent disqualification from any federal office. My recollection is that this is an issue apart from mere conviction/removal—an additional punishment the Senate may, but need not confer. Apart from that, I suppose technically anyone can RUN for President, but if subsequent to conviction and with this disqualification applied, s/he would, if somehow elected, be legally barred from actually taking office. Love your Reports, and your appearances on FNC!” – Doug Chamberlain, Hooksett, N.H.



[Ed. note: Quite right you are. The Senate could apply that further sanction. I should have been clear on that point! Thank you for pointing it out.]



“Most batches or degrees do not prepare the recipient to do anything except further education. Taxpayer tuition is for the schools/universities, not students. Maybe ‘free’ tuition for a trade school would benefit the student and the community. I have two graduate degrees and have taught college level courses.” – Jim Fullilove, Shreveport, La.



[Ed. note: America has a most distressing educational problem. College graduation rates continue to rise while high-school graduation rates continue to fall. This is a reflection of a society in which a broad elite – maybe 30 percent of the country – sees increasingly better outcomes, while the remainder is falling farther behind. It strikes me that the important work ought to be done in improving secondary education before we just punt the problem into additional years of universal education.]



“What were you thinking when you included the beloved microwave burrito along with antiquities like Fireball shots or skinny jeans? To this day, I – who travel the roads often for business – can almost always find my comfort food, the microwave burrito, at any hour at any convenience store. It is the perfect culinary treat, containing every food group, … and prepared ‘fresh’ in an aged microwave found buried at the back of the store with pre-set numbered times - as to which you must simply guess. The cheese, beans and other contents are irregularly heated in wonderful patches, and the corners of the flour tortilla without moisture become perfectly crunchy (or just hard). The last salty savory bite from the bottom of the slightly melted plastic wrapper is like the last Oreo in a pack, and it compels you to wonder how much longer to the next highway exit or rest stop, where you might consider getting just one more. Comparing this oasis treat with unproductive party primaries and anti-constitutional, anti-‘democratic republic’ zanies is just wrong.” – Ken Levine, Lionville, Pa.



[Ed. note: Mr. Levine, you are a balm to a weary mind! But what you need, sir, are pepperoni rolls. On your next sojourn southwest, hang a left at Harrisburg down to Interstate 68 and ride down to North Central West Virginia. Buy a large bag – Country Club Bakery, if possible and under no circumstances with cheese – and toss them in your passenger seat. They are the ideal companion for long drives.]

MAYBE TRY FROOT LOOPS AFTER YOUR NEXT COMMUTE

UPI: “Researchers in Virginia said they trained rats to drive tiny cars and learned the activity was a means of stress relief for the rodents. The scientists at the University of Richmond's Lambert Behavioral Neuroscience Laboratory said they trained two groups of rats to operate the ‘rat-operated vehicle,’ or ROV, which works by having the rats push down on a copper bar that propels the tiny car forward. The rats were rewarded with Froot Loops cereal when they drove to the end of the enclosure. Kelly Lambert, head of the laboratory and lead author of the story … said researchers analyzed the rats' droppings and found both groups of rodents had an increase in hormones that control stress responses. … Lambert said the study could have implications for how researchers approach depression and other mental illnesses in humans.”

Trump received the Bipartisan Justice Award from the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center for his legislative strides on the First Step Act, which grants early release to thousands of nonviolent offenders who are currently serving time in federal prisons.

Harris herself was a supporter of the legislation, which received bipartisan support before Trump signed it into law.

KAMALA HARRIS AIDE MOCKED FOR SHARING DOCTORED TRUMP-PELOSI PHOTO, LATER DELETES TWEET

Harris, also a recipient of the award in 2016, took issue with the group's decision and called Trump -- who is facing an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats -- ""a lawless President.""

""Not only does he circumvent the laws of our country and the principles of our Constitution, but there is nothing in his career that is about justice, for justice or in celebration of justice,"" her campaign said in a statement.

She also decried that only a small minority of students at Benedict College, a historically black college in Columbia, secured tickets for Saturday's event because the majority of the seats will be filled by administration officials and Trump supporters.

“Today, when it became clear Donald Trump would receive an award after decades of celebrating mass incarceration, pushing the death penalty for innocent black Americans, rolling back police accountability measures and racist behavior that puts people’s lives at risk, and then learned all but [10] Benedict students are excluded from participating, I cannot in good faith be complicit in papering over his record,” Harris said.

""Instead, I’ll host students from all campuses, as well as the broader Columbia community, to come and discuss this critical issue that I’ve worked on for my entire career,"" she added.

The junior U.S. senator from California was among 10 Democrats expected to attend the forum but instead said she now plans to host her own criminal justice roundtable.

Harris has come under fire for her own record on criminal justice reform.

In her run for the White House, her campaign has consistently touted the progressive aspects of her career as district attorney and later attorney general of California, which include introducing a proposal for nationwide bail reform, as well as legalizing marijuana, which is a part of her comprehensive criminal justice reform agenda if she is elected president in 2020.

But her record as a San Francisco prosecutor has also been scrutinized, as detractors of her campaign point out that although she's outwardly advocated for a ban to capital punishment, Harris has defended the death penalty in court.

She also fought to keep people in prison even after they were proven to be innocent and resisted the release of prisoners from California jails after the Supreme Court deemed that they were overcrowded, and were perpetuating cruel and unusual punishment against its prisoners.

As of mid-week, Harris was polling behind former Vice President Joe Biden, the top contender for the 2020 Democratic nomination, by nearly 22 points, with only 5.3 percentage points, according to RealClear Politics.

“Badly failing presidential candidate @KamalaHarris will not go to a very wonderful largely African American event today because yesterday I received a major award, at the same event, for being able to produce & sign into law major Criminal Justice Reform legislation, which will greatly help the African American community (and all other communities), and which was unable to get done in past administrations despite a tremendous desire for it,” Trump tweeted Saturday morning.

He added: “This and best unemployment numbers EVER is more than Kamala will EVER be able to do for African Americans!”

The president’s tweets came after he received the Bipartisan Justice Award from the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center for his efforts to pass the First Step Act, which grants early release to thousands of nonviolent offenders who are currently serving time in federal prisons.

KAMALA HARRIS TO BOYCOTT FORUM IN PROTEST OF TRUMP AWARD: 'HE'S A LAWLESS PRESIDENT'

After Trump received the award Friday, Harris announced she would skip Saturday's 2019 Second Step Presidential Justice Forum at Benedict College in Columbia.

Later Saturday, Harris hit back at Trump on Twitter, saying: ""My whole life I've fought for justice and for the people — something you'd know nothing about. The only part of criminal justice you can claim credit for is the “criminal” part.""

Instead of attending the forum, Harris said Friday she would “host students from all campuses, as well as the broader Columbia community to come and discuss this critical issue that I’ve worked on for my entire career.”

“As the only candidate who attended an HBCU, I know the importance that these spaces hold for young Black Americans,” Harris said in a statement Friday. “Today, when it became clear Donald Trump would receive an award after decades of celebrating mass incarceration, pushing the death penalty for innocent Black Americans, rolling back police accountability measures and racist behavior that puts people’s lives at risk, and then learned all but ten Benedict students are excluded from participating, I cannot in good faith be complicit in papering over his record.”

Harris, though, supported the First Step legislation, which received bipartisan support.

TRUMP BLASTS 'BADLY FAILING PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE' KAMALA HARRIS OVER BOYCOTT OF FORUM

But by midday, Harris had come around, with a campaign announcement that she would, in fact, be attending the forum, with her campaign claiming that she successfully pressured the group that awarded the president to be dropped as a sponsor.

“After Senator Kamala Harris stood up and objected to their group awarding Trump and excluding HBCU students from participating, the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center was removed as a sponsor for the criminal justice forum at Benedict College,” the Harris campaign said in a statement Saturday. “After their removal, Harris announced she will join students, Mayor Steve Benjamin and the broader Columbia community on campus at Benedict to discuss critical issues for the country’s justice system.”

Harris, at the event, explained her flip-flop in attendance to reporters.

""Let me just be clear so you can hear it from me,"" she said. ""I refused to come because frankly Benedict College students were excluded and also I said I wouldn't come because I couldn't believe that Donald Trump would be given an award as it relates to criminal justice reform.""

She added: ""This is someone who's disrespected the voices who have fought for justice and sacrificed to create leadership around justice in this system.""

""Someone who dares, dares, use the words lynching on the soil of South Carolina where blood has been spilled, he dares to compare himself to the people who have been on the wrong side of the system,"" she continued, referring to the president's usage of the word ""lynching"" this week when he described the House's formal impeachment inquiry as such. ""That is inappropriate.""

KAMALA HARRIS TO BOYCOTT FORUM IN PROTEST OF TRUMP AWARD: 'HE'S A LAWLESS PRESIDENT'

A spokesman for the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.

The senator has come under fire for her own record on criminal justice reform, but her campaign has consistently touted the progressive aspects of her career as district attorney and later attorney general of California, which include introducing a proposal for nationwide bail reform, as well as legalizing marijuana, which is part of her comprehensive criminal justice reform agenda, as rolled out by her campaign.

As of mid-week, polls showed Harris behind former Vice President Joe Biden, the top contender for the 2020 Democratic nomination, by nearly 22 points, drawing only 5.3 percent support, according to RealClear Politics.

A recent Fox News poll also showed Harris with 5 percent support in the race.

The South Bend, Indiana mayor rolled out his plan, titled “Securing Justice,” and is focused on “rebalancing” and “refocusing” the criminal system in the U.S., and reducing mass incarceration, as well as racial disparities.

TRUMP BLASTS 'BADLY FAILING PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE' KAMALA HARRIS OVER BOYCOTT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM FORUM

“It is past time to transform the criminal legal system to one that truly promotes justice, and benefits all of us,” Buttigieg said.

Buttigieg plans to reduce the number of people incarcerated in the U.S. at both the federal and state level by 50 percent. As part of that effort, Buttigieg said he would prioritize funding for programs aimed at pretrial reforms, decarceration, and expansion of alternative to incarceration programs.

As part of the incarceration reduction plan, Buttigieg said on the federal level, he would eliminate incarceration for drug possession, reduce sentences for other drug offenses, and apply the reductions “retroactively.” Buttigieg said he also would legalize marijuana and “expunge past convictions.”

Buttigieg’s plan also would eliminate mandatory minimums and would establish an “independent clemency commission” outside of the Justice Department.

In addition, Buttigieg said he would “abolish private federal prisons and reduce the use of private contractors,” as well as work with states to “cap the amount of revenue cities and counties receive from fines and fees.”

The plan would also aim to promote justice for youth, with federal support to state efforts to abolish youth prisons and replace them with community-based programs. Buttigieg said he would invest in a new $100 million federal competitive grant program for states and localities to close those prisons, and “repurpose them to serve the needs of children.”

Buttigieg also said he would support a constitutional amendment to abolish the death penalty; while also ensuring that detention facilities have medical treatment and appropriate conditions for trans and gender non-conforming inmates.

Buttigieg is one of nine Democrats slated to speak at the Second Step Forum in Columbia, South Carolina on Saturday—a criminal justice reform forum.

2020 presidential hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., is boycotting that event, after the organization gave President Trump an award for his successful passage of the “First Step Act,” which grants earlier release to thousands of nonviolent offenders who are currently serving time in federal prisons.

PG&E is now admitting it may have sparked one of the state's largest wildfires after a new video revealed the moment the Kincade fire broke out in wine country near a high voltage power line.

Now, the company is announcing some 2.5 million people could lose power for over 48 hours starting this weekend. But, they're not giving a timeframe to residents.

""The last shutdown cost over $2 billion to the economy of the Bay Area. Now, this is a fight between PG&E and the legislature,"" he explained.

""PG&E is held liable, even if they're not fully responsible for these fires. Supposedly they have $30-40 billion in new liabilities for house burning and the like,"" said Del Beccaro.

However, Del Beccaro says that the ""real issue here is that PG&E is a government-controlled monopoly"" that haven't done maintenance for years.

""Well, at least in part, PG&E's never going to be able to recruit this money. So, the national aspect of this starts with -- they're going to need a federal bailout,"" he told Henry. ""They're coming for your tax money.""

There are new opportunities for some second-tier candidates – especially South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.

Both Buttigieg and Klobuchar used this month’s televised debate to hone their appeal to the moderate wing of the Democratic Party – directly by attacking Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s liberal policy proposals (especially “Medicare-for-all”) and implicitly by being younger than former Vice President Joe Biden.

Going into the debate, the emerging conventional wisdom appeared to be that – for all the energy of over 20 starting candidates – the race was quickly turning into a two-person contest between Warren and Biden.

FORMER HILLARY ADVISER REFUSES TO RULE OUT HILLARY RUNNING IN 2020 -- IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE RIGHT

Warren was running a pitch-perfect effort and consolidating the support of the liberal wing of the party, which seeks fundamental change in the U.S. economic system.

Biden was riding a tide of polling that suggested he would be the strongest general election candidate. He was appealing to a party electorate whose anger at President Trump motivates many of them to care primarily about who has the best chance of achieving their top objective: defeating Trump.

But now folks are realizing the historical truism of the nominating process: It starts in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina – and results there can often depart from national polling and have an impact on subsequent contests.

The first three contests rely more on in-state retail politics than on national support, and the one-state nature of each contest enables more-focused media campaigns.

The truism comes out in the polling. In the RealClear Politics averages, Buttigieg currently garners roughly twice as much support in Iowa and New Hampshire as he does nationally.

By contrast, Biden does slightly worse in those states than he’s doing nationally, while the other two leading candidates – Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont – run basically in line with their national performance.

The most recent USA Today Poll showed the leading “candidate” – at 29 percent – is “Undecided,” scoring over 10 points ahead of supposed front-runners Biden and Warren.

Other lower-tier candidates may also benefit from the one-state focus of the first three contests.

Klobuchar, from neighboring Minnesota, is mounting a full-court press in Iowa, vowing to visit all 99 counties. She is shuttling between there and New Hampshire.

But it’s not just Midwestern moderates Buttigieg and Klobuchar who are making strong bids in the early states.

Even novelty candidates – like Andrew Yang, who cleverly uses social media to lead his #YangGang, and self-funding billionaire Tom Steyer – are able to make a push in the smaller early states.

Steyer, though he has yet to articulate a real rationale for his candidacy, is funding enormous media buys in the early states – and as a result is registering 2 or 3 percent in polling there, while barely garnering 1 percent support nationally.

But in a wide-open, in-state race, it is even possible that some of the third-tier, but more traditional candidates – such as Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California and Michael Bennet of Colorado, or Montana Gov. Steve Bullock – might figure out a way to break through or reanimate their fading campaigns.

Still, the three currently leading candidates – Biden, Warren and Sanders – retain the best chance of winning the nomination, even though the race has opened up, and they’re facing clear headwinds.

Warren has run into challenges from two sources. She’d been hoping that Sanders – currently third and, since May, consistently running at around 16 percent in national polls – would fade and enable her to consolidate the support of the left wing of the party, but that hasn’t happened.

Despite recent punditry saying Sanders was losing ground, he reported raising the most money of any candidate in the last reporting period, put in a solid debate performance not long after a heart attack, and won the support of Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.

The endorsements may not affect the bulk of the Democratic electorate, but show that Sanders still has a solid appeal to a significant segment of the left-wing of the Democratic Party.

While Warren can turn that lemon into lemonade by saying she’s more moderate than Republicans like to portray her, she ran into other challenges in the debate. She wasn’t able to articulate a good response to questions about whether “Medicare-for-all” will result in higher taxes.

Face it: “Medicare-for-all” will require tax increases, but one can argue that middle-class Americans will pay less with government-funded health insurance than they pay today separately in both taxes and for private health insurance premiums.

Similarly, Biden has run into headwinds despite a political environment that appears tailor-made for him. With an impeachment inquiry surrounding claims that President Trump sought to extort Ukraine to provide dirt against Biden, it ought to be easy for Biden to make the case that he’s the Democrat Trump fears the most.

It also ought to be easy for Biden to inoculate himself against questions of whether he helped his son get a high-paid position on the board of a Ukrainian company, but it hasn’t been. Instead, Biden seems to have trouble getting those questions behind him. Every time I watch Biden, I think: Presidents Reagan, Clinton, or Bush would’ve had enough political jiu-jitsu to turn this Ukraine story into a winner. Why can’t you?

My sense is that the troubles for Warren and Biden are not over. If the two continue to face challenges in consolidating their separate wings of the party, other candidates may soon claim their place in the spotlight, and could catapult themselves into a leading position.

Indeed, there are calls, especially from donors and uncommitted consultants, for others to join the race.

These new candidates include: former first lady Michelle Obama, who evinces zero interest in running; former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has said he might consider running if Biden falters; and presumably former senator, secretary of state and Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry.

Even one of 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s top aides has publicly said that Clinton should think about entering the race.

My own bet is that Clinton, in particular, is unlikely to run, but quite clearly is enjoying her role on Twitter as an ongoing Trump troll, giving her personal vindication.

Bottom line: the most important numbers to watch will be the polling emerging from the three early states. Those will indicate how the race is evolving.

The polling numbers – which span both before and after the most recent debate – show why one should look primarily at the results of the early states, rather than try to just use national numbers to consider how the nomination contest is shaping up.

The state polls suggest that the Democratic race remains open. None of the top candidates appears to be consolidating support – but they’re not fading, either.

The opportunity for significant changes in the character of the race remain.

Houston and Washington are all even in a World Series that has been one big road show.

Alex Bregman busted out of his slump with a go-ahead single in the first inning and a grand slam in the seventh, and the resurgent Astros routed the Nationals 8-1 Saturday night to tie the Series at two games apiece.

Game 1 winner Max Scherzer takes the mound Sunday night hoping to get Washington a home Series victory for the first time since the Senators at Griffith Stadium in 1933. In a rematch of the opener, Gerrit Cole goes for Houston after losing for the first time since May.

Visiting teams have won the first four games for the first time since 1996, when the Yankees broke the pattern in Game 6 against Atlanta to take the title.

Game 6 will be Tuesday night in Houston, when the Astros lose their road-field advantage.

Yuli Gurriel also drove in a run in the first as Houston strung together four singles in a seven-pitch span for a 2-0 lead against Patrick Corbin. Robinson Chirinos homered for the second straight day, a two-run drive that boosted the lead to 4-0 in the fourth.

WORLD SERIES GAME 5 NOW A CERTAINTY -- WILL TRUMP STILL ATTEND?

Fans started leaving in the seventh, when the Astros sent 10 batters to the plate and battered the bullpen. Bregman, who began the night in a 1-for-13 Series slide, had the big blow, driving a low, inside fastball from Fernando Rodney into the left field stands of the ballpark where was the All-Star Game MVP in 2018. He held his bat high as he slowly walked out of the batter's box, then took nearly 30 seconds to circle the bases.

Orange-clad Houston fans in the right field upper deck chanted ""Let's go Astros!"" as Nationals fans were silenced. Wild-card Washington lost consecutive games for the first time since Sept. 13-14 against Atlanta.

Starting pitchers were the talk of the Series coming in, with Washington's Stephen Strasburg, Scherzer and Corbin combining for 12 All-Star selections and three Cy Young Awards. The baseball cards of Houston's Cole, Justin Verlander and Zack Greinke shine with 17 All-Star picks, two Cy Youngs and one MVP.

But there were just five 1-2-3 innings by starters in the first three games, and the most consecutive outs were by the Nationals' Aníbal Sánchez, who retired seven straight in Game 3.

Urquidy, a 24-year-old right-hander, exceeded them all.

Not bad for a TBA.

Urquidy wasn't even announced as Houston's starter until after Game 3, with manager AJ Hinch hoping to piece together innings any way he could.

WASHINGTON NATIONALS SUPERFAN HOPES TO 'BRING SOME GOOD MOJO' TO TEAM WITH INCREDIBLE BEARD DESIGN

The right-hander began the season at Double-A Corpus Christi, was bumped up to Triple-A Round Rock in mid-May and made his major league debut in July. He faced the Nationals in just his 12th big league appearance, joining Fernando Valenzuela (1981) and Jaime García (2011) as the only Mexican starting pitchers in Series history.

Urquidy allowed two hits in five scoreless innings, striking out four and walking none. Mixing four-seam fastballs in the mid-90s (mph) with two-seamers, sliders, curves and changeups, he set down the Nationals in order in the second, fourth and fifth, retiring his final nine batters. He threw 30 of his first 38 pitches for strikes, 45 of 67 overall.

Josh James, Will Harris, Héctor Rondón, Brad Peacock and Chris Devenski combined for two-hit relief.

Washington's best chance to get back into the game came in the sixth, when Harris relieved with two on and one out. Anthony Rendon singled off the pitcher's leg, loading the bases, and Juan Soto drove in a run with a groundout. Harris then struck out Howie Kendrick. After going 7 for 21 with runners in scoring position in the first two games, the Nationals are 1 for 19 in the last two.

Houston flipped for the positive, going 9 for 23 with RISP after starting 3 for 17 in the two losses. The Astros burst ahead with timely hitting for the second straight night, getting consecutive one-out singles by José Altuve, Michael Brantley, Bregman and Gurriel.

Brantley had three hits, raising his Series average to .471 (8 for 17). Bregman also finished with three hits.

Chirinos, who homered off the screen on the left field foul pole to drive in Houston's final run in Game 3, sent a flat changeup from Corbin deep into the left field seats, then slapped his chest and grinned as he skipped across home plate. The catcher doubled in the ninth and is 4 for 11 against the Nationals.

Signed to a $140 million, six-year contract as a free agent last offseason, Corbin dropped to 1-3 in three postseason starts and four relief appearances. He actually lowered his ERA to 6.64.

“It would be impossible for me to overstate the amount of consternation inside the building around this issue,” Maddow said before bluntly rehashing the all-too-familiar details and bringing Farrow on her show to condemn her employer.

COMCAST CEO BRIAN ROBERTS URGED TO PROBE NBC NEWS’ ‘CULTURE OF WIDESPREAD SEXUAL HARASSMENT’

NBC News chairman Andy Lack and his top deputy, NBC News president Noah Oppenheim, have been adamant that Farrow’s bombshell reporting on Harvey Weinstein wasn’t good enough for their network. The NBC News leaders essentially told Farrow to take his reporting elsewhere, so he published it in The New Yorker where it won a Pulitzer Prize and helped launch the #MeToo movement.

“When you take NBC’s word for it, NBC letting the story get away is a shame. But in Ronan Farrow’s telling, it’s not a shame. It’s a scandal,” Maddow said.

“When you take NBC’s word for it, NBC letting the story get away is shame. But in Ronan Farrow’s telling, it’s not a shame. It’s a scandal."" — Rachel Maddow

Maddow pointed out that the New Yorker published Farrow’s story “less than two months” after NBC sent him packing, implying that she believed the celebrity scion’s version of events. Maddow also independently confirmed Farrow’s claim that NBC ordered him to stop reporting on Weinstein.

Farrow has long claimed that NBC didn’t expose Weinstein as a sexual predator in part because the now-disgraced Hollywood mogul leveraged ex-NBC anchor Matt Lauer’s own sexual misconduct. Once Lauer was fired, Lack and Oppenheim famously refused to launch an outside investigation to determine who knew about his alleged misconduct. Instead, Peacock Network honchos allowed NBCUniversal general counsel Kim Harris to declare her colleagues were oblivious to all wrongdoing.

“There has been consternation, even inside this building, inside MSNBC and NBC News that that matter was handled with an internal investigation. That the company, in effect, investigating itself rather than hiring an external firm to do it,” Maddow admitted.

“NBC News is obviously our parent company here at MSNBC. The allegations about the behavior of Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer are gut-wrenching at baseline no matter who you are or what your connection is to this story,” Maddow continued. “But accusations that people in positions of authority, in this building, may have been complicit in some way, in shielding those guys from accountability. Those accusations are very, very hard to stomach.”

NBC NEWS BOSS ACCUSED OF 'OUTRAGEOUS AND BORDERLINE GRAFT' IN USING 'TODAY' TO FATTEN WALLET

NBC Universal spokeswoman Hillary Smith did not immediately respond when asked if Maddow’s comment will lead to an independent investigation.

Maddow read a statement that she was provided by NBC News declaring the network still stands by the internal review despite widespread scrutiny from people both inside and outside the troubled company.

Maddow began her show the way she does most evenings, delivering a lengthy monologue condemning President Trump. She eventually broke her silence on the Weinstein scandal -- almost two weeks after Farrow’s book was released as NBC News faces everything from protestors swarming its New York City headquarters to some of the most powerful women in media urging parent company Comcast to step in.

WOMEN’S GROUP CALLS FOR DEMS TO PULL MSNBC DEBATE AMID ‘CULTURE OF SEXUAL ABUSE’ AT NBC NEWS

“Rachel spoke for the voiceless and terrorized staff of NBC News when she described the terrible morale here. If her words can’t force an independent investigation -- Noah and Andy have more immunity than Donald Trump,” an NBC News insider told Fox News.

“The Rachel Maddow Show” namesake hammered that the issue is troubling and ongoing, specifically inside NBC’s headquarters -- all before Farrow joined her on set for the second half of the internal takedown.

“I can tell you that inside this building, this issue, the Weinstein story having to leave the building in order to get told, and combine that with another previous gigantic story on a related subject, the ‘Access Hollywood’ tape, Billy Bush story, also having to leave this building in order to get told, the amount of consternation this has caused among the rank and file people that work here would be almost impossible for me to overstate.”

RONAN FARROW 'BEHAVES LIKE A TERRORIST' NBCUNIVERSAL EXECUTIVE REPORTEDLY SAYS

Author and activist Sil Lai Abrams has said she is “one of the many survivors that NBC silenced” and recently detailed claims that her own sexual misconduct bombshell was also shut down by NBC News.

“Noah Oppenheim wants to keep his job. This is his attempt to do so. Letting Maddow be the messenger is smart, but doesn't change the structural issues at the network.” — Sil Lai Abrams

“Noah Oppenheim wants to keep his job. This is his attempt to do so,” Abrams told Fox News. “Letting Maddow be the messenger is smart, but doesn't change the structural issues at the network.”

Maddow also broke the news on Friday that NBC would release alleged victims of sexual misconduct from non-disclosure agreements (NDA) upon request. This is one of numerous issues that women’s groups have urged – but former NBC News correspondent Linda Vester’s Silence Breakers Alliance isn’t satisfied.

“NBC Universal’s statement is not enough. The company should not make any former employee, specifically women, go begging on their hands and knees back to NBC to be released from an NDA. Women have already been through hell with this company,” Silence Breakers Alliance told Fox News.

NBC NEWS BOSS ANDY LACK TAKES AIM AT FARROW'S CLAIMS HE WAS BLOCKED FROM REPORTING ON ALLEGED WEINSTEIN CRIMES

“Instead, here’s what NBC should do: issue a blanket statement simply releasing from NDA’s all current and former NBC News/MSNBC employees who have information regarding sexual misconduct, retaliation, silencing or coverups. Because it’s not just the harassment, it’s everything management does to enable perpetrators and harm victims,” the group continued. “

Silence Breakers Alliance pledged to help any current or former NBC News and MSNBC employees to come forward with information about wrongdoing at the company.

“Despite what Noah Oppenheim claims, the company most definitely does have secrets and something to hide,” Silence Breakers Alliance said.

NBC KILLED MY SEX ASSAULT STORY AFTER FARROW'S WEINSTEIN PIECE, AUTHOR CLAIMS

Meanwhile, as Maddow mentioned, NBC News has still not explained how the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape of Donald Trump was leaked from within Oppenheim’s new division to the Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold -- an old college buddy of Oppenheim.

Fahrenthold, like Farrow, won a Pulitzer Prize for his story that NBC News passed on under Oppenheim. Fahrenthold was later given a paid consultancy with NBC News. Oppenheim and Fahrenthold attended Harvard University together, but NBC has long denied that Oppenheim leaked the scandalous tape to Fahrenthold.

Insiders have long believed that Maddow is the only person with the clout to get away with booking Farrow to attack NBC on MSNBC. It is believed that she had planned the Farrow segment for quite some time and NBC News’ in-house media reporter Claire Atkinson even hinted at it earlier in the week.

It is unclear if Lack and Oppenheim approved of the segment, but Maddow is known to have complete control over her program.

‘TODAY’ ADDRESSES ‘APPALLING’ NEW MATT LAUER REPORT: 'IT’S JUST VERY PAINFUL'

Maddow remains MSNBC’s most-watched host despite viewers turning away when the Robert Mueller’s report failed to backup her longstanding allegations of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. While Maddow earned heavy praise on social media for calling out her own employer Friday night, not everyone was satisfied and MSNBC’s cash cow is clearly peeved at the leaders of her own network.

“Until there is an independent investigation… remains NBC’s word versus Ronan Farrow’s reporting and assertions,” she said."

* Yesterday, Donald Trump’s re-election campaign launched a fundraising campaign based on the demise of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the founder and leader of ISIS.

* Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) has thrown her support behind Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) presidential campaign. She’s the fifth sitting U.S. House member to endorse the Vermont senator’s candidacy. Overall, Sanders now ranks fifth in the 2020 field for House endorsements, trailing Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and Elizabeth Warren.

* On a related note, on Election Day 2020, Bernie Sanders will be 79 years old, though the Washington Post reports that the independent lawmaker wants that to be seen as an asset for his presidential campaign.

* As a member of Congress, Mike Pompeo (R-Kansas) was occasionally derided as “the Koch Brothers’ Congressman.” Now that he’s Donald Trump’s secretary of State, eyeing a possible U.S. Senate race in 2020, Pompeo reportedly discussed the race with billionaire Charles Koch late last week.

* On a related note, the Kansas City Star ran a rather brutal editorial on Friday, directed at the Republican cabinet secretary: “If Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is running to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, then he should quit his rather important day job and do that. Or if, as he told The Star and The Wichita Eagle in a testy, credulity-straining interview on Thursday, he isn’t even thinking about it, then he should by all means focus on U.S. diplomacy – remember diplomacy? – and stop hanging out here every chance he gets.”

* As the number of college students casting ballots grows, Republican officials in a variety of states are taking new steps to make it harder for these young voters to participate.

* Maine’s Democratic U.S. Senate primary field narrowed a bit late last week, with retired Air Force Gen. Jon Treacy dropping out of the race, citing subpar fundraising. Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon appears to be the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination.

* And former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, taking on Donald Trump in a GOP primary, was asked last week whom he’d support in a Biden-vs-Trump race. “Could I vote for a Democrat? Hell yes,” Weld replied. “If it’s Trump against Joe Biden, I’m with Biden in a heartbeat.”"

The former Tampa Bay Buccaneers outside linebacker had flown to Baltimore on Oct. 15 to workout with the Ravens soon after being cut following Tampa Bay's 37-26 loss against the Carolina Panthers in London.

Harris, 23, packed his bags and brought an engagement ring he planned to give longtime girlfriend Arianna Marinelli because it looked like he would have to fly to his native Buffalo, N.Y., for the proposal after meeting with the Ravens.

BRETT FAVRE SYMPATHIZES WITH SAM DARNOLD, KNOWS A THING OR TWO ABOUT 'SEEING GHOSTS'

""About an hour and 20 minutes into my flight, I noticed that the ring was gone -- it was missing,” Harris told ESPN. ""The ring is gone. Now I'm like, 'Come on, I'm at the airport, no job right now, no ring -- and things are looking real bleak for me at the moment.'""

He returned to the Hyatt Place hotel but couldn't find the ring, WGRZ-TV reported.

But that's when things turned: He soon received a text message from the Ravens that they were signing him to its practice squad and that a housekeeper had found the ring in the hotel room's kitchen area.

The team picked up the ring and overnighted it to Harris in time for him to pop the question, to which Marinelli said yes.

""I was more concerned about the ring than my job. Screw football, this is about the girl I've been with for seven years,"" Harris told the news station.

His first order of business once he returned to Buffalo was finding the housekeeper, Yvonne Colahar.

“I thought it was a trash bag at first,” said Colahar, who has been with the hotel for 20 years. “I picked it up, looked inside and was like, 'OMG. Like, wow.'""

As a reward, Harris gifted the mother of three who also works part time at the Ravens facility with $1,000 in gift cards.

“I told her to go pay some bills. ... Go get ahead of her bills, just something nice,” Harris said. “My mother was a housekeeper at Erie County Medical Center at Buffalo for so many years working the night shifts. I just related to her story. She was just a genuine human, a genuine person. People aren’t like that anymore. I was so grateful for that.”

“I was like, ‘I was just doing my job.’ And he goes: ‘No. You were doing more than that. Because without it, I couldn’t have done what I did,’"" Colahar explained. ""It’s good to be honest, because without that, there’s nothing.”

Harris’ daughter, Aniah Blanchard, has not been heard from or seen since Wednesday, police said in a statement. She last communicated with a friend just before midnight, they said.

In Instagram and Twitter posts, Harris, the No. 10 among UFC heavyweights, has asked the public for help in finding his daughter.

“If you have any leads, on where our daughter is, please please please go to authorities, tell someone,” Harris said in a video posted to Twitter.

Blanchard’s car was last spotted around 12:30 a.m. on Thursday, Montgomery's WSFA reported. A missing person’s report was filed with the Auburn Police Department later that day, according to the station.

On Friday, Blachard’s abandoned 2017 Honda CR-V was found at an apartment complex in Montgomery, about an hour south of where she was last seen, police said. The vehicle had evidently been damaged on the front right fender and scraped on the passenger door.

Blanchard’s mother, Angela Haley-Harris, told Birmingham’s WBRC that her daughter had met a younger man Wednesday night, but did not know how they met.

On Monday, Auburn police released video footage of Blanchard at a convenience store before her disappearance.

Auburn police said there is no evidence of foul play, but the investigation will continue until she is found.

WALDEN CALLS QUITS AS GOP RETIREMENT RIPTIDE CONTINUES

Politico: “Rep. Greg Walden, the top Republican on the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee, will retire at the end of this Congress, the veteran lawmaker announced Monday. The 62-year-old Walden, who was first elected in 1998, said he was confident he'd win reelection but decided instead to end his congressional career in Jan. 2021. ‘Based on recent polling, strong fundraising, and the backing of my wife and family, I am confident I could earn the support of 2nd District voters for another term.’ … ‘But I also know that for me, the time has come to pursue new challenges and opportunities.’ … The Oregon congressman is the 17th House Republican to announce their retirement this cycle, a sign of how difficult it will be for the GOP to win back the majority in what’s already shaping up as a tough 2020 election.”



California congresswoman resigns amid sex scandal - WaPo: “Rep. Katie Hill (D-Calif.) on Sunday announced her resignation from Congress amid an ethics inquiry into allegations that she had an intimate relationship with a congressional staff member in her office. ‘It is with a broken heart that today I announce my resignation from Congress,’ Hill wrote in a statement. ‘This is the hardest thing I have ever had to do, but I believe it is the best thing for my constituents, my community, and our country.’ Hill’s spokeswoman said that the resignation is not immediate and that Hill is still deciding on when she will leave office. … Last week, the House Ethics Committee opened an investigation into allegations that Hill was romantically involved with her legislative director, Graham Kelly, a relationship that would violate House ethics rules. … Hill’s announcement comes ahead of an early filing deadline for the seat — Dec. 6. Democrats argued Sunday night that they would win the open seat next year in a district that Hillary Clinton won by six percentage points in 2016.”

Smithsonian: “Dogs have helped law enforcement and search-and-rescue crews discover human remains for decades. But recently, a new group has enlisted the help of canines and their olfactory superpowers: archaeologists. In a recent paper in the Journal of Archeological Method and Theory, Vedrana Glavaš, an archaeologist at the University of Zadar in Croatia, and Andrea Pintar, a cadaver dog handler, describe how dogs trained to find human remains helped them track down gravesites dating to around 700 B.C. For The Guardian, Joshua Rapp Learn reports that the team tested the dogs at a hilltop fort called Drvišica along Croatia’s Adriatic coast. … To test the dogs, Glavaš had them sniff around an area where they she had excavated three grave sites the year before. … Two dogs, working independently, easily located all three spots. … The study is a proof of concept that dogs could be used more extensively in archaeology as a non-destructive method of finding human burials…”

BIDEN SAYS HE ASKED OBAMA TO WITHHOLD ENDORSEMENT

NY Post: “Joe Biden claimed in a new interview that he asked Barack Obama not to endorse his run for president — and called President Trump an ‘idiot’ for saying Russian election interference is a ‘hoax.’ The former vice president appeared on ‘60 Minutes’ Sunday where he was asked by anchor Norah O’Donnell if Obama, who he served with for eight years in the White House, offered to throw his full support behind the campaign. ‘No, we didn’t even get there,’ Biden responded. ‘I asked him not to. He said, ‘OK’ ‘I think it’s better — I think he thinks it’s better for me.’ But if he ends up as the 2020 Democratic nominee, Biden, 76, said he had ‘no doubt” that Obama would ‘be out on the campaign trail for me.’”



Olivia Nuzzi: Biden’s zombie campaign - NY Mag: “The looming presence of the last guy, Jim, is especially important for optics. Jim is tall and official-looking. He greets the world chest-first, his hands resting in a dignified clasp, his expression even, his mouth unmoving. Most people assume that he’s a Secret Service agent. Which he was. But ex-VPs don’t get security for life the way ex-presidents do. Most people don’t know that, not even the politically savvy types who attend these sorts of things. And that’s all for the best, because Jim … is a necessary component of the vibe they’re trying to generate here, the Big Presidential Energy, if you will, that powers this production. And it is a production. This is true even when the event is small, which it often is, because the stakes never are — Joe Biden speaking off the cuff is something the entire campaign seems focused on preventing at all costs. … For political reporters, marveling every day at just how well this isn’t going, watching Biden can feel like being at the rodeo. You’re there because on some level you know you might see someone get killed.”



Climb gets steeper for bottom-tier in December debate - FiveThirtyEight: “For many Democratic presidential candidates, making the debates hasn’t been all that difficult. After all, 12 candidates made the stage in October, and nine have already qualified for the November debate. But on Friday, the Democratic National Committee released its strictest qualifying criteria yet, raising both the polling and donor thresholds for the December debate. And it looks like the new rules could be a thorn in the side of many candidates who have, up until now, qualified for recent debates. … But with over a month to still qualify, it’s likely at least two more candidates will make the cut. Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris each only need one more poll to qualify. After that, however, the likelihood that the other candidates qualify becomes, well, debatable.”



Tyler Perry debate host? - Atlanta Journal-Constitution: “We’re being told that the contract has yet to be signed, but plans are for the fifth debate of Democratic presidential candidates to be held on Nov. 20 at Tyler Perry Studios on the grounds of what once was Fort McPherson. … The newly opened $250 million studio is the only major film studio in the nation owned by an African American. The debate is certain to point to a crowning achievement for a once-struggling playwright who, more than 20 years ago, had been kicked out of his apartment and was living out of a car. That’s a message sure to be celebrated by Democrats who will be depending on a strong turn-out by African-Americans, who made up 60% of primary voters in 2018, in the 2020 election season.”



Rashida Tlaib backs Sanders at Detroit rally - Fox News: “Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., became the latest of her fellow ‘Squad’ members to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for president, joining him at a Detroit rally. ‘We deserve someone who writes the damn bills,’ she said, noting Sanders is a man of the people, as Detroit Free Press reported. ‘We deserve Bernie Sanders.’ Tlaib noted that Sanders is a transformative leader who offers solutions not beholden to corporations or the mediocre ideologies of the status quo. … Winning the OK of the ‘Squad’ members has been viewed as crucial in attracting young voters, as the top three Democrats in the polls are all senior citizens — Sanders is 78, former Vice President Joe Biden is 76 and Warren is 70 years old.”



SENATE REPUBLICANS GETTING ANTSY

WaPo: “In hushed conversations over the past week, GOP senators lamented that the fast-expanding probe is fraying their party, which remains completely in Trump’s grip. They voiced exasperation at the expectation that they defend the president against the troublesome picture that has been painted, with neither convincing arguments from the White House nor confidence that something worse won’t soon be discovered. ‘It feels like a horror movie,’ said one veteran Republican senator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly describe the consensus.”



Ex-Bolton aide wants court to decide whether Trump can keep him quiet - Fox News: “Charles Kupperman, a former deputy to ex-National Security Adviser John Bolton, is looking to the courts to resolve a new standoff in the impeachment inquiry, as Democrats threaten him with contempt for defying a subpoena at the direction of the White House. The subpoena had ordered Kupperman to appear for a deposition Monday morning. He did not. In response to a tough letter from House Democratic leaders, Kupperman's attorney Charles Cooper suggested his client is willing to comply with their requests eventually — provided a judge tells him to do so.”



Enten: Impeachment unpopular in key swing states - CNN: “A look at the national polls indicate that impeaching and removing Trump from office is at, a minimum, a plurality position. … Indeed, take an examination of the battleground states that Democrats almost certainly need to make inroads into in 2020. The New York Times and Siena College, 2018's most accurate pollster, took a poll of voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Arizona. These were closest states in the country that cast their electoral votes for Trump in 2016. Just 43% of voters in these six states want to impeach and remove from office at this point. The majority, 53%, do not. This means that the margin for not impeaching and removing Trump in these states (+10 points) is running well ahead of Trump's margin in these states of about 1.5 points. Put another way, impeaching and removing Trump from office in these states is not a popular position.”



BEVIN BLUNDERS WITH DARE TO RIVAL

AP: “Entering the final days of Kentucky’s bitter race for governor, Republican incumbent Matt Bevin exposed himself to a new attack by flatly denying his recorded claim that suicides happen nightly in casinos. Telling a debate audience Saturday night that the truth matters, Bevin challenged his opponent to produce a tape proving his denial wrong. Democrat Andy Beshear offered up the audiotape Sunday. The televised exchange turned Bevin’s summer radio interview on WKDZ into a talking point for Democrats heading into the last full week of campaigning in the close gubernatorial contest. In the interview, Bevin claimed, without offering evidence, that suicides occur on a nightly basis in casinos. The exchange highlighted the rancor between the two rivals, which intensified when Beshear, as the state’s attorney general, repeatedly sued the governor for several of his policy and executive decisions.”

MONDAYS, CINDER, MONDAYS

WTTG: “A morbidly obese cat in Washington is under strict orders to shed some pounds -- and she's not happy about it. The extra-fluffy feline, named Cinder, was put on a water treadmill at a veterinarian's office in Bellingham. But instead of walking on all fours, the fat cat sat in the corner and used just one paw on the treadmill -- all the while meowing in frustration. Cinder, who also goes by the nickname ‘Cinder Block,’ had been surrendered to Northshore Veterinary Hospital by her previous owners. … The animal hospital said they decided to use an underwater treadmill for Cinder because she has arthritis in multiple joints and is carrying an extra 10 pounds of body weight. They started with a low water level to get her used to the feeling and are gradually raising it the more she uses it. Staff said she is still getting acclimated to using the treadmill.”

Game 1 winner Max Scherzer takes the mound Sunday night hoping to get Washington a home Series victory for the first time since the Senators at Griffith Stadium in 1933. In a rematch of the opener, Gerrit Cole goes for Houston after losing for the first time since May.

Visiting teams have won the first four games for the first time since 1996, when the Yankees broke the pattern in Game 6 against Atlanta to take the title.

Game 6 will be Tuesday night in Houston, when the Astros lose their road-field advantage.

Yuli Gurriel also drove in a run in the first as Houston strung together four singles in a seven-pitch span for a 2-0 lead against Patrick Corbin. Robinson Chirinos homered for the second straight day, a two-run drive that boosted the lead to 4-0 in the fourth.

WORLD SERIES GAME 5 NOW A CERTAINTY -- WILL TRUMP STILL ATTEND?

Fans started leaving in the seventh, when the Astros sent 10 batters to the plate and battered the bullpen. Bregman, who began the night in a 1-for-13 Series slide, had the big blow, driving a low, inside fastball from Fernando Rodney into the left field stands of the ballpark where was the All-Star Game MVP in 2018. He held his bat high as he slowly walked out of the batter's box, then took nearly 30 seconds to circle the bases.

Orange-clad Houston fans in the right field upper deck chanted ""Let's go Astros!"" as Nationals fans were silenced. Wild-card Washington lost consecutive games for the first time since Sept. 13-14 against Atlanta.

Starting pitchers were the talk of the Series coming in, with Washington's Stephen Strasburg, Scherzer and Corbin combining for 12 All-Star selections and three Cy Young Awards. The baseball cards of Houston's Cole, Justin Verlander and Zack Greinke shine with 17 All-Star picks, two Cy Youngs and one MVP.

But there were just five 1-2-3 innings by starters in the first three games, and the most consecutive outs were by the Nationals' Aníbal Sánchez, who retired seven straight in Game 3.

Urquidy, a 24-year-old right-hander, exceeded them all.

Not bad for a TBA.

Urquidy wasn't even announced as Houston's starter until after Game 3, with manager AJ Hinch hoping to piece together innings any way he could.

WASHINGTON NATIONALS SUPERFAN HOPES TO 'BRING SOME GOOD MOJO' TO TEAM WITH INCREDIBLE BEARD DESIGN

The right-hander began the season at Double-A Corpus Christi, was bumped up to Triple-A Round Rock in mid-May and made his major league debut in July. He faced the Nationals in just his 12th big league appearance, joining Fernando Valenzuela (1981) and Jaime García (2011) as the only Mexican starting pitchers in Series history.

Urquidy allowed two hits in five scoreless innings, striking out four and walking none. Mixing four-seam fastballs in the mid-90s (mph) with two-seamers, sliders, curves and changeups, he set down the Nationals in order in the second, fourth and fifth, retiring his final nine batters. He threw 30 of his first 38 pitches for strikes, 45 of 67 overall.

Josh James, Will Harris, Héctor Rondón, Brad Peacock and Chris Devenski combined for two-hit relief.

Washington's best chance to get back into the game came in the sixth, when Harris relieved with two on and one out. Anthony Rendon singled off the pitcher's leg, loading the bases, and Juan Soto drove in a run with a groundout. Harris then struck out Howie Kendrick. After going 7 for 21 with runners in scoring position in the first two games, the Nationals are 1 for 19 in the last two.

Houston flipped for the positive, going 9 for 23 with RISP after starting 3 for 17 in the two losses. The Astros burst ahead with timely hitting for the second straight night, getting consecutive one-out singles by José Altuve, Michael Brantley, Bregman and Gurriel.

Brantley had three hits, raising his Series average to .471 (8 for 17). Bregman also finished with three hits.

Chirinos, who homered off the screen on the left field foul pole to drive in Houston's final run in Game 3, sent a flat changeup from Corbin deep into the left field seats, then slapped his chest and grinned as he skipped across home plate. The catcher doubled in the ninth and is 4 for 11 against the Nationals.

Signed to a $140 million, six-year contract as a free agent last offseason, Corbin dropped to 1-3 in three postseason starts and four relief appearances. He actually lowered his ERA to 6.64.

Todd Phillip's R-rated comic-book hit regained the top spot at the weekend box office in its fourth week of release, narrowly besting ""Maleficent: Mistress of Evil."" The Warner Bros.' sensation, starring Joaquin Phoenix, took in $18.9 million in ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.

That came in just above the $18.6 million haul for the Walt Disney Co.'s ""Maleficent"" sequel, which slid to second after a disappointing No. 1 debut last weekend of $36 million. ""Mistress of Evil,"" starring Angelina Jolie, is performing better overseas, where it grossed $64.3 million over the weekend.

'JOKER' SETS NEW BOX OFFICE RECORD

This week, ""Joker"" became the most successful R-rated moved ever, not accounting for inflation, in worldwide release. It's made $849 million globally, including $47.8 million internationally over the weekend. (Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" remains the R-rated domestic leader, with $370.8 million.)

Despite mixed reviews, ""Joker"" — a ""Taxi Driver""-styled spin on a comic-book origin story — has already amassed a box-office total exceeding that of more mainstream superhero movies such as ""Thor: Ragnarok"" and ""Wonder Woman.""

No new releases mustered any competition with the holdovers. The best-performing newcomer was the STX Entertainment horror thriller ""Countdown."" It grossed $9 million. Sony Screen Gems' ""Black and Blue,"" a police thriller starring Naomie Harris, opened with $8.3 million.

Holding especially well was ""The Addams Family,"" United Artists and MGM's Halloween-timed animated reboot of the macabre family. It slid just 28% in its second weekend with $11.7 million, good for third place.

Taika Waititi's ""Jojo Rabbit,"" about a 10-year-old boy growing up in Nazi Germany, expanded into 55 theaters, earning a strong $1 million. In September, the Fox Searchlight release won the Toronto Film Festival's highly predictive audience award , setting it up as a potential Academy Awards favorite.

Alfonso Gomez-Rejon's ""The Current War"" also finally landed in theaters more than two years after it first premiered.

* Yesterday, Donald Trump’s re-election campaign launched a fundraising campaign based on the demise of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the founder and leader of ISIS.

* Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) has thrown her support behind Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) presidential campaign. She’s the fifth sitting U.S. House member to endorse the Vermont senator’s candidacy. Overall, Sanders now ranks fifth in the 2020 field for House endorsements, trailing Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and Elizabeth Warren.

* On a related note, on Election Day 2020, Bernie Sanders will be 79 years old, though the Washington Post reports that the independent lawmaker wants that to be seen as an asset for his presidential campaign.

* As a member of Congress, Mike Pompeo (R-Kansas) was occasionally derided as “the Koch Brothers’ Congressman.” Now that he’s Donald Trump’s secretary of State, eyeing a possible U.S. Senate race in 2020, Pompeo reportedly discussed the race with billionaire Charles Koch late last week.

* On a related note, the Kansas City Star ran a rather brutal editorial on Friday, directed at the Republican cabinet secretary: “If Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is running to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, then he should quit his rather important day job and do that. Or if, as he told The Star and The Wichita Eagle in a testy, credulity-straining interview on Thursday, he isn’t even thinking about it, then he should by all means focus on U.S. diplomacy – remember diplomacy? – and stop hanging out here every chance he gets.”

* As the number of college students casting ballots grows, Republican officials in a variety of states are taking new steps to make it harder for these young voters to participate.

* Maine’s Democratic U.S. Senate primary field narrowed a bit late last week, with retired Air Force Gen. Jon Treacy dropping out of the race, citing subpar fundraising. Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon appears to be the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination.

* And former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, taking on Donald Trump in a GOP primary, was asked last week whom he’d support in a Biden-vs-Trump race. “Could I vote for a Democrat? Hell yes,” Weld replied. “If it’s Trump against Joe Biden, I’m with Biden in a heartbeat.”"

He also recalled feeling uneasy as people celebrated the death of Al Qaeda terrorist leader Usama Bin Laden during the Obama administration.

""He died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming,” Trump said of Al-Baghdadi on Sunday. “The thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, panic and dread – terrified of the American forces bearing down.”

According to Mudd, Trump was aiding the enemy by using language that would galvanize support for terrorists in the Middle East.

""The other thing in terms of language -- you don't taunt an adversary. On Sunday afternoons in football, you tell the guys in the locker room: 'Don’t give them stuff to put on the bulletin board,'"" Mudd said.

""You don’t use that language, which will echo around the Middle East, about things like dogs and whimpering. Because there’s still a lot of people who follow this movement who are going to say, 'You talk about us like that, we’re coming at you.'

One woman who showed up for work told the paper she met the family she works for as they were leaving the house. They told her they wouldn’t be using her that day and handed her a mask.

The early morning scene in the area was chaotic, and no doubt, many families who employ these workers simply forgot to tell them about the evacuations due to the traumatic conditions.

At least eight homes were destroyed and six damaged in the LA-area blaze, fire officials said. Some of the recognizable names driven from their homes included LeBron James and former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.

The former Tampa Bay Buccaneers outside linebacker had flown to Baltimore on Oct. 15 to workout with the Ravens soon after being cut following Tampa Bay's 37-26 loss against the Carolina Panthers in London.

Harris, 23, packed his bags and brought an engagement ring he planned to give longtime girlfriend Arianna Marinelli because it looked like he would have to fly to his native Buffalo, N.Y., for the proposal after meeting with the Ravens.

He returned to the Hyatt Place hotel but couldn't find the ring, WGRZ-TV reported.

But that's when things turned: He soon received a text message from the Ravens that they were signing him to its practice squad and that a housekeeper had found the ring in the hotel room's kitchen area.

The team picked up the ring and overnighted it to Harris in time for him to pop the question, to which Marinelli said yes.

""I was more concerned about the ring than my job. Screw football, this is about the girl I've been with for seven years,"" Harris told the news station.

His first order of business once he returned to Buffalo was finding the housekeeper, Yvonne Colahar.

“I thought it was a trash bag at first,” said Colahar, who has been with the hotel for 20 years. “I picked it up, looked inside and was like, 'OMG. Like, wow.'""

As a reward, Harris gifted the mother of three who also works part time at the Ravens facility with $1,000 in gift cards.

“I told her to go pay some bills. ... Go get ahead of her bills, just something nice,” Harris said. “My mother was a housekeeper at Erie County Medical Center at Buffalo for so many years working the night shifts. I just related to her story. She was just a genuine human, a genuine person. People aren’t like that anymore. I was so grateful for that.”

“I was like, ‘I was just doing my job.’ And he goes: ‘No. You were doing more than that. Because without it, I couldn’t have done what I did,’"" Colahar explained. ""It’s good to be honest, because without that, there’s nothing.”

In Instagram and Twitter posts, Harris, the No. 10 among UFC heavyweights, has asked the public for help in finding his daughter.

“If you have any leads, on where our daughter is, please please please go to authorities, tell someone,” Harris said in a video posted to Twitter.

Biden, once the unrivaled front-runner in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination in most national polling and many early primary and caucus state surveys, now stands at 15 percent support among likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire, according to a new University of New Hampshire poll conducted for CNN.

That's a drop of 9 percentage points since the previous UNH/CNN survey, which was conducted in July.

WARREN OPENS UP 7-POINT EDGE OVER BIDEN IN NATIONAL POLL

Asked about the new poll, Biden told MSNBC on Tuesday that “polls, as you know, are up and down.”

The former vice president stated that he still planned on performing well in New Hampshire and the other early-voting states of Iowa, Nevada and South Carolina.

The survey indicates Sen. Bernie Sanders stands at 21 percent support, with progressive rival Elizabeth Warren at 18 percent. There’s no front-runner in the new poll, as Sanders’ 3 point edge over Warren is within the survey’s sampling error for likely Democratic primary voters. Both Sanders and Warren – who hail from the neighboring states of Vermont and Massachusetts, respectively – stood at 19 percent in the July survey, trailing Biden.

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg – at 10 percent – is the only other candidate in the still-large field of Democratic White House hopefuls to crack double digits. His numbers are unchanged from the summer survey.

The new poll was conducted Oct. 21-27, entirely after the fourth round Democratic presidential nomination debate.

The survey indicates Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang are tied at 5 percent support, with each gaining support from the summer survey. Sen. Kamala Harris of California and billionaire businessman and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer are each at 3 percent. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas register at 2 percent, with everyone else at 1 percent or less.

New Hampshire presidential primary voters are traditionally late deciders, which is reflected in the survey. With three-and-a-half months to go until the February contest, only 23 percent said they’ve definitely decided on which candidate they’ll support. Just over one in five said they’re leaning toward a candidate, with a whopping 57 percent saying they remain undecided.

Biden – who returns to New Hampshire at the end of next week to formally file to place his name on the primary ballot – still leads when it comes to electability. Thirty-six percent of those questioned say he has the best chance of any Democratic White House hopeful of beating President Trump in next year’s general election. But that’s down from 45 percent in July. And in the new survey, the former vice president grabs just 20 percent support among his core groups — voters 50 and older, and self-described moderates and conservatives.

POLL SUGGESTS MICHELLE OBAMA WOULD BE FRONT-RUNNER IN NH IF SHE ENTERED THE WHITE HOUSE RACE

Warren doubled her electability number, from 9 percent in July to 18 percent now. And Sanders widened his lead over Warren as the most progressive candidate in the field — from 40-23 percent in July to 47-18 percent now.

Buttigieg saw his favorable rating rise from 48 percent in July to 55 percent now. Klobuchar saw her favorability soar from 24 percent in the summer to 40 percent now. And Yang’s favorable rating skyrocketed as well, from 17 percent to 36 percent.

In the Republican presidential primary, Trump remains the overwhelming front-runner, with 86 percent support among likely GOP primary voters in New Hampshire.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Even though he’s visited the Granite State nearly every week since launching his long-shot primary challenge in April, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld stood at just 5 percent. But he’s ahead of the two other Republican presidential primary long shots. Both former South Carolina governor and congressman Mark Sanford and former conservative radio talk show host and one-term congressman from Illinois Joe Walsh are each at just 1 percent in the poll.

The UNH/CNN poll was conducted using live telephone operators, who questioned 574 likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire. The margin of error for Democratic primary questions is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points. Four-hundred-and-sixty-one likely GOP primary voters were also questioned, with a sampling error of plus or minus 4.6 percentage points."

DEMS PONDER LATE ENTRY: WHITE KNIGHT OR DON QUIXOTE?

How late is too late?



That’s the question some anxious Democrats are asking as they look beyond the existing field of 2020 candidates for potential nominees to face President Trump.



In the week since a NYT report about Democratic donors looking for new candidates to enter the race was published, there’s been quite a bit of huffing and puffing over the possibility. It’s a fun Washington parlor game, no doubt. But is it anything more than that?



From a practical perspective, it’s probably already too late for all but the most famous, best-liked political figures in the nation to build a campaign that could compete. And that’s a very short list indeed – one that, by our thinking, currently comprises just one person: Michelle Obama.



But what if someone other than the former first lady wanted to launch a bid at this late date?



Names mentioned for a late launch include former Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former Attorney General Eric Holder, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown and former Vice President Al Gore. Candidates like those would certainly make a splash upon entry, but it’s hard to imagine that any of those microwaved leftovers would be more than yet another second-tier contender in a crowded field.



This is already a group in which well-known sitting senators are struggling to get to 3 percent of the vote after months of campaigning and millions of dollars spent. It just doesn’t stand to reason that the aforementioned – especially those only begrudgingly accepted by Democrats in the past – would be doing much better.



As Nate Silver points out, while some Democratic elites may be unsatisfied with their choices, the party as a whole is quite happy with what’s on offer. Polls show very high levels of satisfaction among Democratic voters. And the only place to start would be in attacking the frontrunner, Joe Biden, a move that would only further alienate voters.



Maybe the party insiders are right that the field is actually weak, but if voters don’t agree, a late entrant looks like Don Quixote, not a white knight. And if a candidate like that did want to run, it’s not just the constraints of politics that would be challenging, but the electoral calendar itself.



Democrats have frontloaded their primary schedule for this cycle in hopes of a swift decision. That means that the filing deadlines for key contests are now just weeks away, including New Hampshire on Nov. 15.



More ominously for potential late entrants, Democrats will allocate more than a third of all delegates on Super Tuesday in the first week of March, which means major filing deadlines are fast approaching. The biggest prize of them all, California, requires candidates to file by Nov. 26 for its Super Tuesday contests, with other delegate-rich states like Texas and Massachusetts following soon thereafter.



It may not technically be too late for a candidate with deep pockets and a well-known name to launch a candidacy, but it will be soon. And practically speaking, it’s probably already past time given the demands of fundraising and organizing.



If Democrats do end up with a split decision and a contested convention this summer, it’s possible that delegates could turn to a party elder not already on the ballot. But barring a meltdown in Milwaukee, Democrats will almost certainly have to choose from among those already running.



The musings of donors at dinner parties will more likely slip from memory more quickly than their last bottle of Beaujolais.



SOUTH CAROLINA PRIEST REFUSED BIDEN COMMUNION

Florence [S.C.] Morning News: “Former Vice President Joe Biden, a candidate for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 presidential race, was denied Holy Communion on Sunday morning at a Florence church. Father Robert E. Morey of Saint Anthony Catholic Church confirmed Monday afternoon that he had denied the presidential candidate Holy Communion because of his stance on abortion. Biden, a lifelong Catholic, had attended the church’s 9 a.m. Mass. … ‘Sadly, this past Sunday, I had to refuse Holy Communion to former Vice President Joe Biden,’ Morey told the Morning News via email. … Morey said that as a priest, it is his responsibility to minister to those souls entrusted to his care and that he must do so in even the most difficult situations. ‘I will keep Mr. Biden in my prayers,’ Morey added.”



The storm of Biden media coverage seems to have passed - FiveThirtyEight: “When news about President Trump’s call to Ukraine first broke in late September, it seemed like former Vice President Joe Biden would be inextricably linked to the story. Biden was mentioned in more cable news clips and online news stories that week than every other 2020 Democratic candidate combined, according to data from the TV News Archive, which chops up cable news across the three networks we monitor — CNN, MSNBC and Fox News — into 15-second clips and Media Cloud, a database of online news. That week, Biden was mentioned in 74 percent of cable news clips, while Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the next most-mentioned candidate, was only in 16 percent of clips. In the past two weeks, however, as the initial flood of impeachment coverage has ebbed, so has the extra attention for Biden.”



Bernie gains ground in New Hampshire - CNN: “Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (21%) and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (18%) are in a close race among likely voters in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation Democratic presidential primary, according to a new CNN poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire. Former Vice President Joe Biden stands a shade behind at 15%, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg rounds out the field of four who reach double-digits with 10%. Behind that group, three candidates land at 5% in the poll -- Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and businessman Andrew Yang. California Sen. Kamala Harris, who stood at 9% in a July New Hampshire poll, now holds just 3% support.”



Harris blames her ethnicity, gender for poor performance - National Review: “Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris described electability as the ‘elephant in the room’ of her campaign and pondered whether America is ready for a woman of color to be commander in chief. ‘Essentially, is America ready for a woman and a woman of color to be president of the United States?’ Harris said in an interview with Axios on HBO. ‘There is a lack of ability or a difficulty in imagining that someone whom we have never seen can do a job that has been done 45 times by someone who is not that person.’ The same conversation happened when Barack Obama ran for president, the California senator added. Harris has been especially vocal about both racial justice and women’s rights during her 2020 campaign.”



Harrop: Amy, what’cha wanna do? - Real Clear Politics: “A new piece in The Economist, ‘Amy Klobuchar for sanity,’ urges Democrats to give the senator ‘a look.’ It portrays her as an exemplar of Midwest pragmatism who could become a moderate alternative to Joe Biden. Mayor Pete's ace is his fine intellect and military service in Afghanistan. … His support for extending health coverage to undocumented immigrants has political strategists slapping their heads. Democrats don't like talking about this, but Buttigieg's outwardly gay identity, as well as his tender age of 37, could work against him in a national election. That leaves Klobuchar as one of the more plausible Democrats to beat Trump. Her momentum follows a frontal assault on Elizabeth Warren's ‘Medicare for All’ plan during the debate. Klobuchar called it a ‘pipe dream’ that would require a significant tax increase on the middle class.”



THE RULEBOOK: TRICKLE DOWN

“Civil power, properly organized and exerted, is capable of diffusing its force to a very great extent; and can, in a manner, reproduce itself in every part of a great empire by a judicious arrangement of subordinate institutions.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 13



TIME OUT: UNDER PONTIUS PILATE

NatGeo: “Pontius Pilate is a man many Jews and Christians love to hate. For Christians, the Roman governor of Judaea played a central role in the execution of Jesus around A.D. 30, while for Jews he was a callous ruler who set the stage for the rebellion that led to the destruction of Jerusalem four decades later. But a new discovery suggests that Pilate also spent a good deal of time and money embellishing the famous city that drew Jewish pilgrims as well as visitors from around the Roman Empire. Archaeologists tunneling beneath a Palestinian neighborhood just south of Jerusalem’s walls are uncovering a monumental stepped street that led to the foot of the Temple Mount, the sacred platform that once held the Jewish Temple and now is home to some of Islam’s holiest sites. The impressive walkway stretched more than a third of a mile, was 26 feet wide, and required some ten thousand tons of limestone slabs.”

ARMY COLONEL CORROBORATES QUID PRO QUO CLAIMS

WaPo: “National Security Council Ukraine expert Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman’s testimony in the House impeachment probe Tuesday is shedding new light on how Trump administration officials pressured Ukrainian leaders into investigations that could benefit the president, corroborating other witnesses with a firsthand account of the alleged attempt at a quid pro quo. Vindman’s prepared remarks directly challenge the testimony of U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, who defended the president’s actions and told House investigators that no one had raised concerns about them. Sondland told the top American diplomat in Ukraine, Ambassador William B. Taylor Jr., in September text messages saying [Donald] Trump had not engaged in a quid pro quo; those text messages were provided to investigators by former special U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker earlier this month.”



House to vote Thursday on impeachment procedures - Fox News: “House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Monday the House will vote this week on a resolution to formalize -- and establish the parameters -- of the Trump impeachment inquiry. In a letter sent to Democratic House lawmakers, Pelosi, D-Calif., said the resolution ‘affirms the ongoing, existing investigation’ and ‘establishes the procedure’ for future investigative steps. ‘We are taking this step to eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas, or continue obstructing the House of Representatives,’ Pelosi said. Fox News has learned the vote will take place Thursday on the House floor. It is not an actual article of impeachment, but rather a resolution that sets process ground rules. … The White House argued Monday that the move proves Democrats have been conducting an ‘unauthorized’ inquiry.”



Pelosi looks to keep pressure on GOP with vote - The Atlantic: “The House will be on recess next week, and Democratic members will have to address the impeachment inquiry when they meet with their constituents. For lawmakers in swing districts, the fear of having to take a vote on impeachment—which drove Pelosi’s initial decision not to have one—may have given way to anxiety that the GOP’s accusation of railroading has been resonating with the public. And for most of the party, a vote shouldn’t be difficult: All but a handful of House Democrats have already come out in favor of an impeachment inquiry… Polls have shown a significant bump in support for impeachment since Pelosi announced the start of the inquiry, and it’s less of a vulnerability for Democrats. The pressure will now be on Republicans: Will those like Representatives Francis Rooney of Florida, Will Hurd of Texas, and Mark Amodei of Nevada, who have voiced concerns about Trump’s actions, back the formal opening of an inquiry?”



SESSIONS SAID TO BE CONSIDERING SENATE RETURN BID

Politico: “Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions is strongly considering jumping into the race for his old Senate seat in Alabama, according to multiple Republican sources familiar with the matter. Sessions would scramble the already crowded field of Republicans seeking to take on Democratic Sen. Doug Jones, who won a 2017 special election to fill the remainder of Sessions' term and is widely viewed as the most vulnerable senator on the ballot next year. … Sessions, 72, must decide within days whether to run: Candidates have until Nov. 8 to qualify for the ballot. Five Republicans are already in the race: Rep. Bradley Byrne, former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville, Secretary of State John Merrill, state Rep. Arnold Mooney and Roy Moore, the former state Supreme Court judge who lost the special election in 2017 amid allegations of sexual misconduct.”



North Carolina to toss GOP-drawn House map - The [Raleigh, N.C.] News & Observer: “North Carolina’s 2020 congressional elections must happen under new maps, a panel of judges ruled Monday evening, saying that the current Republican-drawn maps are unfair to many voters. The legislature must now redraw the state’s 13 U.S. House districts. The judges — two Democrats and one Republican from different parts of North Carolina — wrote that the maps show signs of ‘extreme partisan gerrymandering’ which ‘is contrary to the fundamental right of North Carolina citizens to have elections conducted freely and honestly to ascertain, fairly and truthfully, the will of the people.’ Monday’s ruling, a preliminary injunction, said the state may not hold any elections for Congress using the current maps passed in 2016. … The judges ruled that if there aren’t new maps in time for the primary elections on March 3 then they could delay all or some of the primaries until later in 2020.”

DIRTY BIRDS

Anchorage [Alaska] Daily News: “Alaska’s ravens and crows are shiny black pranksters… Rock-dropping black birds — maybe ravens, maybe crows — are accused of smashing out glass in a half-dozen vehicles parked at Soldotna’s Central Peninsula Hospital last week. Keith Randall, the hospital’s security manager, heard about the spate of broken windshields, rear windows and sunroofs and figured he was dealing with a vandalism problem. Randall quickly realized he was. But it wasn’t humans doing the damage. The evidence pointed to black birds… Off-duty nurse Cathy McDaniel was killing time in her pickup … when she heard a giant boom… McDaniel saw a rock. She saw her shattered sunroof. She tossed the rock on the ground -- and saw a black bird fly down, pick it up, and fly off with it. … The hospital posted a Facebook story about the rock-wielding birds. Several commenters shared stories of their own encounters with ravens.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“The lovable old guy [Bernie Sanders] with the big crowds and no chance at the nomination is hardly taken seriously (except by Hillary Clinton, whose inability to put him away reveals daily her profound political weakness).” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Chicago Tribune on June 2, 2016.

WALDEN CALLS QUITS AS GOP RETIREMENT RIPTIDE CONTINUES

Politico: “Rep. Greg Walden, the top Republican on the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee, will retire at the end of this Congress, the veteran lawmaker announced Monday. The 62-year-old Walden, who was first elected in 1998, said he was confident he'd win reelection but decided instead to end his congressional career in Jan. 2021. ‘Based on recent polling, strong fundraising, and the backing of my wife and family, I am confident I could earn the support of 2nd District voters for another term.’ … ‘But I also know that for me, the time has come to pursue new challenges and opportunities.’ … The Oregon congressman is the 17th House Republican to announce their retirement this cycle, a sign of how difficult it will be for the GOP to win back the majority in what’s already shaping up as a tough 2020 election.”



California congresswoman resigns amid sex scandal - WaPo: “Rep. Katie Hill (D-Calif.) on Sunday announced her resignation from Congress amid an ethics inquiry into allegations that she had an intimate relationship with a congressional staff member in her office. ‘It is with a broken heart that today I announce my resignation from Congress,’ Hill wrote in a statement. ‘This is the hardest thing I have ever had to do, but I believe it is the best thing for my constituents, my community, and our country.’ Hill’s spokeswoman said that the resignation is not immediate and that Hill is still deciding on when she will leave office. … Last week, the House Ethics Committee opened an investigation into allegations that Hill was romantically involved with her legislative director, Graham Kelly, a relationship that would violate House ethics rules. … Hill’s announcement comes ahead of an early filing deadline for the seat — Dec. 6. Democrats argued Sunday night that they would win the open seat next year in a district that Hillary Clinton won by six percentage points in 2016.”

TIME OUT: GIVE A DOG A BONE

Smithsonian: “Dogs have helped law enforcement and search-and-rescue crews discover human remains for decades. But recently, a new group has enlisted the help of canines and their olfactory superpowers: archaeologists. In a recent paper in the Journal of Archeological Method and Theory, Vedrana Glavaš, an archaeologist at the University of Zadar in Croatia, and Andrea Pintar, a cadaver dog handler, describe how dogs trained to find human remains helped them track down gravesites dating to around 700 B.C. For The Guardian, Joshua Rapp Learn reports that the team tested the dogs at a hilltop fort called Drvišica along Croatia’s Adriatic coast. … To test the dogs, Glavaš had them sniff around an area where they she had excavated three grave sites the year before. … Two dogs, working independently, easily located all three spots. … The study is a proof of concept that dogs could be used more extensively in archaeology as a non-destructive method of finding human burials…”

BIDEN SAYS HE ASKED OBAMA TO WITHHOLD ENDORSEMENT

NY Post: “Joe Biden claimed in a new interview that he asked Barack Obama not to endorse his run for president — and called President Trump an ‘idiot’ for saying Russian election interference is a ‘hoax.’ The former vice president appeared on ‘60 Minutes’ Sunday where he was asked by anchor Norah O’Donnell if Obama, who he served with for eight years in the White House, offered to throw his full support behind the campaign. ‘No, we didn’t even get there,’ Biden responded. ‘I asked him not to. He said, ‘OK’ ‘I think it’s better — I think he thinks it’s better for me.’ But if he ends up as the 2020 Democratic nominee, Biden, 76, said he had ‘no doubt” that Obama would ‘be out on the campaign trail for me.’”



Olivia Nuzzi: Biden’s zombie campaign - NY Mag: “The looming presence of the last guy, Jim, is especially important for optics. Jim is tall and official-looking. He greets the world chest-first, his hands resting in a dignified clasp, his expression even, his mouth unmoving. Most people assume that he’s a Secret Service agent. Which he was. But ex-VPs don’t get security for life the way ex-presidents do. Most people don’t know that, not even the politically savvy types who attend these sorts of things. And that’s all for the best, because Jim … is a necessary component of the vibe they’re trying to generate here, the Big Presidential Energy, if you will, that powers this production. And it is a production. This is true even when the event is small, which it often is, because the stakes never are — Joe Biden speaking off the cuff is something the entire campaign seems focused on preventing at all costs. … For political reporters, marveling every day at just how well this isn’t going, watching Biden can feel like being at the rodeo. You’re there because on some level you know you might see someone get killed.”



Climb gets steeper for bottom-tier in December debate - FiveThirtyEight: “For many Democratic presidential candidates, making the debates hasn’t been all that difficult. After all, 12 candidates made the stage in October, and nine have already qualified for the November debate. But on Friday, the Democratic National Committee released its strictest qualifying criteria yet, raising both the polling and donor thresholds for the December debate. And it looks like the new rules could be a thorn in the side of many candidates who have, up until now, qualified for recent debates. … But with over a month to still qualify, it’s likely at least two more candidates will make the cut. Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris each only need one more poll to qualify. After that, however, the likelihood that the other candidates qualify becomes, well, debatable.”



Tyler Perry debate host? - Atlanta Journal-Constitution: “We’re being told that the contract has yet to be signed, but plans are for the fifth debate of Democratic presidential candidates to be held on Nov. 20 at Tyler Perry Studios on the grounds of what once was Fort McPherson. … The newly opened $250 million studio is the only major film studio in the nation owned by an African American. The debate is certain to point to a crowning achievement for a once-struggling playwright who, more than 20 years ago, had been kicked out of his apartment and was living out of a car. That’s a message sure to be celebrated by Democrats who will be depending on a strong turn-out by African-Americans, who made up 60% of primary voters in 2018, in the 2020 election season.”



Rashida Tlaib backs Sanders at Detroit rally - Fox News: “Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., became the latest of her fellow ‘Squad’ members to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for president, joining him at a Detroit rally. ‘We deserve someone who writes the damn bills,’ she said, noting Sanders is a man of the people, as Detroit Free Press reported. ‘We deserve Bernie Sanders.’ Tlaib noted that Sanders is a transformative leader who offers solutions not beholden to corporations or the mediocre ideologies of the status quo. … Winning the OK of the ‘Squad’ members has been viewed as crucial in attracting young voters, as the top three Democrats in the polls are all senior citizens — Sanders is 78, former Vice President Joe Biden is 76 and Warren is 70 years old.”



SENATE REPUBLICANS GETTING ANTSY

WaPo: “In hushed conversations over the past week, GOP senators lamented that the fast-expanding probe is fraying their party, which remains completely in Trump’s grip. They voiced exasperation at the expectation that they defend the president against the troublesome picture that has been painted, with neither convincing arguments from the White House nor confidence that something worse won’t soon be discovered. ‘It feels like a horror movie,’ said one veteran Republican senator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly describe the consensus.”



Ex-Bolton aide wants court to decide whether Trump can keep him quiet - Fox News: “Charles Kupperman, a former deputy to ex-National Security Adviser John Bolton, is looking to the courts to resolve a new standoff in the impeachment inquiry, as Democrats threaten him with contempt for defying a subpoena at the direction of the White House. The subpoena had ordered Kupperman to appear for a deposition Monday morning. He did not. In response to a tough letter from House Democratic leaders, Kupperman's attorney Charles Cooper suggested his client is willing to comply with their requests eventually — provided a judge tells him to do so.”



Enten: Impeachment unpopular in key swing states - CNN: “A look at the national polls indicate that impeaching and removing Trump from office is at, a minimum, a plurality position. … Indeed, take an examination of the battleground states that Democrats almost certainly need to make inroads into in 2020. The New York Times and Siena College, 2018's most accurate pollster, took a poll of voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Arizona. These were closest states in the country that cast their electoral votes for Trump in 2016. Just 43% of voters in these six states want to impeach and remove from office at this point. The majority, 53%, do not. This means that the margin for not impeaching and removing Trump in these states (+10 points) is running well ahead of Trump's margin in these states of about 1.5 points. Put another way, impeaching and removing Trump from office in these states is not a popular position.”



BEVIN BLUNDERS WITH DARE TO RIVAL

AP: “Entering the final days of Kentucky’s bitter race for governor, Republican incumbent Matt Bevin exposed himself to a new attack by flatly denying his recorded claim that suicides happen nightly in casinos. Telling a debate audience Saturday night that the truth matters, Bevin challenged his opponent to produce a tape proving his denial wrong. Democrat Andy Beshear offered up the audiotape Sunday. The televised exchange turned Bevin’s summer radio interview on WKDZ into a talking point for Democrats heading into the last full week of campaigning in the close gubernatorial contest. In the interview, Bevin claimed, without offering evidence, that suicides occur on a nightly basis in casinos. The exchange highlighted the rancor between the two rivals, which intensified when Beshear, as the state’s attorney general, repeatedly sued the governor for several of his policy and executive decisions.”

MONDAYS, CINDER, MONDAYS

WTTG: “A morbidly obese cat in Washington is under strict orders to shed some pounds -- and she's not happy about it. The extra-fluffy feline, named Cinder, was put on a water treadmill at a veterinarian's office in Bellingham. But instead of walking on all fours, the fat cat sat in the corner and used just one paw on the treadmill -- all the while meowing in frustration. Cinder, who also goes by the nickname ‘Cinder Block,’ had been surrendered to Northshore Veterinary Hospital by her previous owners. … The animal hospital said they decided to use an underwater treadmill for Cinder because she has arthritis in multiple joints and is carrying an extra 10 pounds of body weight. They started with a low water level to get her used to the feeling and are gradually raising it the more she uses it. Staff said she is still getting acclimated to using the treadmill.”

Kamala Harris said on Monday that President Donald Trump's Twitter account should be suspended following his tweets about the whistleblower whose complaint is at the center of the Ukraine scandal.

""The President's tweets and his behaviors about this are just further evidence of the fact that he uses his power in a way that is designed to beat people down instead of lift people up,"" the California Democrat and 2020 presidential candidate told CNN's Anderson Cooper on ""Anderson Cooper 360.""

""Frankly, when you look at what he's been tweeting today directed at the whistleblower, directed at so many people, you know, I, frankly, think that based on this and all we've seen him do before, including attacking members of Congress, that he, frankly, should be -- his Twitter account should be suspended. I think there is plenty of now evidence to suggest that he is irresponsible with his words in a way that could result in harm to other people. And so the privilege of using those words in that way should probably be taken from him.""

When asked if she thought a suspension of his Twitter account would be seen as the social networking giant trying to silence Trump, Harris said it must be agreed that a US president's words should be ""not about belittling, much less harming, anyone"" and said Trump is using ""his words in a way that could subject someone to harm.""

""If he's not going to exercise self-restraint, then, perhaps, there should be other mechanisms in place to make sure that his words do not, in fact, harm anyone,"" she said. ""And that's my point. What we want to make sure is that his words do not actually result in harm to anyone.""

Factories in a wide range of businesses, from clothing to machinery are suffering declines in exports.

The slowdown in manufacturing — often an early indicator of problems in the wider economy — showed up starkly in a dreadful report released on Tuesday. Factory activity contracted in September for the second straight month; by some measures it was the worst month in a decade. The bad news spooked investors and the Dow fell nearly 350 points, or 1.3%.

We have now tariffed our way into a manufacturing recession in the US and globally.""

President Donald Trump wasted little time finding someone to blame for the gloomy factory activity.

""As I predicted, Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve have allowed the Dollar to get so strong, especially relative to ALL other currencies, that our manufacturers are being negatively affected,"" Trump tweeted minutes after the report was released.

The president continued to blast his handpicked Fed chief, calling the central bank ""pathetic.""

Trump's blame-the-Fed narrative is not supported by the evidence.

The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing report did not mention Fed policy. Nor did it cite borrowing costs, Powell or the strong US dollar. None of the business executives who were quoted in the survey blamed those issues.

Many of them are complaining about something else: the US-China trade war.

""The tariffs have caused much confusion in the industry,"" one electrical equipment, appliance and components manufacturer said.

A food, beverage and tobacco products executive said: ""Chinese tariffs going up are hurting our business. Most of the materials are not made in the US and made only in China.""

Blaming the Fed is 'completely wrong'

The trade war between the world's two largest economies is slowing global trade and raising the cost of goods. That, in turn, is sapping demand for manufactured products.

The on-again, off-again nature of the trade battle is also sparking deep uncertainty. Unclear about how long tariffs will last or how high they will go, business owners have dialed back spending and overhauled supply chains. That uncertainty shock is further eroding demand for manufactured goods.

Not surprisingly, economists and market analysts similarly pinned the bulk of the blame on the trade war, and not the Fed.

""We have now tariffed our way into a manufacturing recession in the US and globally,"" Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakely Advisory Group, wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.

""What is the ultimate cause of all of this? It's the trade war,"" Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, told CNN Business. ""This whole narrative about the Fed being too slow is completely wrong. The Fed has never moved faster.""

The ISM report provides stark evidence of the trade war's fallout. Not only did manufacturing activity dip further into contraction territory in September, but it was the weakest month since June 2009, the final month of the Great Recession.

Fifteen manufacturing industries contracted in September, including apparel, leather & allied products, printing and related support activities and wood products. New export orders, a trade-sensitive component of the report, had its weakest reading since March 2009.

That's not to say there aren't legitimate gripes over China's trade policy. Business leaders have long complained about the theft of intellectual property and non-tariff trade barriers they say do real harm to American companies. But the trade war is clearly hurting the economy.

US manufacturers are also getting dinged by the global economic slowdown. Major economies including China, India, South Korea and Germany have stumbled in recent quarters. That global slowdown is being amplified by the trade war.

""It's all a vicious circle,"" said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell.

Strong dollar isn't helping. But it's not the main problem

Trump is correct to say that the dollar is strong. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar against a basket of currencies, hasn't been this high since the spring of 2017.

But while a strong dollar is great for Americans touring overseas, it makes it harder for US companies to export their goods. Everything from iPhones, tractors and cars get more expensive for foreign buyers. And then multinational companies get dinged when they convert their foreign sales back into dollars.

""The strong dollar is a headwind. But it's not the end of the world,"" said Young.

Trump argued that the Fed deserved the blame for the strong dollar because America has higher interest rates than many other major economies.

But Bank of America's Harris said it is the trade war, not the Fed, that is causing the dollar's strength. Nervous about the global economic slowdown and trade policy, investors are dumping foreign currencies in favor of the greenback.

""The Fed is the thing that has really helped cushion the blow of the trade war. They have been preventing the dollar from being even stronger,"" said Harris.

The Fed, citing the trade war and global slowdown, lowered interest rates twice this summer — the first such cuts since 2008.

Rate cuts are a blunt tool. Cheaper borrowing costs help interest-sensitive sectors, such as housing and autos. But the cost of capital is already near record lows. A discount on borrowing costs won't do much to clear up the uncertainty and supply chain havoc wreaked by the trade war.

""The only reasons anyone cares about the Fed is because we can't get a trade deal. The Fed is an insurance policy,"" said Young, of FTSE Russell. ""What Wall Street wants is an end to tariffs.""

Can households keep propping up growth?

Recent history shows that the United States can avoid a recession even when the ISM manufacturing index drops into contraction territory. That happened multiple times in the 1990s as well as in 2003, 2012, 2013 and in 2016, according to Bespoke Investment Group. That's because manufacturing only makes up a small part of the modern economy.

Consumer spending, which drives about two-thirds of the economy, remains solid because unemployment is low, confidence is strong and US stocks are trading near record highs.

The hope is that consumers will continue to prop things up, extending the longest economic expansion in American history.

And it's still possible that Washington and Beijing, fearing economic trouble, finally reach an agreement to avert another round of tariffs that would damage growth. A trade deal, especially one that rolls back existing tariffs, would boost confidence among CEOs and households.

But some ""cracks"" are starting to show in consumer spending, according to Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.

In a report to clients, she noted that hiring has slowed, personal spending decelerated in September, and consumer confidence in the availability of jobs tumbled.

The risk is that the consumer picture could darken before a trade agreement can be reached.

""If consumers' confidence seriously falters,"" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote on Tuesday, ""the US could tip into the first recession ever caused directly by the actions of the President, rather than the action of tight monetary policy on an overstretched private sector.""

Or as, Bleakley Advisory Group's Boockvar put it, ""using tariffs as the tool to push back against China was a really dumb idea and history will not look kindly upon the strategy.""

No wonder the White House is shifting the blame on the Fed."

Kamala Harris plans to restructure her struggling presidential campaign, sources with knowledge of the staffing plans tell CNN.

The changes represent the clearest sign to date that Harris, who has seen her poll numbers consistently fall over the last three months, feels changes are needed to jumpstart her presidential bid and streamline an operation that one source said has been been bogged down by bureaucratic hurdles.

Harris will elevate Rohini Kosoglu, her Senate chief of staff, and senior adviser Laphonza Butler into senior leadership positions within the campaign, the sources said, splitting responsibilities for the day to day management of the operation.

Juan Rodriguez will remain Harris' campaign manager, but the addition of Kosoglu and elevation of Butler shifts some of the longtime Harris aide's responsibilities to different staffers.

Butler has already had a role on the campaign, leading one source to express skepticism that these changes will result in a markedly different strategy for the struggling campaign. Butler is expected to continue to play a significant role in the campaign's strategy in South Carolina, where a recent CNN poll indicated Harris has fallen to 3%

Kamala Harris raised $11.6 million in the third quarter of 2019, her campaign announced Tuesday, a sum that is consistent with her previous hauls, despite the California Democrat's falling poll numbers.

Harris' standing in the race, after rocketing up in the polls, has fallen in recent months, as the senator struggles to recapture the momentum that she gained during the first Democratic debate in June. Harris' campaign has also been beset by internal issues, with sources telling CNN earlier on Tuesday that the senator was reshaping the senior staff on her campaign in a bid to streamline an operation that one source said has been bogged down by bureaucratic hurdles.

Even still, Harris' fundraising has been notably consistent throughout her presidential run. The candidate raised $12 million in the first quarter and $11.8 million in the second quarter.

The haul puts Harris below some of the race's top fundraisers, like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who announced he raised over $25 million on Tuesday, or South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who announced he had raised over $19 million in the third quarter. But it puts the California Democrat far ahead of candidates like New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who also announced on Tuesday he had raised $6 million in the third quarter.

""This is a campaign that is growing, expanding, and built to win this primary,"" Juan Rodriguez, Harris campaign manager, said in a statement.

Senator Harris is calling for Twitter to silence President Trump after he tweeted that he believes impeachment efforts are actually “a coup” meant to take away the power of the American people, as well as their vote, freedoms, Second Amendment, religion, military, border wall, and God-given rights.

“Hey @jack. Time to do something about this,” tweeted Harris to Dorsey, in an apparent call to ban President Trump from the social media platform over his remarks on Tuesday evening.

Harris was reacting to a specific tweet by President Trump that read, “As I learn more and more each day, I am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP, intended to take away the Power of the….”

In an additional tweet below, the president continued: “….People, their VOTE, their Freedoms, their Second Amendment, Religion, Military, Border Wall, and their God-given rights as a Citizen of The United States of America!”

The senator’s Tuesday tweet doubled down on the comments she made Monday on CNN, in which the 2020 Democrat presidential primary candidate stated that President Trump should be banned from Twitter due to safety concerns.

Harris attempted to justify her argument by insisting that President Trump being free to speak unrestrained on social media could “subject someone to harm.”

“If he’s not going to exercise self-restraint,” said Harris of the president’s tweets, “then perhaps there should be other mechanisms in place to make sure that his words do not in fact harm anyone.”

Harris argues that President Trump’s criticism of the whistleblower and people like Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) — who recently performed an entirely fabricated version of the Trump-Ukraine phone call at a committee hearing — could result in harm, and that the president should therefore be silenced on Twitter.

Harris said on Monday:

Frankly, when you look at what [the president]’s been tweeting — directed at the whistleblower, directed at so many people — you know, I frankly think that based on this and all we’ve seen him do before, including attacking members of Congress that he frankly should be — his Twitter account should be suspended.

“I think there’s plenty of now evidence to suggest that he is irresponsible with his words in a way that could result in harm to other people,” she added. “And so the privilege of using those words in that way should probably be taken from him.”

The views expressed here are hers. Read more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) As a career prosecutor and former attorney general of California, I saw firsthand how counterproductive marijuana laws exacerbated the problem of mass incarceration in my state and in our country -- leading to the disproportionate criminalization of black and brown people in particular.

The fact is, marijuana laws have not been enforced in the same way for all people. Data show that a person of color is much more likely than a white person to be arrested for marijuana possession, despite evidence that Americans use marijuana at nearly the same rate, regardless of race.

As public opinion of marijuana shifts toward legalization , it's time we do the smart thing -- the right thing -- and ensure any marijuana reform legislation we put on the table adequately addresses the harm caused by the failed drug policies of the past.

To protect states like California that have legalized or decriminalized marijuana in recent years, we must act at the federal level to ensure that the US Department of Justice does not encroach to enforce laws that voters and elected officials in those states have decided are unjust and unfair. Additionally, we have to make sure that widespread reform is felt by the communities most harmed by the so-called war on drugs.

Last week, the House of Representatives passed the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act. While its passage is a promising step forward in allowing legal marijuana businesses to access basic banking services -- it is not enough. That is why I am proposing we do more than simply remove barriers to financial services. We should get smart on marijuana reform.

JUST WATCHED Why cannabis stocks are soaring Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Why cannabis stocks are soaring 03:10

First, the bill acknowledges that legalization is only one part of the solution. In addition to legalizing marijuana at the federal level by removing it from the Controlled Substances Act , our bill goes further to add measures to correct the historical injustices of failed drug policies that have disproportionately impacted communities of color and low-income communities.

Second, in keeping with our belief that times have changed and marijuana should not rise to a criminal offense, we must make sure individuals with criminal records that stem from marijuana-related offenses are able to get on with their lives. Too often, people are barred from jobs, educational opportunities and housing due to their marijuana record. That is why this bill requires federal courts to conduct resentencing hearings and expunge nonviolent marijuana-related convictions. It would also protect Americans from being denied federal benefits based on their use or possession of marijuana or prior conviction for a marijuana offense.

Third, my proposal would deliver economic justice to affected communities. The marijuana business is one of the fastest growing money-making industries in today's economy, and individuals and communities disproportionately criminalized by the enforcement of marijuana laws should be first in line to benefit from today's legal marijuana industry. Our bill would authorize a 5% sales tax on marijuana and marijuana products to create new grant programs specifically designed to support businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals entering the legal marijuana industry. It would also provide funding for programs to help minimize barriers to marijuana licensing and employment.

We must ensure that as marijuana becomes a bigger business, we are committing ourselves to rebuilding communities that have been disproportionately targeted by failed drug policies and creating a diverse industry going forward. If we fail to address a system that has historically been infected by racial bias, communities of color will continue to shoulder the devastating impacts of the past.

Times have changed. We must get smart on marijuana reform and give everyone the opportunity to reap the benefits that come from the legal marijuana industry."

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is leading in New Hampshire, slightly edging out Joe Biden (D) and leading Sen.

The poll – which surveyed 423 registered New Hampshire voters likely to vote in the Democrat primary from September 25-29, 2019 – showed Warren leading the primary field with 25 percent support and Biden on her heels with 24 percent support. Sanders, however, struggled to keep up, falling to a distant third place with just 11 percent support.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) came in fourth place, just one point behind the socialist senator, with ten percent support. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) tumbled to fifth place, failing to garner double digits in the Granite State, seeing just five percent support.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MI) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) saw three percent support, followed by Andrew Yang (D) and Tom Steyer (D), who garnered two percent support each. The remaining candidates saw one percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.8 percent:

New Hampshire Institute of Politics Executive Director Neil Levesque highlighted the sense of “fluidity” in the race, due to the fact that “65% of Warren supporters, 72% of Biden supporters, 56% of Sanders supporters, and 73% of Buttigieg voters indicate that they expect that their choice could change between now and the primary election.”

Levesque added:

Among voters who are not firm in their choice, Warren is the 2nd choice of 26%, well ahead of Biden with 12%, Buttigieg with 11%, Sanders with 7% and Harris with 7%. This suggests that when the field begins to winnow down, Warren may in the best position to pick up other candidates’ support. However, if this turns into a two-person race, the nomination may ultimately turn on what sort of candidate Democrats want to send against Donald Trump: one that they believe would make the best president, or one that they believe has the best chance of beating him. If the former, Warren has a clear 27% to 19% advantage over Biden on the question of whom respondents think would make the best President. However, Biden is seen as the strongest nominee against Trump by 37% of voters compared to Warren with 26%. As in our April poll, Warren leads Biden among ‘extremely interested’ and ‘very liberal’ voters, at 28% – 24% and 35% – 11% respectively.

The poll spells trouble for Sanders, who has been slipping in New Hampshire, as recent polls indicate.

A Monmouth Poll released last Tuesday showed a similar trend, with Warren edging out Biden (27 percent to 25 percent) and leading Sanders – who garnered 12 percent support – by double digits:

Patrick Murray, Monmouth University's polling director, acknowledged that their August poll -- which found Warren, Sanders, and Biden in a three-way tie -- was an outlier compared with other polling conducted around the same time.

(CNN) Amid the breathless dissection of President Donald Trump's phone call to the President of Ukraine came another interesting bit of news that was initially drowned out by the focus on the rough transcript .

In a tweet, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler called for Attorney General William Barr to recuse himself from all matters related to the Ukraine investigation. Nadler's rationale was pretty simple: In Trump's call to President Volodymyr Zelensky, the President said he would have Barr speak with Zelensky about an investigation of former Vice President (and current presidential candidate) Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

If mentioning the attorney general's name in a conversation with a foreign leader is reason for recusal, Barr and all future attorneys general won't have much to do.

Nadler sent his recusal tweet before the whistleblower complaint that started this whole controversy was even made public. In the complaint, the whistleblower, who said he had no firsthand knowledge of Trump's call to Zelensky, made the unsubstantiated claim that ""Attorney General Barr appears to be involved as well.""

Based on what we know from the complaint and the transcript, there is nothing in the rules of professional conduct for attorneys, or in the ethics laws governing US public officials, that even comes close to grounds for recusal.

But since Nadler hit ""send"" on his tweet last Wednesday, the chorus for Barr's hide has grown louder, albeit from predictable sources.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday that Barr has ""gone rogue."" Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris told CNN that ""Barr must be held to account."" Exactly for what, I'm not sure.

According to the Department of Justice, Barr has never spoken to Trump about the Ukraine matter, nor has Barr spoken to Zelensky. Democrats and others have speculated about whether Barr withheld, or narrowed, the Justice Department's inquiry into the whistleblower complaint. None of that justifies the way they're targeting him.

Serving as a piñata for Democrats and the certain members of the liberal media is not new for Barr. The calls for his resignation before and after the release of the Mueller report have been loud and clear -- and very unfair.

The reality is that anyone within Trump's orbit who isn't willing to deliver the goods on the President, or who stands in the Democrats' way in their rush to judgment, is a target. Trump's opponents would like Barr to help them make a case against the President, regardless of whether or not such a case exists.

But Barr won't cooperate, and it's driving Democrats to distraction. Instead, the attorney general is doing his job.

Barr was attorney general under George H.W. Bush from 1991 to 1993. Before that, he served as deputy attorney general and assistant attorney general. He's an accomplished prosecutor who believes in the rule of law. He has followed through on his commitment to transparency: Bear in mind that there would have been no release of the Mueller report or the call transcript if not for Barr. It was entirely within his discretion to release the report, and he did so.

Recent news reports indicate that Barr also urged the President to release the transcript of Trump's call with Zelensky.

Barr told CBS News in May that he hadn't been particularly interested in being attorney general for a second time. He never pursued the job, and he certainly didn't need it.

Instead, Barr said he returned to the Justice Department because he believes in public service and told CBS the personal attacks, which he dismisses as an inevitable part of serving in a ""crazy, hyperpartisan period of time,"" don't bother him. Still, Barr doesn't deserve the treatment he's receiving.

Remember, Barr told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he didn't think special counsel Robert Mueller was engaged in a ""witch hunt"" in the Russia investigation.

From what I've seen of his career, Barr isn't an ideologue. When he told the committee he wouldn't be bullied by anyone, including the President, into doing something wrong, I believe he meant it.

Barr, who joined the Trump administration after I left it, must understand that the reason his detractors loathe him so much is because Donald Trump is President, and Barr was chosen by Trump. These detractors don't believe Trump should have been elected.

Ever since then, it's been hate by association.

""One of the ironies today is that people are saying it is President Trump who is shredding our institutions. I really see no evidence of that,"" Barr told CBS in May. ""From my perspective, the idea of 'resisting' a democratically elected President and basically throwing everything at him, and really changing the norms on the grounds that we have to stop this President. That's where the shredding of our norms and institutions is occurring.""

Barr is right. Democrats are throwing everything they can at the President. The damage, to the presidency and the country, has yet to be calculated.

In the meantime, Barr is taking hits he doesn't deserve."

Kamala Harris (D-CA) is set to shake up her flailing campaign amid sagging poll numbers, according to a report.

Politico says most of the changes will be made at the top. Senior staffers such as Rohini Kosoglu, who serves as Harris’s chief of staff in the Senate, and senior adviser Laphonza Butler are expected to be promoted to senior positions. In an attempt to streamline operations, the pair will reportedly oversee the campaign’s different departments.

Harris’ campaign manager, Juan Rodriguez, will stay in his role but will offload some of her responsibilities to Kosoglu and Butler.

“We continue to grow our organization as we enter the fourth quarter, and it has always been the plan to bring on additional management to oversee an expanded staff,” Rodriguez said in a statement to Politico, seemingly confirming the report.

“We continue to grow our organization as we enter the fourth quarter, and it has always been the plan to bring on additional management to oversee an expanded staff,” he added. “As we double our organizers in Iowa and South Carolina and expand our digital team, we’re in a strong position to execute our plan and win the nomination.

Politico adds that Harris will stop paying third-party multimedia producers:

Harris is also recalibrating her digital operation as she struggles to break out of the middle of the presidential pack. While she’ll still use Authentic Campaigns for digital ad buying, other functions — including content production, email, video, graphics and other work — are moving in-house. Harris’ campaign had already brought in Shelby Cole, the top digital aide on Beto O’Rourke’s Texas Senate run, from Authentic earlier this year.

The report comes after a Harris campaign memo blamed a so-called “summer slump” for the 2020 White House hopeful’s poor polling and fundraising numbers. “August was a rough month for fundraising and we barely scraped by hitting our goal. We expected to come out of the ‘summer slump’ this month, but the first days of September have proven even more difficult for fundraising than we expected,” the memo, according to Politico.

Since her first debate performance in June — for which she made headlines for attacking former Vice President Joe Biden’s praise of segregationists — Harris experienced a steady decline in several statewide and national polls.

Kamala Harris (D-CA) raised $11.6 million for her 2020 White House campaign in the third quarter, the lawmaker’s campaign announced in a statement on Tuesday afternoon.

Harris’ latest cash haul is lower than her previous fundraises where she took in $12 million in the first quarter and $11.8 in the second quarter. According to the California Democrat’s campaign, it has $10 million in cash on hand and plans to bolster its resources on the ground in early primary states such as Iowa and South Carolina.

“This is a campaign that is growing, expanding, and built to win this primary,” campaign manager Juan Rodriguez said. “As we have spent the summer months strengthening our infrastructure, we enter this final stretch of 2019 with ample resources to execute a winning game plan. With hundreds of organizers and staff in the early states and Super Tuesday California, we are ready to harness the energy of our thousands of grassroots volunteers to phone bank, knock doors and turn out the vote for Kamala in these 2020 contests.”

Earlier Tuesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders’s (I-VT) campaign announced it raised $25.3 million, while South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg took in $19.1 million. Additionally, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) brought in $6 million after warning supporters he would be forced to drop out if his campaign didn’t raise $1.7 million by the end of the third quarter.

News of Harris’s third-quarter haul comes amid reports that her campaign is expected to undergo a shakeup of senior staff. According to Politico, Rohini Kosoglu, who serves as Harris’s chief of staff in the Senate, and senior adviser Laphonza Butler will be to be promoted to senior positions.

“We continue to grow our organization as we enter the fourth quarter, and it has always been the plan to bring on additional management to oversee an expanded staff,” Rodriguez told Politico in response to the report.

Reports of the imminent shakeup come as Harris’s campaign continues to struggle with sliding poll numbers.

Sen. Harris joined CNN’s Anderson Cooper and called for President Trump to be de-platformed.

“Frankly, when you look at what he’s been tweeting today, directed at the whistleblower, directed at so many people, I frankly, think that based on this and all we’ve seen him do before, including attacking members of Congress that frankly his Twitter account should be suspended,” Harris said.

Earlier on Monday, President Trump took to Twitter and tweeted a quote from Pastor Robert Jeffress. “If the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.” Pastor Jeffress said.

Indeed, Harris’ call to censor President Trump echoed Marvel movie director Joss Whedon, who demanded that Twitter remove President Trump from the platform in the “interests of national security.”

“Can I just add to this crucial thread that in the interests of national security he should be immediately banned from Twitter?” the Avengers director said adding the hashtag “#TakeTrumpOffTwitter.”

Kamala Harris (D-CA) cited the Twitter blacklisting of actor James Woods in her letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey on Tuesday, in which she demanded that President Donald Trump be kicked off the social media platform.

The Democratic presidential hopeful fired off a letter to Dorsey in which she inaccurately accused Trump of violating Twitter’s terms of service.

In the letter, Harris invoked Woods, a rare Hollywood conservative and Trump supporter who was blacklisted from Twitter in April. The actor claimed the platform removed a tweet he refused to take down and swore to no longer use the social media platform.

Harris alleged that Woods used Twitter “to harass and spread hateful messages,” without citing evidence of harassment. Twitter’s terms of service make no mention of “hateful” content.

The presidential candidate also invoked Martin Shkreli, the convicted hedge fund manager who is was permanently kicked off Twitter in 2017.

Harris’ demand came after Trump tweeted that he believes impeachment efforts are actually “a coup” intended to nullify the power of the American people.

“Hey @jack. Time to do something about this,” Harris tweeted in response to the president.

Many prominent media figures criticized Harris’ letter as an attempt to crush the freedom of speech protected under the First Amendment. One such figure was Nate Silver, the founder the left-leaning news site FiveThirtyEight.

“Hey, @jack. As a journalist I think Trump’s tweets are extremely newsworthy and I’m happy that you’ve given the President of the United States a platform to communicate in a direct and unfiltered way with the public,” Silver tweeted.

Prior to the letter’s emergence, Harris urged Dorsey in a tweet “to do something” about President Trump’s account after he referred to the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry as “a coup” on Twitter.

“Hey @jack. Time to do something about this,” she wrote to Dorsey in response to the president’s tweet about the Ukraine hoax.

“As I learn more and more each day, I am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP, intended to take away the Power of the People, their VOTE, their Freedoms, their Second Amendment, Religion, Military, Border Wall, and their God-given rights as a Citizen of The United States of America!” tweeted the president.

Appearing Monday on CNN, Harris attempted to argue that President Trump’s criticism of the so-called “whistleblower” and his complaint — which is based on secondhand information — could put his life in danger, and thus, banning the president from Twitter is easily justifiably

“Frankly, when you look at what [the president]’s been tweeting — directed at the whistleblower, directed at so many people — you know, I frankly think that based on this and all we’ve seen him do before, including attacking members of Congress that he frankly should be — his Twitter account should be suspended,” the California Democrat said.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has released a number of impeachment advertisements on social media, according to ABC News. Hunter Biden served on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma as his father was leading the Obama administration’s diplomatic dealings with Kiev. Trump has claimed that Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to shut down a corruption investigation of Burisma. The former vice president has denied doing anything wrong.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced last week — without the usual protocol of the House voting on an impeachment resolution — that an impeachment inquiry is underway.

Democrats claim Trump abused his power by mentioning the longstanding Joe/Hunter Biden Ukraine controversy and efforts to investigate it on a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Trump has described the call as “perfect,” and in keeping with conversations between world leaders about fighting government corruption.

Silicon Valley’s previous candidate of choice was Pete Buttigieg, but despite his popularity with liberal elites and NeverTrump neocons, the South Bend mayor failed to enthuse Democrat primary voters.

Now, progressives in tech appear to be warming to Elizabeth Warren, despite her vocal stance against companies like Facebook and Google.

Via CNBC:

This growing contingent of tech insiders looking to back Warren started to take shape in the second quarter when she raised at least $19 million. At that time, she saw two contributions from Chamath Palihapitiya, a Silicon Valley-based venture capitalist, a $2,800 donation from investor and former “Shark Tank” star Chris Sacca and a $2,500 contribution from John MacFarlane, the founder of audio company Sonos Inc. Warren has yet to announce how much she raised in the third quarter.

CNBC reports that business leaders are exhausted by political disruption, and want a period of stability — even if it means higher taxes and more regulation.

Business leaders are clamoring for clarity on policy, even more than the policies themselves, as the 2020 election gets closer, said Aquila. “What business is looking for is a period of stability and calm,” Aquila said. “It’s less a partisan issue and more about bringing economic conditions that allow businesses to focus on business instead of wondering about the political world every two minutes. Many CFOs have told me over the years, ‘I can deal with higher tax rates or lower tax rates. I just need to know what the tax rate will be.’”

Although Warren has attracted a reputation for her anti-big tech positions, she is less consistent on the matter than her populist primary opponent Tulsi Gabbard.

Whereas Gabbard has been consistent on the question of censorship, criticizing big tech companies for “throwing free speech out the window,” Warren has flip-flopped on the issue. She condemned Facebook for its power to “shut down debate” after it removed an ad for her campaign in March this year, but a few months later called for tech companies to censor criticism of Kamala Harris.

It is the “largest three-month sum a Democratic White House hopeful has posted all year,” according to the Associated Press (AP).

The campaign has stressed the importance of small, grassroots donations and reported that the $25.3 million haul came from 1.4 million individual donations, with an average donation of $18.07.

“Media elites and professional pundits have tried repeatedly to dismiss this campaign, and yet working-class Americans keep saying loudly and clearly that they want a political revolution,” Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said, according to the AP.

His report surpasses Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) second-quarter report of $19.1 million raised, all of which stemmed from grassroots donors. Her third-quarter totals have yet to be released.

Only Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) — who has remained in the second tier of Democrat candidates — released fundraising totals alongside Sanders. His campaign reported $19.1 million raised, over $5 million less than his second-quarter total.

Sanders has raised $61.5 million since the launch of his presidential bid this year and has remained in the top tier of candidates, battling Warren and Joe Biden (D) for first place.

Recent polls show Sanders challenging Biden in the early caucus state Nevada, signaling trouble for the Biden campaign:

Factories in a wide range of businesses, from clothing to machinery are suffering declines in exports.

The slowdown in manufacturing — often an early indicator of problems in the wider economy — showed up starkly in a dreadful report released on Tuesday. Factory activity contracted in September for the second straight month; by some measures it was the worst month in a decade. The bad news spooked investors and the Dow fell nearly 350 points, or 1.3%.

We have now tariffed our way into a manufacturing recession in the US and globally.""

President Donald Trump wasted little time finding someone to blame for the gloomy factory activity.

""As I predicted, Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve have allowed the Dollar to get so strong, especially relative to ALL other currencies, that our manufacturers are being negatively affected,"" Trump tweeted minutes after the report was released.

The president continued to blast his handpicked Fed chief, calling the central bank ""pathetic.""

Trump's blame-the-Fed narrative is not supported by the evidence.

The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing report did not mention Fed policy. Nor did it cite borrowing costs, Powell or the strong US dollar. None of the business executives who were quoted in the survey blamed those issues.

Many of them are complaining about something else: the US-China trade war.

""The tariffs have caused much confusion in the industry,"" one electrical equipment, appliance and components manufacturer said.

A food, beverage and tobacco products executive said: ""Chinese tariffs going up are hurting our business. Most of the materials are not made in the US and made only in China.""

Blaming the Fed is 'completely wrong'

The trade war between the world's two largest economies is slowing global trade and raising the cost of goods. That, in turn, is sapping demand for manufactured products.

The on-again, off-again nature of the trade battle is also sparking deep uncertainty. Unclear about how long tariffs will last or how high they will go, business owners have dialed back spending and overhauled supply chains. That uncertainty shock is further eroding demand for manufactured goods.

Not surprisingly, economists and market analysts similarly pinned the bulk of the blame on the trade war, and not the Fed.

""We have now tariffed our way into a manufacturing recession in the US and globally,"" Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakely Advisory Group, wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.

""What is the ultimate cause of all of this? It's the trade war,"" Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, told CNN Business. ""This whole narrative about the Fed being too slow is completely wrong. The Fed has never moved faster.""

The ISM report provides stark evidence of the trade war's fallout. Not only did manufacturing activity dip further into contraction territory in September, but it was the weakest month since June 2009, the final month of the Great Recession.

Fifteen manufacturing industries contracted in September, including apparel, leather & allied products, printing and related support activities and wood products. New export orders, a trade-sensitive component of the report, had its weakest reading since March 2009.

That's not to say there aren't legitimate gripes over China's trade policy. Business leaders have long complained about the theft of intellectual property and non-tariff trade barriers they say do real harm to American companies. But the trade war is clearly hurting the economy.

US manufacturers are also getting dinged by the global economic slowdown. Major economies including China, India, South Korea and Germany have stumbled in recent quarters. That global slowdown is being amplified by the trade war.

""It's all a vicious circle,"" said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell.

Strong dollar isn't helping. But it's not the main problem

Trump is correct to say that the dollar is strong. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar against a basket of currencies, hasn't been this high since the spring of 2017.

But while a strong dollar is great for Americans touring overseas, it makes it harder for US companies to export their goods. Everything from iPhones, tractors and cars get more expensive for foreign buyers. And then multinational companies get dinged when they convert their foreign sales back into dollars.

""The strong dollar is a headwind. But it's not the end of the world,"" said Young.

Trump argued that the Fed deserved the blame for the strong dollar because America has higher interest rates than many other major economies.

But Bank of America's Harris said it is the trade war, not the Fed, that is causing the dollar's strength. Nervous about the global economic slowdown and trade policy, investors are dumping foreign currencies in favor of the greenback.

""The Fed is the thing that has really helped cushion the blow of the trade war. They have been preventing the dollar from being even stronger,"" said Harris.

The Fed, citing the trade war and global slowdown, lowered interest rates twice this summer — the first such cuts since 2008.

Rate cuts are a blunt tool. Cheaper borrowing costs help interest-sensitive sectors, such as housing and autos. But the cost of capital is already near record lows. A discount on borrowing costs won't do much to clear up the uncertainty and supply chain havoc wreaked by the trade war.

""The only reasons anyone cares about the Fed is because we can't get a trade deal. The Fed is an insurance policy,"" said Young, of FTSE Russell. ""What Wall Street wants is an end to tariffs.""

Can households keep propping up growth?

Recent history shows that the United States can avoid a recession even when the ISM manufacturing index drops into contraction territory. That happened multiple times in the 1990s as well as in 2003, 2012, 2013 and in 2016, according to Bespoke Investment Group. That's because manufacturing only makes up a small part of the modern economy.

Consumer spending, which drives about two-thirds of the economy, remains solid because unemployment is low, confidence is strong and US stocks are trading near record highs.

The hope is that consumers will continue to prop things up, extending the longest economic expansion in American history.

And it's still possible that Washington and Beijing, fearing economic trouble, finally reach an agreement to avert another round of tariffs that would damage growth. A trade deal, especially one that rolls back existing tariffs, would boost confidence among CEOs and households.

But some ""cracks"" are starting to show in consumer spending, according to Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.

In a report to clients, she noted that hiring has slowed, personal spending decelerated in September, and consumer confidence in the availability of jobs tumbled.

The risk is that the consumer picture could darken before a trade agreement can be reached.

""If consumers' confidence seriously falters,"" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote on Tuesday, ""the US could tip into the first recession ever caused directly by the actions of the President, rather than the action of tight monetary policy on an overstretched private sector.""

Or as, Bleakley Advisory Group's Boockvar put it, ""using tariffs as the tool to push back against China was a really dumb idea and history will not look kindly upon the strategy.""

No wonder the White House is shifting the blame on the Fed."

Senator Harris is calling for Twitter to silence President Trump after he tweeted that he believes impeachment efforts are actually “a coup” meant to take away the power of the American people, as well as their vote, freedoms, Second Amendment, religion, military, border wall, and God-given rights.

“Hey @jack. Time to do something about this,” tweeted Harris to Dorsey, in an apparent call to ban President Trump from the social media platform over his remarks on Tuesday evening.

Harris was reacting to a specific tweet by President Trump that read, “As I learn more and more each day, I am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP, intended to take away the Power of the….”

In an additional tweet below, the president continued: “….People, their VOTE, their Freedoms, their Second Amendment, Religion, Military, Border Wall, and their God-given rights as a Citizen of The United States of America!”

….People, their VOTE, their Freedoms, their Second Amendment, Religion, Military, Border Wall, and their God-given rights as a Citizen of The United States of America! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2019

The senator’s Tuesday tweet doubled down on the comments she made Monday on CNN, in which the 2020 Democrat presidential primary candidate stated that President Trump should be banned from Twitter due to safety concerns.

Harris attempted to justify her argument by insisting that President Trump being free to speak unrestrained on social media could “subject someone to harm.”

“If he’s not going to exercise self-restraint,” said Harris of the president’s tweets, “then perhaps there should be other mechanisms in place to make sure that his words do not in fact harm anyone.”

Harris argues that President Trump’s criticism of the whistleblower and people like Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) — who recently performed an entirely fabricated version of the Trump-Ukraine phone call at a committee hearing — could result in harm, and that the president should therefore be silenced on Twitter.

Harris said on Monday:

Frankly, when you look at what [the president]’s been tweeting — directed at the whistleblower, directed at so many people — you know, I frankly think that based on this and all we’ve seen him do before, including attacking members of Congress that he frankly should be — his Twitter account should be suspended.

“I think there’s plenty of now evidence to suggest that he is irresponsible with his words in a way that could result in harm to other people,” she added. “And so the privilege of using those words in that way should probably be taken from him.”

Kamala Harris (D-CA) argued President Donald Trump being banned from Twitter was not a “violation of free speech” because it is a “privilege” to use that platform.

Partial transcript as follows:

HARRIS: Well, we’ll see as the impeachment process proceeds, but I will say, Jake, it is a classic case in terms of what he has been doing as it relates to the whistleblower, in an attempt to suppress evidence and intimidate a witness, which is why I’ve also called on Donald Trump’s Twitter privileges to be revoked, because he has even as many other members of Congress have indicated, he seems to be eliciting fear and threatening a witness to what could be a crime against America, our democracy and try to suppress that evidence. That is a classic example of a crime.

TAPPER: I guess the question about— I know you wrote to Twitter and the CEO, Jack Dorsey, and asked him to take away the president’s Twitter handle, his account. How is that not a violation of free speech? I mean, the president has the same rights that you have, that I have. How would that not be a slippery slope where they have to ban half the people on Twitter?

HARRIS: I’ve heard that argument, but here is the thing, Jake. First of all, a corporation, which is what Twitter is, has obligations. In this case, Twitter has terms of use policy. And their terms of use dictate who receives the privilege of speaking on that platform and who does not. And Donald Trump has clearly violated the terms of use. There should be a consequence for that. Not to mention he has used his platform, president of the United States, in a way that’s been about inciting fear and potentially inciting harm against a witness to what might be a crime against our country and our democracy. And for that reason, I do believe that it’s clear that he has violated the terms of use. And I’m asking that Twitter does what it has done in previous locations, which is to revoke someone’s privilege because they’ve not lived up to the advantages of the privilege."

""President Trump also published the following tweet suggesting that violence could be incited should Congress issue formal articles of impeachment against him,"" she wrote, highlighting a tweet Trump sent on Sunday that read: ""....If the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.""

(CNN) As a career prosecutor and former attorney general of California, I saw firsthand how counterproductive marijuana laws exacerbated the problem of mass incarceration in my state and in our country -- leading to the disproportionate criminalization of black and brown people in particular.

The fact is, marijuana laws have not been enforced in the same way for all people. Data show that a person of color is much more likely than a white person to be arrested for marijuana possession, despite evidence that Americans use marijuana at nearly the same rate, regardless of race.

As public opinion of marijuana shifts toward legalization , it's time we do the smart thing -- the right thing -- and ensure any marijuana reform legislation we put on the table adequately addresses the harm caused by the failed drug policies of the past.

To protect states like California that have legalized or decriminalized marijuana in recent years, we must act at the federal level to ensure that the US Department of Justice does not encroach to enforce laws that voters and elected officials in those states have decided are unjust and unfair. Additionally, we have to make sure that widespread reform is felt by the communities most harmed by the so-called war on drugs.

Last week, the House of Representatives passed the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act. While its passage is a promising step forward in allowing legal marijuana businesses to access basic banking services -- it is not enough. That is why I am proposing we do more than simply remove barriers to financial services. We should get smart on marijuana reform.

JUST WATCHED Why cannabis stocks are soaring Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Why cannabis stocks are soaring 03:10

First, the bill acknowledges that legalization is only one part of the solution. In addition to legalizing marijuana at the federal level by removing it from the Controlled Substances Act , our bill goes further to add measures to correct the historical injustices of failed drug policies that have disproportionately impacted communities of color and low-income communities.

Second, in keeping with our belief that times have changed and marijuana should not rise to a criminal offense, we must make sure individuals with criminal records that stem from marijuana-related offenses are able to get on with their lives. Too often, people are barred from jobs, educational opportunities and housing due to their marijuana record. That is why this bill requires federal courts to conduct resentencing hearings and expunge nonviolent marijuana-related convictions. It would also protect Americans from being denied federal benefits based on their use or possession of marijuana or prior conviction for a marijuana offense.

Third, my proposal would deliver economic justice to affected communities. The marijuana business is one of the fastest growing money-making industries in today's economy, and individuals and communities disproportionately criminalized by the enforcement of marijuana laws should be first in line to benefit from today's legal marijuana industry. Our bill would authorize a 5% sales tax on marijuana and marijuana products to create new grant programs specifically designed to support businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals entering the legal marijuana industry. It would also provide funding for programs to help minimize barriers to marijuana licensing and employment.

We must ensure that as marijuana becomes a bigger business, we are committing ourselves to rebuilding communities that have been disproportionately targeted by failed drug policies and creating a diverse industry going forward. If we fail to address a system that has historically been infected by racial bias, communities of color will continue to shoulder the devastating impacts of the past.

Times have changed. We must get smart on marijuana reform and give everyone the opportunity to reap the benefits that come from the legal marijuana industry."

As the state's March 5 primary draws closer, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (23%), former Vice President Joe Biden (22%) and Sen.

Harris tumbled from 19% in July to 8% in the new poll by the institute, failing to sustain the momentum she sparked with her first debate performance in June. She lost significant ground over the summer, while her chief rivals all solidified their standing among California voters.

In the July poll, Warren was at 15%, Sanders was at 12% and Biden was at 11% -- all trailing Harris, who got both a fundraising and a polling bounce after she delivered a fiery performance in the first debate in Miami by questioning the former vice president's past opposition to busing for the purpose of desegregating schools.

While it is often said that California tends to reflect the national state of play of the presidential race -- because it is so expensive to wage an intensive campaign in this vast and diverse state -- the new Public Policy Institute of California poll underscores that Harris does not seem to be drawing any advantage from the fact that she served as the state's attorney general and continues to serve constituents as the state's junior US senator.

New Hampshire Institute of Politics Executive Director Neil Levesque highlighted the sense of “fluidity” in the race, due to the fact that “65% of Warren supporters, 72% of Biden supporters, 56% of Sanders supporters, and 73% of Buttigieg voters indicate that they expect that their choice could change between now and the primary election.”

Levesque added:

Among voters who are not firm in their choice, Warren is the 2nd choice of 26%, well ahead of Biden with 12%, Buttigieg with 11%, Sanders with 7% and Harris with 7%. This suggests that when the field begins to winnow down, Warren may in the best position to pick up other candidates’ support. However, if this turns into a two-person race, the nomination may ultimately turn on what sort of candidate Democrats want to send against Donald Trump: one that they believe would make the best president, or one that they believe has the best chance of beating him. If the former, Warren has a clear 27% to 19% advantage over Biden on the question of whom respondents think would make the best President. However, Biden is seen as the strongest nominee against Trump by 37% of voters compared to Warren with 26%. As in our April poll, Warren leads Biden among ‘extremely interested’ and ‘very liberal’ voters, at 28% – 24% and 35% – 11% respectively.

The poll spells trouble for Sanders, who has been slipping in New Hampshire, as recent polls indicate.

Bernie Sanders and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

The former vice president discussed his fundraising haul during a fundraiser in Palo Alto, California, on Thursday, telling donors, ""We raised, this last quarter, $15 million -- in the middle of summer.""

Biden was bested in the money race last quarter by Sanders, who reported raising $25 million, and Buttigieg, who raked in $19 million.

But Biden's July to September fundraising haul is higher than the $11.6 million raised by California Sen. Kamala Harris, the $10 million raised by businessman Andrew Yang, and the $6 million brought in by New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. Author Marianne Williamson raised $3 million and Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet raised $2.1 million last quarter.

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has started to rise in recent polling as a clear front-runner alongside Biden, has yet to release her fundraising total.

Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden lead the crowded Democratic primary field, with 28% and 25% support each from likely Democratic voters, according to a Monmouth University national poll out Wednesday.

Warren and Biden are followed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders with 15%, California Sen. Kamala Harris and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 5% each, and businessman Andrew Yang and author Marianne Williamson with 2%. No one else received over 1% in the poll.

Patrick Murray, Monmouth University's polling director, acknowledged that their August poll -- which found Warren, Sanders, and Biden in a three-way tie -- was an outlier compared with other polling conducted around the same time. But the new Monmouth poll confirms other recent polling suggesting a far tighter race for the Democratic nomination.

It, along with a late-September Quinnipiac University poll , is the second recent national poll to show Warren and Biden topping the field and within the margin of error of each other, and the third to show Warren in the mid- to upper-20s in support.

While eight in 10 registered Republicans and Republican-leaning independent voters say Donald Trump ought to be re-elected President in 2020, 15% said someone else should be in office.

Bernie Sanders on his right and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to his left, for the next presidential debate, which will also feature a new face and a returning candidate among the dozen Democrats onstage vying for their party's nomination.

The stakes are incredibly high for the candidates participating in the CNN/New York Times Democratic presidential debate on October 15, as several candidates will likely need a breakout performance to remain competitive in this crowded primary field. For businessman Tom Steyer , it will be his first presidential debate, while Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard returns to the stage after failing to qualify for the September debate.

In all, 12 Democratic hopefuls will appear on the same stage for the debate: Biden, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, Gabbard, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, Sanders, Steyer, Warren and businessman Andrew Yang.

The Democratic National Committee's fourth sanctioned primary debate will air live at 8 p.m. ET from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, a northeast suburb of the state capital, Columbus. CNN anchors Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper and New York Times national editor Marc Lacey will serve as the debate moderators.

The 12 campaigns were required to submit paperwork to the DNC Wednesday morning certifying that their respective candidate achieved the fundraising and polling thresholds required to participate in the October debate. To receive an invitation to this debate, candidates needed to attain at least 2% in four separate DNC-approved polls and receive contributions from at least 130,000 unique donors, including at least 400 donors from 20 different states.

Yang's fundraising, powered by a devout grassroots donor base known as the Yang Gang , has turned the once longshot candidate into a fixture on the debate stage who is now polling better than most of his Democratic competitors.

Yang's haul is substantially lower than the $25 million that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders raised or the $19 million South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg announced on Tuesday. But it does land Yang close to the $11.6 million that California Sen. Kamala Harris raised in the third quarter and markedly higher than candidates like New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who announced on Tuesday he had raised $6 million in the third quarter.

The third quarter of an off year is often one of the most difficult to raise money, so Yang more than tripling his second quarter haul demonstrates an ability to turn fervent online support into dollars.

Yang enters the final three months of 2019 with $6.3 million in the bank, his campaign said. His average campaign contribution is $30.18 and he has received donations from nearly 300,000 unique donors. Ninety-nine percent of Yang's donations were under $200, they added.

And now, intrepid travelers be able to get inside the control room where the world's worst nuclear accident unfolded, Chernobyl tour companies confirmed to CNN.

Those who venture inside the highly radioactive area at the infamous Reactor 4 will be provided with white protective suits, helmets and masks for the brief visits. After leaving, they will be subject to two radiology tests to measure exposure.

The move is part of a government drive to encourage tourism in the area after President Volydymyr Zelensky signed a July decree designating Chernobyl an official tourist attraction.

""We must give this territory of Ukraine a new life,"" Zelensky said at the time. ""Until now, Chernobyl was a negative part of Ukraine's brand. It's time to change it.""

l e v a r t

The makeover will involve developing new tourist routes including waterways, building new checkpoints and restoring and upgrading existing ones.

Zelensky made the announcement at the inauguration of a new metal dome at Chernobyl which will encase the destroyed reactor in order to prevent radioactive material from leaking out.

Weighing in at 36,000 tonnes and measuring 108-metre high, the 1.5 billion euro ($1.7 billion) structure was paid for via a special fund launched by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and sponsored by 45 countries, AFP reported.

The structure is strong enough to withstand a tornado and is built to last a century, the EBRD said.

Chernobyl once sat at the centre of a 1,000-square-mile exclusion zone implemented after the 1986 catastrophe, but much of the area has been open to tourists since 2011.

The former Texas congressman and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate characterized Buttigieg's position as driven by political calculation.

""I was really offended by those comments,"" O'Rourke told reporters after a gun control policy forum in Las Vegas on Wednesday. ""And I think he represents a kind of politics that is focused on poll-testing and focus-group-driving and triangulating and listening to consultants, before you arrive at a position.""

O'Rourke's comments came after Buttigieg took an implicit swipe at O'Rourke -- as well as New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who was the first 2020 presidential candidate to support mandatory buy-backs -- on Wednesday.

He called mandatory buy-backs ""a shiny object makes it harder for us to focus"" on reforms that are more politically viable in Washington, where any new gun control measures would require Republican support given the GOP's Senate majority.

""As a policy, it's had mixed results,"" Buttigieg said. ""It's a healthy debate to have, but we've got to do something now.""

Mandatory buybacks are a dividing issue for the 2020 Democratic field at large. But O'Rourke's direct and personal rebuke of Buttigieg forced into the open a tension that has brewed for months between the two camps and their supporters. The two entered the race in the same lane: Both as generation-change candidates with viral appeal, both vying to be seen as alternatives to former Vice President Joe Biden.

O'Rourke's allies have been bitter about Buttigieg since early April, when he said in New Hampshire -- in a clear poke at O'Rourke -- that ""I hear the way you ingratiate yourself to voters is to stand on things.""

Both have lost altitude in recent months, though Buttigieg has remained a much stronger fundraiser and is ahead of O'Rourke in nearly all polls.

But the divide over mandatory buy-backs has offered the clearest view yet of their diverging approaches to politics -- with Buttigieg seeking to show he is able to stake out a sober middle ground and could function effectively in Washington, and O'Rourke relying on more emotional appeals to those wishing to shake up the political system.

Ongoing clash

Buttigieg often uses the term ""shiny object"" to describe something he views as a distraction. Shortly after his appearance at Wednesday's forum, Buttigieg was asked whether he would allow his hypothetical vice president's son or daughter to serve on a foreign board.

He responded by saying Trump is trying to ""change the subject"" away from his ""abuse of power.""

""Let's deal with that and not get caught in the shiny objects he's going to throw out,"" Buttigieg said.

But the mayor calling O'Rourke's signature gun proposal a ""shiny object"" set off the Texas Democrat and his campaign.

The two had already clashed in September , when Buttigieg said O'Rourke's push for mandatory buy-backs -- which he has called for in the wake of a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, Texas -- played into the hands of Republicans looking for reasons to back away from gun control measures at a time when Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell were ""at least pretending to be open to reforms.""

But the Las Vegas forum marked a clear escalation from O'Rourke.

After pointing to Buttigieg's comments, O'Rourke asked, ""How in the world can you say that to March For Our Lives,"" referring to the student-led group founded in the wake of last year's school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that co-hosted Wednesday's forum.

""How can you say that to survivors of mass shootings across this country? How can you say that to the majority of Hispanics in America, certainly in Texas, who fear that they will be the victims of a mass shooting inspired by racism, hatred, that's been welcomed into the open by this president, and has been armed with weapons of war?"" he said.

O'Rourke lashed out again in a text message conversation with BuzzFeed , saying that Buttigieg's comment was ""offensive to anyone who has been shot by one of these weapons or who fears being shot or has lost someone to an AR-15 or AK-47.""

For his part, Buttigieg on Wednesday laid out a more modest set of proposals broadly backed by the field of Democratic 2020 presidential contenders: closing loopholes that allow some guns to be sold without background checks; allowing states to adopt ""red flag"" laws that allow families or police to ask a judge to have a potentially dangerous person's guns taken away; and banning the sale of additional assault-style rifles.

""We can get background checks done now. We can get red flag laws done now. We can get something done about the new sale of assault weapons now. We cannot wait for these other debates to play out -- even if they're healthy debates -- to get that action done because lives are on the line,"" Buttigieg said.

Vying for the top tier

In the Democratic primary field, Booker was the first to call for mandatory buy-backs. O'Rourke announced his support in early August -- after the El Paso shooting -- and California Sen. Kamala Harris called it a ""good idea"" in early September.

However, Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden have opposed mandatory buy-backs. Biden instead this week proposed that owners of assault-style rifles be required to participate in an optional buy-back or register them with the government under the same law that strictly regulated machine guns in the wake of the gangland shootings of the early 1920s and '30s.

But what's striking about the O'Rourke-Buttigieg clash is that both are coming from a similar starting point: They are vying to vault into the top tier of a Democratic presidential race currently being dominated by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Buttigieg has positioned himself as a generational-change candidate with Midwest roots -- but also as a more moderate alternative to the party's most progressive candidates.

O'Rourke had offered similar appeal, with a Sun Belt bent. But his campaign changed direction in the wake of the El Paso shooting.

Previously O'Rourke had opposed mandatory buy-backs, saying as a Senate candidate in 2018 that he would not support taking away Americans' guns.

""To be clear, they should have them. If you purchased that AR-15, you own it, keep it. Continue to use it responsibly,"" O'Rourke said during that race.

But he said the shooting in his hometown had changed him.

""I know that this is not politically easy. It's frankly why far too few people have proposed it; it's frankly why I have not proposed it in the past,"" O'Rourke told CNN in El Paso in August, explaining his reversal. ""I've said, 'This is something we should consider, I want to think about it, I want to talk to people about it.' I've thought about it. I've talked to people. ... And now, beyond a shadow of a doubt, regardless of what it does to our prospects going forward, you've got to speak the truth and be clear about where the solutions are.""

He made headlines in the September Democratic presidential debate when he said that ""hell yes,"" he would take AR-15s and AK-47s away from their owners.

That drew a rebuke from Booker, who already supported mandatory buy-backs -- as well as a national gun licensing program. Booker again criticized O'Rourke on Wednesday in Las Vegas.

""He saw the horrors visiting his community,"" Booker said of O'Rourke's reversal on the issue. ""Are we going to have to wait until hell's lottery comes to your community? No, we are a better country.""

O'Rourke responded on stage that he wanted to give Booker ""all the credit in the world for being a leader on this.""

""So Cory's deal is, you know, he's trying to determine who got to which policy position first,"" O'Rourke told reporters afterward. ""My response to that is, we're both in the right place on this and so let's work together."""

The law allowing teachers to be armed took effect on Monday, October 1, 2019. The next day Harris tweeted, “We need more books and pencils in our classrooms — not guns. Period.”

The findings are among the first to offer insight into what might have sickened more than 800 people in recent months who vaped . At least 17 people nationwide have died from vaping-related illnesses. The cause is unclear, although several federal and state agencies are investigating.

Researchers from the Mayo Clinic found the lung damage was similar to a chemical burn. ""It seems to be some kind of direct chemical injury, similar to what one might see with exposures to toxic chemical fumes, poisonous gases and toxic agents,"" Dr. Brandon Larsen, a surgical pathologist at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona, said in a hospital press release.

The researchers looked at samples of lung tissue from 17 people, all of whom had vaped and 70% had used marijuana or cannabis oils. Two of the samples were taken from patients who died, according to the Mayo Clinic.

The accumulation of fatty substances such as oils were suspected in the lung damage, but researchers said there was no evidence they were the cause.

The Democratic presidential hopeful fired off a letter to Dorsey in which she inaccurately accused Trump of violating Twitter’s terms of service.

In the letter, Harris invoked Woods, a rare Hollywood conservative and Trump supporter who was blacklisted from Twitter in April. The actor claimed the platform removed a tweet he refused to take down and swore to no longer use the social media platform.

Harris alleged that Woods used Twitter “to harass and spread hateful messages,” without citing evidence of harassment. Twitter’s terms of service make no mention of “hateful” content.

The presidential candidate also invoked Martin Shkreli, the convicted hedge fund manager who is was permanently kicked off Twitter in 2017.

Harris’ demand came after Trump tweeted that he believes impeachment efforts are actually “a coup” intended to nullify the power of the American people.

“Hey @jack. Time to do something about this,” Harris tweeted in response to the president.

Many prominent media figures criticized Harris’ letter as an attempt to crush the freedom of speech protected under the First Amendment. One such figure was Nate Silver, the founder the left-leaning news site FiveThirtyEight.

“Hey, @jack. As a journalist I think Trump’s tweets are extremely newsworthy and I’m happy that you’ve given the President of the United States a platform to communicate in a direct and unfiltered way with the public,” Silver tweeted.

Prior to the letter’s emergence, Harris urged Dorsey in a tweet “to do something” about President Trump’s account after he referred to the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry as “a coup” on Twitter.

“Hey @jack. Time to do something about this,” she wrote to Dorsey in response to the president’s tweet about the Ukraine hoax.

“As I learn more and more each day, I am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP, intended to take away the Power of the People, their VOTE, their Freedoms, their Second Amendment, Religion, Military, Border Wall, and their God-given rights as a Citizen of The United States of America!” tweeted the president.

Appearing Monday on CNN, Harris attempted to argue that President Trump’s criticism of the so-called “whistleblower” and his complaint — which is based on secondhand information — could put his life in danger, and thus, banning the president from Twitter is easily justifiably

“Frankly, when you look at what [the president]’s been tweeting — directed at the whistleblower, directed at so many people — you know, I frankly think that based on this and all we’ve seen him do before, including attacking members of Congress that he frankly should be — his Twitter account should be suspended,” the California Democrat said.

“I think there’s plenty of now evidence to suggest that he is irresponsible with his words in a way that could result in harm to other people,” she added. “And so the privilege of using those words in that way should probably be taken from him,” she concluded."

The 78-year-old presidential candidate underwent an emergency heart procedure after experiencing chest discomfort at a campaign event on Tuesday evening. A medical evaluation determined that he had a blockage in an artery, and two stents were “successfully inserted,” according to Sanders’ Senior Advisor Jeff Weaver. Weaver added that Sanders’ campaign events and appearances would be canceled until further notice.

Several 2020 candidates, including President Trump’s campaign, sent words of encouragement the Vermont senator’s way.

“It’s so obscene, the part that money plays on our political system,” the new age author said. “Most of us live in a universe where $3 million is like a big deal. In presidential fundraising, it’s like she just squeaked by.”

“But 3 million dollars definitely says there are a lot of people out there saying you still and you keep going, and I appreciate that so much,” she added.

Though Williamson’s fundraising numbers rose substantially this quarter, the long-shot candidate has failed to secure a spot for the September and October Democrat presidential primary debates.

Williamson’s announcement comes after several 2020 candidates released their third-quarter fundraising numbers this week. Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) campaign on Tuesday announced it raised $25.3 million, while South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg took in $19.1 million. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), whose campaign has sagged in the polls in recent months, raised $11.6 million. Technology entrepreneur Andrew Yang took in $10 million and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) raised $6 million."

Now, progressives in tech appear to be warming to Elizabeth Warren, despite her vocal stance against companies like Facebook and Google.

Via CNBC:

This growing contingent of tech insiders looking to back Warren started to take shape in the second quarter when she raised at least $19 million. At that time, she saw two contributions from Chamath Palihapitiya, a Silicon Valley-based venture capitalist, a $2,800 donation from investor and former “Shark Tank” star Chris Sacca and a $2,500 contribution from John MacFarlane, the founder of audio company Sonos Inc. Warren has yet to announce how much she raised in the third quarter.

CNBC reports that business leaders are exhausted by political disruption, and want a period of stability — even if it means higher taxes and more regulation.

Business leaders are clamoring for clarity on policy, even more than the policies themselves, as the 2020 election gets closer, said Aquila. “What business is looking for is a period of stability and calm,” Aquila said. “It’s less a partisan issue and more about bringing economic conditions that allow businesses to focus on business instead of wondering about the political world every two minutes. Many CFOs have told me over the years, ‘I can deal with higher tax rates or lower tax rates. I just need to know what the tax rate will be.’”

Although Warren has attracted a reputation for her anti-big tech positions, she is less consistent on the matter than her populist primary opponent Tulsi Gabbard.

Whereas Gabbard has been consistent on the question of censorship, criticizing big tech companies for “throwing free speech out the window,” Warren has flip-flopped on the issue. She condemned Facebook for its power to “shut down debate” after it removed an ad for her campaign in March this year, but a few months later called for tech companies to censor criticism of Kamala Harris.

(CNN) Twitter's handling of President Donald Trump's account makes no sense.

Kara Alaimo

Twitter has removed a video meme posted by President Donald Trump on Wednesday of an edited music clip by the band Nickelback after receiving a copyright infringement complaint from Warner Music, Inc. At the same time, Twitter has chosen not to delete a tweet by President Donald Trump on Sunday quoting a pastor who claimed that if the President is impeached, there will be a civil war.

The Department of Homeland Security recently affirmed the urgent threat of white supremacy in the United States, and as my fellow CNN Opinion contributor Nicole Hemmer has argued , the President's past tweets have helped spur domestic terrorism fueled by white power, and this one could result in actual violence, as well. So here's where we are now: Twitter will allow the President to invoke civil war, but harming Nickelback's rights to their own music is a step too far.

President Trump's actions on and off social media have long been and will continue to be a subject of consternation and debate for many. But aside from that, there is clearly something very, very wrong with Twitter's standards. The platform's decisions this week suggest that the company is ultimately focused only on its own concerns rather than on the larger welfare of society. Twitter will step in and take action when it fears that it could face a lawsuit itself, as in the case of Nickelback. But when others potentially stand to face threats of hate or bodily harm as a result of a presidential tweet, Twitter isn't willing to do the same thing.

The company likely (justifiably) fears facing the wrath of the President, who has accused Twitter of discriminating against conservatives in the past, if it deletes tweets. CNN has reported that the White House has even drafted an executive order which would have the Federal Communications Commission determine whether social media platforms can remove particular content. The draft would allow the Federal Trade Commission to sue companies like Twitter if they don't comply with government policy. While Twitter is right to be worried about the prospect of such a chilling development, that isn't an excuse to allow the President to post content that could put Americans in physical danger."

Kamala Harris (D-CA) argued President Donald Trump being banned from Twitter was not a “violation of free speech” because it is a “privilege” to use that platform.

Partial transcript as follows:

HARRIS: Well, we’ll see as the impeachment process proceeds, but I will say, Jake, it is a classic case in terms of what he has been doing as it relates to the whistleblower, in an attempt to suppress evidence and intimidate a witness, which is why I’ve also called on Donald Trump’s Twitter privileges to be revoked, because he has even as many other members of Congress have indicated, he seems to be eliciting fear and threatening a witness to what could be a crime against America, our democracy and try to suppress that evidence. That is a classic example of a crime.

TAPPER: I guess the question about— I know you wrote to Twitter and the CEO, Jack Dorsey, and asked him to take away the president’s Twitter handle, his account. How is that not a violation of free speech? I mean, the president has the same rights that you have, that I have. How would that not be a slippery slope where they have to ban half the people on Twitter?

HARRIS: I’ve heard that argument, but here is the thing, Jake. First of all, a corporation, which is what Twitter is, has obligations. In this case, Twitter has terms of use policy. And their terms of use dictate who receives the privilege of speaking on that platform and who does not. And Donald Trump has clearly violated the terms of use. There should be a consequence for that. Not to mention he has used his platform, president of the United States, in a way that’s been about inciting fear and potentially inciting harm against a witness to what might be a crime against our country and our democracy. And for that reason, I do believe that it’s clear that he has violated the terms of use. And I’m asking that Twitter does what it has done in previous locations, which is to revoke someone’s privilege because they’ve not lived up to the advantages of the privilege."

""I'm calling on the White House to actually release whatever transcripts, whatever recordings, whatever notes there are about Donald Trump's previous conversations with Xi, because we need to know what he has now said in private conversations,"" Harris told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""The Lead.""

""Clearly he doesn't get it,"" Harris said of Trump. The senator said the President ""should not be in the business of working with foreign leaders against our democracy. It is a violation of the oath.""

Harris's comments came hours after Trump said he wants both Ukraine and China to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden in Ukraine. There's also no evidence that the former vice president received any money from China and a lawyer for Hunter Biden pushed back on this characterization calling it ""a gross misrepresentation.""

Also on Thursday, Harris, whose campaign has been unable to sustain the momentum Harris sparked with her first debate performance in June, brushed off the results of a new poll that saw her slide from a front-runner position in her home state to single digits in a survey of likely voters in California. ""The only poll that matters is on election night,"" Harris said.

Kamala Harris in the 2020 presidential race, the California Democrat has slid from an enviable front-runner position in her home state into the single digits in a new poll of likely voters in the Golden State.

As the state's March 5 primary draws closer, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (23%), former Vice President Joe Biden (22%) and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont (21%) are now tied as the leaders in the field among likely voters who are either registered as Democrats or identify as Democratic-leaning independents in the new Public Policy Institute of California poll, which was conducted in mid- to late September after Harris' uneven performance in the last debate.

Harris tumbled from 19% in July to 8% in the new poll by the institute, failing to sustain the momentum she sparked with her first debate performance in June. She lost significant ground over the summer, while her chief rivals all solidified their standing among California voters.

In the July poll, Warren was at 15%, Sanders was at 12% and Biden was at 11% -- all trailing Harris, who got both a fundraising and a polling bounce after she delivered a fiery performance in the first debate in Miami by questioning the former vice president's past opposition to busing for the purpose of desegregating schools.

While it is often said that California tends to reflect the national state of play of the presidential race -- because it is so expensive to wage an intensive campaign in this vast and diverse state -- the new Public Policy Institute of California poll underscores that Harris does not seem to be drawing any advantage from the fact that she served as the state's attorney general and continues to serve constituents as the state's junior US senator.

The Trump campaign and RNC took in $13 million in the three days following the announcement of the partisan-driven impeachment inquiry. That is “significantly more than most of the Democrat presidential candidates are able to raise in a whole quarter,” Parscale noted in an op-ed.

While Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) reported a beefy $25.3 million in the third quarter, Sen. Elizabeth Warren raised $24.6 million, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) reported $19.1 million, several candidates saw numbers relatively the same – or lower – than the Trump campaign and RNC’s three-day spike:

Joe Biden: $15.2 million

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA): $11.6 million

Andrew Yang (D): $10 million

Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ): $6 million

“The sudden flood of donations to President Trump’s reelection effort provides undeniable evidence that this impeachment gambit represents a massive miscalculation,” Parscale noted, arguing that the impeachment effort is “already coming apart at the seams.”

Parscale said Democrats are using the impeachment effort as a mass distraction, albeit one that is backfiring. He predicts it could pose an issue for vulnerable Democrats in swing districts and result in “serious losses” for Democrats, who desperately want to maintain a majority in the House.

He wrote:

If this week’s GOP fundraising haul is any indication, Pelosi didn’t just drive another nail into the coffin awaiting the Democrats’ nominee next year, she may also be looking at serious losses in the swing House districts that handed her the speaker’s gavel in 2018. The moderate Democrats in those seats are already being put on the spot by the impeachment push. Their Republican challengers are poised to hold them accountable back in their home districts, hoping to ensure that those freshman legislators find themselves out of office next year. The true toll of the Democrats’ decision to proceed with this Ukraine farce, of course, is the damage it is already inflicting on our government institutions. The American people won’t look kindly on their politicization of a process that exists as a last resort in a genuine crisis — which this clearly is not.

“We know that this charade won’t result in Donald Trump leaving office, but it may well result in many Democrats leaving theirs,” Parscale concluded.

It boasted about the nearly $200 million it had been spending annually on health care services for detainees, saying that ""comprehensive medical care is provided from the moment detainees arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay.""

What the press release didn't say was that Samimi's death followed a series of lapses in his medical care -- the sort of breakdowns that have been repeatedly identified in government investigations into the care provided at immigrant detention centers in recent years.

Samimi, an Iranian man who was being held by ICE in Aurora, Colorado, had been complaining of vomiting and pain for weeks leading up to his death in 2017, according to ICE's investigation into his treatment. He had told medical staff upon his arrival that he had been taking methadone, a painkiller commonly used to treat opioid addiction, since hurting his back in a car accident. He said he was starting to feel symptoms of withdrawal, yet nurses told investigators they didn't have training in opioid withdrawal.

ICE's report, which involved an outside analysis of his treatment and like other death reviews did not directly connect the medical failures to the death, also found that the facility had been without a director of nursing and another medical provider for more than six months. Around a week before Samimi died, he was found unconscious on the floor of his cell but wasn't sent to the hospital. And on the day he died, a nurse tried calling the doctor multiple times for help after the inmate appeared to have suffered a seizure, but the doctor didn't answer or return any of those calls.

What should we investigate next? Email Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken

Investigations into deaths including Samimi's, as well as critical government audits, have raised troubling questions about the quality of medical care at facilities used to hold immigrants. One of the main private contractors providing health care in these facilities, which employed the doctor in the detention center where Samimi was held, is a massive company known as Wellpath, formerly Correct Care Solutions.

This company was the focus of a recent CNN investigation that exposed how it has provided substandard care that has led to deaths and other serious outcomes that could have been avoided. Through records and interviews with current and former employees, CNN showed how the company has relied on inexperienced workers, offered minimal training and understaffed facilities -- and how its employees have failed to get inmates the emergency care they needed.

Wellpath also works in some of the country's largest detention facilities, where ICE locks up thousands of immigrants -- many of whom have been apprehended for entering the country illegally.

In addition to at least five death reviews conducted by ICE that specifically cite issues with the contractor's treatment of immigrant detainees, a recent class action lawsuit spotlighted the company's problematic record -- calling the decision to hire medical contractors such as Wellpath ""disturbing."" In the suit, more than a dozen current detainees at a variety of detention centers accuse ICE of violating the US Constitution by denying them adequate medical care and failing to provide stronger oversight.

ICE did not comment on Wellpath, but in response to the lawsuit an official said that ""all ICE detainees, regardless of location, can expect timely and appropriate responses to emergent medical requests, and timely medical care appropriate to the anticipated length of detention.""

Wellpath did not comment on the lawsuit or government findings about specific detainees and facilities, but said in a statement that it is confident its ""team made the best possible care decisions with the information that was available to them.""

""Our compassionate team of doctors, nurses and health care providers work with our partners to deliver high quality health care in a clinical environment where security is the highest priority,"" the company said.

Private contractor GEO Group operates a number of the immigrant detention centers where Wellpath provides medical care, and it employed the nurses and other medical staff at the facility where Samimi died. The company declined to comment.

One of the class-action plaintiffs, Martín Muñoz, has Type 2 diabetes and has been detained at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California -- where Wellpath is the medical provider -- for more than two years. He alleges in the suit he was given more than triple his regular dose of insulin, resulting in an overdose. He says he wasn't seen by a doctor after the overdose, and that there have been multiple occasions where he hasn't been given his insulin or blood pressure medication.

The lawsuit states he went without insulin for six days in February and 10 days this summer, without blood pressure medication for two weeks in the spring and without cholesterol medication for a week in July. Muñoz, who has lived in the United States for more than 40 years, most recently worked as a handyman and has four children who are US citizens.

Another current detainee at the Adelanto facility alleges he lost vision in one eye when a recommended surgery wasn't provided, while a man held at California's Mesa Verde immigrant detention center -- where Wellpath is also the medical provider -- claims in the lawsuit that he has received no treatment for a severe parasite in his brain.

At least 27 people have died while being held in ICE custody since 2017, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, one of several advocacy organizations involved with the suit. An ICE official said in a statement that ""statistically, fatalities in ICE custody occur approximately 100 times less often (than) they do in both federal and state custody nationwide.""

Lawmakers who have previously criticized the conditions and medical care at ICE facilities have also expressed serious concerns to CNN about Wellpath.

""The reports of widespread and sometimes deadly deficiencies in the medical care provided by Correct Care Solutions ... are deeply troubling,"" said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-California, in a statement provided to CNN. ""The United States government has a moral obligation to respect the dignity of every individual in its care, and that mission is severely compromised when government agencies transfer responsibility to private corporations incentivized to cut costs and turn profits.""

In December 2018, Harris and a group of other California lawmakers wrote a letter to ICE , condemning the agency for the ""egregious violations"" identified during an inspection of the Adelanto detention center.

In its 2018 report, a Department of Homeland Security watchdog said it had found that detainees did not ""have timely access to proper medical care"" and that doctors were indicating they had seen patients they didn't actually visit. ICE said at the time that it takes the findings seriously and would be conducting a review to ensure standards are now being met.

""We must ensure that migrants in our custody are treated with the care and respect they deserve,"" Rep. Scott Peters, D-California, told CNN. ""Wellpath must be appropriately investigated, and should not be awarded any contracts until such an investigation has been completed.""

Colorado Rep. Jason Crow said he has similar concerns about the medical care at the immigrant detention center in his district, the Aurora facility where Samimi died.

The ACLU of Colorado recently released a report condemning Samimi's medical care, saying that the doctor ""made the medically unjustifiable decision to cut him off from his prescribed methadone."" Samimi had even called a friend and told him he was ""sicker than hell"" and ""dying here,"" according to the death review obtained by the organization and Rocky Mountain PBS

The ACLU is currently suing ICE in an attempt to get more records about what happened.

""ICE arrested a man who had lived in the US for over four decades, and 15 days later he died in ICE's care,"" the ACLU said in a statement about Samimi's death. ""The public deserves to know more.""

And now, intrepid travelers be able to get inside the control room where the world's worst nuclear accident unfolded, Chernobyl tour companies confirmed to CNN.

Those who venture inside the highly radioactive area at the infamous Reactor 4 will be provided with white protective suits, helmets and masks for the brief visits. After leaving, they will be subject to two radiology tests to measure exposure.

The move is part of a government drive to encourage tourism in the area after President Volydymyr Zelensky signed a July decree designating Chernobyl an official tourist attraction.

""We must give this territory of Ukraine a new life,"" Zelensky said at the time. ""Until now, Chernobyl was a negative part of Ukraine's brand. It's time to change it.""

l e v a r t

The makeover will involve developing new tourist routes including waterways, building new checkpoints and restoring and upgrading existing ones.

Zelensky made the announcement at the inauguration of a new metal dome at Chernobyl which will encase the destroyed reactor in order to prevent radioactive material from leaking out.

Weighing in at 36,000 tonnes and measuring 108-metre high, the 1.5 billion euro ($1.7 billion) structure was paid for via a special fund launched by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and sponsored by 45 countries, AFP reported.

The structure is strong enough to withstand a tornado and is built to last a century, the EBRD said.

Chernobyl once sat at the centre of a 1,000-square-mile exclusion zone implemented after the 1986 catastrophe, but much of the area has been open to tourists since 2011.

The former Texas congressman and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate characterized Buttigieg's position as driven by political calculation.

""I was really offended by those comments,"" O'Rourke told reporters after a gun control policy forum in Las Vegas on Wednesday. ""And I think he represents a kind of politics that is focused on poll-testing and focus-group-driving and triangulating and listening to consultants, before you arrive at a position.""

O'Rourke's comments came after Buttigieg took an implicit swipe at O'Rourke -- as well as New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who was the first 2020 presidential candidate to support mandatory buy-backs -- on Wednesday.

He called mandatory buy-backs ""a shiny object makes it harder for us to focus"" on reforms that are more politically viable in Washington, where any new gun control measures would require Republican support given the GOP's Senate majority.

""As a policy, it's had mixed results,"" Buttigieg said. ""It's a healthy debate to have, but we've got to do something now.""

Mandatory buybacks are a dividing issue for the 2020 Democratic field at large. But O'Rourke's direct and personal rebuke of Buttigieg forced into the open a tension that has brewed for months between the two camps and their supporters. The two entered the race in the same lane: Both as generation-change candidates with viral appeal, both vying to be seen as alternatives to former Vice President Joe Biden.

O'Rourke's allies have been bitter about Buttigieg since early April, when he said in New Hampshire -- in a clear poke at O'Rourke -- that ""I hear the way you ingratiate yourself to voters is to stand on things.""

Both have lost altitude in recent months, though Buttigieg has remained a much stronger fundraiser and is ahead of O'Rourke in nearly all polls.

But the divide over mandatory buy-backs has offered the clearest view yet of their diverging approaches to politics -- with Buttigieg seeking to show he is able to stake out a sober middle ground and could function effectively in Washington, and O'Rourke relying on more emotional appeals to those wishing to shake up the political system.

Ongoing clash

Buttigieg often uses the term ""shiny object"" to describe something he views as a distraction. Shortly after his appearance at Wednesday's forum, Buttigieg was asked whether he would allow his hypothetical vice president's son or daughter to serve on a foreign board.

He responded by saying Trump is trying to ""change the subject"" away from his ""abuse of power.""

""Let's deal with that and not get caught in the shiny objects he's going to throw out,"" Buttigieg said.

But the mayor calling O'Rourke's signature gun proposal a ""shiny object"" set off the Texas Democrat and his campaign.

The two had already clashed in September , when Buttigieg said O'Rourke's push for mandatory buy-backs -- which he has called for in the wake of a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, Texas -- played into the hands of Republicans looking for reasons to back away from gun control measures at a time when Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell were ""at least pretending to be open to reforms.""

But the Las Vegas forum marked a clear escalation from O'Rourke.

After pointing to Buttigieg's comments, O'Rourke asked, ""How in the world can you say that to March For Our Lives,"" referring to the student-led group founded in the wake of last year's school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that co-hosted Wednesday's forum.

""How can you say that to survivors of mass shootings across this country? How can you say that to the majority of Hispanics in America, certainly in Texas, who fear that they will be the victims of a mass shooting inspired by racism, hatred, that's been welcomed into the open by this president, and has been armed with weapons of war?"" he said.

O'Rourke lashed out again in a text message conversation with BuzzFeed , saying that Buttigieg's comment was ""offensive to anyone who has been shot by one of these weapons or who fears being shot or has lost someone to an AR-15 or AK-47.""

For his part, Buttigieg on Wednesday laid out a more modest set of proposals broadly backed by the field of Democratic 2020 presidential contenders: closing loopholes that allow some guns to be sold without background checks; allowing states to adopt ""red flag"" laws that allow families or police to ask a judge to have a potentially dangerous person's guns taken away; and banning the sale of additional assault-style rifles.

""We can get background checks done now. We can get red flag laws done now. We can get something done about the new sale of assault weapons now. We cannot wait for these other debates to play out -- even if they're healthy debates -- to get that action done because lives are on the line,"" Buttigieg said.

Vying for the top tier

In the Democratic primary field, Booker was the first to call for mandatory buy-backs. O'Rourke announced his support in early August -- after the El Paso shooting -- and California Sen. Kamala Harris called it a ""good idea"" in early September.

However, Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden have opposed mandatory buy-backs. Biden instead this week proposed that owners of assault-style rifles be required to participate in an optional buy-back or register them with the government under the same law that strictly regulated machine guns in the wake of the gangland shootings of the early 1920s and '30s.

But what's striking about the O'Rourke-Buttigieg clash is that both are coming from a similar starting point: They are vying to vault into the top tier of a Democratic presidential race currently being dominated by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Buttigieg has positioned himself as a generational-change candidate with Midwest roots -- but also as a more moderate alternative to the party's most progressive candidates.

O'Rourke had offered similar appeal, with a Sun Belt bent. But his campaign changed direction in the wake of the El Paso shooting.

Previously O'Rourke had opposed mandatory buy-backs, saying as a Senate candidate in 2018 that he would not support taking away Americans' guns.

""To be clear, they should have them. If you purchased that AR-15, you own it, keep it. Continue to use it responsibly,"" O'Rourke said during that race.

But he said the shooting in his hometown had changed him.

""I know that this is not politically easy. It's frankly why far too few people have proposed it; it's frankly why I have not proposed it in the past,"" O'Rourke told CNN in El Paso in August, explaining his reversal. ""I've said, 'This is something we should consider, I want to think about it, I want to talk to people about it.' I've thought about it. I've talked to people. ... And now, beyond a shadow of a doubt, regardless of what it does to our prospects going forward, you've got to speak the truth and be clear about where the solutions are.""

He made headlines in the September Democratic presidential debate when he said that ""hell yes,"" he would take AR-15s and AK-47s away from their owners.

That drew a rebuke from Booker, who already supported mandatory buy-backs -- as well as a national gun licensing program. Booker again criticized O'Rourke on Wednesday in Las Vegas.

""He saw the horrors visiting his community,"" Booker said of O'Rourke's reversal on the issue. ""Are we going to have to wait until hell's lottery comes to your community? No, we are a better country.""

O'Rourke responded on stage that he wanted to give Booker ""all the credit in the world for being a leader on this.""

""So Cory's deal is, you know, he's trying to determine who got to which policy position first,"" O'Rourke told reporters afterward. ""My response to that is, we're both in the right place on this and so let's work together."""

Kamala Harris (D-CA) is shifting her campaign strategy and focusing on Iowa, going as far as preparing “Sunday suppers” for families in the Hawkeye State in hopes of recruiting supporters.

The Harris campaign is touting a new facet of her Iowa swing, dubbed the “I feel your pain” tour. It features a series of more “intimate” meetings with families in the early caucus state, designed to show a different side of the California senator. The tour follows contentious Democrat debates, in which Harris’s competitors — namely, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) — highlighted less-than-flattering aspects of Harris’s prosecutorial record.

A Harris adviser spoke to Politico and suggested that the tour is about isolating issues that affect families day-to-day:

“It’s not about, ‘Let me talk about myself,” a Harris adviser involved in the planning told POLITICO. “It’s, ‘I understand your problems on a human level in a way that you experience them.’ Their concern is not, ‘I need broad systemic overhauls,’ it’s, ‘I can’t get a job, or I can’t pay the bills this month, or I can’t pay my student loans, or my yard is flooded.’” “You have a fundamentally different conversation when you’re sitting around someone’s kitchen table in their home,” the adviser added.

Additionally, Harris plans to “help prepare Sunday suppers in peoples’ homes.”

She also has bigger events planned across the state as well, including a meeting with Moms Demand Action and Women for Kamala events with field organizers.

Harris’s Iowa blitz follows the presidential candidate’s declaration that she is “f*cking moving to Iowa.”

A reporter overheard the remark as Harris expressed her strategy to a colleague:

“I’m f****** moving to Iowa,” Sen. Kamala Harris joked to Sen. Hirono (before she noticed me) pic.twitter.com/dv0PRWLY8g — Matt Laslo (@MattLaslo) September 18, 2019

The Harris campaign tried to embrace the “oops” moment with a dash of levity:

Harris continues to face an uphill battle in national polls, failing to recapture her once-held top tier status. The most recent Economist/YouGov poll shows Harris in fifth place with just five percent support. Similarly, a Monmouth University Poll released Wednesday shows the California lawmaker tied with Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) in fifth place, with five percent support each.

Harris has a long way to go in Iowa, according to the current Real Clear Politics average. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Joe Biden (D), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Buttigieg are leading in Iowa with 23 percent, 20.3 percent, 12 percent, 11.3 percent, respectively. Harris is in fifth place with 5.3 percent support."

During a campaign event, Warren was asked by a reporter whether Twitter should ban Trump, to which she responded with a one-word answer: “no.”

This puts the Masachussetts senator at odds with competing Democrat presidential candidate Kamala Harris, who said that Twitter should ban the President because of his commentary on the alleged “whistleblower.”

“He has used his platform, president of the United States, in a way that’s been about inciting fear,” said Harris earlier this week.

Tulsi Gabbard was the first Democrat candidate to break with Harris, promising to “stand up for every American’s right and freedom of speech, no matter how strongly I may disagree with that speech. This freedom is the First Amendment of the Constitution for a reason and I will do all I can to stand up for it.”

Gabbard has previously called out Silicon Valley for political censorship, even filing a lawsuit against tech giant Google over alleged censorship of her campaign ads. She has also called the dominance of big tech over public discourse a “threat to free speech, fair elections, and our democracy.”

The findings are among the first to offer insight into what might have sickened more than 800 people in recent months who vaped . At least 17 people nationwide have died from vaping-related illnesses. The cause is unclear, although several federal and state agencies are investigating.

Researchers from the Mayo Clinic found the lung damage was similar to a chemical burn. ""It seems to be some kind of direct chemical injury, similar to what one might see with exposures to toxic chemical fumes, poisonous gases and toxic agents,"" Dr. Brandon Larsen, a surgical pathologist at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona, said in a hospital press release.

The researchers looked at samples of lung tissue from 17 people, all of whom had vaped and 70% had used marijuana or cannabis oils. Two of the samples were taken from patients who died, according to the Mayo Clinic.

The accumulation of fatty substances such as oils were suspected in the lung damage, but researchers said there was no evidence they were the cause.

A clip of the town hall event in Reno, Nevada, surfaced on Thursday, showing Kamala Harris attempting to relate to the crowd with a bit of “real talk.”

“I’m at the stage of the campaign where I’m kind of like, you know, I’m just gonna gauge a real talk. I don’t want to waste your time with anything else,” the presidential candidate said. “Let’s just have some real talk.”

“So real talk. In this election in the last kind of couple — I mean, maybe a couple months, certainly few weeks — there’s this whole conversation that’s been coming up about electability, focused on our campaign,” Harris said.

“Is America ready for that?” she asked, to which some in the crowd shouted, “No!”

Their response appeared to take Harris by surprise, and she responded with a quick, “Well, yes they are”:

While it is possible — and likely, even — that certain members of the crowd misheard Harris. The awkward moment is emblematic of the presidential hopeful’s overall struggle to break through with voters and re-emerge at the top of the Democrat field.

The 78-year-old presidential candidate underwent an emergency heart procedure after experiencing chest discomfort at a campaign event on Tuesday evening. A medical evaluation determined that he had a blockage in an artery, and two stents were “successfully inserted,” according to Sanders’ Senior Advisor Jeff Weaver. Weaver added that Sanders’ campaign events and appearances would be canceled until further notice.

Several 2020 candidates, including President Trump’s campaign, sent words of encouragement the Vermont senator’s way.

“It’s so obscene, the part that money plays on our political system,” the new age author said. “Most of us live in a universe where $3 million is like a big deal. In presidential fundraising, it’s like she just squeaked by.”

“But 3 million dollars definitely says there are a lot of people out there saying you still and you keep going, and I appreciate that so much,” she added.

Though Williamson’s fundraising numbers rose substantially this quarter, the long-shot candidate has failed to secure a spot for the September and October Democrat presidential primary debates.

Williamson’s announcement comes after several 2020 candidates released their third-quarter fundraising numbers this week. Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) campaign on Tuesday announced it raised $25.3 million, while South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg took in $19.1 million. Sen.

Warren’s campaign reported a hefty $24.6 million raised in the third quarter, putting her just $700k behind her rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), whose campaign boasted of a staggering $25.3 million raised.

Warren’s third-quarter fundraising haul is a $5.5 million increase from the $19.1 million she raised in the second quarter. She has prided her campaign on being 100 percent grassroots-funded, although she reportedly used $10.4 million in leftover funds from her 2018 Senate campaign to cushion her presidential bid. Warren happily courted big donors and attended fundraisers during her 2018 senatorial bid.

Warren campaign manager Roger Lau said the 940,000 contributions came from 500,000 people. The average donation was $26. Three hundred thousand of those people, Lau claimed, were new donors.

Joe Biden’s third-quarter fundraising haul pales in comparison to both Warren’s and Sanders’ strong reports. His campaign only reported $15.2 million, roughly $10 million less than his strongest competitors.

The others are as follows:

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA): $11.6 million

(CNN) Twitter's handling of President Donald Trump's account makes no sense.

Kara Alaimo

Twitter has removed a video meme posted by President Donald Trump on Wednesday of an edited music clip by the band Nickelback after receiving a copyright infringement complaint from Warner Music, Inc. At the same time, Twitter has chosen not to delete a tweet by President Donald Trump on Sunday quoting a pastor who claimed that if the President is impeached, there will be a civil war.

The Department of Homeland Security recently affirmed the urgent threat of white supremacy in the United States, and as my fellow CNN Opinion contributor Nicole Hemmer has argued , the President's past tweets have helped spur domestic terrorism fueled by white power, and this one could result in actual violence, as well. So here's where we are now: Twitter will allow the President to invoke civil war, but harming Nickelback's rights to their own music is a step too far.

President Trump's actions on and off social media have long been and will continue to be a subject of consternation and debate for many. But aside from that, there is clearly something very, very wrong with Twitter's standards. The platform's decisions this week suggest that the company is ultimately focused only on its own concerns rather than on the larger welfare of society. Twitter will step in and take action when it fears that it could face a lawsuit itself, as in the case of Nickelback. But when others potentially stand to face threats of hate or bodily harm as a result of a presidential tweet, Twitter isn't willing to do the same thing.

The company likely (justifiably) fears facing the wrath of the President, who has accused Twitter of discriminating against conservatives in the past, if it deletes tweets. CNN has reported that the White House has even drafted an executive order which would have the Federal Communications Commission determine whether social media platforms can remove particular content. The draft would allow the Federal Trade Commission to sue companies like Twitter if they don't comply with government policy. While Twitter is right to be worried about the prospect of such a chilling development, that isn't an excuse to allow the President to post content that could put Americans in physical danger."

Parscale said Democrats are using the impeachment effort as a mass distraction, albeit one that is backfiring. He predicts it could pose an issue for vulnerable Democrats in swing districts and result in “serious losses” for Democrats, who desperately want to maintain a majority in the House.

He wrote:

If this week’s GOP fundraising haul is any indication, Pelosi didn’t just drive another nail into the coffin awaiting the Democrats’ nominee next year, she may also be looking at serious losses in the swing House districts that handed her the speaker’s gavel in 2018. The moderate Democrats in those seats are already being put on the spot by the impeachment push. Their Republican challengers are poised to hold them accountable back in their home districts, hoping to ensure that those freshman legislators find themselves out of office next year. The true toll of the Democrats’ decision to proceed with this Ukraine farce, of course, is the damage it is already inflicting on our government institutions. The American people won’t look kindly on their politicization of a process that exists as a last resort in a genuine crisis — which this clearly is not.

It boasted about the nearly $200 million it had been spending annually on health care services for detainees, saying that ""comprehensive medical care is provided from the moment detainees arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay.""

What the press release didn't say was that Samimi's death followed a series of lapses in his medical care -- the sort of breakdowns that have been repeatedly identified in government investigations into the care provided at immigrant detention centers in recent years.

Samimi, an Iranian man who was being held by ICE in Aurora, Colorado, had been complaining of vomiting and pain for weeks leading up to his death in 2017, according to ICE's investigation into his treatment. He had told medical staff upon his arrival that he had been taking methadone, a painkiller commonly used to treat opioid addiction, since hurting his back in a car accident. He said he was starting to feel symptoms of withdrawal, yet nurses told investigators they didn't have training in opioid withdrawal.

ICE's report, which involved an outside analysis of his treatment and like other death reviews did not directly connect the medical failures to the death, also found that the facility had been without a director of nursing and another medical provider for more than six months. Around a week before Samimi died, he was found unconscious on the floor of his cell but wasn't sent to the hospital. And on the day he died, a nurse tried calling the doctor multiple times for help after the inmate appeared to have suffered a seizure, but the doctor didn't answer or return any of those calls.

What should we investigate next? Email Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken

Investigations into deaths including Samimi's, as well as critical government audits, have raised troubling questions about the quality of medical care at facilities used to hold immigrants. One of the main private contractors providing health care in these facilities, which employed the doctor in the detention center where Samimi was held, is a massive company known as Wellpath, formerly Correct Care Solutions.

This company was the focus of a recent CNN investigation that exposed how it has provided substandard care that has led to deaths and other serious outcomes that could have been avoided. Through records and interviews with current and former employees, CNN showed how the company has relied on inexperienced workers, offered minimal training and understaffed facilities -- and how its employees have failed to get inmates the emergency care they needed.

Wellpath also works in some of the country's largest detention facilities, where ICE locks up thousands of immigrants -- many of whom have been apprehended for entering the country illegally.

In addition to at least five death reviews conducted by ICE that specifically cite issues with the contractor's treatment of immigrant detainees, a recent class action lawsuit spotlighted the company's problematic record -- calling the decision to hire medical contractors such as Wellpath ""disturbing."" In the suit, more than a dozen current detainees at a variety of detention centers accuse ICE of violating the US Constitution by denying them adequate medical care and failing to provide stronger oversight.

ICE did not comment on Wellpath, but in response to the lawsuit an official said that ""all ICE detainees, regardless of location, can expect timely and appropriate responses to emergent medical requests, and timely medical care appropriate to the anticipated length of detention.""

Wellpath did not comment on the lawsuit or government findings about specific detainees and facilities, but said in a statement that it is confident its ""team made the best possible care decisions with the information that was available to them.""

""Our compassionate team of doctors, nurses and health care providers work with our partners to deliver high quality health care in a clinical environment where security is the highest priority,"" the company said.

Private contractor GEO Group operates a number of the immigrant detention centers where Wellpath provides medical care, and it employed the nurses and other medical staff at the facility where Samimi died. The company declined to comment.

One of the class-action plaintiffs, Martín Muñoz, has Type 2 diabetes and has been detained at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California -- where Wellpath is the medical provider -- for more than two years. He alleges in the suit he was given more than triple his regular dose of insulin, resulting in an overdose. He says he wasn't seen by a doctor after the overdose, and that there have been multiple occasions where he hasn't been given his insulin or blood pressure medication.

The lawsuit states he went without insulin for six days in February and 10 days this summer, without blood pressure medication for two weeks in the spring and without cholesterol medication for a week in July. Muñoz, who has lived in the United States for more than 40 years, most recently worked as a handyman and has four children who are US citizens.

Another current detainee at the Adelanto facility alleges he lost vision in one eye when a recommended surgery wasn't provided, while a man held at California's Mesa Verde immigrant detention center -- where Wellpath is also the medical provider -- claims in the lawsuit that he has received no treatment for a severe parasite in his brain.

At least 27 people have died while being held in ICE custody since 2017, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, one of several advocacy organizations involved with the suit. An ICE official said in a statement that ""statistically, fatalities in ICE custody occur approximately 100 times less often (than) they do in both federal and state custody nationwide.""

Lawmakers who have previously criticized the conditions and medical care at ICE facilities have also expressed serious concerns to CNN about Wellpath.

""The reports of widespread and sometimes deadly deficiencies in the medical care provided by Correct Care Solutions ... are deeply troubling,"" said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-California, in a statement provided to CNN. ""The United States government has a moral obligation to respect the dignity of every individual in its care, and that mission is severely compromised when government agencies transfer responsibility to private corporations incentivized to cut costs and turn profits.""

In December 2018, Harris and a group of other California lawmakers wrote a letter to ICE , condemning the agency for the ""egregious violations"" identified during an inspection of the Adelanto detention center.

In its 2018 report, a Department of Homeland Security watchdog said it had found that detainees did not ""have timely access to proper medical care"" and that doctors were indicating they had seen patients they didn't actually visit. ICE said at the time that it takes the findings seriously and would be conducting a review to ensure standards are now being met.

""We must ensure that migrants in our custody are treated with the care and respect they deserve,"" Rep. Scott Peters, D-California, told CNN. ""Wellpath must be appropriately investigated, and should not be awarded any contracts until such an investigation has been completed.""

Colorado Rep. Jason Crow said he has similar concerns about the medical care at the immigrant detention center in his district, the Aurora facility where Samimi died.

The ACLU of Colorado recently released a report condemning Samimi's medical care, saying that the doctor ""made the medically unjustifiable decision to cut him off from his prescribed methadone."" Samimi had even called a friend and told him he was ""sicker than hell"" and ""dying here,"" according to the death review obtained by the organization and Rocky Mountain PBS

The ACLU is currently suing ICE in an attempt to get more records about what happened.

""ICE arrested a man who had lived in the US for over four decades, and 15 days later he died in ICE's care,"" the ACLU said in a statement about Samimi's death. ""The public deserves to know more.""

Kamala Harris (D-CA) is shifting her campaign strategy and focusing on Iowa, going as far as preparing “Sunday suppers” for families in the Hawkeye State in hopes of recruiting supporters.

The Harris campaign is touting a new facet of her Iowa swing, dubbed the “I feel your pain” tour. It features a series of more “intimate” meetings with families in the early caucus state, designed to show a different side of the California senator. The tour follows contentious Democrat debates, in which Harris’s competitors — namely, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) — highlighted less-than-flattering aspects of Harris’s prosecutorial record.

A Harris adviser spoke to Politico and suggested that the tour is about isolating issues that affect families day-to-day:

“It’s not about, ‘Let me talk about myself,” a Harris adviser involved in the planning told POLITICO. “It’s, ‘I understand your problems on a human level in a way that you experience them.’ Their concern is not, ‘I need broad systemic overhauls,’ it’s, ‘I can’t get a job, or I can’t pay the bills this month, or I can’t pay my student loans, or my yard is flooded.’” “You have a fundamentally different conversation when you’re sitting around someone’s kitchen table in their home,” the adviser added.

Additionally, Harris plans to “help prepare Sunday suppers in peoples’ homes.”

She also has bigger events planned across the state as well, including a meeting with Moms Demand Action and Women for Kamala events with field organizers.

Harris’s Iowa blitz follows the presidential candidate’s declaration that she is “f*cking moving to Iowa.”

A reporter overheard the remark as Harris expressed her strategy to a colleague:

“I’m f****** moving to Iowa,” Sen. Kamala Harris joked to Sen. Hirono (before she noticed me) pic.twitter.com/dv0PRWLY8g — Matt Laslo (@MattLaslo) September 18, 2019

The Harris campaign tried to embrace the “oops” moment with a dash of levity:

Harris continues to face an uphill battle in national polls, failing to recapture her once-held top tier status. The most recent Economist/YouGov poll shows Harris in fifth place with just five percent support. Similarly, a Monmouth University Poll released Wednesday shows the California lawmaker tied with Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) in fifth place, with five percent support each.

Harris has a long way to go in Iowa, according to the current Real Clear Politics average. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Joe Biden (D), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Buttigieg are leading in Iowa with 23 percent, 20.3 percent, 12 percent, 11.3 percent, respectively. Harris is in fifth place with 5.3 percent support."

During a campaign event, Warren was asked by a reporter whether Twitter should ban Trump, to which she responded with a one-word answer: “no.”

This puts the Masachussetts senator at odds with competing Democrat presidential candidate Kamala Harris, who said that Twitter should ban the President because of his commentary on the alleged “whistleblower.”

“He has used his platform, president of the United States, in a way that’s been about inciting fear,” said Harris earlier this week.

Tulsi Gabbard was the first Democrat candidate to break with Harris, promising to “stand up for every American’s right and freedom of speech, no matter how strongly I may disagree with that speech. This freedom is the First Amendment of the Constitution for a reason and I will do all I can to stand up for it.”

Gabbard has previously called out Silicon Valley for political censorship, even filing a lawsuit against tech giant Google over alleged censorship of her campaign ads. She has also called the dominance of big tech over public discourse a “threat to free speech, fair elections, and our democracy.”

Warren’s statements have been more contradictory. While she has disagreed with Harris on Twitter banning Trump, and once condemned Facebook for its power to “shut down debate” after it removed an ad for her campaign in March this year, she has also called for Twitter to censor allegedly “racist” criticism of Kamala Harris."

“I’m at the stage of the campaign where I’m kind of like, you know, I’m just gonna gauge a real talk. I don’t want to waste your time with anything else,” the presidential candidate said. “Let’s just have some real talk.”

“So real talk. In this election in the last kind of couple — I mean, maybe a couple months, certainly few weeks — there’s this whole conversation that’s been coming up about electability, focused on our campaign,” Harris said.

“Is America ready for that?” she asked, to which some in the crowd shouted, “No!”

Their response appeared to take Harris by surprise, and she responded with a quick, “Well, yes they are”:

While it is possible — and likely, even — that certain members of the crowd misheard Harris. The awkward moment is emblematic of the presidential hopeful’s overall struggle to break through with voters and re-emerge at the top of the Democrat field.

The Massachusetts senator and White House hopeful told reporters at the SEIU event that she has, in fact, seen enough evidence to convict Trump in the Senate, if the inquiry leads to that.

“Yes,” she said, adding that the “evidence is clear.”

“When Donald Trump released the transcript in which he solicited a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 elections, he broke the law and he did that in context of already having interfered with an investigation into the 2016 elections and Russia being invited to interfere in our elections,” Warren said, resurrecting what the president informally refers to as the Mueller “witch hunt.”

“He’s made it clear that the law doesn’t apply to him and the point of the federal government is to put whatever resources at his disposal to protect himself politically and financially,” she continued, according to the Washington Examiner. “That is not the case.”

“What he has done is an impeachable offense, and he should be impeached,” she added.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) also attended the event but did not go as far as Warren on impeachment, despite pushing for the inquiry on social media.

“I’ll wait until the evidence comes over from the House, and then I’ll share my vote with you,” she said.

Former Vice President Joe Biden (D) dodged the question, telling reporters that he preferred to refrain from speculation.

“I am not going to speculate what I would do in the Senate,” he explained. “I’m a former vice president, I know what occurred in Ukraine, I know what occurred in terms of China, I know what occurred in terms of Russia.”

“This is a president trying to get two of our most serious competitors, and not allies, to decide this election, to decide who he runs against,” he continued, calling Trump a “coward.”

“This guy, like all bullies, is a coward,” Biden assessed. “He does not want to run against me.”

Warren’s third-quarter fundraising haul is a $5.5 million increase from the $19.1 million she raised in the second quarter. She has prided her campaign on being 100 percent grassroots-funded, although she reportedly used $10.4 million in leftover funds from her 2018 Senate campaign to cushion her presidential bid.

She had taken the test back in December under Ireland's national cervical check screening program, and as she had taken it annually for years, she was expecting to receive the results back in six weeks' time

When she hadn't received her results by the spring, Sharon, who Ireland's health authority identified only by her first name, started to worry. In April, after first contacting CervicalCheck, the screening program, she sent a series of emails to Ireland's Department of Health outlining her concerns regarding the significant delay. They told her there had been a general slowdown in turnaround for test results.

By June, after doggedly pursuing answers, officials from the screening program eventually admitted there had been a glitch, saying that ""due to an IT issue in the laboratory"" her results had never been issued

And Sharon wasn't the only one.

Out of 4,088 women who had taken a smear test from December 2018 to July 2019, 873 hadn't received their tests, according to the MacCraith report, a review commissioned by the health authority into what had happened.

Days later, another woman identifying herself only as Ms. Scullion came forward to the Irish Times , exposing yet another mistake in the cervical screening process.

Scullion, like Sharon, was one of the 873 women who hadn't received her results for months. When she finally got the letter in August, it said that she had tested negative for human papilloma virus (HPV). But Scullion knows that she's HPV positive.

After she made her story public, Ireland's health service, the HSE, said that over 400 women had also received a letter with an ""inaccuracy.""

The revelations have marked yet the latest chapter in a years-long controversy over cervical screenings that has rocked the country.

And by challenging the system, Sharon and Scullion have joined a group of women whose push for answers have unearthed a cataclysmic series of scandals within the health service, controversies that continue to raise questions about what womens' rights activists view as the prevalence of institutionalized misogyny within it and Irish society.

Dr. Mary McAuliffe, historian and lecturer in Gender Studies at University College Dublin, says the government's response to the problem demonstrates that women are not a priority.

McAuliffe told CNN that current attitudes in the government reflect an ""almost unconscious demeaning of women's health and women's bodies"" where ""women's bodies and the risk to women's bodies are not important -- and in particular their reproductive bodies and their health care is seen as secondary to maybe money, to power, and to a patriarchal system that has always seen women as second class citizens.""

Ireland's Department of Health did not specifically address McAuliffe's allegation in comments to CNN, but did say that the government is soon expected to issue a formal apology to the women affected by the failures of the screening program in the next Dail (parliamentary) term.

'They knew I was ill'

The failures of that program all started in 2011, when Vicky Phelan, a mother of two, received a letter in the mail from CervicalCheck, confirming a negative pap smear test.

Three years later, she took another one, and it came back positive. In July 2014, Phelan was diagnosed with cervical cancer. Before she was diagnosed, unbeknown to her, an audit was carried out on the first test.

That audit found that the results of her 2011 test had been inaccurate, and that there had been a strong indication of cancer.

Campaigner Vicky Phelan exposed Ireland's cervical check scandal.

Phelan began aggressive treatment on the cancer, and it went into remission. But in 2017, the cancer came back in the form of an inoperable 10-centimeter tumor. Phelan's doctor told her that it was terminal and that she had a year or two to live.

He then told her about the audit, which had taken place three years earlier without her knowledge. Phelan sued.

In April 2018, Phelan took the HSE and the US-based lab that had been outsourced by the HSE to analyze the results to Ireland's High Court.

Her lawyers argued that if the cancerous cells had been correctly detected in 2011, Phelan could have had a hysterectomy, and would have been given a 90% chance of survival.

She was awarded a 2.5 million euro (approximately US $2.8 million) settlement with Texas-based Clinical Pathology Laboratories Inc and the case against the HSE was dropped. As part of the settlement, CPL did not admit any liability, but its lawyers did press Phelan to sign a non-disclosure agreement.

She refused.

""They knew I was very ill, and I think they were hoping that I would sign the non-disclosure because they knew I was so sick. They thought, 'Why would this woman fight when she's clearly sick?"" Phelan, 44, told CNN.

In researching her own case, Phelan and her lawyers discovered that there were about ten other women in her same position, who had yet to be informed about their incorrect smear test results. That number would later swell to more than 220 women.

""I knew it wasn't just about me. I couldn't in all conscious sign anything if I knew that the other women affected would not find out,"" she said, adding that she wasn't willing to let the authorities sweep their stories under the carpet.

""If I'm going to die, I'm going to bring them down with me,"" she said.

'Why didn't you tell me?'

A month after Phelan's day in court, the HSE confirmed that at least 209 women had been given inaccurate smear tests, all of whom were subsequently diagnosed with cervical cancer.

Eighteen of those women had already died not knowing they had been misdiagnosed. Since, it's been discovered that at least 221 women were misdiagnosed

In a May 2018 statement , the CervicalCheck screening service said that ""on look-back, the screening test could have provided a different result or a warning of increased risk or evidence of developing cancer"" for those women.

The government soon established a ""scoping inquiry"" into the screening program. Its findings, supported by the advocacy and campaigns of terminally ill women, such as now deceased 37-year-old mother of five Emma Mhic Mhathúna, were published by Dr. Gabriel Scally in September 2018.

The hearse carrying the body of campaigner Emma Mhic Mhathuna, one of the most high-profile victims of Ireland's cervical smear test controversy, passes by government buildings last October.

The Scally report found that the screening program was ""doomed to fail,"" and made 50 recommendations to combat problems that it said were ""redolent of a whole-system failure.""

The report drew from testimonies of some of the women affected by the misdiagnoses, which revealed a troubling account of a medical culture seemingly content with keeping patients in the dark.

""He (the doctor) had seen I had had a hysterectomy and decided I didn't need to know,"" read one woman's account.

Another woman recalled an exchange with her doctor, who asked: ""Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you tell my clinicians?"" The doctor responded, ""What difference does it make?"" Pressing her doctor further, the woman asked how she would be informed in the future.

""Watch the news,"" her doctor said.

And in another piece of testimony, described by Scally as ""one of the most disturbing accounts,"" a close relative of a woman who had died detailed that during the disclosure meeting, the woman's doctor mentioned ""several times that the late woman was a smoker (it is known that smoking impedes the body's ability to clear itself of the HPV virus) and they were also told that 'nuns don't get cervical cancer.'""

Addressing Minister for Health Simon Harris in the report , Scally praised the ""extraordinary determination of Vicky Phelan (to) not be silenced,"" and recommended that women and the families affected by the controversy ""should play a prominent part in the oversight of these reviews.""

Harris commissioned Scally to provide a follow-up report, which stated in February that although the government had made steps in the right direction, ""it is notable that the previous policy, which has been judged to be deeply flawed, remains in place.""

In June, Scally delivered a final report and addressed the outsourcing of the lab work. He said that ""the lack of transparency by the major private sector laboratory companies about the precise locations of their screening services provided to CervicalCheck, and therefore to Irish women, is entirely unsatisfactory,"" and that the tendering process ""appeared to move over time to place an increasing emphasis on price rather than quality.""

A 'drip' of information

Dr. Cliona Loughnane, Women's Health Coordinator at the National Women's Council of Ireland, told CNN that it's ""completely unacceptable"" that it is only through the actions of women challenging the health system and being persistent in trying to seek access to their own health information that the public is learning about system failures.

""There's been a drip drip of information about problems coming out. The onus shouldn't be on the individual, the onus needs to be on the system,"" Loughnane said, adding that now is the time for full disclosure so that the system can improve.

In a statement to CNN, the HSE said that it is ""absolutely focused on improving women's health and working with women in doing so.""

""Since the CervicalCheck crisis happened last year, significant work has been done to engage women in co-designing and improving our screening services. Specific actions have included patients being co-opted on to project groups within our screening services,"" it added.

Both the MacCraith and Scally reports have recommended that the government and health service start adopting a ""women first"" approach

Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Health Simon Harris speak at a news conference on the scandal last May.

Although historian McAuliffe welcomes any progress they might make, she says that she isn't holding her breath, noting that while Ireland appears to have progressed in terms of women's rights, the state has a historically skirted grave violations when it comes to women's reproductive autonomy.

She referenced the Magdalene laundries (workhouses where unmarried mothers, victims of sexual abuse, orphans considered a burden to relatives or the state, or others with mental or physical disabilities were sent to work and live without pay), the mother and baby homes (church-run institutions where unmarried mothers were sent to deliver their children) and the controversial surgical practice of symphysiotomy , where a woman's pelvis was broken during childbirth without consent.

""While we may have a process now where it seems like we have equality within the state and within this society, the structures that always judged women's bodies as secondary and as not as their own still remain in place,"" McAuliffe said.

""No one is held accountable and it keeps going and going. I think they think we will just get tired and all go away,"" she added.

But Irish women are not going away.

Phelan says one positive that has emerged in the last year is that Irish women are feeling more empowered, and speaking up and rejecting the power that the Catholic Church and ""old Ireland"" once held over their bodies

Referencing the country's landmark referendum on abortion , which passed around the time that the CervicalCheck scandal emerged, Phelan said that the last year or so has shown that women are ""coming out of the woodwork and not willing to put up with this type of treatment anymore.""

McAuliffe argues that ""it shouldn't be left up to individual women to basically shame the government into doing something right. We are part of this society and deserve the best. The fact we have to campaign for it over and over again is not acceptable.""

But for now, that appears to still be the case."

5. Trump, unleashed: Donald Trump has spent the last week talking and tweeting almost nonstop as he tries to fight his way out of mounting allegations over his pressure campaign to get the Ukrainians to look into debunked allegations of wrongdoing against Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

And the rhetoric from Trump has gone to previously unseen heights -- even for Trump. He's accused Rep. Adam Schiff (California) of treason, he's attacked Mitt Romney in deeply personal terms -- more on that directly below -- and he's repeating, repeating, repeating long disproven lies.

All of which means that when Trump travels to Minneapolis on Thursday for a ""Keep America Great"" rally, well, look out. Trump is always at his most, well, Trump-y at these campaign rallies -- and, given the walls closing in on him in Washington, he could well use the Minnesota rally as a venting session the likes of which even longtime Trump observers rarely see.

Stay tuned. It's going to be a doozy.

4. Any other Mitt Romneys out there?: Republicans have, almost uniformly, closed ranks around Trump even as a Republicans have, almost uniformly, closed ranks around Trump even as a second whistleblower has emerged regarding the President allegedly using the power of his office for political gain during interactions over the summer with Ukraine.

Only Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) has publicly criticized Trump in any way, calling the President's urgings of China and Ukraine to investigate the Bidens ""wrong"" and ""appalling."" Trump immediately struck back, referring to Romney as a ""pompous 'ass'"" (I have no idea why he put ""ass"" in quotes) and suggesting that the 2012 Republican nominee was ""begging"" to be his secretary of state.

Any Republican who was weighing speaking out about Trump's behavior with Ukraine (and his plea for China to investigate his main rival for the 2020 nomination) now can have no illusions about what such criticism will be met with: Pure, unadulterated anger from Trump -- and likely vilification from the President's base.

Is any prominent Republican other than Romney willing to risk speaking out when that reaction is assured? Principle vs. politics, anyone?

3. Fundraising losers...: With the With the third fundraising quarter ending at the close of last month , most of the major candidates have released how much they brought in and how much they spent between July 1 and September 30.

Let's go through the losers first.

* Joe Biden: When you are a former vice president and the race's frontrunner, you need to be at or very close to the top of the money chase. Biden's $15 million raised in the third quarter is well off the pace and a significant drop-off from when Biden raised $21.5 million from April 1 to June 30 -- his first three months of active fundraising. His numbers will re-ignite the debate over whether he has real grassroots energy behind his establishment candidacy. Think about this: The mayor of South Bend, Indiana -- Pete Buttigieg -- raised $4 million more than Biden in the third quarter and has now out-raised the former vice president for six months straight.

* Cory Booker: The New Jersey senator's plea for $1.7 million in the final days of the quarter -- in order, he said, for him to remain in the race -- drew a ton of publicity. Even though Booker met his goal, he still only brought in $6 million for the entire three-month period. That likely means he will be facing another dire financial deadline in the not-too-distant future.

2. ... and fundraising winners:

* Bernie Sanders: Even as his poll numbers have stagnated somewhat, the Vermont senator's small-dollar, online fundraising network continues to deliver. Sanders topped the field in the third quarter with more than $25 million raised and has now raised more than $71 million this year. That ensures he will not only have real organizations in all of the early states but will also be able to continue fighting for the nomination for months.

* Elizabeth Warren: While Sanders edged out Warren for the top spot by about $500,000, Warren's third quarter fundraising is yet another data point proving how much momentum she has built behind her candidacy. Warren already has the best organization in Iowa, and fundraising like she put on the board over the last three months ensures her campaign will be able to fund a (TV) air assault as well.

* Andrew Yang: The tech entrepreneur raised $10 million in the third quarter, which, at least to me was the single most surprising result of the fundraising race. Yang's total put him well above what Booker, as well as Sen. Michael Bennet (Colorado) and Gov. Steve Bullock (Montana) raised, and within shouting distance of Sen. Kamala Harris (California). That's a stunner, and shows how far he's come since the year started and almost no one knew who he was.

1. The age/health debate is here: It was probably inevitable, given that the four most likely candidates to be president in 2021 are 70+ years old, but Bernie Sanders' recent heart attack has officially injected the issue of age and health into the 2020 campaign.

After several days of uncertainty, Sanders' campaign confirmed that he had suffered a heart attack on the campaign trail and, following his release from the hospital late last week, he has returned to Vermont. His campaign has canceled its events until further notice but has said Sanders will be at the next debate -- set for October 15 in Ohio.

While the relatively advanced ages of Sanders (78), Joe Biden (76) and Elizabeth Warren (70) has been a sort of low buzz in the background of the Democratic race so far, those days are now over. All three candidates had previously pledged to release their medical records before the Iowa caucuses on February 3, 2020, but the urgency of those releases is significantly higher now than it was even a week ago.

(Remember that Donald Trump was the oldest person ever elected to a first term when he won the presidency in 2016 at age 70. During the campaign, his personal physician released a letter proclaiming that Trump ""would be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency."" Trump is now 73. In January of this year, he underwent a physical which found him in ""very good health overall."")"

1. Kamala Harris' Iowa plan

Sen. Kamala Harris plans a three-day campaign swing through Iowa this week -- part of what her team says is a new strategy to focus their resources on beating expectations in the Hawkeye State.

But is it too little, too late for a candidate mired in the mid-single digits in most polls?

""Some of her advisers say she's going to be doing the Obama strategy -- focusing all on Iowa,"" CNN's Jeff Zeleny said. ""But that is simply not a correct reading of history. Twelve years ago, Barack Obama, yes he was trying to do a come-from-behind victory in Iowa, which he pulled it off against Hillary Clinton. But he started there early -- and he never wavered in his Iowa plan,"" whereas Harris has come to the strategy relatively late in the campaign.

""So now they're trying to revive her candidacy in Iowa, but don't believe they're repeating the Obama strategy. Had she done that, it wouldn't be a Hail Mary right now,"" Zeleny said.

2. Trump's latest immigration restriction

The Trump administration has found a new way to restrict legal immigration -- it will bar visa applicants from entering the US unless they can prove they have health insurance or the means to pay for their own medical care.

The new plan takes effect next month, and New York Times reporter Julie Hirschfeld Davis said it's just the latest in a series of steps the administration is taking to make it harder to get into the country.

""We've been reporting about some of the President's more extreme ideas for preventing immigrants from coming across the southern border, everything from shooting at them to digging a water-filled trench with potentially dangerous reptiles inside,"" said Davis, who co-authored the book ""Border Wars: Inside Trump's Assault on Immigration,"" which goes on sale this week.

""You have a President who's really obsessed with this issue who's grasping for ever more extreme ways to get at what he sees as the problem of illegal immigration,"" Davis said. ""Stephen Miller, his senior adviser, has really sort of stood up an internal think tank inside the West Wing to come up with ideas to target legal immigration. That's some of what we'll continue to see in the run-up to the 2020 election.""

3. Marking one year since Khashoggi's murder

It's been one year since journalist Jamal Khashoggi walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and never walked out -- murdered by Saudi agents.

US intelligence officials believe it was at the behest of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman -- but he denies involvement, and US President Donald Trump appears to still be taking his word for it.

""We've seen President Trump really rehabilitate the image of Mohammed bin Salman ... over the past year, and not really punish him at all,"" Washington Post reporter Toluse Olorunnipa said. ""He basically ordered this grisly murder of a Washington Post columnist.""

The crown prince will be hosting some of the world's most important people at a summit this month that's been nicknamed ""Davos in the Desert.""

""We're expecting the Trump administration to be heavily represented,"" Olorunnipa said. ""Showing in pretty stark imagery how much the Trump administration has welcomed the Saudis right back into the global stage, so we'll be watching as we talk about the President's discussions with foreign leaders, his discussions and his relations with the Saudi government is going to be something heavily in focus.""

4. A trade meeting in Mexico

Impeachment fever has taken over Washington, but some in Congress and the White House still hope to finalize the US Mexico Canada trade agreement (USMCA) -- Trump's replacement for NAFTA.

""There's a group of House Democrats who are going to Mexico later this week to meet with Mexican government officials and local workers there about the trade deal,"" Washington Post reporter Seung Min Kim said.

And Kim said House Democrats continue to meet with Trump's trade team.

""I spoke with one of the members of the working group earlier this week, and she said ... the dynamic and the discussions in the room have not changed, we really do want to get this done,"" Kim said.

As for the President? Kim said he's been sounding pessimistic lately about getting a final vote in Congress.

5. Impeachment then & now

And from CNN Chief National Correspondent John King:

History doesn't always repeat itself, but it can shadow itself.

It was 21 years ago this week, October 5, 1998, to be exact, that the House Judiciary Committee voted to open an impeachment inquiry into President Bill Clinton. The full House endorsed the inquiry a few days later on a vote of 259 to 176.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says such votes are not necessary, and are not planned as the Democratic majority pursues its impeachment inquiry of Trump.

Here's another difference: Clinton had a 63% approval rating in Gallup polling at the beginning of his impeachment proceedings, and national polling showed clear opposition to impeachment. Trump's approval rating is just 40%, and polling shows a more divided country on the impeachment question, but with those favoring at least an inquiry on top.

And this difference is giant: President Clinton was well into his second term when the proceedings began. Trump, of course, is just approaching his reelection year.

One more: this time, we will not have an immediate test of how the impeachment drama plays out in voting behavior.

The Clinton inquiry was launched in the final weeks of the 1998 midterm campaign, and Republicans attacked many Democrats with ads linking them to the president and his troubles.

But the strategy didn't work. Democrats defied the traditional midterm norms that year and picked up five seats in the House. The 1998 Senate races were a wash; several seats changed hands but the overall balance of power remained the same."

“Yes,” she said, adding that the “evidence is clear.”

“When Donald Trump released the transcript in which he solicited a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 elections, he broke the law and he did that in context of already having interfered with an investigation into the 2016 elections and Russia being invited to interfere in our elections,” Warren said, resurrecting what the president informally refers to as the Mueller “witch hunt.”

“He’s made it clear that the law doesn’t apply to him and the point of the federal government is to put whatever resources at his disposal to protect himself politically and financially,” she continued, according to the Washington Examiner. “That is not the case.”

“What he has done is an impeachable offense, and he should be impeached,” she added.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) also attended the event but did not go as far as Warren on impeachment, despite pushing for the inquiry on social media.

“I’ll wait until the evidence comes over from the House, and then I’ll share my vote with you,” she said.

Former Vice President Joe Biden (D) dodged the question, telling reporters that he preferred to refrain from speculation.

“I am not going to speculate what I would do in the Senate,” he explained. “I’m a former vice president, I know what occurred in Ukraine, I know what occurred in terms of China, I know what occurred in terms of Russia.”

“This is a president trying to get two of our most serious competitors, and not allies, to decide this election, to decide who he runs against,” he continued, calling Trump a “coward.”

“This guy, like all bullies, is a coward,” Biden assessed. “He does not want to run against me.”

She had taken the test back in December under Ireland's national cervical check screening program, and as she had taken it annually for years, she was expecting to receive the results back in six weeks' time

When she hadn't received her results by the spring, Sharon, who Ireland's health authority identified only by her first name, started to worry. In April, after first contacting CervicalCheck, the screening program, she sent a series of emails to Ireland's Department of Health outlining her concerns regarding the significant delay. They told her there had been a general slowdown in turnaround for test results.

By June, after doggedly pursuing answers, officials from the screening program eventually admitted there had been a glitch, saying that ""due to an IT issue in the laboratory"" her results had never been issued

And Sharon wasn't the only one.

Out of 4,088 women who had taken a smear test from December 2018 to July 2019, 873 hadn't received their tests, according to the MacCraith report, a review commissioned by the health authority into what had happened.

Days later, another woman identifying herself only as Ms. Scullion came forward to the Irish Times , exposing yet another mistake in the cervical screening process.

Scullion, like Sharon, was one of the 873 women who hadn't received her results for months. When she finally got the letter in August, it said that she had tested negative for human papilloma virus (HPV). But Scullion knows that she's HPV positive.

After she made her story public, Ireland's health service, the HSE, said that over 400 women had also received a letter with an ""inaccuracy.""

The revelations have marked yet the latest chapter in a years-long controversy over cervical screenings that has rocked the country.

And by challenging the system, Sharon and Scullion have joined a group of women whose push for answers have unearthed a cataclysmic series of scandals within the health service, controversies that continue to raise questions about what womens' rights activists view as the prevalence of institutionalized misogyny within it and Irish society.

Dr. Mary McAuliffe, historian and lecturer in Gender Studies at University College Dublin, says the government's response to the problem demonstrates that women are not a priority.

McAuliffe told CNN that current attitudes in the government reflect an ""almost unconscious demeaning of women's health and women's bodies"" where ""women's bodies and the risk to women's bodies are not important -- and in particular their reproductive bodies and their health care is seen as secondary to maybe money, to power, and to a patriarchal system that has always seen women as second class citizens.""

Ireland's Department of Health did not specifically address McAuliffe's allegation in comments to CNN, but did say that the government is soon expected to issue a formal apology to the women affected by the failures of the screening program in the next Dail (parliamentary) term.

'They knew I was ill'

The failures of that program all started in 2011, when Vicky Phelan, a mother of two, received a letter in the mail from CervicalCheck, confirming a negative pap smear test.

Three years later, she took another one, and it came back positive. In July 2014, Phelan was diagnosed with cervical cancer. Before she was diagnosed, unbeknown to her, an audit was carried out on the first test.

That audit found that the results of her 2011 test had been inaccurate, and that there had been a strong indication of cancer.

Campaigner Vicky Phelan exposed Ireland's cervical check scandal.

Phelan began aggressive treatment on the cancer, and it went into remission. But in 2017, the cancer came back in the form of an inoperable 10-centimeter tumor. Phelan's doctor told her that it was terminal and that she had a year or two to live.

He then told her about the audit, which had taken place three years earlier without her knowledge. Phelan sued.

In April 2018, Phelan took the HSE and the US-based lab that had been outsourced by the HSE to analyze the results to Ireland's High Court.

Her lawyers argued that if the cancerous cells had been correctly detected in 2011, Phelan could have had a hysterectomy, and would have been given a 90% chance of survival.

She was awarded a 2.5 million euro (approximately US $2.8 million) settlement with Texas-based Clinical Pathology Laboratories Inc and the case against the HSE was dropped. As part of the settlement, CPL did not admit any liability, but its lawyers did press Phelan to sign a non-disclosure agreement.

She refused.

""They knew I was very ill, and I think they were hoping that I would sign the non-disclosure because they knew I was so sick. They thought, 'Why would this woman fight when she's clearly sick?"" Phelan, 44, told CNN.

In researching her own case, Phelan and her lawyers discovered that there were about ten other women in her same position, who had yet to be informed about their incorrect smear test results. That number would later swell to more than 220 women.

""I knew it wasn't just about me. I couldn't in all conscious sign anything if I knew that the other women affected would not find out,"" she said, adding that she wasn't willing to let the authorities sweep their stories under the carpet.

""If I'm going to die, I'm going to bring them down with me,"" she said.

'Why didn't you tell me?'

A month after Phelan's day in court, the HSE confirmed that at least 209 women had been given inaccurate smear tests, all of whom were subsequently diagnosed with cervical cancer.

Eighteen of those women had already died not knowing they had been misdiagnosed. Since, it's been discovered that at least 221 women were misdiagnosed

In a May 2018 statement , the CervicalCheck screening service said that ""on look-back, the screening test could have provided a different result or a warning of increased risk or evidence of developing cancer"" for those women.

The government soon established a ""scoping inquiry"" into the screening program. Its findings, supported by the advocacy and campaigns of terminally ill women, such as now deceased 37-year-old mother of five Emma Mhic Mhathúna, were published by Dr. Gabriel Scally in September 2018.

The hearse carrying the body of campaigner Emma Mhic Mhathuna, one of the most high-profile victims of Ireland's cervical smear test controversy, passes by government buildings last October.

The Scally report found that the screening program was ""doomed to fail,"" and made 50 recommendations to combat problems that it said were ""redolent of a whole-system failure.""

The report drew from testimonies of some of the women affected by the misdiagnoses, which revealed a troubling account of a medical culture seemingly content with keeping patients in the dark.

""He (the doctor) had seen I had had a hysterectomy and decided I didn't need to know,"" read one woman's account.

Another woman recalled an exchange with her doctor, who asked: ""Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you tell my clinicians?"" The doctor responded, ""What difference does it make?"" Pressing her doctor further, the woman asked how she would be informed in the future.

""Watch the news,"" her doctor said.

And in another piece of testimony, described by Scally as ""one of the most disturbing accounts,"" a close relative of a woman who had died detailed that during the disclosure meeting, the woman's doctor mentioned ""several times that the late woman was a smoker (it is known that smoking impedes the body's ability to clear itself of the HPV virus) and they were also told that 'nuns don't get cervical cancer.'""

Addressing Minister for Health Simon Harris in the report , Scally praised the ""extraordinary determination of Vicky Phelan (to) not be silenced,"" and recommended that women and the families affected by the controversy ""should play a prominent part in the oversight of these reviews.""

Harris commissioned Scally to provide a follow-up report, which stated in February that although the government had made steps in the right direction, ""it is notable that the previous policy, which has been judged to be deeply flawed, remains in place.""

In June, Scally delivered a final report and addressed the outsourcing of the lab work. He said that ""the lack of transparency by the major private sector laboratory companies about the precise locations of their screening services provided to CervicalCheck, and therefore to Irish women, is entirely unsatisfactory,"" and that the tendering process ""appeared to move over time to place an increasing emphasis on price rather than quality.""

A 'drip' of information

Dr. Cliona Loughnane, Women's Health Coordinator at the National Women's Council of Ireland, told CNN that it's ""completely unacceptable"" that it is only through the actions of women challenging the health system and being persistent in trying to seek access to their own health information that the public is learning about system failures.

""There's been a drip drip of information about problems coming out. The onus shouldn't be on the individual, the onus needs to be on the system,"" Loughnane said, adding that now is the time for full disclosure so that the system can improve.

In a statement to CNN, the HSE said that it is ""absolutely focused on improving women's health and working with women in doing so.""

""Since the CervicalCheck crisis happened last year, significant work has been done to engage women in co-designing and improving our screening services. Specific actions have included patients being co-opted on to project groups within our screening services,"" it added.

Both the MacCraith and Scally reports have recommended that the government and health service start adopting a ""women first"" approach

Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Health Simon Harris speak at a news conference on the scandal last May.

Although historian McAuliffe welcomes any progress they might make, she says that she isn't holding her breath, noting that while Ireland appears to have progressed in terms of women's rights, the state has a historically skirted grave violations when it comes to women's reproductive autonomy.

She referenced the Magdalene laundries (workhouses where unmarried mothers, victims of sexual abuse, orphans considered a burden to relatives or the state, or others with mental or physical disabilities were sent to work and live without pay), the mother and baby homes (church-run institutions where unmarried mothers were sent to deliver their children) and the controversial surgical practice of symphysiotomy , where a woman's pelvis was broken during childbirth without consent.

""While we may have a process now where it seems like we have equality within the state and within this society, the structures that always judged women's bodies as secondary and as not as their own still remain in place,"" McAuliffe said.

""No one is held accountable and it keeps going and going. I think they think we will just get tired and all go away,"" she added.

But Irish women are not going away.

Phelan says one positive that has emerged in the last year is that Irish women are feeling more empowered, and speaking up and rejecting the power that the Catholic Church and ""old Ireland"" once held over their bodies

Referencing the country's landmark referendum on abortion , which passed around the time that the CervicalCheck scandal emerged, Phelan said that the last year or so has shown that women are ""coming out of the woodwork and not willing to put up with this type of treatment anymore.""

McAuliffe argues that ""it shouldn't be left up to individual women to basically shame the government into doing something right. We are part of this society and deserve the best. The fact we have to campaign for it over and over again is not acceptable.""

But for now, that appears to still be the case."

5. Trump, unleashed: Donald Trump has spent the last week talking and tweeting almost nonstop as he tries to fight his way out of mounting allegations over his pressure campaign to get the Ukrainians to look into debunked allegations of wrongdoing against Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

And the rhetoric from Trump has gone to previously unseen heights -- even for Trump. He's accused Rep. Adam Schiff (California) of treason, he's attacked Mitt Romney in deeply personal terms -- more on that directly below -- and he's repeating, repeating, repeating long disproven lies.

All of which means that when Trump travels to Minneapolis on Thursday for a ""Keep America Great"" rally, well, look out. Trump is always at his most, well, Trump-y at these campaign rallies -- and, given the walls closing in on him in Washington, he could well use the Minnesota rally as a venting session the likes of which even longtime Trump observers rarely see.

Stay tuned. It's going to be a doozy.

4. Any other Mitt Romneys out there?: Republicans have, almost uniformly, closed ranks around Trump even as a Republicans have, almost uniformly, closed ranks around Trump even as a second whistleblower has emerged regarding the President allegedly using the power of his office for political gain during interactions over the summer with Ukraine.

Only Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) has publicly criticized Trump in any way, calling the President's urgings of China and Ukraine to investigate the Bidens ""wrong"" and ""appalling."" Trump immediately struck back, referring to Romney as a ""pompous 'ass'"" (I have no idea why he put ""ass"" in quotes) and suggesting that the 2012 Republican nominee was ""begging"" to be his secretary of state.

Any Republican who was weighing speaking out about Trump's behavior with Ukraine (and his plea for China to investigate his main rival for the 2020 nomination) now can have no illusions about what such criticism will be met with: Pure, unadulterated anger from Trump -- and likely vilification from the President's base.

Is any prominent Republican other than Romney willing to risk speaking out when that reaction is assured? Principle vs. politics, anyone?

3. Fundraising losers...: With the With the third fundraising quarter ending at the close of last month , most of the major candidates have released how much they brought in and how much they spent between July 1 and September 30.

Let's go through the losers first.

* Joe Biden: When you are a former vice president and the race's frontrunner, you need to be at or very close to the top of the money chase. Biden's $15 million raised in the third quarter is well off the pace and a significant drop-off from when Biden raised $21.5 million from April 1 to June 30 -- his first three months of active fundraising. His numbers will re-ignite the debate over whether he has real grassroots energy behind his establishment candidacy. Think about this: The mayor of South Bend, Indiana -- Pete Buttigieg -- raised $4 million more than Biden in the third quarter and has now out-raised the former vice president for six months straight.

* Cory Booker: The New Jersey senator's plea for $1.7 million in the final days of the quarter -- in order, he said, for him to remain in the race -- drew a ton of publicity. Even though Booker met his goal, he still only brought in $6 million for the entire three-month period. That likely means he will be facing another dire financial deadline in the not-too-distant future.

2. ... and fundraising winners:

* Bernie Sanders: Even as his poll numbers have stagnated somewhat, the Vermont senator's small-dollar, online fundraising network continues to deliver. Sanders topped the field in the third quarter with more than $25 million raised and has now raised more than $71 million this year. That ensures he will not only have real organizations in all of the early states but will also be able to continue fighting for the nomination for months.

* Elizabeth Warren: While Sanders edged out Warren for the top spot by about $500,000, Warren's third quarter fundraising is yet another data point proving how much momentum she has built behind her candidacy. Warren already has the best organization in Iowa, and fundraising like she put on the board over the last three months ensures her campaign will be able to fund a (TV) air assault as well.

* Andrew Yang: The tech entrepreneur raised $10 million in the third quarter, which, at least to me was the single most surprising result of the fundraising race. Yang's total put him well above what Booker, as well as Sen. Michael Bennet (Colorado) and Gov. Steve Bullock (Montana) raised, and within shouting distance of Sen. Kamala Harris (California). That's a stunner, and shows how far he's come since the year started and almost no one knew who he was.

1. The age/health debate is here: It was probably inevitable, given that the four most likely candidates to be president in 2021 are 70+ years old, but Bernie Sanders' recent heart attack has officially injected the issue of age and health into the 2020 campaign.

After several days of uncertainty, Sanders' campaign confirmed that he had suffered a heart attack on the campaign trail and, following his release from the hospital late last week, he has returned to Vermont. His campaign has canceled its events until further notice but has said Sanders will be at the next debate -- set for October 15 in Ohio.

While the relatively advanced ages of Sanders (78), Joe Biden (76) and Elizabeth Warren (70) has been a sort of low buzz in the background of the Democratic race so far, those days are now over. All three candidates had previously pledged to release their medical records before the Iowa caucuses on February 3, 2020, but the urgency of those releases is significantly higher now than it was even a week ago.

(Remember that Donald Trump was the oldest person ever elected to a first term when he won the presidency in 2016 at age 70. During the campaign, his personal physician released a letter proclaiming that Trump ""would be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency."" Trump is now 73. In January of this year, he underwent a physical which found him in ""very good health overall."")"

1. Kamala Harris' Iowa plan

Sen. Kamala Harris plans a three-day campaign swing through Iowa this week -- part of what her team says is a new strategy to focus their resources on beating expectations in the Hawkeye State.

But is it too little, too late for a candidate mired in the mid-single digits in most polls?

""Some of her advisers say she's going to be doing the Obama strategy -- focusing all on Iowa,"" CNN's Jeff Zeleny said. ""But that is simply not a correct reading of history. Twelve years ago, Barack Obama, yes he was trying to do a come-from-behind victory in Iowa, which he pulled it off against Hillary Clinton. But he started there early -- and he never wavered in his Iowa plan,"" whereas Harris has come to the strategy relatively late in the campaign.

""So now they're trying to revive her candidacy in Iowa, but don't believe they're repeating the Obama strategy. Had she done that, it wouldn't be a Hail Mary right now,"" Zeleny said.

2. Trump's latest immigration restriction

The Trump administration has found a new way to restrict legal immigration -- it will bar visa applicants from entering the US unless they can prove they have health insurance or the means to pay for their own medical care.

The new plan takes effect next month, and New York Times reporter Julie Hirschfeld Davis said it's just the latest in a series of steps the administration is taking to make it harder to get into the country.

""We've been reporting about some of the President's more extreme ideas for preventing immigrants from coming across the southern border, everything from shooting at them to digging a water-filled trench with potentially dangerous reptiles inside,"" said Davis, who co-authored the book ""Border Wars: Inside Trump's Assault on Immigration,"" which goes on sale this week.

""You have a President who's really obsessed with this issue who's grasping for ever more extreme ways to get at what he sees as the problem of illegal immigration,"" Davis said. ""Stephen Miller, his senior adviser, has really sort of stood up an internal think tank inside the West Wing to come up with ideas to target legal immigration. That's some of what we'll continue to see in the run-up to the 2020 election.""

3. Marking one year since Khashoggi's murder

It's been one year since journalist Jamal Khashoggi walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and never walked out -- murdered by Saudi agents.

US intelligence officials believe it was at the behest of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman -- but he denies involvement, and US President Donald Trump appears to still be taking his word for it.

""We've seen President Trump really rehabilitate the image of Mohammed bin Salman ... over the past year, and not really punish him at all,"" Washington Post reporter Toluse Olorunnipa said. ""He basically ordered this grisly murder of a Washington Post columnist.""

The crown prince will be hosting some of the world's most important people at a summit this month that's been nicknamed ""Davos in the Desert.""

""We're expecting the Trump administration to be heavily represented,"" Olorunnipa said. ""Showing in pretty stark imagery how much the Trump administration has welcomed the Saudis right back into the global stage, so we'll be watching as we talk about the President's discussions with foreign leaders, his discussions and his relations with the Saudi government is going to be something heavily in focus.""

4. A trade meeting in Mexico

Impeachment fever has taken over Washington, but some in Congress and the White House still hope to finalize the US Mexico Canada trade agreement (USMCA) -- Trump's replacement for NAFTA.

""There's a group of House Democrats who are going to Mexico later this week to meet with Mexican government officials and local workers there about the trade deal,"" Washington Post reporter Seung Min Kim said.

And Kim said House Democrats continue to meet with Trump's trade team.

""I spoke with one of the members of the working group earlier this week, and she said ... the dynamic and the discussions in the room have not changed, we really do want to get this done,"" Kim said.

As for the President? Kim said he's been sounding pessimistic lately about getting a final vote in Congress.

5. Impeachment then & now

And from CNN Chief National Correspondent John King:

History doesn't always repeat itself, but it can shadow itself.

It was 21 years ago this week, October 5, 1998, to be exact, that the House Judiciary Committee voted to open an impeachment inquiry into President Bill Clinton. The full House endorsed the inquiry a few days later on a vote of 259 to 176.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says such votes are not necessary, and are not planned as the Democratic majority pursues its impeachment inquiry of Trump.

Here's another difference: Clinton had a 63% approval rating in Gallup polling at the beginning of his impeachment proceedings, and national polling showed clear opposition to impeachment. Trump's approval rating is just 40%, and polling shows a more divided country on the impeachment question, but with those favoring at least an inquiry on top.

And this difference is giant: President Clinton was well into his second term when the proceedings began. Trump, of course, is just approaching his reelection year.

One more: this time, we will not have an immediate test of how the impeachment drama plays out in voting behavior.

The Clinton inquiry was launched in the final weeks of the 1998 midterm campaign, and Republicans attacked many Democrats with ads linking them to the president and his troubles.

But the strategy didn't work. Democrats defied the traditional midterm norms that year and picked up five seats in the House. The 1998 Senate races were a wash; several seats changed hands but the overall balance of power remained the same."

The 2020 Democratic candidate announced her proposal -- part of her ""Children's Agenda"" -- in Iowa on the second day of a three-day campaign tour across the state. Harris' Iowa push comes as part of her campaign's renewed focus on voters in the Hawkeye state.

If elected President, Harris promises in the plan to ""put children at the center of her decision-making and treat their needs with the same urgency and importance as we treat any other national priority.""

Paid leave would be available to all workers under the proposal, including part-time employees, self-employed workers, and independent contractors. Workers would have the ability to use it for ""personal serious health conditions, caring for new children or family members with serious health conditions, or addressing medical or non-medical needs"" caused by domestic violence or sexual assault, according to the Harris campaign.

The plan would also allow low and middle-income workers making less than $75,000 a year to receive full wage replacement during their leave, and benefits would phase down for higher-income households."

""Instead of siding with Americans, politicians have stood with corporate health care, as they did when Congress barred the federal government from negotiating with pharmaceutical companies on drug prices for seniors.""

Buttigieg's plan, which CNN obtained Sunday afternoon, echoes proposals from fellow 2020 hopefuls, including California Sen. Kamala Harris and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , in capping out-of-pocket drug spending, setting a limit at 50% for seniors on Medicare and at $250 per month for those choosing a public health insurance option under Buttigieg's newly released ""Medicare for All Who Want It"" plan.

The plan also calls on the federal government to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies based on a series of criteria, including ""(1) the therapeutic gain offered by the drug, (2) the cost of bringing the therapeutic class of drugs to market, (3) the current costs of treating the indicated disease, and (4) international prices charged for these drugs.""

Kamala Harris (D-CA) said based on everything already known, she would vote to remove President Donald Trump from office in an impeachment trial in the Senate.

Harris said, “I believe this is a moment where every member of the United States Congress should take very seriously their oath to protect the Constitution of the United States. This is about defending our democracy and our system of justice because the framers imagined a moment like this, Katy, where there would be an abuse of power by one branch of government, and purposely they designed a democracy understanding it for it to be real and true and checks and balances on any excessive display of power, which means, in this case, we’re the executive branch the president has abused his power. Congress, the other, co-equal independent branch of government, must provide the check and the balance on that abuse. And that means beginning an inquiry to expose exactly what happened so there could be accountability and consequence. There is a matter of defending the very democracy that makes us and allows us to walk into rooms around the globe and have respect because perfect we may be, we actually understand the importance of not having authoritarian regimes.”

When asked if she would vote to “remove him from office,” Harris said, “Yes. Based on everything I’ve seen. Yes. I mean, look, Katy, listen, I’m a former prosecutor. And let me just tell you, as far as I’m concerned, the subject, the main subject of the impeachment which is the issue of yet again Donald Trump eliciting help from a foreign government to interfere with the election of our president of the United States, in this case, we’ve basically got a confession. We’ve got a display of conscious consciousness of guilt in an attempt to cover-up. I don’t know how much more we need but apparently a second whistle-blower, and we’re going to get more. Based on everything we know, including an admission by this president, I don’t know that it leads in any other direction except to vote yes. Which is what I believe I will do based on everything I know.”

She added, “A large part of my campaign and my perspective is that in 2020 justice is on the ballot. And it is everything from having a crook in the White House to justice being on the ballot. when the average American family is a $400 unexpected expense away from complete upheaval.”

“Think about it. Hillary is still the smartest of the bunch. She’s also better known than any of the candidates, so she doesn’t need a lot of money,” Brown argued.

“Clinton is the only candidate short of Barack Obama who has the brains, the battle-tested brawn and the national presence to take out Trump. And Obama can’t run.” he said.

Brown’s latest vote of no confidence in the current Democratic field echoes his earlier pronouncements. In February, he had already declared that none of the candidates — including his former girlfriend, Kamala Harris — could beat Trump.

The Democratic candidates “all have impressive credentials, winning personalities and positive messages, but none displays the “people personality” that our media-savvy president has mastered,” Brown wrote at the time.

The most recent Public Policy Institute of California poll showed Harris in a distant fourth among likely Democratic primary voters in her home state, while former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) were locked in a dead heat for first place.

“However, among voters with a candidate preference, more than half (53%) would consider supporting another candidate,” the PPIC poll added.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), IBD-TIPP’s October poll shows.

The IBD/TIPP Poll – taken September 26 to October 3 among 900 adults (including a “subset” of 341 Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents) – showed the president edging out Warren in support from independent voters in a hypothetical general election matchup. While the poll shows Warren narrowly leading Trump overall – 48 percent to 46 percent – Trump leads Warren among independent voters by six percentage points, 49 percent to 43 percent.

Similarly, Trump leads Sanders among independent voters by four points, 48 percent to 44 percent. A head-to-head matchup shows Sanders surpassing Trump by three points overall – 49 percent to 46 percent.

Biden performs the best against Trump in a general election matchup – 51 percent to 44 percent – the survey found. However, his lead narrowed by five points from September’s poll, when he led Trump 54 percent to 42 percent.

In September, Biden saw an overwhelming amount of support from independent voters, 55 percent to Trump’s 37 percent. October’s results, however, signal a dramatic shift, with Biden narrowly leading Trump among independent voters, 46 percent to 45 percent. The poll’s margin of error is +/- 3.3 percent.

The survey also examined the Democrat primary field, which currently shows Warren leading the pack with one point over Biden, 27 percent to 26 percent. Sanders fell to a distant third with just ten percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) with seven percent support.

The poll also showed another significant drop for Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who tied with Andrew Yang (D) for fifth place with just three percent support:"

(CNN) In 1972, President Richard Nixon's administration was plagued by scandal. But not the one you're thinking of.

This was the ITT scandal. And President Donald Trump's White House would be wise to read up on it, because it just might explain the recent and sudden movement in national polls toward impeachment.

I was reminded of the ITT scandal when I noticed Trump's call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky had come the day after Special Counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress about the Russia inquiry. And then I thought about how quickly current poll numbers on impeachment are moving now, given that we saw no polling bump after Mueller's testimony.

There are many differences between the 1970s and now. But it's possible that in Nixon's case, the initial corruption allegation around the ITT scandal may have softened the ground for impeachment by the time Watergate came around -- even if the ITT scandal didn't move poll numbers at first.

If that's true, it's also possible that voters simply reach a tipping point on presidents like Nixon and Trump who can't help but run back into the fire just days after almost being burned.

In 1971, the Department of Justice was conducting an independent investigation into ITT, the technology manufacturing company founded as International Telephone & Telegraph, when Nixon told then-Deputy Attorney General Richard G. Kleindienst not to appeal one of ITT's suits to the Supreme Court.

It was no coincidence that, around the same time, the DOJ's target in the investigation assisted the Republican National Committee and the President's campaign in a big way : ITT contributed $400,000 (roughly $2.5 million in today's dollars) to the Republican National Committee for the GOP's 1972 convention.

The deal came to light about a year before Nixon's reelection. While some observers suspected there had been some sort of quid pro quo arrangement, it wasn't until a still-unknown whistleblower sent an internal memo to a syndicated columnist that things heated up. As if to emphasize the document's shadiness, the memo ended with the line: ""please destroy this, huh?""

Brit Hume , then just a scrappy young reporter working under syndicated columnist Jack Anderson, confirmed the memo's authenticity in the Washington Post, saying he'd gotten confirmation from ITT spokesperson Dita Beard. (Beard later denied that she'd offered Hume this confirmation.) Vice President Spiro Agnew was involved in the affair, holding meetings with ITT officials.

But Nixon was unchastened and persisted in his quest for reelection by whatever means necessary. His approval numbers sagged, but his support among Republicans actually increased in the early months of 1972. In fact, as the ITT scandal unfolded that spring, most polls were still predicting the President would win reelection.

The Democrats had over a dozen serious candidates vying for the nomination that year -- their most diverse field in history. More than a year out, the candidate leading the pack with an average of just under 30% in Democratic primary polls was Senator Ed Muskie, an East Coast moderate who appealed to blue-collar voters. The White House viewed Muskie as the biggest threat to the President's reelection; in early 1972, the two were tied in polls.

In response, Republicans peddled false attacks against the Democratic frontrunner, including attacks against Muskie's family. Muskie's pushback was seen as too weak in the press, and his lead began to slip. The Democrats then looked to their progressive base for a nominee.

In the meantime, Democrats in Congress were still investigating that ITT memo and sending out document requests without much success. But Nixon -- paranoid, obsessed with winning and undeterred by the continuing inquiry -- jumped back into the fire with both feet by participating in a coverup after his campaign orchestrated a break-in at the DNC headquarters at the Watergate Hotel to spy on the opposition's operations.

And this time, his deeply inept team got caught.

Nixon's most loyal supporters in the conservative media downplayed the Watergate allegations at first: ""I can see no grounds for impeachment , or even to get worked up about,"" said conservative publisher Henry Regnery. Or else they blamed the deep state, as Regnery did when writing to a friend: ""[This scandal] clearly demonstrates that the press and the bureaucracy, working together, can destroy the president.""

But public opinion in favor of impeachment started to creep upward the following year. The President talked about it endlessly at press conferences . Two and a half years after that initial ""please destroy this"" memo came to light, the President was out of a job.

While the special prosecutor's definitive report in the ITT scandal didn't find evidence of criminal conduct, the scandal, though quickly forgotten, may well have laid the foundation for Nixon's resignation.

Here's the transcript from Nixon's White House tapes of a conversation between Nixon and his Deputy Attorney General Richard G. Kleindienst in the late spring of 1971:

Nixon: ""The I.T.T. thing — stay the hell out of it. Is that clear? That's an order .... I do not want [Assistant Attorney General Richard] McLaren to run around prosecuting people, raising hell about conglomerates, stirring things up.""

After a little more back-and-forth, Kleindienst says ,""Yeah, I understand that.""

The ITT affair only became a scandal for Nixon when a reporter anonymously received the memo, which appeared to show that ITT had offered financial support for the convention in exchange for the DOJ dropping the lawsuit. (A special prosecutor found no evidence of wrongdoing by ITT.)

The story blew up in early 1972, but Kleindienst, who by then had been nominated for Attorney General, testified under oath that the White House never asked him to intervene in the case.

Polling at the time showed that 59% of Americans were following the ITT scandal and that only 24% believed Kleindienst. Even so, Kleindienst was confirmed by the Senate on June 8, 1972, and ITT faded into the background as ""a setback for the Nixon Administration...[but not] the political bombshell some Democrats hoped it might,"" as Lou Harris wrote in a polling memo at the time.

Once Nixon had dodged the ITT bullet, his reelection seemed all but assured, as he enjoyed a 20-point lead in the polls heading into the summer of 1972.

Democrats for Education Reform (DFER), a proponent of school choice, released the nationwide poll, conducted by Benenson Strategy Group, on Monday.

According to the poll results, 81 percent of Democrat primary voters, including 89 percent of black Democrat primary voters, support the proposal to “expand access to more choices and options within the public-school system,” including charter schools, which are funded with taxpayer dollars but operated by private boards.

In addition, when presented with a proposal to “put a nationwide moratorium in place to ban all federal funding for new charter schools,” only 44 percent of voters support it and 52 percent oppose it.

The poll states:

Voters know that a one-size-fits-all approach to education doesn’t work, and they support choices in the public-school system to make sure every child—no matter their background—has the chance to get a great public education at a school that puts their unique needs first.

The Benenson group conducted the poll in August-September 2019 using both phone and online interviews. Respondents were 1,721 likely 2020 voters, including an oversample of 1,227 likely Democrat primary voters. The poll’s margin of error is ±2.4.

The poll’s outcome places a spotlight on the vast disconnect between the education platform of the Democrat Party — one that remains closely aligned with the demands of the national teachers’ unions — and a plurality of its base.

Though several Democrat candidates were once staunch supporters of charter schools, as presidential candidates they have focused more on criticism of the Trump administration’s central education theme of school choice and of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.

As Education Week reports, Democrat candidates Joe Biden, Cory Booker, and Michael Bennet had all been supportive of charter schools prior to becoming presidential candidates.

In May, however, Biden said he will “not support any federal money for for-profit charter schools. Period.”

Bernie Sanders has been clear he would ban charter schools from being run by for-profit entities and would audit all existing charter schools.

Elizabeth Warren said, “Money for public schools should stay in public schools, not go anywhere else.” However, she praised the charter schools in her home state of Massachusetts as “successful, thoughtful, and innovative.”

Pete Buttigieg has said he would “take steps” to pull back on charter school expansion, while Julián Castro has said he would demand more “accountability” for charter schools than is required now due to the fact they are run independently.

Kamala Harris acted against charter schools when she was California’s attorney general and supported the Los Angeles teachers who demanded more rules for charter schools when they went out on strike in January.

Amy Klobuchar has said charter schools must meet “high standards” if they want to meet the definition of public schools.

Andrew Yang said, “I am pro-good school” during the last Democrat debate.

Beto O’Rourke has said for-profit charter schools should be banned, but, in June, said “there is a role” for them.

DFER states school choice is “in line with the Obama education legacy.”

“It’s no secret that our public schools need to be better funded, but that’s just the beginning of the story,” said Shavar Jeffries, president of DFER, and added:

The public sees that we need to more fairly fund underserved schools and pay teachers more who teach hard-to-staff subjects and serve in high-need schools. The poll findings are a call to action to continue the work started by President Obama and find ways to make our schools more equitable.

Left-wing groups, such as Planned Parenthood, the ACLU, and LGBT activist organizations, have muscled their way into charter schools in California. In 2018, the California Healthy Youth Act required comprehensive sex education (CSE) to be taught in charter schools as well as traditional public schools.

Meanwhile, some teachers’ unions have opened membership to charter school teachers. In December 2018, the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) and the American Federation of Teachers backed the nation’s first strike by charter school teachers.

However, officials from the Illinois Network of Charter Schools (INCS) criticized CTU’s involvement in the negotiations, saying the strike would restrict the independence of the charter school.

“If we accede to the idea that every unionized charter in Chicago has to have the exact same (working conditions), pretty soon we’re going to lose what the movement has contributed to the city — which is a vibrancy, a differential approach,” INCS president Andrew Broy said, according to the Chicago Tribune. “It would be a step backward for the city if we go down that path.”

The acceptance of charter schools in the education platform of the Democrat Party would likely mean a more robust attempt on its part to force charter schools to become more like traditional public schools under the banner of “accountability” for taxpayer dollars."

If elected President, Harris promises in the plan to ""put children at the center of her decision-making and treat their needs with the same urgency and importance as we treat any other national priority.""

Paid leave would be available to all workers under the proposal, including part-time employees, self-employed workers, and independent contractors. Workers would have the ability to use it for ""personal serious health conditions, caring for new children or family members with serious health conditions, or addressing medical or non-medical needs"" caused by domestic violence or sexual assault, according to the Harris campaign.

The plan would also allow low and middle-income workers making less than $75,000 a year to receive full wage replacement during their leave, and benefits would phase down for higher-income households."

""Instead of siding with Americans, politicians have stood with corporate health care, as they did when Congress barred the federal government from negotiating with pharmaceutical companies on drug prices for seniors.""

The plan, titled ""Affordable Medicine for All,"" would offset $100 to 200 billion in spending by penalizing pharmaceutical companies that raise prices by more than inflation and by increasing the annual Branded Prescription Drug Fee, a section of the Affordable Care Act that sets an annual fee according to each manufacturers share of drug sales to government programs like Medicare Part D and the VA.

Bostock v. Clayton County Georgia and Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarada were brought by homosexual men who claimed they were fired because of their sexual orientation.

R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc. v. EEOC centers on a man who was fired after he announced he had changed his name and would now be coming to work as a woman. The business’s sex-specific dress code required women to wear skirts as their work uniform.

Justice Neil Gorsuch had an exchange with David Cole, attorney for Aimee Stephens, who was William Stephens for the six years he worked at the funeral home, first as an apprentice and then as a funeral director and embalmer.

Cole said that Stephens would have been fired even if he complied with the dress code for women in the funeral home because he was a man, a clear case of sex discrimination, he argued. Gorsuch said:

I guess I — I’d just like you to have a chance to respond to Judge Lynch in his thoughtful dissent in which he lamented everything you have before us, but suggested that something as drastic a change in this country as bathrooms in every place of employment and dress codes in every place of employment that are otherwise gender neutral would be changed, that that — that that’s an essentially legislative decision.

“Judge Lynch is a very thoughtful judge and — and wrote a very thoughtful opinion that I — I think he probably regretted having to write,” Gorsuch said. “What do you say to him?”

Cole said:

I say that recognizing that transgender people have a right to exist in the workplace and not be turned away because of who they are does not end dress codes or restrooms. There are transgender lawyers in this courtroom today.

“Of course, there are,” Gorsuch said. “That’s not the question, Mr. Cole.”

“Mr. Cole, the question is a matter of the judicial role and the modesty in interpreting statutes that are old. And that’s the question he posed,” Gorsuch said.

“Nobody is questioning, and he certainly did not, the legitimacy of the claims and the importance of them,” Gorsuch said.

“The question is about judicial interpretation,” Gorsuch said. “If you wish to address it.”

Cole said that the Plaintiff was not asking to change the definition of sex as it was defined in 1964 but argued that it was because of his sex as a man who wanted “to present” as a woman that caused the termination.

Gorsuch responded that the case could be close on the “textual” review of the 1964 law but that social implications are much broader. He said:

At the end of the day, should he or she take into consideration the massive social upheaval that would be entailed in such a decision, and the possibility that — that Congress didn’t think about it. That is more effective — more appropriate a legislative rather than a judicial function?

But Cole argued transgenders are not “disruptive.”

“So, first of all, federal courts of appeals have been recognizing that discrimination against transgender people is sex discrimination for 20 years,” Cole said. “There’s been no upheaval.”

“As I was saying, there are transgender male lawyers in this courtroom following the male dress code and going to the men’s room and the Court’s dress code and sex-segregated restrooms have not fallen,” Cole added.

“So the notion that somehow this is going to be a huge upheaval, we haven’t seen that upheaval for 20 years, there’s no reason you — you would see that upheaval,” Cole said. “Transgender people follow the rule that’s associated with their gender identity.”

“It’s not disruptive,” Cole said.

In previewing the cases, Steven D. Schwinn, professor of law at the University of Illinois Chicago John Marshall Law School, said that the court’s ruling “matters deeply to the estimated 11.3 million LGBTQ adults in the United States.”

Kamala Harris (D-CA) on Monday unveiled one of the most aggressive family-leave proposals to date, featuring six months of taxpayer-funded family and medical leave.

Harris, who is floundering in both national and early primary state polls, has switched her campaign strategy on issues that “keep families up at night,” dubbing it a “3 a.m. agenda.”

Under Harris’s proposal, every worker that makes less than $75,000 per year would be entitled to full wages during the six-month absence, which is three months longer than proposals pushed by Democrat lawmakers like Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). Higher earners would also receive compensation, but less than Americans under the outlined threshold.

The plan would allow workers to take advantage of the benefit outside of traditional childcare or medical-related issues and could apply to “chosen family.”

Politico reports:

For example, Harris’ campaign said that a parent could take leave to care for a child harmed by domestic violence. It wouldn’t be limited to immediate family — workers could take leave to care for domestic partners, parents-in-law and ‘chosen family,’ among others.

The benefits would extend to part-time workers, independent contractors, and self-employed workers as well.

Harris’s plan also calls for the passage of the Child Care for Working Families Act and pledges to “create a federal inter-agency working group tasked with cutting child poverty by 50 percent in her first term.” She also calls for the expansion of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program, or “food stamps.”

Harris plans to pay for her massive family leave proposal with “new payroll taxes on employers and employees in addition to unspecified ‘general revenues,'” as well as “fines on corporations that fail to narrow their gender-based pay gaps,” Politico reports.

The proposal comes in the wake of Harris’s continued struggle to gain support in polls. IBD-TIPP’s October poll showed the presidential hopeful dropping to fifth place nationally, with just three percent support:

Kamala Harris (D-CA) said based on everything already known, she would vote to remove President Donald Trump from office in an impeachment trial in the Senate.

Harris said, “I believe this is a moment where every member of the United States Congress should take very seriously their oath to protect the Constitution of the United States. This is about defending our democracy and our system of justice because the framers imagined a moment like this, Katy, where there would be an abuse of power by one branch of government, and purposely they designed a democracy understanding it for it to be real and true and checks and balances on any excessive display of power, which means, in this case, we’re the executive branch the president has abused his power. Congress, the other, co-equal independent branch of government, must provide the check and the balance on that abuse. And that means beginning an inquiry to expose exactly what happened so there could be accountability and consequence. There is a matter of defending the very democracy that makes us and allows us to walk into rooms around the globe and have respect because perfect we may be, we actually understand the importance of not having authoritarian regimes.”

When asked if she would vote to “remove him from office,” Harris said, “Yes. Based on everything I’ve seen. Yes. I mean, look, Katy, listen, I’m a former prosecutor. And let me just tell you, as far as I’m concerned, the subject, the main subject of the impeachment which is the issue of yet again Donald Trump eliciting help from a foreign government to interfere with the election of our president of the United States, in this case, we’ve basically got a confession. We’ve got a display of conscious consciousness of guilt in an attempt to cover-up. I don’t know how much more we need but apparently a second whistle-blower, and we’re going to get more. Based on everything we know, including an admission by this president, I don’t know that it leads in any other direction except to vote yes. Which is what I believe I will do based on everything I know.”

She added, “A large part of my campaign and my perspective is that in 2020 justice is on the ballot. And it is everything from having a crook in the White House to justice being on the ballot. when the average American family is a $400 unexpected expense away from complete upheaval.”

She has worked on three Republican presidential campaigns and is an adjunct professor at George Washington University's School of Media and Public Affairs. She is a graduate of Harvard Law School. The views expressed here are the author's. Read more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) In 1972, President Richard Nixon's administration was plagued by scandal. But not the one you're thinking of.

This was the ITT scandal. And President Donald Trump's White House would be wise to read up on it, because it just might explain the recent and sudden movement in national polls toward impeachment.

I was reminded of the ITT scandal when I noticed Trump's call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky had come the day after Special Counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress about the Russia inquiry. And then I thought about how quickly current poll numbers on impeachment are moving now, given that we saw no polling bump after Mueller's testimony.

There are many differences between the 1970s and now. But it's possible that in Nixon's case, the initial corruption allegation around the ITT scandal may have softened the ground for impeachment by the time Watergate came around -- even if the ITT scandal didn't move poll numbers at first.

If that's true, it's also possible that voters simply reach a tipping point on presidents like Nixon and Trump who can't help but run back into the fire just days after almost being burned.

In 1971, the Department of Justice was conducting an independent investigation into ITT, the technology manufacturing company founded as International Telephone & Telegraph, when Nixon told then-Deputy Attorney General Richard G. Kleindienst not to appeal one of ITT's suits to the Supreme Court.

It was no coincidence that, around the same time, the DOJ's target in the investigation assisted the Republican National Committee and the President's campaign in a big way : ITT contributed $400,000 (roughly $2.5 million in today's dollars) to the Republican National Committee for the GOP's 1972 convention.

The deal came to light about a year before Nixon's reelection. While some observers suspected there had been some sort of quid pro quo arrangement, it wasn't until a still-unknown whistleblower sent an internal memo to a syndicated columnist that things heated up. As if to emphasize the document's shadiness, the memo ended with the line: ""please destroy this, huh?""

Brit Hume , then just a scrappy young reporter working under syndicated columnist Jack Anderson, confirmed the memo's authenticity in the Washington Post, saying he'd gotten confirmation from ITT spokesperson Dita Beard. (Beard later denied that she'd offered Hume this confirmation.) Vice President Spiro Agnew was involved in the affair, holding meetings with ITT officials.

But Nixon was unchastened and persisted in his quest for reelection by whatever means necessary. His approval numbers sagged, but his support among Republicans actually increased in the early months of 1972. In fact, as the ITT scandal unfolded that spring, most polls were still predicting the President would win reelection.

The Democrats had over a dozen serious candidates vying for the nomination that year -- their most diverse field in history. More than a year out, the candidate leading the pack with an average of just under 30% in Democratic primary polls was Senator Ed Muskie, an East Coast moderate who appealed to blue-collar voters. The White House viewed Muskie as the biggest threat to the President's reelection; in early 1972, the two were tied in polls.

In response, Republicans peddled false attacks against the Democratic frontrunner, including attacks against Muskie's family. Muskie's pushback was seen as too weak in the press, and his lead began to slip. The Democrats then looked to their progressive base for a nominee.

In the meantime, Democrats in Congress were still investigating that ITT memo and sending out document requests without much success. But Nixon -- paranoid, obsessed with winning and undeterred by the continuing inquiry -- jumped back into the fire with both feet by participating in a coverup after his campaign orchestrated a break-in at the DNC headquarters at the Watergate Hotel to spy on the opposition's operations.

And this time, his deeply inept team got caught.

Nixon's most loyal supporters in the conservative media downplayed the Watergate allegations at first: ""I can see no grounds for impeachment , or even to get worked up about,"" said conservative publisher Henry Regnery. Or else they blamed the deep state, as Regnery did when writing to a friend: ""[This scandal] clearly demonstrates that the press and the bureaucracy, working together, can destroy the president.""

But public opinion in favor of impeachment started to creep upward the following year. The President talked about it endlessly at press conferences . Two and a half years after that initial ""please destroy this"" memo came to light, the President was out of a job.

While the special prosecutor's definitive report in the ITT scandal didn't find evidence of criminal conduct, the scandal, though quickly forgotten, may well have laid the foundation for Nixon's resignation.

9th August 1974: U.S. President Richard Nixon looks down as stands at a podium, reading a farewell speech to his staff following his resignation, the White House, Washington, D.C. (Photo by George Tames/New York Times Co./Getty Images)

Here's the transcript from Nixon's White House tapes of a conversation between Nixon and his Deputy Attorney General Richard G. Kleindienst in the late spring of 1971:

Nixon: ""The I.T.T. thing — stay the hell out of it. Is that clear? That's an order .... I do not want [Assistant Attorney General Richard] McLaren to run around prosecuting people, raising hell about conglomerates, stirring things up.""

After a little more back-and-forth, Kleindienst says ,""Yeah, I understand that.""

The ITT affair only became a scandal for Nixon when a reporter anonymously received the memo, which appeared to show that ITT had offered financial support for the convention in exchange for the DOJ dropping the lawsuit. (A special prosecutor found no evidence of wrongdoing by ITT.)

The story blew up in early 1972, but Kleindienst, who by then had been nominated for Attorney General, testified under oath that the White House never asked him to intervene in the case.

Polling at the time showed that 59% of Americans were following the ITT scandal and that only 24% believed Kleindienst. Even so, Kleindienst was confirmed by the Senate on June 8, 1972, and ITT faded into the background as ""a setback for the Nixon Administration...[but not] the political bombshell some Democrats hoped it might,"" as Lou Harris wrote in a polling memo at the time.

Once Nixon had dodged the ITT bullet, his reelection seemed all but assured, as he enjoyed a 20-point lead in the polls heading into the summer of 1972.

Democrats for Education Reform (DFER), a proponent of school choice, released the nationwide poll, conducted by Benenson Strategy Group, on Monday.

According to the poll results, 81 percent of Democrat primary voters, including 89 percent of black Democrat primary voters, support the proposal to “expand access to more choices and options within the public-school system,” including charter schools, which are funded with taxpayer dollars but operated by private boards.

In addition, when presented with a proposal to “put a nationwide moratorium in place to ban all federal funding for new charter schools,” only 44 percent of voters support it and 52 percent oppose it.

The poll states:

Voters know that a one-size-fits-all approach to education doesn’t work, and they support choices in the public-school system to make sure every child—no matter their background—has the chance to get a great public education at a school that puts their unique needs first.

The Benenson group conducted the poll in August-September 2019 using both phone and online interviews. Respondents were 1,721 likely 2020 voters, including an oversample of 1,227 likely Democrat primary voters. The poll’s margin of error is ±2.4.

The poll’s outcome places a spotlight on the vast disconnect between the education platform of the Democrat Party — one that remains closely aligned with the demands of the national teachers’ unions — and a plurality of its base.

Though several Democrat candidates were once staunch supporters of charter schools, as presidential candidates they have focused more on criticism of the Trump administration’s central education theme of school choice and of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.

As Education Week reports, Democrat candidates Joe Biden, Cory Booker, and Michael Bennet had all been supportive of charter schools prior to becoming presidential candidates.

In May, however, Biden said he will “not support any federal money for for-profit charter schools. Period.”

Bernie Sanders has been clear he would ban charter schools from being run by for-profit entities and would audit all existing charter schools.

Elizabeth Warren said, “Money for public schools should stay in public schools, not go anywhere else.” However, she praised the charter schools in her home state of Massachusetts as “successful, thoughtful, and innovative.”

Pete Buttigieg has said he would “take steps” to pull back on charter school expansion, while Julián Castro has said he would demand more “accountability” for charter schools than is required now due to the fact they are run independently.

Kamala Harris acted against charter schools when she was California’s attorney general and supported the Los Angeles teachers who demanded more rules for charter schools when they went out on strike in January.

Amy Klobuchar has said charter schools must meet “high standards” if they want to meet the definition of public schools.

Andrew Yang said, “I am pro-good school” during the last Democrat debate.

Beto O’Rourke has said for-profit charter schools should be banned, but, in June, said “there is a role” for them.

DFER states school choice is “in line with the Obama education legacy.”

“It’s no secret that our public schools need to be better funded, but that’s just the beginning of the story,” said Shavar Jeffries, president of DFER, and added:

The public sees that we need to more fairly fund underserved schools and pay teachers more who teach hard-to-staff subjects and serve in high-need schools. The poll findings are a call to action to continue the work started by President Obama and find ways to make our schools more equitable.

Left-wing groups, such as Planned Parenthood, the ACLU, and LGBT activist organizations, have muscled their way into charter schools in California. In 2018, the California Healthy Youth Act required comprehensive sex education (CSE) to be taught in charter schools as well as traditional public schools.

Meanwhile, some teachers’ unions have opened membership to charter school teachers. In December 2018, the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) and the American Federation of Teachers backed the nation’s first strike by charter school teachers.

However, officials from the Illinois Network of Charter Schools (INCS) criticized CTU’s involvement in the negotiations, saying the strike would restrict the independence of the charter school.

“If we accede to the idea that every unionized charter in Chicago has to have the exact same (working conditions), pretty soon we’re going to lose what the movement has contributed to the city — which is a vibrancy, a differential approach,” INCS president Andrew Broy said, according to the Chicago Tribune. “It would be a step backward for the city if we go down that path.”

The acceptance of charter schools in the education platform of the Democrat Party would likely mean a more robust attempt on its part to force charter schools to become more like traditional public schools under the banner of “accountability” for taxpayer dollars."

Cutting admitted in court that she stabbed Cannon to death in the off-campus apartment they shared near Radford University in Virginia.

Before the murder, Cutting had been ingesting a cocktail of drugs, including cocaine, mushrooms, marijuana, Adderall, and Xanax, according to the report.

In her confession to the police, Cutting allegedly rambled about the Apocalypse and recited the Hail Mary several times in Spanish. She also reportedly tried to shove her fist into her mouth, causing jail personnel to take her to a mental health facility for a week, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported.

Cutting offered a brief statement during her sentencing Monday, expressing remorse for the killing.

“There are no words for this tragedy and my heart is filled with sorrow and grief,” she said.

Before the stabbing, Cannon wrote glowing social media posts about her friend, at one point praising her for her accomplishments in school.

“I met this girl two years ago online and somehow we ended up living across from each other for a year, this summer she was equivalent to my mom in Cancun. And unimaginably she still puts up with me and now we’re living together next year. Love you more Lu and everyone pray that we don’t kill each other this year,” Cannon said on Instagram in March, according to the New York Post.

“So incredibly proud of my best friend, Luisa Cutting for becoming Latinos Student Alliance’s President! I know you’re going to be amazing with everything you do! Love you more!!” Cannon wrote.

“Love you so so much,” Cutting wrote in response to Cannon’s Facebook post, according to the New York Post."

The case, R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. EEOC, centers around former employee Aimee Stephens, who originally agreed to the sex-specific dress code of the establishment but later decided he wanted to present himself as a woman. Stephens was fired, and the ACLU accused Rost of discrimination.

Business owner Thomas Rost said that is not the case and spoke after the Supreme Court heard the case.

“Americans and American businesses should be able to rely on what the law says,” Rost said. “We’re hoping the Supreme Court will uphold that basic right for everyone.

“Our business exists to serve grieving families. There is no time in life more difficult than after losing a loved one,” he continued.

“Our company has a professional code of conduct and sex-specific dress code to ensure families can focus on processing their grief,” he explained.

Rost said he hired a male funeral director who agreed to the code of conduct and sex-specific dress code in 2007. Nearly six years later, the employee penned a letter, indicating that he wanted to violate the dress code and present himself as a female.

“I felt deep concern for the employee. I care about all the people who work for me. They’re part of my family. That’s why I intervened to save the employee’s job a few months earlier,” he said.

He reiterated that his business created the dress code for grieving families and determined that it was in the best interest of those families to reject the employee’s request, describing it as a “difficult choice.”

Even though Rost acted in accord with federal law, the ACLU targeted his business.

“The ACLU is trying to use my grandfather’s business as a pawn to achieve a larger political goal that it has been unable to achieve in Congress, where this issue belongs,” he said.

“We’re hopeful that the Supreme Court won’t impose such unjust punishment on us,” he continued. “All of us should be able to rely on what the law says.”"

""We're not just doing town halls,"" Deidre DeJear, Iowa state chair for the Harris campaign, told CNN. ""We're giving her an opportunity to meet Iowans to hear more of their stories and hear more of their most intimate details about what's going on in their lives.""

The debate will air live exclusively on MSNBC, and will livestream on NBC News and MSNBC digital platforms and on The Washington Post's web and mobile apps, according to the DNC. The venue, format and moderators will be announced at a future date.

The candidates who have met the thresholds to qualify for the November debate so far include: Former Vice President Joe Biden, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, billionaire Tom Steyer, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and businessman Andrew Yang.

Last month, the DNC raised the polling and donor thresholds required to qualify for the November debate. Candidates will have to reach 3% in at least four DNC-approved polls of Democratic voters nationally or in one of the four early-voting states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. The change is a 1 percentage point increase over the threshold for the September and October debates. Candidates also have a new option of reaching at least 5% in two polls of the early-voting states.

Candidates hoping to qualify need contributions from at least 165,000 individuals, coming from at least 600 unique donors in 20 or more states. The deadline for qualifying polls and donations for the November debate will be November 13 at 11:59 p.m., according to the DNC.

But is she seriously eyeing another run?,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/09/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-2020/index.html,"(CNN) Hillary Clinton fired off another taunting tweet to President Donald Trump on Thursday, saying, ""It's becoming a challenge to keep up with the high crimes and misdemeanors.""

Clinton is carefully following the daily developments in the ongoing impeachment drama -- and is having fun at her former rival's expense -- but that doesn't mean she is seriously weighing another run for president, several of her friends and advisers tell CNN.

Clinton's recent reentry into the public sphere after months out of the limelight has led to speculation that she could be seriously considering a rematch with Trump. Those questions have been stoked by Clinton herself, who responded to a recent Trump tweet about her running again by simply saying, ""Don't tempt me, "" and joked with PBS' Judy Woodruff about a possible round two with the President.

""Maybe there does need to be a rematch,"" Clinton said jokingly. ""Obviously, I can beat him again."" Clinton bested Trump in the popular vote, but fell short in the Electoral College.

But Clinton's reemergence is more a product of fortuitous timing and feeling unencumbered than a genuine exploration of a 2020 run.

""No,"" said longtime Clinton friend and former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, when asked if Clinton is considering a run in 2020. ""I think she is having the time of her life and speaking her mind.""

McAuliffe, who was chair of Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, added: ""It drives Trump crazy. ... Trump and his massive ego cannot get over the fact that Hillary Clinton got 3 million more votes than he got. It drives him absolutely mad, so she is having fun shooting back at him.""

For Clinton, the moment is a twofold opportunity: promoting her book and taunting Trump. And friends who have spent time with her in recent weeks say she's enjoying both in equal measures.

""Yes, she loves taunting him. As much now as ever,"" a person close to Clinton told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. ""She's having fun, but that doesn't mean she's going to run again.""

Clinton, after writing ""The Book of Gutsy Women: Favorite Stories of Courage and Resilience"" with her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, was always planning a lengthy book tour. Little did she know, however, that she would kick off the tour mere hours before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the beginning of an impeachment inquiry into Trump.

That unexpected timing, aides said, meant Clinton was going to be far more public at the same time that Trump's presidency faced its most existential threat. Trump continues to bring up Clinton, tweeting about her regularly and often using questions around her email use as secretary of state to deflect from questions about his own legal issues.

Nick Merrill, Clinton's longtime spokesman, said the former nominee is ""not going to take (Trump's attacks) lying down.""

""She is out on a book tour,"" Merrill said, ""and she is having a little fun.""

One longtime loyal supporter said Clinton's jabs at Trump have created a fear among those close to her that she could ultimately consider a rematch, which many people believe would end badly for her.

""A lot of people are talking to her, which isn't helpful,"" another person close to Clinton told CNN. ""They get into her head because she so dislikes Donald Trump that she can't see straight.""

All of this chatter -- much of which comes from longtime Clinton donors -- is focused on the notion of a rematch with Trump. Of course, should she decide to run -- again, highly unlikely -- she would face a Democratic primary fight in a far different landscape than the 2016 campaign.

""Sure, she thinks about it,"" said McAuliffe of another Clinton presidential run, ""but she is also realistic.""

Still, some friends email her political gambling sites, showing her with a strong chance of defeating Trump. Newspaper columns floating the idea of her running always make their way into her inbox, including one last week from former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown.

""She feels vindicated on everything she felt during the campaign,"" a person close to Clinton said. ""She's been proven right. Does that mean she will run again? No.""

A longtime confidante put it more bluntly: ""She is NOT running.""

Clinton has, however, been directly involved with the 2020 race and is deeply immersed in its day-to-day machinations. She keeps up with the swirl of news around the large field of Democrats vying to take on Trump and, according to advisers, has talked to nearly all of the 2020 Democrats.

That includes recent conversations with former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the race's two front-runners, as well as in-person meetings with candidates like Sen. Kamala Harris of California, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and others. Clinton has not talked to Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an adviser said, who is running for the nomination again after challenging Clinton in 2016.

While Clinton has been involved in the 2020 primary behind the scenes, she does not plan to endorse in the contest, people close to her said.

Clinton's recent bluntness has been a stark break from how she was as a candidate in 2016, where she was more guarded and careful.

This shift was recently made clear when, during a book tour interview, Clinton replied to a question about the gutsiest thing she ever did with an answer that took even some of her advisers by surprise.

""I think the gutsiest thing I've ever done -- well, personally -- make the decision to stay in my marriage,"" Clinton told ABC, referring to her husband, then-President Bill Clinton, having an affair with then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky in the 1990s.

""She feels unconstrained, free to speak her mind,"" said Merrill. ""Watch her on this book tour. It's liberating.""

This story has been updated with Hillary Clinton's tweet from Thursday."

Federal data obtained by Breitbart News reveals that since August, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency has deported more than 2,500 illegal aliens who arrived as a family unit at the southern border and have final orders for removal.

Over these two months, ICE agents arrested another 275 illegal aliens who arrived as family units at the border. All of these illegal aliens arrested have final orders for removal, meaning they have gone through the asylum and immigration courts and have been found not to be eligible to stay in the U.S.

Compare these deportation numbers to that of Fiscal Year 2018, when ICE deported 2,711 illegal aliens who arrived as family units at the border for the entire year.

This indicates that about 226 illegal aliens claiming to be part of a family unit were deported every month last year compared to about 1,250 deported each month in August and September of this year — a more than 453 percent increase in illegal family unit deportations based on monthly totals.

As Breitbart News has reported, research finds that deporting the 11 to 22 million illegal aliens saves American taxpayers billions compared to the costs they are forced to pay when illegal aliens are allowed to stay.

Deporting every illegal alien in the country would amount to a cost savings of about $622 billion over the course of a lifetime. This indicates that deporting illegal aliens is six times less costly than what it costs American taxpayers to currently subsidize the millions of illegal aliens living in the U.S.

Mass deportations are supported by a majority of American voters, a July Harvard/Harris Poll finds. Overall, 51 percent of voters said they support mass deportations of the illegal alien population, including more than eight-in-ten GOP voters and more than five-in-ten swing voters.

Bostock v. Clayton County Georgia and Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarada were brought by homosexual men who claimed they were fired because of their sexual orientation.

R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc. v. EEOC centers on a man who was fired after he announced he had changed his name and would now be coming to work as a woman. The business’s sex-specific dress code required women to wear skirts as their work uniform.

Justice Neil Gorsuch had an exchange with David Cole, attorney for Aimee Stephens, who was William Stephens for the six years he worked at the funeral home, first as an apprentice and then as a funeral director and embalmer.

Cole said that Stephens would have been fired even if he complied with the dress code for women in the funeral home because he was a man, a clear case of sex discrimination, he argued. Gorsuch said:

I guess I — I’d just like you to have a chance to respond to Judge Lynch in his thoughtful dissent in which he lamented everything you have before us, but suggested that something as drastic a change in this country as bathrooms in every place of employment and dress codes in every place of employment that are otherwise gender neutral would be changed, that that — that that’s an essentially legislative decision.

“Judge Lynch is a very thoughtful judge and — and wrote a very thoughtful opinion that I — I think he probably regretted having to write,” Gorsuch said. “What do you say to him?”

Cole said:

I say that recognizing that transgender people have a right to exist in the workplace and not be turned away because of who they are does not end dress codes or restrooms. There are transgender lawyers in this courtroom today.

“Of course, there are,” Gorsuch said. “That’s not the question, Mr. Cole.”

“Mr. Cole, the question is a matter of the judicial role and the modesty in interpreting statutes that are old. And that’s the question he posed,” Gorsuch said.

“Nobody is questioning, and he certainly did not, the legitimacy of the claims and the importance of them,” Gorsuch said.

“The question is about judicial interpretation,” Gorsuch said. “If you wish to address it.”

Cole said that the Plaintiff was not asking to change the definition of sex as it was defined in 1964 but argued that it was because of his sex as a man who wanted “to present” as a woman that caused the termination.

Gorsuch responded that the case could be close on the “textual” review of the 1964 law but that social implications are much broader. He said:

At the end of the day, should he or she take into consideration the massive social upheaval that would be entailed in such a decision, and the possibility that — that Congress didn’t think about it. That is more effective — more appropriate a legislative rather than a judicial function?

But Cole argued transgenders are not “disruptive.”

“So, first of all, federal courts of appeals have been recognizing that discrimination against transgender people is sex discrimination for 20 years,” Cole said. “There’s been no upheaval.”

“As I was saying, there are transgender male lawyers in this courtroom following the male dress code and going to the men’s room and the Court’s dress code and sex-segregated restrooms have not fallen,” Cole added.

“So the notion that somehow this is going to be a huge upheaval, we haven’t seen that upheaval for 20 years, there’s no reason you — you would see that upheaval,” Cole said. “Transgender people follow the rule that’s associated with their gender identity.”

“It’s not disruptive,” Cole said.

In previewing the cases, Steven D. Schwinn, professor of law at the University of Illinois Chicago John Marshall Law School, said that the court’s ruling “matters deeply to the estimated 11.3 million LGBTQ adults in the United States.”

But “employers, the government and their amici argue that the plaintiff’s reading of Title VII would so ‘expand’ the concept of “sex” that employers would not know show to comply, and courts would not know how to enforce it.”

Schwinn wrote:

Moreover, the defendants and their amici argue that the plaintiffs’ reading of Title VII could mean the end of things like sex-specific restrooms and locker rooms and this could actually undermine Title VII by threatening other sex specific practices and institutions that are designed to provide an equal playing field between men and women.

These cases are Bostock v. Clayton County Georgia, No. 17-1618, Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda, No. 17-1623, and R.G. &G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc. v. EEOC, No. 18-107 in the Supreme Court of the United States.

Kamala Harris (D-CA) on Monday unveiled one of the most aggressive family-leave proposals to date, featuring six months of taxpayer-funded family and medical leave.

Harris, who is floundering in both national and early primary state polls, has switched her campaign strategy on issues that “keep families up at night,” dubbing it a “3 a.m. agenda.”

Under Harris’s proposal, every worker that makes less than $75,000 per year would be entitled to full wages during the six-month absence, which is three months longer than proposals pushed by Democrat lawmakers like Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). Higher earners would also receive compensation, but less than Americans under the outlined threshold.

The plan would allow workers to take advantage of the benefit outside of traditional childcare or medical-related issues and could apply to “chosen family.”

Politico reports:

For example, Harris’ campaign said that a parent could take leave to care for a child harmed by domestic violence. It wouldn’t be limited to immediate family — workers could take leave to care for domestic partners, parents-in-law and ‘chosen family,’ among others.

The benefits would extend to part-time workers, independent contractors, and self-employed workers as well.

Harris’s plan also calls for the passage of the Child Care for Working Families Act and pledges to “create a federal inter-agency working group tasked with cutting child poverty by 50 percent in her first term.” She also calls for the expansion of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program, or “food stamps.”

Harris plans to pay for her massive family leave proposal with “new payroll taxes on employers and employees in addition to unspecified ‘general revenues,'” as well as “fines on corporations that fail to narrow their gender-based pay gaps,” Politico reports.

The proposal comes in the wake of Harris’s continued struggle to gain support in polls. IBD-TIPP’s October poll showed the presidential hopeful dropping to fifth place nationally, with just three percent support:

A social housing project in Norwich , England, hailed as a ""modest masterpiece,"" has won the prestigious Stirling Prize architecture award.

Goldsmith Street, made up of almost 100 ultra-low-energy homes for Norwich City Council and built in seven terraced blocks, was designed by London-based Mikhail Riches with Cathy Hawley.

The Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), which launched the annual prize in 1996, announced this year's winner on Tuesday night.

Goldsmith Street consists of rows of two-story houses, bookended by three-story flats.

The architects took inspiration from Victorian streets in the nearby ""Golden Triangle"" district.

The competition judges, chaired by Julia Barfield, said: ""Goldsmith Street is a modest masterpiece. It is high-quality architecture in its purest, most environmentally and socially conscious form.""

""This is proper social housing, over ten years in the making, delivered by an ambitious and thoughtful council. These desirable, spacious, low-energy properties should be the norm for all council housing,"" the judges added.

The development is designed to the stringent Passivhaus standard, which means homes will use very little additional energy for heating or cooling.

Architects took inspiration from nearby Victorian streets. Credit: Tim Crocker/RIBA

Annual energy costs for homes designed to the standard are estimated to be 70% lower than for the average household, according to the RIBA.

In order to ensure the windows echoed Victorian proportions but also met the standard, the architects developed a recessed feature, thereby giving the impression of a larger opening, but with a limited amount of glass.

Letterboxes were also built externally so that front doors would not let in drafts.

Each flat has its own front door, ""generous"" lobby space for prams and bikes, and a private balcony, the RIBA said.

More than a quarter of the space is communal and a walkway connects residents' gardens.

Parking has been placed on the periphery, ""ensuring that people own the streets, not their cars,"" the RIBA added.

Councilor Gail Harris, Norwich City Council's cabinet member for social housing, said: ""This is an incredibly proud moment for Norwich, our strong history of building social housing and our ambitions to raise environmental standards.""

Goldsmith Street beat five other nominees on the shortlist to scoop the prize. These included an opera house in Leicestershire, the Macallan Distillery in Scotland and the revamped London Bridge train station."

If Trump recounts a story in which an unnamed person addresses him as ""sir,"" the story is usually false in some way.

In recent weeks, Trump has been telling a new ""sir"" story.

""When I took over our military, we didn't have ammunition,"" Trump said Monday . ""I was told by a top general -- maybe the top of them all -- 'Sir, I'm sorry. Sir, we don't have ammunition.' I said, 'I'll never let another president have that happen to him or her.' We didn't have ammunition.""

As you may have suspected from the two ""sir""s or from the substance of the story, Trump's claim is a severe exaggeration.

While we can't be sure what a general might have privately told Trump -- and though we couldn't reach former Defense Secretary James Mattis, whom Trump named as the general in a September version of the story -- it's clearly not true that the world's most powerful military simply ""didn't have ammunition"" when he was inaugurated in January 2017.

""No general or admiral would say this,"" Hertling said in an email. ""They might say they have concerns, or if they were asked to attack a country (say, for instance, North Korea), that a major constraint would be they didn't have the right amount of ammunition to hit all targets (like, say, all the 10,000 artillery pieces hidden in caves in North Korea, or all the potential rocket sites), but then they would give their requirements.""

As Hertling noted, however, there are some real facts underlying the dubious tale.

What the military has said about munitions levels

According to military leaders, there was a shortfall in certain kinds of munitions, particularly precision-guided bombs, late in the Obama presidency and early in the Trump presidency -- after the US used tens of thousands of these munitions in the campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.

Obama administration Defense Secretary Ash Carter said in February 2016 : ""We've recently been hitting ISIL with so many GPS-guided smart bombs and laser-guided rockets that we are starting to run low on the ones that we use against terrorists the most. So we're investing $1.8 billion in (fiscal year 2017) to buy over 45,000 more of them.""

Adm. Harry Harris, commander of the Navy's Pacific Command, told Congress in April 2017 : ""Critical munitions shortfalls are my top warfighting concern ... We are short in 'here-and-now' basic munitions like small diameter bombs.""

And in a December 2018 speech in which Mattis touted military progress under Trump, he said there had been ""munition shortages"" two years prior.

Critics of US military intervention abroad might note that one way the US could address a bomb shortage is by doing less bombing. Regardless, Trump wasn't making the whole thing up: Military leaders did make clear that they thought that the US was lower on certain munitions than it should be, though none of them publicly said anything like ""we don't have ammunition.""

How bad was it?

It has never been clear how dire or how unusual the perceived shortage was, since the military does not release comprehensive data about ammunition levels. Michael O'Hanlon, a Brookings Institution senior fellow who specializes in defense strategy, said ""no claims like Trump's should be taken at face value,"" but that we don't have the information to assess his claims in depth.

""The military generally does have some 'shortages' of ammunition, relative to formal goals and preferred levels, at any given time -- more often than not,"" O'Hanlon said in an email.

Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic & International Studies, said that while inventories of some munitions, like Hellfire missiles and Joint Direct Attack Munitions, were ""stretched thin"" from heavy use in the ISIS conflict and in Afghanistan, the Defense Department ""has requested (and received) more money to restock its inventories, and the manufacturers of these weapons have ramped up production to fill these new orders.""

""So while it was a concern, it never became an operational issue as far as I can tell,"" Harrison said in an email.

Harrison's assessment is supported by a 2017 article in which Air Force Col. Randall Ackerman, a spokesman for the Joint Staff, told US News & World Report , ""We are currently able to mitigate shortages within combatant commands by managing the redistribution of munitions according to requirements and needs."" A spokesman for the campaign against ISIS also said at the time that the mission ""is not affected because of a lack of munitions.""

Lt. Gen. Aundre Piggee, Army deputy chief of staff for logistics, told Congress in March 2017 that while ""today I think we have adequate munitions for our normal requirements,"" he would be ""very concerned with our current stockage of munitions"" if ""we had to surge, if we had contingency operations and if there continues to be emerging threats we see around the world,"" Defense News reported

Hertling explained that there is ""ALWAYS concern"" about having insufficient ammunition to fight multiple wars simultaneously; this, he said, is not an issue that will go away.

""The truth of the matter is that there isn't enough to go around, and when priorities are shifted it would be a logistics challenge to get the right type and right amount of ammo (and other logistics/equipment) to the commander who found himself in a fight,"" he said."

Luisa Ines Tudela Harris Cutting, 21, pleaded guilty on Monday to murdering Alexa Cannon, 20, and was sentenced to 20 years behind bars, the Roanoke Times reported.

Cutting admitted in court that she stabbed Cannon to death in the off-campus apartment they shared near Radford University in Virginia.

Before the murder, Cutting had been ingesting a cocktail of drugs, including cocaine, mushrooms, marijuana, Adderall, and Xanax, according to the report.

In her confession to the police, Cutting allegedly rambled about the Apocalypse and recited the Hail Mary several times in Spanish. She also reportedly tried to shove her fist into her mouth, causing jail personnel to take her to a mental health facility for a week, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported.

Cutting offered a brief statement during her sentencing Monday, expressing remorse for the killing.

“There are no words for this tragedy and my heart is filled with sorrow and grief,” she said.

Before the stabbing, Cannon wrote glowing social media posts about her friend, at one point praising her for her accomplishments in school.

“I met this girl two years ago online and somehow we ended up living across from each other for a year, this summer she was equivalent to my mom in Cancun. And unimaginably she still puts up with me and now we’re living together next year. Love you more Lu and everyone pray that we don’t kill each other this year,” Cannon said on Instagram in March, according to the New York Post.

“So incredibly proud of my best friend, Luisa Cutting for becoming Latinos Student Alliance’s President! I know you’re going to be amazing with everything you do! Love you more!!” Cannon wrote.

The case, R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. EEOC, centers around former employee Aimee Stephens, who originally agreed to the sex-specific dress code of the establishment but later decided he wanted to present himself as a woman. Stephens was fired, and the ACLU accused Rost of discrimination.

Business owner Thomas Rost said that is not the case and spoke after the Supreme Court heard the case.

“Americans and American businesses should be able to rely on what the law says,” Rost said. “We’re hoping the Supreme Court will uphold that basic right for everyone.

“Our business exists to serve grieving families. There is no time in life more difficult than after losing a loved one,” he continued.

“Our company has a professional code of conduct and sex-specific dress code to ensure families can focus on processing their grief,” he explained.

Rost said he hired a male funeral director who agreed to the code of conduct and sex-specific dress code in 2007. Nearly six years later, the employee penned a letter, indicating that he wanted to violate the dress code and present himself as a female.

“I felt deep concern for the employee. I care about all the people who work for me. They’re part of my family. That’s why I intervened to save the employee’s job a few months earlier,” he said.

He reiterated that his business created the dress code for grieving families and determined that it was in the best interest of those families to reject the employee’s request, describing it as a “difficult choice.”

Even though Rost acted in accord with federal law, the ACLU targeted his business.

“The ACLU is trying to use my grandfather’s business as a pawn to achieve a larger political goal that it has been unable to achieve in Congress, where this issue belongs,” he said.

“We’re hopeful that the Supreme Court won’t impose such unjust punishment on us,” he continued. “All of us should be able to rely on what the law says.”"

Steyer continued: ""When I think about why I started the need to impeach campaign two years ago, yeah, he's a criminal, it's true that he more than has earned impeachment, but it goes much beyond this and it goes to exactly this kind of issue.

The nation's first memorial for more than 4,000 victims of lynchings opened last year there.

But is she seriously eyeing another run?,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/09/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-2020/index.html,"(CNN) Hillary Clinton fired off another taunting tweet to President Donald Trump on Thursday, saying, ""It's becoming a challenge to keep up with the high crimes and misdemeanors.""

Clinton is carefully following the daily developments in the ongoing impeachment drama -- and is having fun at her former rival's expense -- but that doesn't mean she is seriously weighing another run for president, several of her friends and advisers tell CNN.

Clinton's recent reentry into the public sphere after months out of the limelight has led to speculation that she could be seriously considering a rematch with Trump. Those questions have been stoked by Clinton herself, who responded to a recent Trump tweet about her running again by simply saying, ""Don't tempt me, "" and joked with PBS' Judy Woodruff about a possible round two with the President.

""Maybe there does need to be a rematch,"" Clinton said jokingly. ""Obviously, I can beat him again."" Clinton bested Trump in the popular vote, but fell short in the Electoral College.

But Clinton's reemergence is more a product of fortuitous timing and feeling unencumbered than a genuine exploration of a 2020 run.

""No,"" said longtime Clinton friend and former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, when asked if Clinton is considering a run in 2020. ""I think she is having the time of her life and speaking her mind.""

McAuliffe, who was chair of Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, added: ""It drives Trump crazy. ... Trump and his massive ego cannot get over the fact that Hillary Clinton got 3 million more votes than he got. It drives him absolutely mad, so she is having fun shooting back at him.""

For Clinton, the moment is a twofold opportunity: promoting her book and taunting Trump. And friends who have spent time with her in recent weeks say she's enjoying both in equal measures.

""Yes, she loves taunting him. As much now as ever,"" a person close to Clinton told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. ""She's having fun, but that doesn't mean she's going to run again.""

Clinton, after writing ""The Book of Gutsy Women: Favorite Stories of Courage and Resilience"" with her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, was always planning a lengthy book tour. Little did she know, however, that she would kick off the tour mere hours before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the beginning of an impeachment inquiry into Trump.

That unexpected timing, aides said, meant Clinton was going to be far more public at the same time that Trump's presidency faced its most existential threat. Trump continues to bring up Clinton, tweeting about her regularly and often using questions around her email use as secretary of state to deflect from questions about his own legal issues.

Nick Merrill, Clinton's longtime spokesman, said the former nominee is ""not going to take (Trump's attacks) lying down.""

""She is out on a book tour,"" Merrill said, ""and she is having a little fun.""

One longtime loyal supporter said Clinton's jabs at Trump have created a fear among those close to her that she could ultimately consider a rematch, which many people believe would end badly for her.

""A lot of people are talking to her, which isn't helpful,"" another person close to Clinton told CNN. ""They get into her head because she so dislikes Donald Trump that she can't see straight.""

All of this chatter -- much of which comes from longtime Clinton donors -- is focused on the notion of a rematch with Trump. Of course, should she decide to run -- again, highly unlikely -- she would face a Democratic primary fight in a far different landscape than the 2016 campaign.

""Sure, she thinks about it,"" said McAuliffe of another Clinton presidential run, ""but she is also realistic.""

Still, some friends email her political gambling sites, showing her with a strong chance of defeating Trump. Newspaper columns floating the idea of her running always make their way into her inbox, including one last week from former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown.

""She feels vindicated on everything she felt during the campaign,"" a person close to Clinton said. ""She's been proven right. Does that mean she will run again? No.""

A longtime confidante put it more bluntly: ""She is NOT running.""

Clinton has, however, been directly involved with the 2020 race and is deeply immersed in its day-to-day machinations. She keeps up with the swirl of news around the large field of Democrats vying to take on Trump and, according to advisers, has talked to nearly all of the 2020 Democrats.

That includes recent conversations with former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the race's two front-runners, as well as in-person meetings with candidates like Sen. Kamala Harris of California, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and others. Clinton has not talked to Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an adviser said, who is running for the nomination again after challenging Clinton in 2016.

While Clinton has been involved in the 2020 primary behind the scenes, she does not plan to endorse in the contest, people close to her said.

Clinton's recent bluntness has been a stark break from how she was as a candidate in 2016, where she was more guarded and careful.

This shift was recently made clear when, during a book tour interview, Clinton replied to a question about the gutsiest thing she ever did with an answer that took even some of her advisers by surprise.

""I think the gutsiest thing I've ever done -- well, personally -- make the decision to stay in my marriage,"" Clinton told ABC, referring to her husband, then-President Bill Clinton, having an affair with then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky in the 1990s.

""She feels unconstrained, free to speak her mind,"" said Merrill. ""Watch her on this book tour. It's liberating.""

This story has been updated with Hillary Clinton's tweet from Thursday."

But she still needs to win over black voters,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/10/politics/elizabeth-warren-black-voters/index.html,"Charleston, South Carolina (CNN) At an annual awards dinner hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington, DC, last month, Rev. Jesse Jackson watched as a stream of attendees walked over to one 2020 Democratic candidate, looking to shake her hand, chat and take a photo together.

It was Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , being approached ""all night long,"" Jackson said: ""People coming across the room to get a picture.""

The overwhelmingly positive reception that Warren received at the black-tie CBC gala wasn't the first time the senator has stood out this year at a forum of a largely black audience. Warren received a standing ovation at the ""She The People"" conference this summer as she presented her idea for bringing down the maternal mortality rate among black women ; in June, Jackson lavished her with praise at the Rainbow Push conference; and Warren appeared to be a crowd favorite at Al Sharpton's National Action Network conference in April, when she spoke about the acute challenges facing African-American homeowners.

But as Warren continues a steady climb in the national polls and now shares the front-runner status with former Vice President Joe Biden, Warren confronts a tough political reality. Those standout moments, coupled with public praise from African American leaders and activists, have yet to fully translate to support among black voters

According to a Quinnipiac national poll released on Tuesday, Warren is the top-choice candidate for 20% of black Democratic or Democratic-leaning voters. It is a notable improvement from the 10% support Warren had among black voters in an August Quinnipiac survey, but Biden still remains well ahead in support among blacks, at 36%.

Whether Warren can continue to improve her standing with this critical demographic group will be particularly important in the early voting state of South Carolina. A recent CNN poll showed Biden with a strong lead in the state, with the support of 45% of black likely primary voters. The same survey showed Warren with only 4% support among black voters in the state.

In an earlier Quinnipiac poll released at the end of September, seven in 10 black voters said they would be ""excited"" if Warren were the Democratic nominee, and 60% said they had a favorable view of the senator. But around two in 10 black voters said they still had not heard enough about Warren to have a favorable or unfavorable view of her. In contrast, 70% of those black voters said they had a favorable view of Biden, and only 5% said they hadn't heard enough about the former vice president to have a positive or negative opinion of him.

It has not gone unnoticed that some of Warren's events in South Carolina have featured largely white audiences. And despite the warm reception at the CBC dinner, Warren has not received endorsements from any black lawmakers in that caucus, unlike Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris.

On Wednesday, after another ""walking tour"" through a Charleston, South Carolina, neighborhood, Warren held a roundtable meeting with local residents, activists and leaders.

Asked by CNN how she would win over black voters who are far more familiar with Biden, Warren responded: ""I'm showing up, because I think that's really important -- showing up and shaking hands and talking with people.""

State Sen. Marlon Kimpson, who joined Warren in the discussion and applauded her for visiting his constituents, told reporters that he believes Biden has a ""head start"" with black voters because of name recognition.

""But I caution all candidates: Things in the rear mirror are closer than they appear. It's a wide-open race, there are some built-in advantages based on name recognition, but all candidates including the vice president has to make the case,"" said Kimpson, who has not yet made an endorsement.

According to Jackson, who himself ran for President twice in the 1980s, he and Warren speak ""quite often."" The civil rights activists told CNN in an interview the senator has reached out to him periodically as she has mounted a bid for the White House.

""She appears to be fearless,"" Jackson said. He has not endorsed in the Democratic primary and said he is undecided on whether he will publicly back someone before the Iowa caucuses. ""People hear her and they respond to her. She has the capacity to arouse the base.""

""It's not enough to talk about black people as if we're a monolith""

The Warren campaign has sought to reach out to the black community through its policy plans.

From her student loan debt forgiveness plan to her housing proposal to plans on closing private prisons and assisting entrepreneurs of color, Warren has integrated measures aimed specifically at African Americans in many of her policy outlines. Asked about outreach the senator has been doing this year to the black community, the campaign also pointed to ""listening sessions"" she has held with black activists and leaders throughout the year, including in Philadelphia ahead of the Netroots Nation conference.

And even as early as the spring, Warren was spending time in the south, in states that hold contests in March after the all-important early states. In March, she visited the Mississippi Delta for a ""walking tours"" of Cleveland and Greenville, Mississippi, to promote her rural housing plan, and also held campaign events in Tennessee and Alabama.

Ashlee Marie Preston, an African American transgender activist who has endorsed Warren, said she spoke with several other Democratic candidates before settling on Warren. It was in some ways an unexpected choice, she said, particularly given that there are two black candidates in the Democratic race: Sens. Harris and Cory Booker.

""I think it's easy to talk about racism in America -- it's another thing to be specific about the different layers about structural racism and systemic racism and how it continues to stand as a barrier to the poor and disenfranchised communities,"" Preston said. ""It's not enough to talk about black people as if we're a monolith.""

Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families Party, which endorsed Warren last month, echoed Preston's sentiment.

""Identity is important but identity is insufficient. Simply because candidates happen to occupy the same racial identity of black voters doesn't mean it's in the bag for any candidate,"" Mitchell said. ""And black voters are incredibly sophisticated. They want to understand a candidate's history, a candidate's platform.""

Other African American Warren supporters -- particularly those who have known the senator voters will for years -- insist that her standing with black voters will improve as they get to know the candidate better.

""I'm troubled by the numbers in South Carolina, only because I know that folks in South Carolina don't know her like we know her -- members of the African American community in Boston,"" said Rev. Jeffrey Brown, an associate pastor of the 12th Baptist Church in Roxbury, Massachusetts.

For years, Warren has periodically attended services at the 12th Baptist Church, one of the oldest black churches in the Boston area. Brown said Warren personally calls to give him a heads-up before attending Sunday services, and that while he has asked her on multiple occasions to speak to the congregation, she has largely declined.

Remarking upon the Bible that Warren brings to church -- ""What I love about her Bible is that it's not brand new. And I've seen it. I've looked at it. It's a well-worn thing"" -- Brown said it is what he sees as the senator's understanding of the unique needs of African-Americans that leads him to believe that there is room for black support for Warren to grow.

But the reality is that Warren has less than four months left to introduce herself to black voters across the country and intensively court them, in contrast to the years she has had to get to know black voters in Massachusetts.

""I wish I could go down to South Carolina to some of these places and say look -- this is not a show... She's a real advocate for us,"" said Brown, who added he is ""a thousand percent"" behind Warren's candidacy. ""I wish I could go down there to some southern churches and preach about that."""

Federal data obtained by Breitbart News reveals that since August, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency has deported more than 2,500 illegal aliens who arrived as a family unit at the southern border and have final orders for removal.

Over these two months, ICE agents arrested another 275 illegal aliens who arrived as family units at the border. All of these illegal aliens arrested have final orders for removal, meaning they have gone through the asylum and immigration courts and have been found not to be eligible to stay in the U.S.

Compare these deportation numbers to that of Fiscal Year 2018, when ICE deported 2,711 illegal aliens who arrived as family units at the border for the entire year.

This indicates that about 226 illegal aliens claiming to be part of a family unit were deported every month last year compared to about 1,250 deported each month in August and September of this year — a more than 453 percent increase in illegal family unit deportations based on monthly totals.

As Breitbart News has reported, research finds that deporting the 11 to 22 million illegal aliens saves American taxpayers billions compared to the costs they are forced to pay when illegal aliens are allowed to stay.

Deporting every illegal alien in the country would amount to a cost savings of about $622 billion over the course of a lifetime. This indicates that deporting illegal aliens is six times less costly than what it costs American taxpayers to currently subsidize the millions of illegal aliens living in the U.S.

Mass deportations are supported by a majority of American voters, a July Harvard/Harris Poll finds. Overall, 51 percent of voters said they support mass deportations of the illegal alien population, including more than eight-in-ten GOP voters and more than five-in-ten swing voters.

A social housing project in Norwich , England, hailed as a ""modest masterpiece,"" has won the prestigious Stirling Prize architecture award.

Goldsmith Street, made up of almost 100 ultra-low-energy homes for Norwich City Council and built in seven terraced blocks, was designed by London-based Mikhail Riches with Cathy Hawley.

The Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), which launched the annual prize in 1996, announced this year's winner on Tuesday night.

Goldsmith Street consists of rows of two-story houses, bookended by three-story flats.

The architects took inspiration from Victorian streets in the nearby ""Golden Triangle"" district.

The competition judges, chaired by Julia Barfield, said: ""Goldsmith Street is a modest masterpiece. It is high-quality architecture in its purest, most environmentally and socially conscious form.""

""This is proper social housing, over ten years in the making, delivered by an ambitious and thoughtful council. These desirable, spacious, low-energy properties should be the norm for all council housing,"" the judges added.

The development is designed to the stringent Passivhaus standard, which means homes will use very little additional energy for heating or cooling.

Annual energy costs for homes designed to the standard are estimated to be 70% lower than for the average household, according to the RIBA.

In order to ensure the windows echoed Victorian proportions but also met the standard, the architects developed a recessed feature, thereby giving the impression of a larger opening, but with a limited amount of glass.

Letterboxes were also built externally so that front doors would not let in drafts.

Each flat has its own front door, ""generous"" lobby space for prams and bikes, and a private balcony, the RIBA said.

More than a quarter of the space is communal and a walkway connects residents' gardens.

Parking has been placed on the periphery, ""ensuring that people own the streets, not their cars,"" the RIBA added.

Councilor Gail Harris, Norwich City Council's cabinet member for social housing, said: ""This is an incredibly proud moment for Norwich, our strong history of building social housing and our ambitions to raise environmental standards.""

Goldsmith Street beat five other nominees on the shortlist to scoop the prize. These included an opera house in Leicestershire, the Macallan Distillery in Scotland and the revamped London Bridge train station."

Kamala Harris (D-CA) said members of President Donald Trump’s administration were “violating” their oath to defend the Constitution by mounting a defense to the House’s impeachment inquiry.

On a letter she sent to members of Trump’s cabinet, Harris said, “To put everyone on notice, this is a process that is about pursuit of justice and truth and that we are not going to tolerate in our role of oversight any conduct that interferes with that process, and so we are putting members of the cabinet on notice that they have a duty and a responsibility to preserve evidence to protect whistleblowers and the inspector’s general of the various agencies and cooperate with the process. And frankly, to your point, the letter perhaps is unique because I don’t think in recent history we’ve seen the need for those kinds of obvious points to be made but with this administration. We can’t take anything for granted, especially when we’ve seen the highest elected official in our government, Donald Trump actively engaged in the suppress of evidence and the intimidation of witnesses.”

When asked about Trump’s letter to Congress saying they will not corporate with the impeachment inquiry, Harris said, “This is a moment that highlights the magnificent brilliance of the framers of our constitution and the Founders of our nation who imagined such a moment where there would be an outright and obvious, at this point, abuse of power by one branch of government, in this case, the executive branch and the need therefore for these kinds of checks and balances. So the letter today from Senator Blumenthal and myself and so many others who have stood up to stand for accountability and for our democracy is about living what our Founders imagine might be necessary, which is to have these checks and balances. But that statement is ridiculous and is clearly just another example of members of this administration who frankly are violating their oath.”

She added, “I say that purposely. It’s not like they are ignoring it or overlooking it. They are violating it. They took an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. And I think it is clear that there are enemies who are American citizens, enemies to our democracy. This is a moment where everyone should have the courage to stand up and speak to the values of our Constitution and our democracy and our system of justice.”

If Trump recounts a story in which an unnamed person addresses him as ""sir,"" the story is usually false in some way.

In recent weeks, Trump has been telling a new ""sir"" story.

""When I took over our military, we didn't have ammunition,"" Trump said Monday . ""I was told by a top general -- maybe the top of them all -- 'Sir, I'm sorry. Sir, we don't have ammunition.' I said, 'I'll never let another president have that happen to him or her.' We didn't have ammunition.""

As you may have suspected from the two ""sir""s or from the substance of the story, Trump's claim is a severe exaggeration.

While we can't be sure what a general might have privately told Trump -- and though we couldn't reach former Defense Secretary James Mattis, whom Trump named as the general in a September version of the story -- it's clearly not true that the world's most powerful military simply ""didn't have ammunition"" when he was inaugurated in January 2017.

""No general or admiral would say this,"" Hertling said in an email. ""They might say they have concerns, or if they were asked to attack a country (say, for instance, North Korea), that a major constraint would be they didn't have the right amount of ammunition to hit all targets (like, say, all the 10,000 artillery pieces hidden in caves in North Korea, or all the potential rocket sites), but then they would give their requirements.""

As Hertling noted, however, there are some real facts underlying the dubious tale.

What the military has said about munitions levels

According to military leaders, there was a shortfall in certain kinds of munitions, particularly precision-guided bombs, late in the Obama presidency and early in the Trump presidency -- after the US used tens of thousands of these munitions in the campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.

Obama administration Defense Secretary Ash Carter said in February 2016 : ""We've recently been hitting ISIL with so many GPS-guided smart bombs and laser-guided rockets that we are starting to run low on the ones that we use against terrorists the most. So we're investing $1.8 billion in (fiscal year 2017) to buy over 45,000 more of them.""

Adm. Harry Harris, commander of the Navy's Pacific Command, told Congress in April 2017 : ""Critical munitions shortfalls are my top warfighting concern ... We are short in 'here-and-now' basic munitions like small diameter bombs.""

And in a December 2018 speech in which Mattis touted military progress under Trump, he said there had been ""munition shortages"" two years prior.

Critics of US military intervention abroad might note that one way the US could address a bomb shortage is by doing less bombing. Regardless, Trump wasn't making the whole thing up: Military leaders did make clear that they thought that the US was lower on certain munitions than it should be, though none of them publicly said anything like ""we don't have ammunition.""

How bad was it?

It has never been clear how dire or how unusual the perceived shortage was, since the military does not release comprehensive data about ammunition levels. Michael O'Hanlon, a Brookings Institution senior fellow who specializes in defense strategy, said ""no claims like Trump's should be taken at face value,"" but that we don't have the information to assess his claims in depth.

""The military generally does have some 'shortages' of ammunition, relative to formal goals and preferred levels, at any given time -- more often than not,"" O'Hanlon said in an email.

Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic & International Studies, said that while inventories of some munitions, like Hellfire missiles and Joint Direct Attack Munitions, were ""stretched thin"" from heavy use in the ISIS conflict and in Afghanistan, the Defense Department ""has requested (and received) more money to restock its inventories, and the manufacturers of these weapons have ramped up production to fill these new orders.""

""So while it was a concern, it never became an operational issue as far as I can tell,"" Harrison said in an email.

Harrison's assessment is supported by a 2017 article in which Air Force Col. Randall Ackerman, a spokesman for the Joint Staff, told US News & World Report , ""We are currently able to mitigate shortages within combatant commands by managing the redistribution of munitions according to requirements and needs."" A spokesman for the campaign against ISIS also said at the time that the mission ""is not affected because of a lack of munitions.""

Lt. Gen. Aundre Piggee, Army deputy chief of staff for logistics, told Congress in March 2017 that while ""today I think we have adequate munitions for our normal requirements,"" he would be ""very concerned with our current stockage of munitions"" if ""we had to surge, if we had contingency operations and if there continues to be emerging threats we see around the world,"" Defense News reported

Hertling explained that there is ""ALWAYS concern"" about having insufficient ammunition to fight multiple wars simultaneously; this, he said, is not an issue that will go away.

""The truth of the matter is that there isn't enough to go around, and when priorities are shifted it would be a logistics challenge to get the right type and right amount of ammo (and other logistics/equipment) to the commander who found himself in a fight,"" he said."

Why did the network let him walk it over to The New Yorker, where he eventually won a Pulitzer Prize for the reporting, instead of airing it on TV?

NBC executives say Farrow simply didn't have any on-the-record, on-camera reporting to broadcast. The executives say they supported Farrow for months, but his draft script wasn't up to NBC standards, and they didn't want to stand in his way when he saw an opportunity to get the story published in print.

Farrow doesn't buy it. Neither does his former producer Rich McHugh. They have their suspicions about what happened, and now Farrow is sharing it all publicly in a book called ""Catch and Kill.""

CNN Business obtained an advance copy of the book, which comes out next week. In it, Farrow describes ""odd signals"" from NBC executives and suggests that the network's own secrets weighed on the network's judgments. One of the network's biggest stars, Matt Lauer, was having sexual relationships with co-workers, and Weinstein knew it, according to anonymous sources he cites in the book.

""NBC denied any threat was communicated"" by Weinstein or American Media Inc, the publisher of the National Enquirer , Farrow wrote. He doesn't seem to have any proof of an explicit deal between Weinstein and NBC management. But he has many reasons to be suspicious.

Ultimately, he says, his reporting effort was shut down for reasons that were not journalistic. He presents evidence of a purported deal that Weinstein claimed to have with NBC, which the network denies. In a new interview with the Washington Post , he calls it a ""corporate coverup.""

NBC News chairman Andy Lack pushed back on Farrow's interpretation of events in a Wednesday afternoon memo to staffers. He said Farrow's book ""uses a variety of tactics to paint a fundamentally untrue picture"" about NBC's handling of the Weinstein probe.

A representative for Farrow responded, ""the claims by NBC's senior management about Ronan Farrow's reporting are simply not true, as his book will methodically demonstrate.""

In the book, Farrow says ""there was no doubt that the allegations against Lauer, and NBC's wider use of nondisclosure agreements with women who experienced harassment, were under threat of exposure during our reporting. That precarious culture of secrecy made NBC more vulnerable to Harvey Weinstein's intimidation and enticement, delivered through lawyers, and intermediaries, and calls to"" multiple executives up and down the corporate chain of command.

NBC has previously acknowledged that Weinstein badgered NBC executives and pursued all sorts of avenues to shut down Farrow's investigation. The network says it resisted all of the pressure.

But Farrow's book, drawing from anonymous sources, says Weinstein was under the impression that he had successfully spiked the investigation: ""Weinstein told one of his legal advisors that he'd spoken to executives at the network, and that 'they tell me they're not doing the story.'"" This occurred, Farrow says, before he was told the story was tabled.

People on the calls with Weinstein came to the clear conclusion that a deal was struck, Farrow adds.

NBC says there was not. It is certainly possible that Weinstein spoke with network executives and came away with a different understanding than they did. The heads of news divisions sometimes find themselves in positions where they listen to aggrieved sources and try to calm the person down, without actually making any promises or ordering any changes.

Farrow also points to a business relationship between Weinstein and American Media, which had been writing stories about Lauer's love life for years. He even describes a September 2017 meeting between Weinstein and National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard, where the two men looked at the dirt the Enquirer had accumulated about Lauer.

""The story presented by Mr. Farrow, while dramatic, is inaccurate,"" an AMI spokesperson told CNN Business.

NBC News said in a statement that the news division ""was never contacted by AMI, or made aware in any way of any threats from them, or from anyone else, for that matter. And the idea of NBC News taking a threat seriously from a tabloid company about Matt Lauer is especially preposterous, since they already covered him with great regularity.""

By September, though, NBC had already freed Farrow to take his investigation to The New Yorker, where it was ultimately published in October, five days after The New York Times published its own investigation into Weinstein's abusive conduct.

He said, he said

The timeline of Farrow's reporting stretches back to the start of 2017, when Farrow was working on multiple investigative projects for NBC, to be shown on Lauer's ""Today"" show and other network newscasts.

He was interested in stories about sexual harassment in Hollywood, and NBC News president Noah Oppenheim suggested he contact the actress Rose McGowan, who had been tweeting about her encounter with an unnamed movie mogul.

Before long Farrow was hearing about Weinstein and decades' worth of alleged abuse. But it proved to be very difficult to convince anyone to speak on camera on the record. This was a testament, Farrow writes, to the fear that Weinstein instilled in his employees: Multiple sources wanted to be interviewed in shadow, disguising their identities from the television audience.

McGowan was an exception: She spoke on the record, on camera, in chilling fashion. But she did not explicitly name Weinstein as her attacker.

Later, she hesitated about letting Farrow air her comments at all. According to Farrow, she grew ""uncomfortable with the delays"" and concerned about ""things she'd heard about the people there"" at NBC. McGowan — who struck a settlement agreement with Weinstein in 1997 — had her lawyers send a cease-and-desist demand to NBC.

At the heart of the matter is a fascinating series of arguments about what is publishable, when, and in what form. And both Farrow and NBC have compelling cases to make.

What Farrow interpreted as slow-walking his explosive scoop, NBC executives cast as an act of journalistic responsibility.

What Farrow describes as a lack of enthusiasm about his reporting, others describe as appropriate skepticism.

So was what happened with Farrow and NBC just the natural push and pull between reporter and editor, between employee and supervisor?

Or was NBC News trying to cover up Weinstein's conduct? Was NBC's parent company, Comcast, trying to protect relationships in Hollywood?

Farrow strongly hints at these latter possibilities. He notes that Weinstein had relationships right up to the top of Comcast, where CEO Brian Roberts had known the media mogul for years.

But he doesn't have smoking gun evidence of a quid pro quo — something to the effect of Weinstein saying ""back off of me, or I'll expose Lauer.""

And Farrow says that Roberts later apologized to him for NBC's handling of his investigation.

Throughout ""Catch and Kill,"" Farrow brings up his workplace interactions with Lauer, reminding readers that Lauer would be fired for sexual misconduct less than two months after the Weinstein investigations came out.

Farrow has new interviews with several of Lauer's accusers, including the first on-the-record interview with Brooke Nevils, who alleges that Lauer raped her during a 2014 work trip in Russia. Lauer categorically denied her claims in an open letter on Wednesday.

Farrow points the finger at what he calls a ""network news culture that made women feel uncomfortable and unsafe, and left little room for accountability around its larger-than-life stars.""

And he questions NBC's own use of contracts to keep alleged wrongdoing a secret, given that he was trying to reveal Weinstein's use of the same types of contracts.

In the book, Farrow quotes at length from his interactions with Oppenheim and others at NBC. At times, Farrow says, Oppenheim was very interested in the progress he was making; at other times, he writes, Oppenheim seemed indifferent.

""I still don't think Harvey Weinstein's a name the 'Today' show audience knows,"" he quotes Oppenheim saying after he turned in a lengthy draft script in July. ""And anyway,"" Oppenheim is quoted saying, ""where would we even air it? This looks long.""

Farrow was getting more and more concerned about getting scooped by The Times. But he says NBC executives didn't share his sense of urgency.

He quotes Rich Greenberg, the executive editor of the NBC News investigative unit, telling him that ""sometimes it's best to let someone else go first.""

Through an NBC spokesperson, Greenberg and Oppenheim declined to comment on Farrow's account.

Farrow's frustration

Farrow grew frustrated as the reporting was held up by a legal review process. Such a review is standard practice in the news business, particularly when a litigious figure like Weinstein is involved.

Again, it all comes down to interpretation — was NBC supporting Farrow by making sure the story was buttoned up, or was his reporting being shelved?

When NBCUniversal's general counsel Kim Harris undertook her own review of the reporting, Oppenheim told Farrow that Harris would ""tell us what we can really be bulletproof in saying, what can hold up in court,"" according to Farrow.

But in the meantime, Farrow was told to ""pause"" his efforts to gain additional corroboration, including a new interview with McGowan.

By mid-August, network executives had determined that Farrow did not have enough evidence against Weinstein to merit a story. ""Right now, we can't run this,"" Oppenheim told him.

Farrow also quotes Oppenheim telling him ""you're too close to this,"" meaning, too emotionally invested in the accusers' accounts.

He gave Farrow a green light to take the reporting to a magazine, bringing up New York magazine as a potential example and essentially telling him to take the story elsewhere.

Farrow took it to the The New Yorker magazine , where editor David Remnick was immediately interested in what he had.

(L-R) Ronan Farrow, Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer

When the magazine published Farrow's reporting, and people asked why Farrow hadn't broadcast it on NBC, Oppenheim told staffers, ""we didn't feel that we had all the elements that we needed to air it.""

""We supported him and gave him resources to report that story over many, many months,"" Oppenheim said at the time. ""The notion that we would try to cover for a powerful person is deeply offensive to all of us.""

That's been the consistent explanation from NBC ever since.

As Farrow has become more critical of his former employer in public, NBC executives have become more critical of him suggesting that he overstated some of his reporting and cut corners along the way.

McHugh, who left NBC last year, has stood firmly in Farrow's corner, pointing out that the network had ""an exclusive audio recording of Harvey Weinstein admitting to sexual assault,"" among other evidence.

This tape was of a 2015 NYPD sting operation, when model Ambra Gutierrez recorded Weinstein pleading with her to come up to his hotel room and she was heard resisting him. At one point, Gutierrez asked him, ""Why did you touch my breast?"" Weinstein responded by saying sorry and ""I'm used to that."" A moment later, he added, ""I won't do it again.""

The tape was handed over to the District Attorney in Manhattan at the time, but the D.A. office determined it was insufficient to prove a crime had occurred, a decision that remains deeply controversial.

According to Farrow, Oppenheim commented that the existence of the tape was not national news. NBC News has come under fire from media critics for sitting on the tape for months and not airing it; in response, the network has pointed out that The New Yorker later possessed the tape for nearly two months a month before publishing it.

Ultimately the tape was a key piece of the fact pattern laid out in Farrow's story for The New Yorker.

According to NBC, his ultimate story for the magazine ""bore little resemblance to the reporting he had while at NBC News."" In other words, Farrow was able to find new sources and evidence after he left NBC.

But Farrow asserts that he had an eminently reportable story, ready to go, and that NBC quashed it.

""NBC killed the Weinstein story,"" Farrow's partner Jon Lovett tweeted on Wednesday. ""It was a historic mistake. Over and over and over again, NBC told Ronan to stop reporting. I heard it myself! Phones have speakers!""

But in Wednesday's memo, Lack stood by the August 2017 decision.

""Here are the essential and indisputable facts: NBC News assigned the Harvey Weinstein story to Ronan, we completely supported it over many months with resources -- both financial and editorial,"" Lack wrote. ""After seven months, without one victim or witness on the record, he simply didn't have a story that met our standard for broadcast nor that of any major news organization. Not willing to accept that standard and not wanting to get beaten by the New York Times, he asked to take his story to an outlet he claimed was ready to publish right away. Reluctantly, we allowed him to go ahead.""

Farrow's representative responded by saying that ""relevant sections of the book confirm not only how many women were named, but also how much proof Ronan had gathered. Importantly, it documents the lengths to which NBC executives went to thwart the reporting efforts of Ronan and his producer Rich McHugh and why they did so.""

Lack's memo also defended the news division by noting its other investigations ""into sexual harassment and abuse on many stories -- many pre-dating Weinstein -- including USA Gymnastics, Silicon Valley, Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, and more.""

To get across the finish line on big stories like these takes exceptional work, collaboration, patience, and a commitment to a set of standards and practices that ultimately lends our work great credibility,"" Lack wrote. ""If you have any questions about the journalistic decisions that were made, please don't hesitate to ask.""

CNN reported on the details of its town hall:

Invitations to participate in the LGBTQ-focused town hall were extended to Democratic presidential hopefuls who met the DNC’s qualifications for the October 2019 primary debate. Candidates must have reached 2% in at least four national polls identified by the DNC to determine eligibility. The polls for this town hall must have been released between June 28, 2019 and September 25, 2019. In addition, candidates also needed to meet the donor threshold outlined by the DNC for the October debate, in which the candidates had to receive the financial support of 130,000 unique donors, including 400 donors each from at least 20 states. Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and businessman Andrew Yang both declined HRCF’s invitation, each citing scheduling conflicts. A HRCF (Human Rights Campaign Foundation) spokesperson said the audience will be comprised of invited guests, LGBTQ stakeholders, and members of civic organizations. No public tickets will be available for the event.

“The problem that we’ve got is that the judge is allowing input of evidence of every injury that Planned Parenthood and their allies suffered at the hands of the negative public relations, and yet not allowing us to even put in the videos that the public was reacting to,” Peter Breen of the Thomas More Society told Breitbart News in an interview.

“So, there’s a principle in the law that has been recognized that David and his team are not responsible for the reaction to the contents of the video,” he continued:

And, so, the reaction of the public is, to some extent, not relevant to the damages that are being claimed by Planned Parenthood. But the judge is letting those in. He’s letting them talk all about their, you know the terrible public relations they took. But at the same time, we’ve not been able, thus far, to show any of the videos that caused this great public reaction. And Planned Parenthood is trying to get damages, after the publication of the videos that they say weren’t caused by the public reactions.

Daleiden himself tweeted the judge’s decision to prevent the jury from seeing the videos is a violation of “due process”:

BREAKING: major due process violations in trial vs @PPFA as PP convinces Judge Orrick to BAN us from showing the jury the exact video conversations that PP is suing for! How can @CtrMedProgress witness on stand rebut false PP claims re: “privacy” without playing the convos?! #1A — David Daleiden (@daviddaleiden) October 8, 2019

Breen said the problem for his team is they need to show public reaction to the videos, which depicted top-level Planned Parenthood officials haggling over the price of body parts of aborted babies, was “overwhelming.”

“And there’s good reason for it, because the videos, showed evidence of terrible crimes and the willingness to commit those crimes by top officials at Planned Parenthood,” he said. “We’re fighting as hard as we can, but based on the recent rulings, we’re having a fight with one hand tied behind our back, possibly both.”

As the Federalist reported, in opening statements, Judge William Orrick of U.S. District Court in San Francisco instructed the jury the case “is not about the truth of whether plaintiffs profited from the sale of fetal tissue or otherwise violated the law in securing tissue for those programs.”

“Those issues are a matter of dispute between the parties in the world outside this courtroom,” the judge added.

Breen told Breitbart News:

Imagine what it is going to be like for these jurors to sit through six weeks of Planned Parenthood talking about all the terrible things that happened to them, none of which should be relevant to damages. And yet, we’re going to be unable to talk about why those things were actually happening, in defense.

“Unfortunately, it’s starting to look like we’re engaged in a game of heads Planned Parenthood wins, tails we lose – on the presentation of evidence,” Breen added.

Daleiden reported as well on Center for Medical Progress’s (CMP) website:

At Planned Parenthood’s request, Judge Orrick refused to allow the Defense to show the jury the exact video conversations that Planned Parenthood is suing for. It is the jury’s job to assess whether the conversations are “private” or “confidential” under applicable state law–yet Planned Parenthood and Judge Orrick are barring the actual recordings of these conversations from the courtroom. Adrian Lopez, one of CMP’s undercover investigators, took the witness stand and was accused by Planned Parenthood of videotaping so-called “private” conversations at a National Abortion Federation trade show in Baltimore, MD, yet defense attorney Paul Jonna was not allowed to play video of the conversation itself, a graphic discussion with Plaintiff Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast leadership, to allow Lopez and CMP to defend against Planned Parenthood’s accusation. Ironically, Planned Parenthood was allowed to play multiple recordings of undercover conversations during their questioning.

Planned Parenthood initially sought over $20 million in damages, but those damages have since been reduced to several hundred thousands of dollars, in addition to legal and attorney fees, which could yet run into millions of dollars.

In a separate criminal case against Daleiden and Sandra Merritt, the CMP colleagues are the first undercover journalists to be criminally prosecuted in the history of the state of California.

Daleiden and Merritt were slapped with 15 felony counts of recording confidential information without consent by the office of the California Attorney General (AG), including its past AG, current U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, and her successor, Xavier Becerra.

Harris received thousands of dollars in campaign donations from Planned Parenthood, and, subsequently, she and her office raided Daleiden’s home and seized his personal property, including his laptop, instead of prosecuting Planned Parenthood.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), a former chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, announced her endorsement of the former vice president on Tuesday, claiming to have witnessed Biden’s “fortitude” and leadership during their overlapping tenures in Congress.

Feinstein said in a statement:

I’ve worked closely with Vice President Biden and I’ve seen firsthand his legislative ability, his statesmanship, and most importantly his moral fortitud. During his time in Congress and in the White House, Joe Biden has been a tireless fighter for hard working American families.

The endorsement comes as Biden’s presidential campaign is besieged by scandal regarding the lucrative business dealings his youngest son, Hunter, had with foreign governments.

Only hours before Feinstein’s endorsement, the Chinese government announced it would not investigate how Hunter Biden ended up at the center of one its top private equity firms. The Chinese foreign ministry made the decision after President Donald Trump publicly called for a probe of Hunter Biden’s dealings with Bohai Harvest RST (BHR). In particular, Trump has noted that the circumstances surrounding BHR’s creation could have posed a conflict of interest for Joe Biden.

As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, revealed in his bestselling book Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden inked the multibillion-dollar deal that created BHR with a subsidiary of the state-owned Bank of China in 2013.

The timing of the lucrative deal has been brought into question as it came only 12 days after Hunter visited China with his father aboard Air Force Two. Officially, the then-vice president was visiting the country amid escalating tensions over islands in the South China Sea and decided to bring his granddaughter and son along. In a March 2018 interview with Breitbart News Tonight, however, Schweizer detailed the political machinations that preceded Hunter Biden’s $1.5 billion venture with China:

In December of 2013, Vice President Joe Biden flies to Asia for a trip, and the centerpiece for that trip is a visit to Beijing, China. To put this into context, in 2013, the Chinese have just exerted air rights over the South Pacific, the South China Sea. They basically have said, ‘If you want to fly in this area, you have to get Chinese approval. We are claiming sovereignty over this territory.’ Highly controversial in Japan, in the Philippines, and in other countries. Joe Biden is supposed to be going there to confront the Chinese. Well, he gets widely criticized on that trip for going soft on China. For basically not challenging them, and Japan and other countries are quite upset about this.

Since its creation, BHR has invested heavily in energy and defense projects across the globe. As of June, Hunter Biden was still involved with BHR, sitting on its board of directors and owning a minority stake of the fund estimated to be worth more than $430,000.

Such dealings at the center of politics and business, while perhaps not illegal, are not exclusive to the Biden family alone. As a few noted at the time of Feinstein’s endorsement, the senator and her husband have their own close ties to the communist country.

During her tenure as mayor of San Francisco in the late-1970s and early-1980s, Feinstein took advantage of the newly normalized diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China by establishing one of the first sister city partnership between San Francisco and Shanghai. Through that partnership, Feinstein led trade delegations to China in which she and her husband, Richard Blum, became acquainted with some of the country’s most prominent political leaders.

As the Federalist noted in August 2018, Feinstein and her husband leveraged those relationships to boost their own wealth. In 1986, Feinstein and Jiang Zemin — the then-mayor of Shanghai, who would later ascend to the presidency of the People’s Republic of China — “designated several corporate entities for fostering commercial relations.” One of those firms was Shanghai Pacific Partners, which employed Blum as a director. Blum reportedly had an interest of upwards of $500,000 in a project backed by Shanghai Pacific Partners.

After Feinstein was elected to the Senate in 1992, Blum continued profiting off their ties to China. A the same time, the freshman lawmaker was pitching herself as a “China hand” to colleagues, even once claiming “that in my last life maybe I was Chinese.” Through her seat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Feinstein led the fight on a number of initiatives seen as being favorable to China, including granting the country permanent most-favored-nation trading status in 2000.

Despite Feinstein and her husband having a close relationship with Jiang, the Chinese government targeted the senator as part of its espionage operations. In the early 2000s, the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) recruited a longtime employee of the senator to gather information about the inner workings of her congressional and district offices. Feinstein only learned of the staffer’s duplicity in 2013, after he’d already been on her payroll for more than 20 years.

“While this person, who was a liaison to the local Chinese community, was fired, charges were never filed against him,” Politico reported in 2018, speculating that because “the staffer was providing political intelligence and not classified information—making prosecution far more difficult.”

Apart from the convoluted history of the senator’s ties to China, the political timing of Feinstein’s endorsement also caught many off guard. The California Democrat, who hosted a fundraiser on Biden’s behalf last week alongside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) daughter, is only the most recent figure from the Democrat establishment to openly pledge support for the former vice president. Feinstein’s endorsement, however, was not totally expected, especially since her seamate, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), is mounting a bid of her own for the Democrat nomination. In fact, earlier this year, Feinsten flirted with the notion of remaining neutral in the 2020 contest out of respect for Harris.

Compounding the political picture is that most polls show Biden no longer the favorite to win California, having fallen behind Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).

Feinstein, however, did not address any of that when endorsing the former vice president on Tuesday. Instead, the senator offered platitudes about Biden’s work to enhance gun control and how his campaign was a “fight to restore the soul of the nation.”"

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), on Wednesday, arguing that the country is “not electing a planner.”

While the top-tier candidates in the Democrat primary field have largely refrained from taking deep digs at one another, Biden signaled that he may switch strategies.

“We’re not electing a planner,” Biden said in New Hampshire on Wednesday, in an apparent reference to Warren. “I’ve been there. I know what it takes to get it done.”

Warren has made “I have a plan for that” a catchphrase of her campaign, claiming to have solutions for virtually every major problem the country faces and outlining those broad plans in a series of Medium posts over the course of her campaign. Most of Warren’s plans contain a common thread, incorporating aspects from additional proposals within her political arsenal.

Warren has unveiled a $3 trillion climate change proposal inspired by former presidential candidate and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), a plan focused entirely on “honoring and empowering tribal nations and Indigenous peoples,” and a proposal to “end corruption in Washington.”

In August, Warren released her comprehensive criminal justice reform plan, which emphasized protections for “special populations” — such as LGBT individuals — and called for the elimination of private prisons.

In September, Warren added to her ultra-progressive agenda, promising to raise Social Security benefits by $200 per month. She said she would pay for it by taxing the “wealthy” — specifically, by increasing the Social Security contribution requirement to 14.8 percent for individuals making $250,000 per year, and splitting the 14.8 percent “equally between employees and employers at 7.4 percent each.”

Most recently, Warren released a plan to address “environmental injustice” and “environmental racism” across the country.

Biden’s jab comes after weeks of a slow, steady surge in Warren’s favor, besting Biden in a variety of recent polls and overtaking him in the RealClearPolitics average for the first time this week.

A poll from The Economist/YouGov showed Warren topping the field with 29 percent to Biden’s 25 percent — a lead which remains outside of the +/- 2.9 percent margin of error:

Deadline reported that former Vice President Biden will attend two Hollywood fundraisers on Thursday — one in the afternoon hosted by former HBO executive Michael Lombardo, and one in the evening at the home of Paramount Pictures chairman and CEO Jim Gianopulos.

CNN’s town hall, titled Equality in America, is set to air Thursday evening, from 7:30 p.m. to 12 a.m. ET, and will feature nine Democratic presidential candidates. The event is co-organized by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, a non-profit focused on LGBTQ issues.

The town hall comes amidst increased U.S.-China tensions — a subject that hits close to home in the entertainment industry, which depends heavily on Chinese consumers to buy movie tickets and visit theme parks.

Hollywood executives have remained conspicuously quiet about U.S.-China relations in the wake of democracy protests in Hong Kong that have put global businesses including the NBA to Apple in a difficult spot.

President Donald Trump has publicly hammered Biden over his close ties with China, accusing the former Vice President and his son, Hunter, of being “paid off” by foreign interests.

Moderators of Thursday’s town hall include CNN’s Dana Bash, Anderson Cooper, Chris Cuomo, Don Lemon and Nia-Malika Henderson.

Sen. Harris (D-CA) reportedly attended a reception at The Abbey in West Hollywood on Wednesday, while Buttigieg is set to attend a fundraiser at the Belasco Theater in downtown L.A.

Deadline reported earlier this week that Buttigieg attended a separate L.A. fundraiser on Tuesday at the home of former CAA agent Michael Kives, who is now head of the investment advisory firm K5 Global.

Celebrities who were reportedly in attendance include Leonardo DiCaprio, Glenn Close, Ashton Kutcher and Paris Hilton.

Hollywood is a reliable fundraising pitstop for Democratic candidates.

Hillary Clinton made numerous L.A. visits in her failed 2016 bid for the White House, including events with mega donor and billionaire Haim Saban, the founder of Saban Entertainment.

CNN’s town hall is set to take place at the Novo, at the L.A. Live complex in downtown L.A.

Other Democratic presidential hopefuls scheduled to appear include Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Beto O’Rourke, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, Tom Steyer and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ).

Josephson, a psychiatrist and professor who led the child and adolescent psychiatry at the University of Louisville School, lost his job after speaking at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, DC, in 2017 about treating children and teens for gender dysphoria.

“I found my university turning against me for asking that question,” Josephson said. “And some of my colleagues turned against me.”

“Within weeks my university demoted me despite numerous evaluations from administrators praising my skills and what I had done in my career and my professionalism,” Josephson said. “For the next year I endured a hostile environment and then finally I was effectively fired all for simply asking a question — why is this happening?”

As Josephson spoke, a woman with a megaphone tried to drown him out by shouting repeatedly, “Go home homophobe.”

“Tolerance is very popular these days especially among people who don’t show much of it,” Josephson said.

During his remarks, Josephson said gender dysphoria is real and damaging.

“Many of these children have serious distress, anxiety, depression, and they asked me what’s the best way to treat them,” Josephson said. “As a physician who cares about their patients my answer was straightforward.”

“The best treatment is always based on the understanding of what is causing the child’s distress,” Josephson said. “What does the confusion stem from?”

“Is it a physical problem or is it an emotional problem?” Josephson said. “As a behavioral scientist I could not bring myself to say this is just something that happens.”

“We do not approach any other medical condition that way, and we didn’t need to approach this one that way,” Josephson said. “We need to understand a condition before we plan treatment for it.”

“But I soon found out that ‘why’ is not a question a doctor can asked these days at least when it comes to gender dysphoria,” Josephson said.

The Heritage Foundation’s Daily Signal reported that Josephson said academia is failing in its purpose of educating students.

Josephson said in the Daily Signal report:

Universities are supposed to be places where you can exchange ideas and vigorous discussion, go back and forth. This marketplace of ideas as a metaphor is great, and that’s how science proceeds. That’s how we make progress. Unfortunately, many academic settings, including my own, are becoming more of an activist setting—meaning you’re not testing ideas, promoting the results of research; you’re asking for someone to agree with you, essentially.

“Josephson cautioned that universities need to stop being about groupthink and instead embrace debate and differences of opinion,” the Daily Signal reported.

“Today’s social activism is overriding academic inquiry and the search for truth and worst of all its overriding the well being of many patients,” Josephson said on the steps of the High Court, where several women held signs to support him that read “Protect Fairness for Women” and “#SexNotGender.”

Josephson warned Supreme Court justices of the gravity of their decision in three cases, one by a man who was fired from his job at a funeral home when he told his boss he was going to change his name and dress as a woman and two others by homosexual men who said they were fired because of their sexual orientation.

“If the Supreme Court reads gender identity into federal law, a lot of people will be silenced or punished for their views,” Josephson said. “I’m living proof of that.”

These cases are Bostock v. Clayton County Georgia, No. 17-1618; Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda, No. 17-1623; and R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc. v. EEOC, No. 18-107 in the Supreme Court of the United States.

""We want to be seen as a part of the New South,"" Steven Reed told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""We want to turn the page and change the narrative, and that's what this election was about.""

Reed was born and raised in Montgomery and in 2012 became the first African American elected as probate judge in Montgomery County. In Tuesday's mayoral runoff, he defeated TV station owner David Woods, who is white.

Montgomery, where 60% of residents are black, has a complicated racial history . It is the birthplace of the civil rights movement but also was the first capital of the Confederacy. It later became the site of Rosa Parks' bus boycott and the destination of the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery protest marches. The nation's first memorial for more than 4,000 victims of lynchings opened last year there.

While the mayor-elect told CNN that it might have been a number of factors that delayed the state capital city's election of a black mayor, it's now time to move forward.

Advocates tracked the deaths of at least 26 transgender people in the US in 2018, according to the Human Rights Campaign . In 2019, at least 19 transgender people have been fatally shot or killed, according to HRC.

The first demonstration occurred at the start of South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg 's town hall. Buttigieg said he shared the concerns of the protesters, who shouted, ""People are dying, do something!"" and ""Trans lives matter!"" before he could answer the first question.

""I do want to acknowledge what these demonstrators are speaking about, which is the epidemic of violence against black trans women,"" Buttigieg said, prompting applause from the crowd.

""And I believe or would like to believe that everybody here is committed to ending that epidemic, and that does include lifting up ... visibility and speaking to it,"" he continued.

As protesters chanted ""Trans lives matter!"" CNN's Anderson Cooper thanked the demonstrators and said there is a long history of protest in the LGBTQ community.

""Let me just point out, there is a long and proud tradition in history in the gay, lesbian and transgender community of protest and we applaud them for their protest,"" said Cooper, who was met by applause. AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), an activist group working to end the AIDS crisis, was particularly active in protesting for access to experimental medicine to treat the virus in the 1980's and 1990's, at the height of the AIDS epidemic.

Cooper continued: ""And they are absolutely right to be angry and upset at the lack of attention, particularly in the media, of the lives of transgender"" people.

After addressing the protesters, Buttigieg said he is ""very mindful of the fact that my experience as a gay man, but as a white cis-gendered gay man, means that there are dimensions for example of what it's like to be a black trans woman that I do not personally understand. But I also think the diversity within the LGBTQ-plus community is part of what we have to offer right now.""

Bamby Salcedo, a Latina transgender activist, was among the protesters on Thursday night. She spoke up during Buttigieg's time on stage, chanting along with others, ""Trans people are dying! Do something!""

Salcedo, who serves as the president and CEO of TransLatin@ Coalition, was invited to the forum as a special guest of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The Warren campaign did not immediately comment on Salcedo's protest.

Later during the town hall, when former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke was on stage, a protester named Blossom C. Brown emerged from the crowd and took the mic from a questioner.

""Black trans women are dying, our lives matter!"" Brown said into the mic. ""I am an extraordinary black trans woman, and I deserve to be here,"" she said, and the crowd clapped.

""I am tired. I am so tired ... It's not just my black trans women, it's my black trans brothers too. And I'm going to say what I'm going to say,"" Brown added.

CNN moderator Don Lemon asked for Brown's name, and asked her to come to the stage and hand him the mic. ""Blossom, let me tell you something. The reason that we're here is to validate people like you,"" Lemon said.

He returned the mic to Brown, who then pointed out the lack of representation of black transgender people throughout the night.

""Not one black trans woman has taken the mic tonight. Not one black trans man has taken the mic tonight,"" Brown said, referring to a lack of black transgender people asking questions by that point in the town hall. (Black transgender questioners appeared later in the program.)

Lemon said, ""We're proud and happy that you're here.""

O'Rourke thanked Brown in a tweet after the exchange for ""making your voice heard tonight,"" and wrote, ""We will hold a town hall focused on trans women of color. And I hope you'll be there.""

Buttigieg and O'Rourke were one of several 2020 candidates to appear at the town hall hosted by CNN and HRCF in Los Angeles, the day before the 31st anniversary of National Coming Out Day, answering questions on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer issues.

New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro, and businessman Tom Steyer were also scheduled to participate."

Senator Cory Booker, the night's first speaker, was politely laughed at for not answering a yes or no question about whether religious educational institutions that oppose LGBTQ rights should lose their tax-exempt status. Senator Elizabeth Warren had the zinger of the night when asked how she'd respond to an ""old-fashioned"" supporter who told her they believe marriage is between a man and a woman. Warren quipped : ""Then just marry one woman. I'm cool with that...assuming you can find one.""

And then there was former Vice President Joe Biden who suggested the vast majority of Americans are not homophobic but instead are afraid and don't know what to do or say. He finished his time mumbling something about bathhouses. It was as awkward as it sounds.

But the night did not belong to a single candidate but rather a single topic.

Several transgender women of color held small protests inside the town hall sporadically throughout the night in hopes of drawing attention to the string of underreported murders of similar women. According to the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), which co-sponsored the event with CNN, more than 26 transgender people were murdered in 2018, most of whom were black transgender women.

So far this year HRC has reported that 19 transgender women have been killed . The lack of media coverage of these deaths is particularly jarring when juxtaposed against the frequent reminders that this year marks the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots

Those protests, in response to police persecution 50 years ago, are seen as the birth of the modern gay rights movement. And while gays and lesbians, particularly those who happen to be white, have benefited from the steady progression toward cultural acceptance, the trans women who led those protests remain mostly in the shadows.

Perhaps this is why the demonstrations began just when South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg was about to speak. Buttigieg, an openly gay cisgender white male, has become a regular on Sunday morning talk shows and is a bit of a pop culture media darling. The discussion was being moderated by Anderson Cooper, another openly gay cisgender white male who, as a public figure, has seemed to find a high level of acceptance.

There is no question that coming out and living one's truth can be a difficult journey regardless of race or gender identity. But it is far too easy for people of a station and privilege in life—and for viewers who may pat themselves on the back for their broadmindedness -- to not acknowledge the struggles of the trans women of color who have not been as readily accepted despite their historical activism in the movement.

Buttigieg approached this as the protesters were removed: ""I do want to acknowledge what these demonstrators were speaking about, which is the epidemic of violence against black trans women in this country right now."" Ending that epidemic, he said, requires ""lifting up its visibility and speaking to it.""

To his credit, Cooper took a moment to applaud the protesters for their demonstration and acknowledge the lack of media coverage given to the trans community.

Cooper was right: If tens of cisgender gay white males were murdered in a year, it would undoubtedly garner much more media attention.

We should credit the candidates who were asked about their strategy to stop men from killing trans women of color (as one audience member yelled while Senator Kamala Harris was on stage) for at least being well versed on the issue. They spoke of the need to have a Department of Justice that seriously investigated these crimes. They spoke of the need to have an education secretary who was committed to protecting transgender students, something the current secretary has been reluctant to do. More importantly they looked these disenfranchised women in their eyes and they listened to their pain, something the community at large has not been particularly good at doing since the decline of AIDS.

Historically, because of family rejection and housing discrimination , many transgender people do not have the resources to attend a fabulous fundraiser with the promise of one-on-one time with a candidate. In fact, because of these civil rights violations, many must turn to sex work just to survive, a predicament that makes them vulnerable to the violence that has led to so many deaths.

They have been reliant on their gay and lesbian brothers and sisters with deep pockets to take their concerns up the socioeconomic ladder and quite honestly, they have been sorely let down.

Consumed with marriage equality, iconography, and heteronormativity, much of the past 50 years in the movement has been an exercise in white, cisgender, gay advancement despite its black and Latino transgender beginnings. Because of this, the policy improvements the candidates proposed on this historic night are somewhat secondary to the fundamental fight that still needs to be fought.

The long-standing running joke used to be that when it came to the LGBT movement, the T was silent. As uncomfortable as it was at times, on this historic night, that was not the case—and an important step."

Sen. Elizabeth Warren promised her nominee to the Department of Education would have to earn the approval of a nine-year-old child who claimed to be transgender.

The invited child, flanked by the mother, asked, “What are you doing … to make sure that kids like me feel safer in schools? And what do you think schools need to do better to make sure that I don’t have to worry about anything but my homework?”

Warren responded:

So let me start by saying, I want to have a secretary of education who both believes in public education and believes in the value of every one of our kids, and is willing to enforce our civil rights laws. It turns out that when the Department of Education was set up many years ago, the secretary of education was given a whole lot of power over the public schools, and over the rules and how they’re enforced. And we’ve had some secretaries of education who’ve been better. And we’ve had one that’s been a whole lot worse. Her name is Betsy DeVos. And when I’m President, she’ll be gone. And here’s my plan … I’m going to find just the right secretary of education. But here’s what I plan to do. I want to make sure that the person I think is the right secretary of education meets you and hears your story. And then I want you to tell me if you think that’s the right person, and then we’ll make the deal. Does that sound good?

“The Equality Act is essential,” said New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, referring to the House-passed Equality Act, which would establish the transgender ideology as law, and so outlaw and stigmatize any recognition of the complementary differences of women and men.

“If we can get five [Senate] votes, we will pass the Equality Act the next day,” said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. “We urgently need an Equality Act,” said Mayor Pete Buttigieg. “We would pass the Equality Act right off the bat, number one,” said Joe Biden.

The candidates promised to promote the status of gay and transgender people in K-12 schools, to roll back restrictions on blood donations, to appoint gay generals, and to subordinate national diplomacy to the goal of gay acceptance. “I would, in fact, curtail aid, curtail foreign assistance to countries who, in fact, engage in this kind of [anti-gay] behavior,” said Biden.

The audience picked by the pr0-transgender HRC was delighted with the river of promises and praise. “This means the world to all of us … I cannot believe this is happening,” said activist Julia Goldman, an author of a podcast about gay politics.

The Pentagon must treat male soldiers as if they are women once they say they are transgender, said Buttigieg. “The trans military ban is an outrage … That is dead wrong … I will put an end to that,” he said.

Religious rights must end when “religion is being used an excuse to harm other people,” Buttigieg said. Religious-based opposition to gay status “makes God smaller … It is an insult to faith to believe it can be used to hurt people in that way,” he said.

Religious groups must agree to arrange adoptions for gay couples, said Klobuchar. “You have got to have agencies that follow the law … You have got to [endorse] adoptions for gay families,” she said.

Conservatives & (some) feminists agree biology shapes our personalities & politics.

Warren jeered at critics of single-sex marriage and transgenderism. One questioner asked her:

Senator, thank you for being here. Now, let’s say you’re on the campaign trail, and a supporter approaches you and says, “Senator, I’m old-fashioned. And my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.” What is your response?” Well, I’m going to assume it’s a guy who said that. I’m going to say, just marry one woman. Assuming you can find one!

A moment later, Warren declared her deep belief in charity towards other people:

It’s about what I learned in the church I grew up, in first song I ever remember singing: “There is yellow, black and white, they are precious in His sight. Jesus loves all the children in the world.” … That was the basis of the faith that I grew up in. And it truly is about the preciousness of each and every life, it is about the worth of every human being.

Former California Attorney General, Kamala Harris, boasted of her refusal to defend California’s marriage law in 2008 from advocates for single-sex marriage.

Tom Steyer backed body-changing drugs for teenagers who say they are transgender. “All of that care should be available for all transgender youth,” he said. “It has to be part of the public [healthcare] option I believe in … It is an absolute right, and this is a critical part of healthcare for these young people.”

Warren promised taxpayer funding for cosmetic surgery for people who want to live as members of the opposite sex:

I believe that everyone is entitled to medical care and medical care that they need, and that includes people who are transgender, who — it is the time for them to have gender-affirming surgery. I just think that’s important and the appropriate medical care.

CNN’s announcers excluded any possible critics or skeptical questioners who might spotlight the political risks posed by the candidates’ unreserved support for transgender ideology. That ideology would change women’s status and rights, change education rules, and girls’ sports.

Amy Klobuchar provided the only moment of disagreement when she declined to endorse a call for legal prostitution. “I am not in favor of demineralizing all of sex work,” she said, but quickly backtracked, “but I’d love to talk with you for a few minutes and see if we can find common ground going forward.”

The only loud opposition came from several attendees who described themselves as black transgender women, including one named Blossom. A second person rebuked one CNN announcer for a mispronouncing the person’s name, saying, “it is violence to ‘misgender’ or to alter the name of a transperson.” A group interrupted the event to chant about “black trans” lives.

But Beto O’Rourke pushed the envelope.

“Discrimination” against people who are homosexual or transgender cannot be tolerated, he said. “There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone, any institution… that denies the human rights and full civil rights of every single one of us.”

He promised cheap anti-AIDS medicine: “We’ll bring down that cost … We will take over that patent and make sure it is distributed to every person in America.”

Mental-health professionals should not be allowed to guide adults or children who prefer to detransition from transgender status or to change homosexual feelings. “Conversion therapy … should be illegal,” O’Rourke said. “As president, I will seek to outlaw it everywhere in this country … this is tantamount to torture — a torture we visit on children who are absolutely defenseless,” he said.

Beto also promised a new policy to counter the murder of black transgender women, saying, “they will be the guide on this issue — they will direct our policy.” Countering the murders is “a matter of restoring the very fabric of America,” he said."

But she still needs to win over black voters,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/10/politics/elizabeth-warren-black-voters/index.html,"Charleston, South Carolina (CNN) At an annual awards dinner hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington, DC, last month, Rev. Jesse Jackson watched as a stream of attendees walked over to one 2020 Democratic candidate, looking to shake her hand, chat and take a photo together.

It was Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , being approached ""all night long,"" Jackson said: ""People coming across the room to get a picture.""

The overwhelmingly positive reception that Warren received at the black-tie CBC gala wasn't the first time the senator has stood out this year at a forum of a largely black audience. Warren received a standing ovation at the ""She The People"" conference this summer as she presented her idea for bringing down the maternal mortality rate among black women ; in June, Jackson lavished her with praise at the Rainbow Push conference; and Warren appeared to be a crowd favorite at Al Sharpton's National Action Network conference in April, when she spoke about the acute challenges facing African-American homeowners.

But as Warren continues a steady climb in the national polls and now shares the front-runner status with former Vice President Joe Biden, Warren confronts a tough political reality. Those standout moments, coupled with public praise from African American leaders and activists, have yet to fully translate to support among black voters

According to a Quinnipiac national poll released on Tuesday, Warren is the top-choice candidate for 20% of black Democratic or Democratic-leaning voters. It is a notable improvement from the 10% support Warren had among black voters in an August Quinnipiac survey, but Biden still remains well ahead in support among blacks, at 36%.

Whether Warren can continue to improve her standing with this critical demographic group will be particularly important in the early voting state of South Carolina. A recent CNN poll showed Biden with a strong lead in the state, with the support of 45% of black likely primary voters. The same survey showed Warren with only 4% support among black voters in the state.

In an earlier Quinnipiac poll released at the end of September, seven in 10 black voters said they would be ""excited"" if Warren were the Democratic nominee, and 60% said they had a favorable view of the senator. But around two in 10 black voters said they still had not heard enough about Warren to have a favorable or unfavorable view of her. In contrast, 70% of those black voters said they had a favorable view of Biden, and only 5% said they hadn't heard enough about the former vice president to have a positive or negative opinion of him.

It has not gone unnoticed that some of Warren's events in South Carolina have featured largely white audiences. And despite the warm reception at the CBC dinner, Warren has not received endorsements from any black lawmakers in that caucus, unlike Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris.

On Wednesday, after another ""walking tour"" through a Charleston, South Carolina, neighborhood, Warren held a roundtable meeting with local residents, activists and leaders.

Asked by CNN how she would win over black voters who are far more familiar with Biden, Warren responded: ""I'm showing up, because I think that's really important -- showing up and shaking hands and talking with people.""

State Sen. Marlon Kimpson, who joined Warren in the discussion and applauded her for visiting his constituents, told reporters that he believes Biden has a ""head start"" with black voters because of name recognition.

""But I caution all candidates: Things in the rear mirror are closer than they appear. It's a wide-open race, there are some built-in advantages based on name recognition, but all candidates including the vice president has to make the case,"" said Kimpson, who has not yet made an endorsement.

According to Jackson, who himself ran for President twice in the 1980s, he and Warren speak ""quite often."" The civil rights activists told CNN in an interview the senator has reached out to him periodically as she has mounted a bid for the White House.

""She appears to be fearless,"" Jackson said. He has not endorsed in the Democratic primary and said he is undecided on whether he will publicly back someone before the Iowa caucuses. ""People hear her and they respond to her. She has the capacity to arouse the base.""

""It's not enough to talk about black people as if we're a monolith""

The Warren campaign has sought to reach out to the black community through its policy plans.

From her student loan debt forgiveness plan to her housing proposal to plans on closing private prisons and assisting entrepreneurs of color, Warren has integrated measures aimed specifically at African Americans in many of her policy outlines. Asked about outreach the senator has been doing this year to the black community, the campaign also pointed to ""listening sessions"" she has held with black activists and leaders throughout the year, including in Philadelphia ahead of the Netroots Nation conference.

And even as early as the spring, Warren was spending time in the south, in states that hold contests in March after the all-important early states. In March, she visited the Mississippi Delta for a ""walking tours"" of Cleveland and Greenville, Mississippi, to promote her rural housing plan, and also held campaign events in Tennessee and Alabama.

Ashlee Marie Preston, an African American transgender activist who has endorsed Warren, said she spoke with several other Democratic candidates before settling on Warren. It was in some ways an unexpected choice, she said, particularly given that there are two black candidates in the Democratic race: Sens. Harris and Cory Booker.

""I think it's easy to talk about racism in America -- it's another thing to be specific about the different layers about structural racism and systemic racism and how it continues to stand as a barrier to the poor and disenfranchised communities,"" Preston said. ""It's not enough to talk about black people as if we're a monolith.""

Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families Party, which endorsed Warren last month, echoed Preston's sentiment.

""Identity is important but identity is insufficient. Simply because candidates happen to occupy the same racial identity of black voters doesn't mean it's in the bag for any candidate,"" Mitchell said. ""And black voters are incredibly sophisticated. They want to understand a candidate's history, a candidate's platform.""

Other African American Warren supporters -- particularly those who have known the senator voters will for years -- insist that her standing with black voters will improve as they get to know the candidate better.

""I'm troubled by the numbers in South Carolina, only because I know that folks in South Carolina don't know her like we know her -- members of the African American community in Boston,"" said Rev. Jeffrey Brown, an associate pastor of the 12th Baptist Church in Roxbury, Massachusetts.

For years, Warren has periodically attended services at the 12th Baptist Church, one of the oldest black churches in the Boston area. Brown said Warren personally calls to give him a heads-up before attending Sunday services, and that while he has asked her on multiple occasions to speak to the congregation, she has largely declined.

Remarking upon the Bible that Warren brings to church -- ""What I love about her Bible is that it's not brand new. And I've seen it. I've looked at it. It's a well-worn thing"" -- Brown said it is what he sees as the senator's understanding of the unique needs of African-Americans that leads him to believe that there is room for black support for Warren to grow.

But the reality is that Warren has less than four months left to introduce herself to black voters across the country and intensively court them, in contrast to the years she has had to get to know black voters in Massachusetts.

""I wish I could go down to South Carolina to some of these places and say look -- this is not a show... She's a real advocate for us,"" said Brown, who added he is ""a thousand percent"" behind Warren's candidacy. ""I wish I could go down there to some southern churches and preach about that."""

The surgery, which can cost in excess of £6,000 (around $7,400) in Britain, involves taking fat from another part of the patient's body and injecting it into the buttocks, to increase their size and roundness. But there is a risk of injecting the fat into large veins, after which it can travel to the heart or brain, causing a ""fat embolism"" and illness or death, according to the plastic surgeons' body.

According to an anonymous 2017 survey of 692 surgeons worldwide , 32 respondents reported fatalities and 103 cited non-fatal cases of fat embolism.

""I am still concerned about patient death,"" Harris told CNN, saying people were opting for the procedure to achieve a rounded look or a Kim Kardashian-style figure.

""At this stage there's no guarantee the fat will not travel (between the muscles, causing potential harm),"" he added.

""We don't know what it's going to look like in 20 years' time when we've pumped two liters of fat into someone's buttocks -- that's unknown. One of the questions we'll ask our members today is: 'Would you do this to your daughter?' and if you wouldn't do it to your daughter, why would you do it to a patient? And most of us wouldn't do it to our daughter.""

Of particular concern to BAAPS is plastic surgery tourism, because of countries' varying levels of safety regulation. Harris said the procedure was particularly popular in Latin America, including Brazil and Mexico, and was also performed in Turkey.

""I've just had a patient who had this procedure abroad. She didn't die, but she was septic and in intensive care -- and as a result she lost all of her fingers,"" he said. ""She was in hospital for eight months and had 23 operations. And she's the lucky one because she survived.""

When considering a ban, Harris said, BAAPS will have to consider carefully whether doing so could push more people to seek treatment overseas, prompting a potentially dangerous ""race to the bottom"" on costs and patient safety."

Kamala Harris (D-CA) said members of President Donald Trump’s administration were “violating” their oath to defend the Constitution by mounting a defense to the House’s impeachment inquiry.

On a letter she sent to members of Trump’s cabinet, Harris said, “To put everyone on notice, this is a process that is about pursuit of justice and truth and that we are not going to tolerate in our role of oversight any conduct that interferes with that process, and so we are putting members of the cabinet on notice that they have a duty and a responsibility to preserve evidence to protect whistleblowers and the inspector’s general of the various agencies and cooperate with the process. And frankly, to your point, the letter perhaps is unique because I don’t think in recent history we’ve seen the need for those kinds of obvious points to be made but with this administration. We can’t take anything for granted, especially when we’ve seen the highest elected official in our government, Donald Trump actively engaged in the suppress of evidence and the intimidation of witnesses.”

When asked about Trump’s letter to Congress saying they will not corporate with the impeachment inquiry, Harris said, “This is a moment that highlights the magnificent brilliance of the framers of our constitution and the Founders of our nation who imagined such a moment where there would be an outright and obvious, at this point, abuse of power by one branch of government, in this case, the executive branch and the need therefore for these kinds of checks and balances. So the letter today from Senator Blumenthal and myself and so many others who have stood up to stand for accountability and for our democracy is about living what our Founders imagine might be necessary, which is to have these checks and balances. But that statement is ridiculous and is clearly just another example of members of this administration who frankly are violating their oath.”

She added, “I say that purposely. It’s not like they are ignoring it or overlooking it. They are violating it. They took an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. And I think it is clear that there are enemies who are American citizens, enemies to our democracy. This is a moment where everyone should have the courage to stand up and speak to the values of our Constitution and our democracy and our system of justice.”

Why did the network let him walk it over to The New Yorker, where he eventually won a Pulitzer Prize for the reporting, instead of airing it on TV?

NBC executives say Farrow simply didn't have any on-the-record, on-camera reporting to broadcast. The executives say they supported Farrow for months, but his draft script wasn't up to NBC standards, and they didn't want to stand in his way when he saw an opportunity to get the story published in print.

Farrow doesn't buy it. Neither does his former producer Rich McHugh. They have their suspicions about what happened, and now Farrow is sharing it all publicly in a book called ""Catch and Kill.""

CNN Business obtained an advance copy of the book, which comes out next week. In it, Farrow describes ""odd signals"" from NBC executives and suggests that the network's own secrets weighed on the network's judgments. One of the network's biggest stars, Matt Lauer, was having sexual relationships with co-workers, and Weinstein knew it, according to anonymous sources he cites in the book.

""NBC denied any threat was communicated"" by Weinstein or American Media Inc, the publisher of the National Enquirer , Farrow wrote. He doesn't seem to have any proof of an explicit deal between Weinstein and NBC management. But he has many reasons to be suspicious.

Ultimately, he says, his reporting effort was shut down for reasons that were not journalistic. He presents evidence of a purported deal that Weinstein claimed to have with NBC, which the network denies. In a new interview with the Washington Post , he calls it a ""corporate coverup.""

NBC News chairman Andy Lack pushed back on Farrow's interpretation of events in a Wednesday afternoon memo to staffers. He said Farrow's book ""uses a variety of tactics to paint a fundamentally untrue picture"" about NBC's handling of the Weinstein probe.

A representative for Farrow responded, ""the claims by NBC's senior management about Ronan Farrow's reporting are simply not true, as his book will methodically demonstrate.""

In the book, Farrow says ""there was no doubt that the allegations against Lauer, and NBC's wider use of nondisclosure agreements with women who experienced harassment, were under threat of exposure during our reporting. That precarious culture of secrecy made NBC more vulnerable to Harvey Weinstein's intimidation and enticement, delivered through lawyers, and intermediaries, and calls to"" multiple executives up and down the corporate chain of command.

NBC has previously acknowledged that Weinstein badgered NBC executives and pursued all sorts of avenues to shut down Farrow's investigation. The network says it resisted all of the pressure.

But Farrow's book, drawing from anonymous sources, says Weinstein was under the impression that he had successfully spiked the investigation: ""Weinstein told one of his legal advisors that he'd spoken to executives at the network, and that 'they tell me they're not doing the story.'"" This occurred, Farrow says, before he was told the story was tabled.

People on the calls with Weinstein came to the clear conclusion that a deal was struck, Farrow adds.

NBC says there was not. It is certainly possible that Weinstein spoke with network executives and came away with a different understanding than they did. The heads of news divisions sometimes find themselves in positions where they listen to aggrieved sources and try to calm the person down, without actually making any promises or ordering any changes.

Farrow also points to a business relationship between Weinstein and American Media, which had been writing stories about Lauer's love life for years. He even describes a September 2017 meeting between Weinstein and National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard, where the two men looked at the dirt the Enquirer had accumulated about Lauer.

""The story presented by Mr. Farrow, while dramatic, is inaccurate,"" an AMI spokesperson told CNN Business.

NBC News said in a statement that the news division ""was never contacted by AMI, or made aware in any way of any threats from them, or from anyone else, for that matter. And the idea of NBC News taking a threat seriously from a tabloid company about Matt Lauer is especially preposterous, since they already covered him with great regularity.""

By September, though, NBC had already freed Farrow to take his investigation to The New Yorker, where it was ultimately published in October, five days after The New York Times published its own investigation into Weinstein's abusive conduct.

He said, he said

The timeline of Farrow's reporting stretches back to the start of 2017, when Farrow was working on multiple investigative projects for NBC, to be shown on Lauer's ""Today"" show and other network newscasts.

He was interested in stories about sexual harassment in Hollywood, and NBC News president Noah Oppenheim suggested he contact the actress Rose McGowan, who had been tweeting about her encounter with an unnamed movie mogul.

Before long Farrow was hearing about Weinstein and decades' worth of alleged abuse. But it proved to be very difficult to convince anyone to speak on camera on the record. This was a testament, Farrow writes, to the fear that Weinstein instilled in his employees: Multiple sources wanted to be interviewed in shadow, disguising their identities from the television audience.

McGowan was an exception: She spoke on the record, on camera, in chilling fashion. But she did not explicitly name Weinstein as her attacker.

Later, she hesitated about letting Farrow air her comments at all. According to Farrow, she grew ""uncomfortable with the delays"" and concerned about ""things she'd heard about the people there"" at NBC. McGowan — who struck a settlement agreement with Weinstein in 1997 — had her lawyers send a cease-and-desist demand to NBC.

At the heart of the matter is a fascinating series of arguments about what is publishable, when, and in what form. And both Farrow and NBC have compelling cases to make.

What Farrow interpreted as slow-walking his explosive scoop, NBC executives cast as an act of journalistic responsibility.

What Farrow describes as a lack of enthusiasm about his reporting, others describe as appropriate skepticism.

So was what happened with Farrow and NBC just the natural push and pull between reporter and editor, between employee and supervisor?

Or was NBC News trying to cover up Weinstein's conduct? Was NBC's parent company, Comcast, trying to protect relationships in Hollywood?

Farrow strongly hints at these latter possibilities. He notes that Weinstein had relationships right up to the top of Comcast, where CEO Brian Roberts had known the media mogul for years.

But he doesn't have smoking gun evidence of a quid pro quo — something to the effect of Weinstein saying ""back off of me, or I'll expose Lauer.""

And Farrow says that Roberts later apologized to him for NBC's handling of his investigation.

Throughout ""Catch and Kill,"" Farrow brings up his workplace interactions with Lauer, reminding readers that Lauer would be fired for sexual misconduct less than two months after the Weinstein investigations came out.

Farrow has new interviews with several of Lauer's accusers, including the first on-the-record interview with Brooke Nevils, who alleges that Lauer raped her during a 2014 work trip in Russia. Lauer categorically denied her claims in an open letter on Wednesday.

Farrow points the finger at what he calls a ""network news culture that made women feel uncomfortable and unsafe, and left little room for accountability around its larger-than-life stars.""

And he questions NBC's own use of contracts to keep alleged wrongdoing a secret, given that he was trying to reveal Weinstein's use of the same types of contracts.

In the book, Farrow quotes at length from his interactions with Oppenheim and others at NBC. At times, Farrow says, Oppenheim was very interested in the progress he was making; at other times, he writes, Oppenheim seemed indifferent.

""I still don't think Harvey Weinstein's a name the 'Today' show audience knows,"" he quotes Oppenheim saying after he turned in a lengthy draft script in July. ""And anyway,"" Oppenheim is quoted saying, ""where would we even air it? This looks long.""

Farrow was getting more and more concerned about getting scooped by The Times. But he says NBC executives didn't share his sense of urgency.

He quotes Rich Greenberg, the executive editor of the NBC News investigative unit, telling him that ""sometimes it's best to let someone else go first.""

Through an NBC spokesperson, Greenberg and Oppenheim declined to comment on Farrow's account.

Farrow's frustration

Farrow grew frustrated as the reporting was held up by a legal review process. Such a review is standard practice in the news business, particularly when a litigious figure like Weinstein is involved.

Again, it all comes down to interpretation — was NBC supporting Farrow by making sure the story was buttoned up, or was his reporting being shelved?

When NBCUniversal's general counsel Kim Harris undertook her own review of the reporting, Oppenheim told Farrow that Harris would ""tell us what we can really be bulletproof in saying, what can hold up in court,"" according to Farrow.

But in the meantime, Farrow was told to ""pause"" his efforts to gain additional corroboration, including a new interview with McGowan.

By mid-August, network executives had determined that Farrow did not have enough evidence against Weinstein to merit a story. ""Right now, we can't run this,"" Oppenheim told him.

Farrow also quotes Oppenheim telling him ""you're too close to this,"" meaning, too emotionally invested in the accusers' accounts.

He gave Farrow a green light to take the reporting to a magazine, bringing up New York magazine as a potential example and essentially telling him to take the story elsewhere.

Farrow took it to the The New Yorker magazine , where editor David Remnick was immediately interested in what he had.

(L-R) Ronan Farrow, Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer

When the magazine published Farrow's reporting, and people asked why Farrow hadn't broadcast it on NBC, Oppenheim told staffers, ""we didn't feel that we had all the elements that we needed to air it.""

""We supported him and gave him resources to report that story over many, many months,"" Oppenheim said at the time. ""The notion that we would try to cover for a powerful person is deeply offensive to all of us.""

That's been the consistent explanation from NBC ever since.

As Farrow has become more critical of his former employer in public, NBC executives have become more critical of him suggesting that he overstated some of his reporting and cut corners along the way.

McHugh, who left NBC last year, has stood firmly in Farrow's corner, pointing out that the network had ""an exclusive audio recording of Harvey Weinstein admitting to sexual assault,"" among other evidence.

This tape was of a 2015 NYPD sting operation, when model Ambra Gutierrez recorded Weinstein pleading with her to come up to his hotel room and she was heard resisting him. At one point, Gutierrez asked him, ""Why did you touch my breast?"" Weinstein responded by saying sorry and ""I'm used to that."" A moment later, he added, ""I won't do it again.""

The tape was handed over to the District Attorney in Manhattan at the time, but the D.A. office determined it was insufficient to prove a crime had occurred, a decision that remains deeply controversial.

According to Farrow, Oppenheim commented that the existence of the tape was not national news. NBC News has come under fire from media critics for sitting on the tape for months and not airing it; in response, the network has pointed out that The New Yorker later possessed the tape for nearly two months a month before publishing it.

Ultimately the tape was a key piece of the fact pattern laid out in Farrow's story for The New Yorker.

According to NBC, his ultimate story for the magazine ""bore little resemblance to the reporting he had while at NBC News."" In other words, Farrow was able to find new sources and evidence after he left NBC.

But Farrow asserts that he had an eminently reportable story, ready to go, and that NBC quashed it.

""NBC killed the Weinstein story,"" Farrow's partner Jon Lovett tweeted on Wednesday. ""It was a historic mistake. Over and over and over again, NBC told Ronan to stop reporting. I heard it myself! Phones have speakers!""

But in Wednesday's memo, Lack stood by the August 2017 decision.

""Here are the essential and indisputable facts: NBC News assigned the Harvey Weinstein story to Ronan, we completely supported it over many months with resources -- both financial and editorial,"" Lack wrote. ""After seven months, without one victim or witness on the record, he simply didn't have a story that met our standard for broadcast nor that of any major news organization. Not willing to accept that standard and not wanting to get beaten by the New York Times, he asked to take his story to an outlet he claimed was ready to publish right away. Reluctantly, we allowed him to go ahead.""

Farrow's representative responded by saying that ""relevant sections of the book confirm not only how many women were named, but also how much proof Ronan had gathered. Importantly, it documents the lengths to which NBC executives went to thwart the reporting efforts of Ronan and his producer Rich McHugh and why they did so.""

Lack's memo also defended the news division by noting its other investigations ""into sexual harassment and abuse on many stories -- many pre-dating Weinstein -- including USA Gymnastics, Silicon Valley, Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, and more.""

To get across the finish line on big stories like these takes exceptional work, collaboration, patience, and a commitment to a set of standards and practices that ultimately lends our work great credibility,"" Lack wrote. ""If you have any questions about the journalistic decisions that were made, please don't hesitate to ask.""

Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the source of a cease-and-desist letter involving McGowan."

The remark came after Buttigieg, who is the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, was asked about whether bullying that causes suicide should have legal ramifications.

“I believe it’s one of the things that could help,” Buttigieg said. “There are still states — I live in one of them — that don’t have hate crime legislation.”

“And we need to make sure that our legislation reflects our values as a country and the insistence that nobody be singled out or harmed because of who they are,” Buttigieg said.

He continued:

But that’s just the beginning of what we’ve got to do for LGBTQ youth. We know that LGBTQ youth are much more likely to experience homelessness, which is one of the reasons why we need to invest more in youth homelessness in general and do the opposite of what this president is doing, which is allowing rules to go forward that would actually make it harder for transgender youth to access homeless services.

“That is just wrong, and it will end in my administration,” Buttigieg said.

In fact, while the HUD rule — posted in spring 2019 — does allow for shelters to make decisions based on privacy and safety, it specifically states that discrimination based on “sexual orientation and gender identity” will not take place:

This proposed rule provides that grant recipients, subrecipients, owners, operators, managers, and providers (Shelter Providers) under HUD programs which permit single-sex or sex-segregated facilities (such as bathrooms or temporary, emergency shelters and other buildings and facilities with physical limitations or configurations that require and are permitted to have shared sleeping quarters or bathing facilities) may establish a policy, consistent with state and local law, by which such Shelter Provider considers an individual’s sex for the purposes of determining accommodation within such shelters and for purposes of determining sex for admission to any facility or portion thereof. The proposed rule permits Shelter Providers to consider a range of factors in making such determinations, including privacy, safety, practical concerns, religious beliefs, any relevant considerations under civil rights and nondiscrimination authorities , the individual’s sex as reflected in official government documents, as well as the gender which a person identifies with. The proposed rule does not dictate a required basis for making determinations other than that they be consistent with an overall policy. The proposed rule continues HUD’s policy of ensuring that its programs are open to all eligible individuals and families regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.

Buttigieg joined eight other Democrat candidates at the marathon town hall, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), as well as former HUD Secretary Julian Castro (D), former Vice President Joe Biden (D), former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX), and Tom Steyer (D).

“The problem that we’ve got is that the judge is allowing input of evidence of every injury that Planned Parenthood and their allies suffered at the hands of the negative public relations, and yet not allowing us to even put in the videos that the public was reacting to,” Peter Breen of the Thomas More Society told Breitbart News in an interview.

“So, there’s a principle in the law that has been recognized that David and his team are not responsible for the reaction to the contents of the video,” he continued:

And, so, the reaction of the public is, to some extent, not relevant to the damages that are being claimed by Planned Parenthood. But the judge is letting those in. He’s letting them talk all about their, you know the terrible public relations they took. But at the same time, we’ve not been able, thus far, to show any of the videos that caused this great public reaction. And Planned Parenthood is trying to get damages, after the publication of the videos that they say weren’t caused by the public reactions.

Daleiden himself tweeted the judge’s decision to prevent the jury from seeing the videos is a violation of “due process”:

BREAKING: major due process violations in trial vs @PPFA as PP convinces Judge Orrick to BAN us from showing the jury the exact video conversations that PP is suing for! How can @CtrMedProgress witness on stand rebut false PP claims re: “privacy” without playing the convos?! #1A — David Daleiden (@daviddaleiden) October 8, 2019

Breen said the problem for his team is they need to show public reaction to the videos, which depicted top-level Planned Parenthood officials haggling over the price of body parts of aborted babies, was “overwhelming.”

“And there’s good reason for it, because the videos, showed evidence of terrible crimes and the willingness to commit those crimes by top officials at Planned Parenthood,” he said. “We’re fighting as hard as we can, but based on the recent rulings, we’re having a fight with one hand tied behind our back, possibly both.”

As the Federalist reported, in opening statements, Judge William Orrick of U.S. District Court in San Francisco instructed the jury the case “is not about the truth of whether plaintiffs profited from the sale of fetal tissue or otherwise violated the law in securing tissue for those programs.”

“Those issues are a matter of dispute between the parties in the world outside this courtroom,” the judge added.

Breen told Breitbart News:

Imagine what it is going to be like for these jurors to sit through six weeks of Planned Parenthood talking about all the terrible things that happened to them, none of which should be relevant to damages. And yet, we’re going to be unable to talk about why those things were actually happening, in defense.

“Unfortunately, it’s starting to look like we’re engaged in a game of heads Planned Parenthood wins, tails we lose – on the presentation of evidence,” Breen added.

Daleiden reported as well on Center for Medical Progress’s (CMP) website:

At Planned Parenthood’s request, Judge Orrick refused to allow the Defense to show the jury the exact video conversations that Planned Parenthood is suing for. It is the jury’s job to assess whether the conversations are “private” or “confidential” under applicable state law–yet Planned Parenthood and Judge Orrick are barring the actual recordings of these conversations from the courtroom. Adrian Lopez, one of CMP’s undercover investigators, took the witness stand and was accused by Planned Parenthood of videotaping so-called “private” conversations at a National Abortion Federation trade show in Baltimore, MD, yet defense attorney Paul Jonna was not allowed to play video of the conversation itself, a graphic discussion with Plaintiff Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast leadership, to allow Lopez and CMP to defend against Planned Parenthood’s accusation. Ironically, Planned Parenthood was allowed to play multiple recordings of undercover conversations during their questioning.

Planned Parenthood initially sought over $20 million in damages, but those damages have since been reduced to several hundred thousands of dollars, in addition to legal and attorney fees, which could yet run into millions of dollars.

In a separate criminal case against Daleiden and Sandra Merritt, the CMP colleagues are the first undercover journalists to be criminally prosecuted in the history of the state of California.

Daleiden and Merritt were slapped with 15 felony counts of recording confidential information without consent by the office of the California Attorney General (AG), including its past AG, current U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, and her successor, Xavier Becerra.

Harris received thousands of dollars in campaign donations from Planned Parenthood, and, subsequently, she and her office raided Daleiden’s home and seized his personal property, including his laptop, instead of prosecuting Planned Parenthood.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), a former chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, announced her endorsement of the former vice president on Tuesday, claiming to have witnessed Biden’s “fortitude” and leadership during their overlapping tenures in Congress.

Feinstein said in a statement:

I’ve worked closely with Vice President Biden and I’ve seen firsthand his legislative ability, his statesmanship, and most importantly his moral fortitud. During his time in Congress and in the White House, Joe Biden has been a tireless fighter for hard working American families.

The endorsement comes as Biden’s presidential campaign is besieged by scandal regarding the lucrative business dealings his youngest son, Hunter, had with foreign governments.

Only hours before Feinstein’s endorsement, the Chinese government announced it would not investigate how Hunter Biden ended up at the center of one its top private equity firms. The Chinese foreign ministry made the decision after President Donald Trump publicly called for a probe of Hunter Biden’s dealings with Bohai Harvest RST (BHR). In particular, Trump has noted that the circumstances surrounding BHR’s creation could have posed a conflict of interest for Joe Biden.

As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, revealed in his bestselling book Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden inked the multibillion-dollar deal that created BHR with a subsidiary of the state-owned Bank of China in 2013.

The timing of the lucrative deal has been brought into question as it came only 12 days after Hunter visited China with his father aboard Air Force Two. Officially, the then-vice president was visiting the country amid escalating tensions over islands in the South China Sea and decided to bring his granddaughter and son along. In a March 2018 interview with Breitbart News Tonight, however, Schweizer detailed the political machinations that preceded Hunter Biden’s $1.5 billion venture with China:

In December of 2013, Vice President Joe Biden flies to Asia for a trip, and the centerpiece for that trip is a visit to Beijing, China. To put this into context, in 2013, the Chinese have just exerted air rights over the South Pacific, the South China Sea. They basically have said, ‘If you want to fly in this area, you have to get Chinese approval. We are claiming sovereignty over this territory.’ Highly controversial in Japan, in the Philippines, and in other countries. Joe Biden is supposed to be going there to confront the Chinese. Well, he gets widely criticized on that trip for going soft on China. For basically not challenging them, and Japan and other countries are quite upset about this.

Since its creation, BHR has invested heavily in energy and defense projects across the globe. As of June, Hunter Biden was still involved with BHR, sitting on its board of directors and owning a minority stake of the fund estimated to be worth more than $430,000.

Such dealings at the center of politics and business, while perhaps not illegal, are not exclusive to the Biden family alone. As a few noted at the time of Feinstein’s endorsement, the senator and her husband have their own close ties to the communist country.

During her tenure as mayor of San Francisco in the late-1970s and early-1980s, Feinstein took advantage of the newly normalized diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China by establishing one of the first sister city partnership between San Francisco and Shanghai. Through that partnership, Feinstein led trade delegations to China in which she and her husband, Richard Blum, became acquainted with some of the country’s most prominent political leaders.

As the Federalist noted in August 2018, Feinstein and her husband leveraged those relationships to boost their own wealth. In 1986, Feinstein and Jiang Zemin — the then-mayor of Shanghai, who would later ascend to the presidency of the People’s Republic of China — “designated several corporate entities for fostering commercial relations.” One of those firms was Shanghai Pacific Partners, which employed Blum as a director. Blum reportedly had an interest of upwards of $500,000 in a project backed by Shanghai Pacific Partners.

After Feinstein was elected to the Senate in 1992, Blum continued profiting off their ties to China. A the same time, the freshman lawmaker was pitching herself as a “China hand” to colleagues, even once claiming “that in my last life maybe I was Chinese.” Through her seat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Feinstein led the fight on a number of initiatives seen as being favorable to China, including granting the country permanent most-favored-nation trading status in 2000.

Despite Feinstein and her husband having a close relationship with Jiang, the Chinese government targeted the senator as part of its espionage operations. In the early 2000s, the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) recruited a longtime employee of the senator to gather information about the inner workings of her congressional and district offices. Feinstein only learned of the staffer’s duplicity in 2013, after he’d already been on her payroll for more than 20 years.

“While this person, who was a liaison to the local Chinese community, was fired, charges were never filed against him,” Politico reported in 2018, speculating that because “the staffer was providing political intelligence and not classified information—making prosecution far more difficult.”

Apart from the convoluted history of the senator’s ties to China, the political timing of Feinstein’s endorsement also caught many off guard. The California Democrat, who hosted a fundraiser on Biden’s behalf last week alongside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) daughter, is only the most recent figure from the Democrat establishment to openly pledge support for the former vice president. Feinstein’s endorsement, however, was not totally expected, especially since her seamate, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), is mounting a bid of her own for the Democrat nomination. In fact, earlier this year, Feinsten flirted with the notion of remaining neutral in the 2020 contest out of respect for Harris.

Compounding the political picture is that most polls show Biden no longer the favorite to win California, having fallen behind Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).

Feinstein, however, did not address any of that when endorsing the former vice president on Tuesday. Instead, the senator offered platitudes about Biden’s work to enhance gun control and how his campaign was a “fight to restore the soul of the nation.”"

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), on Wednesday, arguing that the country is “not electing a planner.”

While the top-tier candidates in the Democrat primary field have largely refrained from taking deep digs at one another, Biden signaled that he may switch strategies.

“We’re not electing a planner,” Biden said in New Hampshire on Wednesday, in an apparent reference to Warren. “I’ve been there. I know what it takes to get it done.”

Warren has made “I have a plan for that” a catchphrase of her campaign, claiming to have solutions for virtually every major problem the country faces and outlining those broad plans in a series of Medium posts over the course of her campaign. Most of Warren’s plans contain a common thread, incorporating aspects from additional proposals within her political arsenal.

Warren has unveiled a $3 trillion climate change proposal inspired by former presidential candidate and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), a plan focused entirely on “honoring and empowering tribal nations and Indigenous peoples,” and a proposal to “end corruption in Washington.”

In August, Warren released her comprehensive criminal justice reform plan, which emphasized protections for “special populations” — such as LGBT individuals — and called for the elimination of private prisons.

In September, Warren added to her ultra-progressive agenda, promising to raise Social Security benefits by $200 per month. She said she would pay for it by taxing the “wealthy” — specifically, by increasing the Social Security contribution requirement to 14.8 percent for individuals making $250,000 per year, and splitting the 14.8 percent “equally between employees and employers at 7.4 percent each.”

Most recently, Warren released a plan to address “environmental injustice” and “environmental racism” across the country.

Biden’s jab comes after weeks of a slow, steady surge in Warren’s favor, besting Biden in a variety of recent polls and overtaking him in the RealClearPolitics average for the first time this week.

A poll from The Economist/YouGov showed Warren topping the field with 29 percent to Biden’s 25 percent — a lead which remains outside of the +/- 2.9 percent margin of error:

Deadline reported that former Vice President Biden will attend two Hollywood fundraisers on Thursday — one in the afternoon hosted by former HBO executive Michael Lombardo, and one in the evening at the home of Paramount Pictures chairman and CEO Jim Gianopulos.

CNN’s town hall, titled Equality in America, is set to air Thursday evening, from 7:30 p.m. to 12 a.m. ET, and will feature nine Democratic presidential candidates. The event is co-organized by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, a non-profit focused on LGBTQ issues.

The town hall comes amidst increased U.S.-China tensions — a subject that hits close to home in the entertainment industry, which depends heavily on Chinese consumers to buy movie tickets and visit theme parks.

Hollywood executives have remained conspicuously quiet about U.S.-China relations in the wake of democracy protests in Hong Kong that have put global businesses including the NBA to Apple in a difficult spot.

President Donald Trump has publicly hammered Biden over his close ties with China, accusing the former Vice President and his son, Hunter, of being “paid off” by foreign interests.

Moderators of Thursday’s town hall include CNN’s Dana Bash, Anderson Cooper, Chris Cuomo, Don Lemon and Nia-Malika Henderson.

Sen. Harris (D-CA) reportedly attended a reception at The Abbey in West Hollywood on Wednesday, while Buttigieg is set to attend a fundraiser at the Belasco Theater in downtown L.A.

Deadline reported earlier this week that Buttigieg attended a separate L.A. fundraiser on Tuesday at the home of former CAA agent Michael Kives, who is now head of the investment advisory firm K5 Global.

Celebrities who were reportedly in attendance include Leonardo DiCaprio, Glenn Close, Ashton Kutcher and Paris Hilton.

Hollywood is a reliable fundraising pitstop for Democratic candidates.

Hillary Clinton made numerous L.A. visits in her failed 2016 bid for the White House, including events with mega donor and billionaire Haim Saban, the founder of Saban Entertainment.

CNN’s town hall is set to take place at the Novo, at the L.A. Live complex in downtown L.A.

Other Democratic presidential hopefuls scheduled to appear include Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Beto O’Rourke, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, Tom Steyer and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ).

Josephson, a psychiatrist and professor who led the child and adolescent psychiatry at the University of Louisville School, lost his job after speaking at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, DC, in 2017 about treating children and teens for gender dysphoria.

“I found my university turning against me for asking that question,” Josephson said. “And some of my colleagues turned against me.”

“Within weeks my university demoted me despite numerous evaluations from administrators praising my skills and what I had done in my career and my professionalism,” Josephson said. “For the next year I endured a hostile environment and then finally I was effectively fired all for simply asking a question — why is this happening?”

As Josephson spoke, a woman with a megaphone tried to drown him out by shouting repeatedly, “Go home homophobe.”

“Tolerance is very popular these days especially among people who don’t show much of it,” Josephson said.

During his remarks, Josephson said gender dysphoria is real and damaging.

“Many of these children have serious distress, anxiety, depression, and they asked me what’s the best way to treat them,” Josephson said. “As a physician who cares about their patients my answer was straightforward.”

“The best treatment is always based on the understanding of what is causing the child’s distress,” Josephson said. “What does the confusion stem from?”

“Is it a physical problem or is it an emotional problem?” Josephson said. “As a behavioral scientist I could not bring myself to say this is just something that happens.”

“We do not approach any other medical condition that way, and we didn’t need to approach this one that way,” Josephson said. “We need to understand a condition before we plan treatment for it.”

“But I soon found out that ‘why’ is not a question a doctor can asked these days at least when it comes to gender dysphoria,” Josephson said.

The Heritage Foundation’s Daily Signal reported that Josephson said academia is failing in its purpose of educating students.

Josephson said in the Daily Signal report:

Universities are supposed to be places where you can exchange ideas and vigorous discussion, go back and forth. This marketplace of ideas as a metaphor is great, and that’s how science proceeds. That’s how we make progress. Unfortunately, many academic settings, including my own, are becoming more of an activist setting—meaning you’re not testing ideas, promoting the results of research; you’re asking for someone to agree with you, essentially.

“Josephson cautioned that universities need to stop being about groupthink and instead embrace debate and differences of opinion,” the Daily Signal reported.

“Today’s social activism is overriding academic inquiry and the search for truth and worst of all its overriding the well being of many patients,” Josephson said on the steps of the High Court, where several women held signs to support him that read “Protect Fairness for Women” and “#SexNotGender.”

Josephson warned Supreme Court justices of the gravity of their decision in three cases, one by a man who was fired from his job at a funeral home when he told his boss he was going to change his name and dress as a woman and two others by homosexual men who said they were fired because of their sexual orientation.

“If the Supreme Court reads gender identity into federal law, a lot of people will be silenced or punished for their views,” Josephson said. “I’m living proof of that.”

These cases are Bostock v. Clayton County Georgia, No. 17-1618; Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda, No. 17-1623; and R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc. v. EEOC, No. 18-107 in the Supreme Court of the United States.

Schweizer and McLeod provide further details on the investments former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, facilitated via his Chinese-backed investment firm.

In 2013, less than two weeks after accompanying his father on an official visit to Beijing–and despite his lack of pertinent expertise–Hunter Biden secured $1 billion (later raised to $1.5 billion) from the state-owned Bank of China for his newly formed investment firm, Bohai Harvest RST (BHR). This was in addition to the first-of-its-kind deal the Chinese government awarded Biden’s private equity firm Rosemont Seneca in the recently formed Shanghai Free-Trade Zone, a deal that allowed the firm to focus on international acquisitions.

“With the backing of the state-owned Bank of China, one of the country’s ‘big four’ financial institutions, BHR had access to the types of deals that most Western firms only dreamed of, including IPOs of state-owned companies,” Schweizer and McLeod write, noting that Biden’s firm “invested in strategically sensitive assets in both China and the United States.”

They write:

In December 2014, BHR became an “anchor investor” in the IPO of China General Nuclear Power Company (CGN), a state-owned nuclear company involved in the development of nuclear reactors. Not only is CGN a strategically important company in China, it was also facing legal scrutiny in the United States. In 2016, CGN was charged with espionage by the Justice Department for stealing US nuclear secrets. As a “cross-border” investment fund, Bohai Harvest was interested in making deals outside of China. In 2015, BHR acquired Henniges Automotive, a Michigan-based producer of vibration-dampening equipment, alongside Chinese military contractor Aviation Industry Corp. of China (AVIC). Given the military applications of Henniges’ technology, the deal required federal approval. Like CGN, AVIC was suspected of stealing US technology for its purposes. Not long after the Henniges deal closed, AVIC debuted its new J-20 fighter — incorporating designs allegedly stolen from the US’ F-35 program.

Schweizer and McLeod conclude by asking, “Did the Chinese give favorable treatment to Hunter Biden to curry favor with his vice-president father? The American public deserves to understand what exactly Hunter Biden was doing overseas and the extent of then-Vice President Biden’s involvement.”

The timing of Hunter Biden’s business deal is particularly problematic. His father was negotiating U.S. policy with China at a time when the regime’s behavior had become increasingly menacing to U.S. allies in the region. Vice President Biden’s kid-gloves treatment of China during that trip—a fact which was widely criticized by U.S. allies at the time—also raises questions in light of the lucrative business deals his son secured just two weeks later.

Biden’s BHR focused on strategic energy and defense projects, including U.S. companies specializing in technology used by our military, as Breitbart’s Haris Alic reported:

In 2015, BHR and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) — an aerospace and defense conglomerate owned and operated by the Chinese government — made a $600 million bid to purchase Henniges, a Michigan-based automotive company. The sale required approval from the Obama-Biden administration’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), as AVIC was a subsidiary of the Chinese government and Henniges produced “dual-use” anti-vibration technology with U.S. “military applications.” CFIUS, which is made up of representatives from 16 different federal bodies including the Departments of State, Treasury, and Defense, is required to review any transaction with national security implications. When the AVIC and BHR’s bid was first announced, alarm bells went off in certain sectors of the defense industry. In particular, many noted that AVIC was “reportedly involved in stealing sensitive data regarding the Joint Strike Fighter program,” which it later “reportedly incorporated … into China’s J-20 and J‑31 aircraft.” Despite the national security concerns, CFIUS approved the deal with AVIC, purchasing 51 percent of the company while BHR took ownership of the other 49 percent. Upon purchase, an industry newsletter stated the deal was the “biggest Chinese investment into US automotive manufacturing assets to date.”

The acquisition of foreign technology is a key component of China’s aggressive “Made In China 2025” (MI2025) strategy to overtake the United States economically and militarily by dominating key technologies of the future (i.e. artificial intelligence, robotics, electric vehicles, 5G telecommunications, etc.). A 2017 report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce explained the role private equity firms like Hunter Biden’s play in this strategy. The Chinese government “is injecting state funds into private equity to fund foreign acquisitions” of companies with technology identified as a priority for MI2025, according to the report.

In his extensive report last February on China’s “whole-of-state” strategy for global dominance, Florida Senator Marco Rubio also noted the communist regime’s reliance on “intellectual property acquisitions” to achieve its ambitions.

“China is becoming a significant shareholder in U.S. industries, and is selectively targeting those with strategic implications,” Matt Stoller and Lucas Kunce wrote in The American Conservative last June. Their analysis exposes the extend to which China has co-opted Wall Street against the longterm interests of the American economy and national security. For example, they write:

Jennifer M. Harris, an expert in global markets with experience at the U.S. State Department and the U.S. National Intelligence Council, researched a recent explosion of Chinese strategic investment in American technology companies. She found that China has systematically targeted U.S. greenfield investments, “technology goods (especially semiconductors), R&D networks, and advanced manufacturing.”

Hunter Biden’s attorneys told ABC News last June that Biden still sits on BHR’s board and owns a minority stake in the fund.

At his campaign rally in Minneapolis yesterday, President Trump called out Hunter Biden’s business dealings with China while his father was negotiating U.S. policy with the communist regime.

“Biden allowed China to rip off America for eight years as vice president,” Trump told the crowd. “And Barack Obama let him just rob us blind, and we are not doing that anymore. Those days are over. The Bidens got rich, and that is substantiated, while America got robbed. That’s what happened. Sleepy Joe and his friends sold out America.”

The House Democrat impeachment inquiry has brought renewed interest in the sweetheart deals Hunter Biden’s private equity firm secured while his father was vice president, as detailed in Schweizer’s 2018 bestseller Secret Empires.

Democrats allege that President Trump attempted to coerce the Ukrainians into investigating corruption charges against former Vice President Biden during a July phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart.

The allegation centers around Hunter Biden’s lucrative dealings with a Ukrainian oligarch-owned energy company at a time when his father was mediating U.S. policy towards Ukraine. The natural gas firm Burisma Holdings paid Hunter Biden over $50,000 per month for his work as a board member, despite his total lack of experience in Ukraine and the energy sector. Just a few months prior to landing this deal, Hunter Biden had been dishonorably discharged from the U.S. Navy Reserve for testing positive to cocaine use.

A Ukrainian corruption probe into Burisma Holdings was scuttled in 2016, when Vice President Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to the country if the Ukrainian government did not fire the prosecutor who launched the investigation. Withholding the loans would have thrown the former Soviet republic into insolvency at a time when it was fending off attacks from Vladimir Putin’s Russia.

Both Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky denied the Democrats claim that Trump delayed military funding to Ukrainian in order to pressure Zelensky’s government to investigate the Bidens.

The Trump White House has refused to cooperate with the Democrat impeachment inquiry, declaring it a “partisan and unconstitutional” investigation.

Advocates tracked the deaths of at least 26 transgender people in the US in 2018, according to the Human Rights Campaign . In 2019, at least 19 transgender people have been fatally shot or killed, according to HRC.

The first demonstration occurred at the start of South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg 's town hall. Buttigieg said he shared the concerns of the protesters, who shouted, ""People are dying, do something!"" and ""Trans lives matter!"" before he could answer the first question.

""I do want to acknowledge what these demonstrators are speaking about, which is the epidemic of violence against black trans women,"" Buttigieg said, prompting applause from the crowd.

""And I believe or would like to believe that everybody here is committed to ending that epidemic, and that does include lifting up ... visibility and speaking to it,"" he continued.

As protesters chanted ""Trans lives matter!"" CNN's Anderson Cooper thanked the demonstrators and said there is a long history of protest in the LGBTQ community.

""Let me just point out, there is a long and proud tradition in history in the gay, lesbian and transgender community of protest and we applaud them for their protest,"" said Cooper, who was met by applause. AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), an activist group working to end the AIDS crisis, was particularly active in protesting for access to experimental medicine to treat the virus in the 1980's and 1990's, at the height of the AIDS epidemic.

Cooper continued: ""And they are absolutely right to be angry and upset at the lack of attention, particularly in the media, of the lives of transgender"" people.

After addressing the protesters, Buttigieg said he is ""very mindful of the fact that my experience as a gay man, but as a white cis-gendered gay man, means that there are dimensions for example of what it's like to be a black trans woman that I do not personally understand. But I also think the diversity within the LGBTQ-plus community is part of what we have to offer right now.""

Bamby Salcedo, a Latina transgender activist, was among the protesters on Thursday night. She spoke up during Buttigieg's time on stage, chanting along with others, ""Trans people are dying! Do something!""

Salcedo, who serves as the president and CEO of TransLatin@ Coalition, was invited to the forum as a special guest of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The Warren campaign did not immediately comment on Salcedo's protest.

Later during the town hall, when former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke was on stage, a protester named Blossom C. Brown emerged from the crowd and took the mic from a questioner.

""Black trans women are dying, our lives matter!"" Brown said into the mic. ""I am an extraordinary black trans woman, and I deserve to be here,"" she said, and the crowd clapped.

""I am tired. I am so tired ... It's not just my black trans women, it's my black trans brothers too. And I'm going to say what I'm going to say,"" Brown added.

CNN moderator Don Lemon asked for Brown's name, and asked her to come to the stage and hand him the mic. ""Blossom, let me tell you something. The reason that we're here is to validate people like you,"" Lemon said.

He returned the mic to Brown, who then pointed out the lack of representation of black transgender people throughout the night.

""Not one black trans woman has taken the mic tonight. Not one black trans man has taken the mic tonight,"" Brown said, referring to a lack of black transgender people asking questions by that point in the town hall. (Black transgender questioners appeared later in the program.)

Lemon said, ""We're proud and happy that you're here.""

O'Rourke thanked Brown in a tweet after the exchange for ""making your voice heard tonight,"" and wrote, ""We will hold a town hall focused on trans women of color. And I hope you'll be there.""

Buttigieg and O'Rourke were one of several 2020 candidates to appear at the town hall hosted by CNN and HRCF in Los Angeles, the day before the 31st anniversary of National Coming Out Day, answering questions on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer issues.

Senator Cory Booker, the night's first speaker, was politely laughed at for not answering a yes or no question about whether religious educational institutions that oppose LGBTQ rights should lose their tax-exempt status. Senator Elizabeth Warren had the zinger of the night when asked how she'd respond to an ""old-fashioned"" supporter who told her they believe marriage is between a man and a woman. Warren quipped : ""Then just marry one woman. I'm cool with that...assuming you can find one.""

And then there was former Vice President Joe Biden who suggested the vast majority of Americans are not homophobic but instead are afraid and don't know what to do or say. He finished his time mumbling something about bathhouses. It was as awkward as it sounds.

But the night did not belong to a single candidate but rather a single topic.

Several transgender women of color held small protests inside the town hall sporadically throughout the night in hopes of drawing attention to the string of underreported murders of similar women. According to the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), which co-sponsored the event with CNN, more than 26 transgender people were murdered in 2018, most of whom were black transgender women.

So far this year HRC has reported that 19 transgender women have been killed . The lack of media coverage of these deaths is particularly jarring when juxtaposed against the frequent reminders that this year marks the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots

Those protests, in response to police persecution 50 years ago, are seen as the birth of the modern gay rights movement. And while gays and lesbians, particularly those who happen to be white, have benefited from the steady progression toward cultural acceptance, the trans women who led those protests remain mostly in the shadows.

Perhaps this is why the demonstrations began just when South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg was about to speak. Buttigieg, an openly gay cisgender white male, has become a regular on Sunday morning talk shows and is a bit of a pop culture media darling. The discussion was being moderated by Anderson Cooper, another openly gay cisgender white male who, as a public figure, has seemed to find a high level of acceptance.

There is no question that coming out and living one's truth can be a difficult journey regardless of race or gender identity. But it is far too easy for people of a station and privilege in life—and for viewers who may pat themselves on the back for their broadmindedness -- to not acknowledge the struggles of the trans women of color who have not been as readily accepted despite their historical activism in the movement.

Buttigieg approached this as the protesters were removed: ""I do want to acknowledge what these demonstrators were speaking about, which is the epidemic of violence against black trans women in this country right now."" Ending that epidemic, he said, requires ""lifting up its visibility and speaking to it.""

To his credit, Cooper took a moment to applaud the protesters for their demonstration and acknowledge the lack of media coverage given to the trans community.

Cooper was right: If tens of cisgender gay white males were murdered in a year, it would undoubtedly garner much more media attention.

We should credit the candidates who were asked about their strategy to stop men from killing trans women of color (as one audience member yelled while Senator Kamala Harris was on stage) for at least being well versed on the issue. They spoke of the need to have a Department of Justice that seriously investigated these crimes. They spoke of the need to have an education secretary who was committed to protecting transgender students, something the current secretary has been reluctant to do. More importantly they looked these disenfranchised women in their eyes and they listened to their pain, something the community at large has not been particularly good at doing since the decline of AIDS.

Historically, because of family rejection and housing discrimination , many transgender people do not have the resources to attend a fabulous fundraiser with the promise of one-on-one time with a candidate. In fact, because of these civil rights violations, many must turn to sex work just to survive, a predicament that makes them vulnerable to the violence that has led to so many deaths.

They have been reliant on their gay and lesbian brothers and sisters with deep pockets to take their concerns up the socioeconomic ladder and quite honestly, they have been sorely let down.

Consumed with marriage equality, iconography, and heteronormativity, much of the past 50 years in the movement has been an exercise in white, cisgender, gay advancement despite its black and Latino transgender beginnings. Because of this, the policy improvements the candidates proposed on this historic night are somewhat secondary to the fundamental fight that still needs to be fought.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren promised her nominee to the Department of Education would have to earn the approval of a nine-year-old child who claimed to be transgender.

The invited child, flanked by the mother, asked, “What are you doing … to make sure that kids like me feel safer in schools? And what do you think schools need to do better to make sure that I don’t have to worry about anything but my homework?”

Warren responded:

So let me start by saying, I want to have a secretary of education who both believes in public education and believes in the value of every one of our kids, and is willing to enforce our civil rights laws. It turns out that when the Department of Education was set up many years ago, the secretary of education was given a whole lot of power over the public schools, and over the rules and how they’re enforced. And we’ve had some secretaries of education who’ve been better. And we’ve had one that’s been a whole lot worse. Her name is Betsy DeVos. And when I’m President, she’ll be gone. And here’s my plan … I’m going to find just the right secretary of education. But here’s what I plan to do. I want to make sure that the person I think is the right secretary of education meets you and hears your story. And then I want you to tell me if you think that’s the right person, and then we’ll make the deal. Does that sound good?

“The Equality Act is essential,” said New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, referring to the House-passed Equality Act, which would establish the transgender ideology as law, and so outlaw and stigmatize any recognition of the complementary differences of women and men.

“If we can get five [Senate] votes, we will pass the Equality Act the next day,” said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. “We urgently need an Equality Act,” said Mayor Pete Buttigieg. “We would pass the Equality Act right off the bat, number one,” said Joe Biden.

The candidates promised to promote the status of gay and transgender people in K-12 schools, to roll back restrictions on blood donations, to appoint gay generals, and to subordinate national diplomacy to the goal of gay acceptance. “I would, in fact, curtail aid, curtail foreign assistance to countries who, in fact, engage in this kind of [anti-gay] behavior,” said Biden.

The audience picked by the pr0-transgender HRC was delighted with the river of promises and praise. “This means the world to all of us … I cannot believe this is happening,” said activist Julia Goldman, an author of a podcast about gay politics.

The Pentagon must treat male soldiers as if they are women once they say they are transgender, said Buttigieg. “The trans military ban is an outrage … That is dead wrong … I will put an end to that,” he said.

Religious rights must end when “religion is being used an excuse to harm other people,” Buttigieg said. Religious-based opposition to gay status “makes God smaller … It is an insult to faith to believe it can be used to hurt people in that way,” he said.

Religious groups must agree to arrange adoptions for gay couples, said Klobuchar. “You have got to have agencies that follow the law … You have got to [endorse] adoptions for gay families,” she said.

Conservatives & (some) feminists agree biology shapes our personalities & politics.

Warren jeered at critics of single-sex marriage and transgenderism. One questioner asked her:

Senator, thank you for being here. Now, let’s say you’re on the campaign trail, and a supporter approaches you and says, “Senator, I’m old-fashioned. And my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.” What is your response?” Well, I’m going to assume it’s a guy who said that. I’m going to say, just marry one woman. Assuming you can find one!

A moment later, Warren declared her deep belief in charity towards other people:

It’s about what I learned in the church I grew up, in first song I ever remember singing: “There is yellow, black and white, they are precious in His sight. Jesus loves all the children in the world.” … That was the basis of the faith that I grew up in. And it truly is about the preciousness of each and every life, it is about the worth of every human being.

Former California Attorney General, Kamala Harris, boasted of her refusal to defend California’s marriage law in 2008 from advocates for single-sex marriage.

Tom Steyer backed body-changing drugs for teenagers who say they are transgender. “All of that care should be available for all transgender youth,” he said. “It has to be part of the public [healthcare] option I believe in … It is an absolute right, and this is a critical part of healthcare for these young people.”

Warren promised taxpayer funding for cosmetic surgery for people who want to live as members of the opposite sex:

I believe that everyone is entitled to medical care and medical care that they need, and that includes people who are transgender, who — it is the time for them to have gender-affirming surgery. I just think that’s important and the appropriate medical care.

CNN’s announcers excluded any possible critics or skeptical questioners who might spotlight the political risks posed by the candidates’ unreserved support for transgender ideology. That ideology would change women’s status and rights, change education rules, and girls’ sports.

Amy Klobuchar provided the only moment of disagreement when she declined to endorse a call for legal prostitution. “I am not in favor of demineralizing all of sex work,” she said, but quickly backtracked, “but I’d love to talk with you for a few minutes and see if we can find common ground going forward.”

The only loud opposition came from several attendees who described themselves as black transgender women, including one named Blossom. A second person rebuked one CNN announcer for a mispronouncing the person’s name, saying, “it is violence to ‘misgender’ or to alter the name of a transperson.” A group interrupted the event to chant about “black trans” lives.

But Beto O’Rourke pushed the envelope.

“Discrimination” against people who are homosexual or transgender cannot be tolerated, he said. “There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone, any institution… that denies the human rights and full civil rights of every single one of us.”

He promised cheap anti-AIDS medicine: “We’ll bring down that cost … We will take over that patent and make sure it is distributed to every person in America.”

Mental-health professionals should not be allowed to guide adults or children who prefer to detransition from transgender status or to change homosexual feelings. “Conversion therapy … should be illegal,” O’Rourke said. “As president, I will seek to outlaw it everywhere in this country … this is tantamount to torture — a torture we visit on children who are absolutely defenseless,” he said.

Beto also promised a new policy to counter the murder of black transgender women, saying, “they will be the guide on this issue — they will direct our policy.” Countering the murders is “a matter of restoring the very fabric of America,” he said."

An expert panel will assess the latest evidence and decide whether to uphold previous guidance it issued in 2018, which strongly warned surgeons against performing the surgery because of its high fatality rate. If the guidance is upheld it will essentially ban the procedure in the UK, though surgeons could in theory choose to ignore the recommendation.

Two Britons are known to have died following the surgery, and it is feared that globally the number of fatalities could be in the hundreds, BAAPS president and plastic surgeon Paul Harris told CNN.

The surgery, which can cost in excess of £6,000 (around $7,400) in Britain, involves taking fat from another part of the patient's body and injecting it into the buttocks, to increase their size and roundness. But there is a risk of injecting the fat into large veins, after which it can travel to the heart or brain, causing a ""fat embolism"" and illness or death, according to the plastic surgeons' body.

According to an anonymous 2017 survey of 692 surgeons worldwide , 32 respondents reported fatalities and 103 cited non-fatal cases of fat embolism.

""I am still concerned about patient death,"" Harris told CNN, saying people were opting for the procedure to achieve a rounded look or a Kim Kardashian-style figure.

""At this stage there's no guarantee the fat will not travel (between the muscles, causing potential harm),"" he added.

""We don't know what it's going to look like in 20 years' time when we've pumped two liters of fat into someone's buttocks -- that's unknown. One of the questions we'll ask our members today is: 'Would you do this to your daughter?' and if you wouldn't do it to your daughter, why would you do it to a patient? And most of us wouldn't do it to our daughter.""

Of particular concern to BAAPS is plastic surgery tourism, because of countries' varying levels of safety regulation. Harris said the procedure was particularly popular in Latin America, including Brazil and Mexico, and was also performed in Turkey.

""I've just had a patient who had this procedure abroad. She didn't die, but she was septic and in intensive care -- and as a result she lost all of her fingers,"" he said. ""She was in hospital for eight months and had 23 operations. And she's the lucky one because she survived.""

When considering a ban, Harris said, BAAPS will have to consider carefully whether doing so could push more people to seek treatment overseas, prompting a potentially dangerous ""race to the bottom"" on costs and patient safety."

The campaign wrote:

They came from all 50 states, and nearly 20% of our donors gave to us for the first time this quarter. And most impressively, we did this while not fundraising during the 12 day period around the El Paso shooting because that tragedy wasn’t about our campaign, it was about our community.

However, O’Rourke’s team admitted that the amount raised is “not what we thought we’d be able to do given all of the other indicators we’re seeing.”

“Voters like what Beto has to say. When they meet him in person, they like him even more. In fact, our modeling shows a correlation between the counties Beto visits and an increase in his favorability,” his campaign argued.

The campaign diagnosed the problem, writing, “People think this is a two-person race.”

“We’re stuck in what we’ve been calling the ‘Media Trap,’ where the media is treating this race like it’s over, despite the fact that only 9% of voters have made up their mind,” it claimed, adding that it sees a “no-bullshit path for Beto.”

“We see a no-bullshit path for Beto and for our people-powered campaign—and a real, serious one,” his campaign wrote. “More than that, though, we see that we need to bypass the media trap and we need to do it quickly.”

The campaign outlined a few of the things that need to happen to help O’Rourke break through. The plan includes launching an advertising blitz, beefing up national organizers, and focusing on early primary states.

The remark came after Buttigieg, who is the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, was asked about whether bullying that causes suicide should have legal ramifications.

“I believe it’s one of the things that could help,” Buttigieg said. “There are still states — I live in one of them — that don’t have hate crime legislation.”

“And we need to make sure that our legislation reflects our values as a country and the insistence that nobody be singled out or harmed because of who they are,” Buttigieg said.

He continued:

But that’s just the beginning of what we’ve got to do for LGBTQ youth. We know that LGBTQ youth are much more likely to experience homelessness, which is one of the reasons why we need to invest more in youth homelessness in general and do the opposite of what this president is doing, which is allowing rules to go forward that would actually make it harder for transgender youth to access homeless services.

“That is just wrong, and it will end in my administration,” Buttigieg said.

In fact, while the HUD rule — posted in spring 2019 — does allow for shelters to make decisions based on privacy and safety, it specifically states that discrimination based on “sexual orientation and gender identity” will not take place:

This proposed rule provides that grant recipients, subrecipients, owners, operators, managers, and providers (Shelter Providers) under HUD programs which permit single-sex or sex-segregated facilities (such as bathrooms or temporary, emergency shelters and other buildings and facilities with physical limitations or configurations that require and are permitted to have shared sleeping quarters or bathing facilities) may establish a policy, consistent with state and local law, by which such Shelter Provider considers an individual’s sex for the purposes of determining accommodation within such shelters and for purposes of determining sex for admission to any facility or portion thereof. The proposed rule permits Shelter Providers to consider a range of factors in making such determinations, including privacy, safety, practical concerns, religious beliefs, any relevant considerations under civil rights and nondiscrimination authorities , the individual’s sex as reflected in official government documents, as well as the gender which a person identifies with. The proposed rule does not dictate a required basis for making determinations other than that they be consistent with an overall policy. The proposed rule continues HUD’s policy of ensuring that its programs are open to all eligible individuals and families regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.

Buttigieg joined eight other Democrat candidates at the marathon town hall, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), as well as former HUD Secretary Julian Castro (D), former Vice President Joe Biden (D), former Rep.

Schweizer and McLeod provide further details on the investments former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, facilitated via his Chinese-backed investment firm.

In 2013, less than two weeks after accompanying his father on an official visit to Beijing–and despite his lack of pertinent expertise–Hunter Biden secured $1 billion (later raised to $1.5 billion) from the state-owned Bank of China for his newly formed investment firm, Bohai Harvest RST (BHR). This was in addition to the first-of-its-kind deal the Chinese government awarded Biden’s private equity firm Rosemont Seneca in the recently formed Shanghai Free-Trade Zone, a deal that allowed the firm to focus on international acquisitions.

“With the backing of the state-owned Bank of China, one of the country’s ‘big four’ financial institutions, BHR had access to the types of deals that most Western firms only dreamed of, including IPOs of state-owned companies,” Schweizer and McLeod write, noting that Biden’s firm “invested in strategically sensitive assets in both China and the United States.”

They write:

In December 2014, BHR became an “anchor investor” in the IPO of China General Nuclear Power Company (CGN), a state-owned nuclear company involved in the development of nuclear reactors. Not only is CGN a strategically important company in China, it was also facing legal scrutiny in the United States. In 2016, CGN was charged with espionage by the Justice Department for stealing US nuclear secrets. As a “cross-border” investment fund, Bohai Harvest was interested in making deals outside of China. In 2015, BHR acquired Henniges Automotive, a Michigan-based producer of vibration-dampening equipment, alongside Chinese military contractor Aviation Industry Corp. of China (AVIC). Given the military applications of Henniges’ technology, the deal required federal approval. Like CGN, AVIC was suspected of stealing US technology for its purposes. Not long after the Henniges deal closed, AVIC debuted its new J-20 fighter — incorporating designs allegedly stolen from the US’ F-35 program.

Schweizer and McLeod conclude by asking, “Did the Chinese give favorable treatment to Hunter Biden to curry favor with his vice-president father? The American public deserves to understand what exactly Hunter Biden was doing overseas and the extent of then-Vice President Biden’s involvement.”

The timing of Hunter Biden’s business deal is particularly problematic. His father was negotiating U.S. policy with China at a time when the regime’s behavior had become increasingly menacing to U.S. allies in the region. Vice President Biden’s kid-gloves treatment of China during that trip—a fact which was widely criticized by U.S. allies at the time—also raises questions in light of the lucrative business deals his son secured just two weeks later.

Biden’s BHR focused on strategic energy and defense projects, including U.S. companies specializing in technology used by our military, as Breitbart’s Haris Alic reported:

In 2015, BHR and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) — an aerospace and defense conglomerate owned and operated by the Chinese government — made a $600 million bid to purchase Henniges, a Michigan-based automotive company. The sale required approval from the Obama-Biden administration’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), as AVIC was a subsidiary of the Chinese government and Henniges produced “dual-use” anti-vibration technology with U.S. “military applications.” CFIUS, which is made up of representatives from 16 different federal bodies including the Departments of State, Treasury, and Defense, is required to review any transaction with national security implications. When the AVIC and BHR’s bid was first announced, alarm bells went off in certain sectors of the defense industry. In particular, many noted that AVIC was “reportedly involved in stealing sensitive data regarding the Joint Strike Fighter program,” which it later “reportedly incorporated … into China’s J-20 and J‑31 aircraft.” Despite the national security concerns, CFIUS approved the deal with AVIC, purchasing 51 percent of the company while BHR took ownership of the other 49 percent. Upon purchase, an industry newsletter stated the deal was the “biggest Chinese investment into US automotive manufacturing assets to date.”

The acquisition of foreign technology is a key component of China’s aggressive “Made In China 2025” (MI2025) strategy to overtake the United States economically and militarily by dominating key technologies of the future (i.e. artificial intelligence, robotics, electric vehicles, 5G telecommunications, etc.). A 2017 report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce explained the role private equity firms like Hunter Biden’s play in this strategy. The Chinese government “is injecting state funds into private equity to fund foreign acquisitions” of companies with technology identified as a priority for MI2025, according to the report.

In his extensive report last February on China’s “whole-of-state” strategy for global dominance, Florida Senator Marco Rubio also noted the communist regime’s reliance on “intellectual property acquisitions” to achieve its ambitions.

“China is becoming a significant shareholder in U.S. industries, and is selectively targeting those with strategic implications,” Matt Stoller and Lucas Kunce wrote in The American Conservative last June. Their analysis exposes the extend to which China has co-opted Wall Street against the longterm interests of the American economy and national security. For example, they write:

Jennifer M. Harris, an expert in global markets with experience at the U.S. State Department and the U.S. National Intelligence Council, researched a recent explosion of Chinese strategic investment in American technology companies. She found that China has systematically targeted U.S. greenfield investments, “technology goods (especially semiconductors), R&D networks, and advanced manufacturing.”

Hunter Biden’s attorneys told ABC News last June that Biden still sits on BHR’s board and owns a minority stake in the fund.

At his campaign rally in Minneapolis yesterday, President Trump called out Hunter Biden’s business dealings with China while his father was negotiating U.S. policy with the communist regime.

“Biden allowed China to rip off America for eight years as vice president,” Trump told the crowd. “And Barack Obama let him just rob us blind, and we are not doing that anymore. Those days are over. The Bidens got rich, and that is substantiated, while America got robbed. That’s what happened. Sleepy Joe and his friends sold out America.”

The House Democrat impeachment inquiry has brought renewed interest in the sweetheart deals Hunter Biden’s private equity firm secured while his father was vice president, as detailed in Schweizer’s 2018 bestseller Secret Empires.

Democrats allege that President Trump attempted to coerce the Ukrainians into investigating corruption charges against former Vice President Biden during a July phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart.

The allegation centers around Hunter Biden’s lucrative dealings with a Ukrainian oligarch-owned energy company at a time when his father was mediating U.S. policy towards Ukraine. The natural gas firm Burisma Holdings paid Hunter Biden over $50,000 per month for his work as a board member, despite his total lack of experience in Ukraine and the energy sector. Just a few months prior to landing this deal, Hunter Biden had been dishonorably discharged from the U.S. Navy Reserve for testing positive to cocaine use.

A Ukrainian corruption probe into Burisma Holdings was scuttled in 2016, when Vice President Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to the country if the Ukrainian government did not fire the prosecutor who launched the investigation. Withholding the loans would have thrown the former Soviet republic into insolvency at a time when it was fending off attacks from Vladimir Putin’s Russia.

Both Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky denied the Democrats claim that Trump delayed military funding to Ukrainian in order to pressure Zelensky’s government to investigate the Bidens.

The Trump White House has refused to cooperate with the Democrat impeachment inquiry, declaring it a “partisan and unconstitutional” investigation.

The Times article, “What, Exactly, Is Tulsi Gabbard Up To?“, claims that Gabbard is beloved by white nationalists, antisemites, and Russians attempting to interfere in the election, citing “suspicious activity” around her campaign.

For example, the article states:

Then there is 4chan, the notoriously toxic online message board, where some right-wing trolls and anti-Semites fawn over Ms. Gabbard, calling her “Mommy” and praising her willingness to criticize Israel. In April, the Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, took credit for Ms. Gabbard’s qualification for the first two Democratic primary debates.” Brian Levin, the head of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University-San Bernardino, said Ms. Gabbard had “the seal of approval” within white nationalist circles. “If people have that isolationist worldview, there is one candidate that could best express them on each side: Gabbard on the Democratic side and Trump on the Republican side,” Mr. Levin said.

The article also cites Gabbard’s threat last Thursday to boycott the October presidential primary debate as evidence of her alleged appeal to the far right:

The questions [about Gabbard’s right-wing sympathies] deepened on Thursday after Ms. Gabbard threatened to boycott Tuesday’s debate, arguing that the corporate news media and the Democratic National Committee are working together to rig the event. (The New York Times is a co-sponsor of the debate with CNN.) … [I]t’s also an argument that reminds some Democrats of the narrative pushed by Russian actors during the 2016 presidential contest, when an operation by internet trolls worked to manipulate American public opinion: that the electoral system is broken and cannot be trusted.

In response to the Times article, Gabbard reiterated her threat to boycott:

As if to prove my point, NYT just published a “greatest hits” smear piece. All your favorite hits in one article! These are the folks who will be acting as the “neutral” questioners/moderators of Tuesday’s debate lol — Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 12, 2019

Gabbard failed to qualify for the third debate last month, but at the second presidential debate in Detroit, Michigan, in August, she damaged Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) with strident — and true — accusations that the former California prosecutor had put thousands of non-violent marijuana users behind bars and initially opposed the use of DNA evidence that might exonerate a death row inmate.

Gabbard, a major in the U.S. Army National Guard, is also known for her strong views against armed intervention abroad, particularly in Syria. A Samoan-American, Gabbard is also the first Hindu elected to the U.S. Congress.

She supported “democratic socialist” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in the 2016 election, famously quitting the Democratic National Committee (DNC) over its unfair treatment of Sanders in favor of Hillary Clinton.

O’Rourke’s campaign announced on Friday $4.5 million raised in the third quarter, putting him near the bottom of the barrel compared to his Democrat challengers. According to the campaign, 99 percent of O’Rourke’s donations were below $200, and the average donation was $26.

The campaign wrote:

They came from all 50 states, and nearly 20% of our donors gave to us for the first time this quarter. And most impressively, we did this while not fundraising during the 12 day period around the El Paso shooting because that tragedy wasn’t about our campaign, it was about our community.

However, O’Rourke’s team admitted that the amount raised is “not what we thought we’d be able to do given all of the other indicators we’re seeing.”

“Voters like what Beto has to say. When they meet him in person, they like him even more. In fact, our modeling shows a correlation between the counties Beto visits and an increase in his favorability,” his campaign argued.

The campaign diagnosed the problem, writing, “People think this is a two-person race.”

“We’re stuck in what we’ve been calling the ‘Media Trap,’ where the media is treating this race like it’s over, despite the fact that only 9% of voters have made up their mind,” it claimed, adding that it sees a “no-bullshit path for Beto.”

“We see a no-bullshit path for Beto and for our people-powered campaign—and a real, serious one,” his campaign wrote. “More than that, though, we see that we need to bypass the media trap and we need to do it quickly.”

The campaign outlined a few of the things that need to happen to help O’Rourke break through. The plan includes launching an advertising blitz, beefing up national organizers, and focusing on early primary states.

O’Rourke’s third-quarter haul pales in comparison to his competitors’ numbers:

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT): $25.3 million

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA): $24.6 million

Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D): $19.1 million

However, no one shined brighter than the black trans folks in the audience who called attention to the violence against transgender people, writes Clay Cane.",2019-10-13,CNN,Democrats need to heed the cries of black trans women,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/12/opinions/democrats-need-to-heed-the-cries-of-black-trans-women/index.html,"(CNN) Several presidential candidates took to the stage on Thursday night at the CNN Equality Town Hall. However, no one shined brighter than the black trans folks in the audience who called attention to the violence against transgender people. They were the personification of democracy.

When California Sen. Kamala Harris graced the stage, an audience member asked , ""How do we get those men to stop the killing of trans women of color? We are hunted."" During Beto O'Rourke's segment, Los Angeles trans activist Blossom C. Brown grabbed the mic and demanded to be heard by saying, ""Black trans women are dying, our lives matter! I am an extraordinary black trans woman, and I deserve to be here."" She also called out the lack of black trans women and men asking questions. (They appeared later in the program.)

Black transgender people, who are among the most vulnerable in the LGBTQ community, are often erased or ignored -- even by others in the queer community. Despite being dismissed and used as punchlines for comedians, black trans folks are fighting for their right to exist.

Nineteen transgender women have been killed this year, according to the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) -- the most recent being Itali Marlowe, a 29-year-old black trans woman who was reportedly shot and killed in Houston, Texas, this week. According to a report from HRC, at least 26 transgender people were killed in 2018, with black transgender women making up the majority. More than 100 transgender people were killed from 2013 to 2018, with people of color making up more than 80% of the victims, according to HRC.

The protesters at the town hall event exercised their freedom of speech at a crucial time when democracy itself is under threat. Their outrage is not a performance of so-called identity politics. It is more important than ever to call attention to marginalized groups who are under attack from this administration. From the ban on trans people in the military to the attempts to roll back protections against discrimination , the Trump administration is targeting this already vulnerable population.

That said, in 2019, the idea of an LGBTQ town hall on a major cable news network is still surprising. As someone who grew up during the height of the AIDS epidemic, I can recall that it took President Ronald Reagan until 1987 to deliver his first major speech on AIDS . By that time, more than 50,000 people -- mainly gay and trans people of all backgrounds -- had already died.

There was also George W. Bush, who peddled policies grounded in homophobia and theological hate to rouse his base for votes, specifically targeting African American churches

We cannot forget that President Barack Obama once said that ""marriage is between a man and a woman"" and supported civil unions instead of same-sex marriage . While some people in the LGBTQ community were disappointed, he was a relief for many compared to Bush.

Obama understood that LGBTQ issues go beyond same-sex marriage. What good is marriage if your job is threatened? What good is a wedding if you are a trans woman who is attacked and killed in public

This week, the US Supreme Court struggled to decide whether a civil rights law would protect members of the LGBTQ community from job discrimination. Fifty years after Stonewall, it is embarrassing we are having the same arguments to convince people of our humanity. On top of all the issues the LGBTQ community endures under this administration, we have to worry about workplace discrimination in a slowing economy.

The Democratic candidates hit the right notes Thursday night. But platitudes will not save us -- enforceable policy will. We need more candidates who understand that liberation for LGBTQ folks is not just about love, rainbows and taglines about being your authentic self.

I am still looking to see which candidate best addresses the intersections of race, class, sexual orientation and gender identity to construct radical policies for the most vulnerable. The Democratic nominee for president should build on Obama's legacy to address the needs of the LGBTQ community and engage with those who are ignored.

Queer liberation is rooted in anti-establishment ideas, in words and ideologies politicians rarely use because they remind us that the system needs to be reinvented to make room for us. Black transgender women were our conscience Thursday night, reminding us they are here and will not be silenced. We have to honor these warriors because they have been at the forefront of the LGBTQ movement, despite the whitewashing of history

As the trailblazing actress and LGBTQ advocate Laverne Cox once said, ""It is revolutionary for any trans person to choose to be seen and visible in a world that tells us we should not exist."""

Kamala Harris (D-CA) signed a petition that has been circulating among students and staff at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR), which smears the conservative student organization, Turning Point USA.

“We are deeply alarmed by your administration’s inadequate response to the presence and impacts of Turning Point USA (TPUSA) on our campus,” read a petition addressed to UNR president Marc Johnson, claiming that the university president has failed to “fully support students who organize anti-racist speech, protest, and action.”

The petition, entitled, Concerning white nationalism on the University of Nevada, Reno campus, smears TPUSA — which recently hosted its annual Black Leadership Summit — as a group that is engaging in “white nationalist tactics.”

Among the signers of the petition includes “Kamala Harris, Presidential Candidate,” who visited UNR’s campus earlier this month.

The petition goes on to accuse the university of “the lack of commitment to systemic transformation of the racist, sexist, anti-Semitic, and homophobic atmosphere on campus,” and specifically cites dismay over the arrests of one student, Edsel Bester, who was apprehended by police and taken to the Washoe County Jail after targeting TPUSA members on campus.

The arrests of a UNR student who brought a sign reading “Abolish ICE” to the UNR stadium, and who argued with campus TPUSA members and knocked over their display table. Both arrests were carried out by the Reno Police Department with no apparent attempt to resolve conflict through campus resources, and no communication with the campus community.

“TPUSA is waging a campaign to recruit students at colleges and universities nationwide. They have significantly increased their activity over the past years and months,” states the petition, which goes on to vilify TPUSA by attempting to conflate the organization with anti-capitalist and white nationalist groups — all of which have no affiliation with TPUSA.

Student members of UNR’s TPUSA group expressed shock and concern over now finding themselves targeted by leftists on campus.

“No one ever talked to us, so they would never know who we are actually,” said one UNR TPUSA member to Breitbart News. “We all have strong moral characters. This is why it’s so upsetting — we all come from a good place in our hearts.”

The petition goes on to proclaim that “racist, sexist, anti-Semitic, and anti-LGBTQ rhetoric” may eventually “escalate into physical violence, including gun violence” on campus.

“We believe that it is crucial to prevent an established pattern of intimidation from escalating further,” states the petition.

Some may argue, however, that “an established pattern of intimidation” might involve white leftists attempting to silence black conservative and TPUSA regional manager Richard Mills — just days after Bester was arrested for targeting TPUSA members in what was a separate incident on campus.

Most conservatives agree black lives matter— even if we disagree with the divisive movement named after the same statement. When I joined @unevadareno protestors in agreement of that statement, two white leftists prevented me, a black man, from doing so. How is that not racist? pic.twitter.com/NSNuOd26yS — Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) October 8, 2019

“Most conservatives agree black lives matter — even if we disagree with the divisive movement named after the same statement,” tweeted Mills, which included a video of the incident. “When I joined [UNR] protestors in agreement of that statement, two white leftists prevented me, a black man, from doing so. How is that not racist?”

While speaking at UNR last week, TPUSA founder and executive director Charlie Kirk addressed the smears targeting his organization on campus.

“I want to make something very, very clear — the evil, wicked ideology of white supremacy has no place in our organization. We repudiate it, we reject it wholeheartedly and completely, as should any decent American,” said Kirk, which elicited a response of cheers and applause from TPUSA members and fans in the audience.

A TPUSA spokesperson told Breitbart News in a phone interview that Sen. Harris “is either incredibly ignorant or wildly reckless to sign a document that places a mainstream organization like Turning Point USA in the same breath as hate or bigotry.”

“It is not only defamatory, but it endangers the many patriots and amazing young people that are a part of UNR’s TPUSA chapter — who represent all backgrounds, genders, skin colors — putting them at risk of doxing, physical harm, and harassment, all because Senator Harris failed to reflect the truth by signing such a fallacious petition.”

The concerns raised by TPUSA are not unfounded, given that leftists at the University of Texas at Austin — who have doxed pro-Kavanaugh students — also threatened to dox incoming fall 2019 freshmen students seeking to get involved with the conservative student organization.

“TPUSA would welcome the opportunity to speak face-to-face with Senator Harris — particularly with the leaders of our young Black Leadership Summit or Latino Leadership Summit, who are directly impacted by the senator’s actions — so that she can understand what our organization is for, and what it is against,” added the TPUSA spokesperson.

“Namely, TPUSA is against all forms of hate, racism, and bigotry,” affirmed the spokesperson. “We should stand united on these issues.”

The questions [about Gabbard’s right-wing sympathies] deepened on Thursday after Ms. Gabbard threatened to boycott Tuesday’s debate, arguing that the corporate news media and the Democratic National Committee are working together to rig the event. (The New York Times is a co-sponsor of the debate with CNN.) … [I]t’s also an argument that reminds some Democrats of the narrative pushed by Russian actors during the 2016 presidential contest, when an operation by internet trolls worked to manipulate American public opinion: that the electoral system is broken and cannot be trusted.

In response to the Times article, Gabbard reiterated her threat to boycott:

As if to prove my point, NYT just published a “greatest hits” smear piece. All your favorite hits in one article! These are the folks who will be acting as the “neutral” questioners/moderators of Tuesday’s debate lol — Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 12, 2019

Gabbard failed to qualify for the third debate last month, but at the second presidential debate in Detroit, Michigan, in August, she damaged Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) with strident — and true — accusations that the former California prosecutor had put thousands of non-violent marijuana users behind bars and initially opposed the use of DNA evidence that might exonerate a death row inmate.

Gabbard, a major in the U.S. Army National Guard, is also known for her strong views against armed intervention abroad, particularly in Syria. A Samoan-American, Gabbard is also the first Hindu elected to the U.S. Congress.

She supported “democratic socialist” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in the 2016 election, famously quitting the Democratic National Committee (DNC) over its unfair treatment of Sanders in favor of Hillary Clinton.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is causing him to rethink his decision to stay out of the presidential race, according to CNBC.

Bloomberg is reportedly mulling the possibility of entering the race – if Biden drops out – “according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were deemed private,” CNBC reported.

The former New York City mayor’s reconsideration has been ignited by Warren’s growing support over Biden.

Via CNBC:

Bloomberg has signaled he’s “still looking at” running for president, but people close him say that the only way he could even go down that path is if Biden’s fortunes suffer so much that he drops out before or during the early stages of the primary. Bloomberg could then enter the race as one of the rare moderates with enough name recognition and campaign funding to make a run. Forbes estimates his net worth at $51 billion, and he was planning to spend over $100 million on a campaign for president if he ran.

Bloomberg ruled out a presidential bid in March, telling supporters that he was “clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field.”

“While there would be no higher honor than serving as president, my highest obligation as a citizen is to help the country the best way I can, right now. That’s what I’ll do, including the launch of a new effort called Beyond Carbon,” he stated at the time.

Warren has positioned herself as a viable threat to Biden, who held the frontrunner status in the early months of the Democrat primary. The Massachusetts senator has surged in recent weeks, besting Biden in a number of national polls as well as early primary and caucus state polls. A YouGovUS/CBSNews poll released over the weekend showed Warren leading Biden in early states by six points– 31 percent to 25 percent:

Warren surpassed Biden in the Real Clear Politics average last week and currently sits less than two points behind Biden in the current average, with 26 percent to Biden’s 27.8.

Biden’s loss of his previously held frontrunner status has Bloomberg mulling a bid, although a source told CNBC that Bloomberg would not make a move unless Biden dropped out of the race.

“I think it’s something he wants. He has not been shy about that,” a Bloomberg ally told CNBC. “Nothing can happen unless Biden drops out, and that’s not happening anytime soon.”

“He’s like everyone else. They can’t get it out of their system,” another source, described as a banking executive, told CNBC.

“Bloomberg is in if Biden is out,” another source added.

The former mayor told the Associated Press this year that – if he ran for president – his campaign would focus on “climate change, education, and public health.”

“Climate change could destroy the whole world and kill everyone on it,” Bloomberg said. “It’s frustrating that a lot of people don’t understand that.”

The gun-control activist joined California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) in September, announcing the Satellites for Climate Action initiative, which is “dedicated to monitoring climate change and the impact of the state’s policies,” as Breitbart News reported."

The results demonstrate a five-point gain for Warren, who had 26 percent to Biden’s 25 percent in the YouGovUS/CBS News poll taken August 28 – September 4, 2019.

The remaining candidates fell below the well-established top tier. The survey shows Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) down by double digits, with seven percent support. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) came in fifth place with five percent support, and former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D) came in right behind with four percent support.

However, no one shined brighter than the black trans folks in the audience who called attention to the violence against transgender people, writes Clay Cane.",2019-10-13,CNN,Democrats need to heed the cries of black trans women,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/12/opinions/democrats-need-to-heed-the-cries-of-black-trans-women/index.html,"(CNN) Several presidential candidates took to the stage on Thursday night at the CNN Equality Town Hall. However, no one shined brighter than the black trans folks in the audience who called attention to the violence against transgender people. They were the personification of democracy.

When California Sen. Kamala Harris graced the stage, an audience member asked , ""How do we get those men to stop the killing of trans women of color? We are hunted."" During Beto O'Rourke's segment, Los Angeles trans activist Blossom C. Brown grabbed the mic and demanded to be heard by saying, ""Black trans women are dying, our lives matter! I am an extraordinary black trans woman, and I deserve to be here."" She also called out the lack of black trans women and men asking questions. (They appeared later in the program.)

Black transgender people, who are among the most vulnerable in the LGBTQ community, are often erased or ignored -- even by others in the queer community. Despite being dismissed and used as punchlines for comedians, black trans folks are fighting for their right to exist.

Nineteen transgender women have been killed this year, according to the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) -- the most recent being Itali Marlowe, a 29-year-old black trans woman who was reportedly shot and killed in Houston, Texas, this week. According to a report from HRC, at least 26 transgender people were killed in 2018, with black transgender women making up the majority. More than 100 transgender people were killed from 2013 to 2018, with people of color making up more than 80% of the victims, according to HRC.

The protesters at the town hall event exercised their freedom of speech at a crucial time when democracy itself is under threat. Their outrage is not a performance of so-called identity politics. It is more important than ever to call attention to marginalized groups who are under attack from this administration. From the ban on trans people in the military to the attempts to roll back protections against discrimination , the Trump administration is targeting this already vulnerable population.

That said, in 2019, the idea of an LGBTQ town hall on a major cable news network is still surprising. As someone who grew up during the height of the AIDS epidemic, I can recall that it took President Ronald Reagan until 1987 to deliver his first major speech on AIDS . By that time, more than 50,000 people -- mainly gay and trans people of all backgrounds -- had already died.

There was also George W. Bush, who peddled policies grounded in homophobia and theological hate to rouse his base for votes, specifically targeting African American churches

We cannot forget that President Barack Obama once said that ""marriage is between a man and a woman"" and supported civil unions instead of same-sex marriage . While some people in the LGBTQ community were disappointed, he was a relief for many compared to Bush.

Obama understood that LGBTQ issues go beyond same-sex marriage. What good is marriage if your job is threatened? What good is a wedding if you are a trans woman who is attacked and killed in public

This week, the US Supreme Court struggled to decide whether a civil rights law would protect members of the LGBTQ community from job discrimination. Fifty years after Stonewall, it is embarrassing we are having the same arguments to convince people of our humanity. On top of all the issues the LGBTQ community endures under this administration, we have to worry about workplace discrimination in a slowing economy.

The Democratic candidates hit the right notes Thursday night. But platitudes will not save us -- enforceable policy will. We need more candidates who understand that liberation for LGBTQ folks is not just about love, rainbows and taglines about being your authentic self.

I am still looking to see which candidate best addresses the intersections of race, class, sexual orientation and gender identity to construct radical policies for the most vulnerable. The Democratic nominee for president should build on Obama's legacy to address the needs of the LGBTQ community and engage with those who are ignored.

Queer liberation is rooted in anti-establishment ideas, in words and ideologies politicians rarely use because they remind us that the system needs to be reinvented to make room for us. Black transgender women were our conscience Thursday night, reminding us they are here and will not be silenced. We have to honor these warriors because they have been at the forefront of the LGBTQ movement, despite the whitewashing of history

As the trailblazing actress and LGBTQ advocate Laverne Cox once said, ""It is revolutionary for any trans person to choose to be seen and visible in a world that tells us we should not exist."""

Kamala Harris (D-CA) signed a petition that has been circulating among students and staff at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR), which smears the conservative student organization, Turning Point USA.

“We are deeply alarmed by your administration’s inadequate response to the presence and impacts of Turning Point USA (TPUSA) on our campus,” read a petition addressed to UNR president Marc Johnson, claiming that the university president has failed to “fully support students who organize anti-racist speech, protest, and action.”

The petition, entitled, Concerning white nationalism on the University of Nevada, Reno campus, smears TPUSA — which recently hosted its annual Black Leadership Summit — as a group that is engaging in “white nationalist tactics.”

Among the signers of the petition includes “Kamala Harris, Presidential Candidate,” who visited UNR’s campus earlier this month.

The petition goes on to accuse the university of “the lack of commitment to systemic transformation of the racist, sexist, anti-Semitic, and homophobic atmosphere on campus,” and specifically cites dismay over the arrests of one student, Edsel Bester, who was apprehended by police and taken to the Washoe County Jail after targeting TPUSA members on campus.

The arrests of a UNR student who brought a sign reading “Abolish ICE” to the UNR stadium, and who argued with campus TPUSA members and knocked over their display table. Both arrests were carried out by the Reno Police Department with no apparent attempt to resolve conflict through campus resources, and no communication with the campus community.

“TPUSA is waging a campaign to recruit students at colleges and universities nationwide. They have significantly increased their activity over the past years and months,” states the petition, which goes on to vilify TPUSA by attempting to conflate the organization with anti-capitalist and white nationalist groups — all of which have no affiliation with TPUSA.

Student members of UNR’s TPUSA group expressed shock and concern over now finding themselves targeted by leftists on campus.

“No one ever talked to us, so they would never know who we are actually,” said one UNR TPUSA member to Breitbart News. “We all have strong moral characters. This is why it’s so upsetting — we all come from a good place in our hearts.”

The petition goes on to proclaim that “racist, sexist, anti-Semitic, and anti-LGBTQ rhetoric” may eventually “escalate into physical violence, including gun violence” on campus.

“We believe that it is crucial to prevent an established pattern of intimidation from escalating further,” states the petition.

Some may argue, however, that “an established pattern of intimidation” might involve white leftists attempting to silence black conservative and TPUSA regional manager Richard Mills — just days after Bester was arrested for targeting TPUSA members in what was a separate incident on campus.

Most conservatives agree black lives matter— even if we disagree with the divisive movement named after the same statement. When I joined @unevadareno protestors in agreement of that statement, two white leftists prevented me, a black man, from doing so. How is that not racist? pic.twitter.com/NSNuOd26yS — Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) October 8, 2019

“Most conservatives agree black lives matter — even if we disagree with the divisive movement named after the same statement,” tweeted Mills, which included a video of the incident. “When I joined [UNR] protestors in agreement of that statement, two white leftists prevented me, a black man, from doing so. How is that not racist?”

While speaking at UNR last week, TPUSA founder and executive director Charlie Kirk addressed the smears targeting his organization on campus.

“I want to make something very, very clear — the evil, wicked ideology of white supremacy has no place in our organization. We repudiate it, we reject it wholeheartedly and completely, as should any decent American,” said Kirk, which elicited a response of cheers and applause from TPUSA members and fans in the audience.

A TPUSA spokesperson told Breitbart News in a phone interview that Sen. Harris “is either incredibly ignorant or wildly reckless to sign a document that places a mainstream organization like Turning Point USA in the same breath as hate or bigotry.”

“It is not only defamatory, but it endangers the many patriots and amazing young people that are a part of UNR’s TPUSA chapter — who represent all backgrounds, genders, skin colors — putting them at risk of doxing, physical harm, and harassment, all because Senator Harris failed to reflect the truth by signing such a fallacious petition.”

The concerns raised by TPUSA are not unfounded, given that leftists at the University of Texas at Austin — who have doxed pro-Kavanaugh students — also threatened to dox incoming fall 2019 freshmen students seeking to get involved with the conservative student organization.

“TPUSA would welcome the opportunity to speak face-to-face with Senator Harris — particularly with the leaders of our young Black Leadership Summit or Latino Leadership Summit, who are directly impacted by the senator’s actions — so that she can understand what our organization is for, and what it is against,” added the TPUSA spokesperson.

“Namely, TPUSA is against all forms of hate, racism, and bigotry,” affirmed the spokesperson. “We should stand united on these issues.”

Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday challenged her Democratic primary rivals to release the names of contributors and fundraisers with influential positions on their campaigns, while pledging to champion legislation that would effectively disqualify big-dollar donors from being appointed to cushy diplomatic posts.

The requests were written into a series of mostly new proposed campaign finance restrictions, which would ban corporate PACs from donating to federal candidates and make it illegal for certain super PACs to be run by operatives with professional or personal ties to the candidate they're backing.

Now firmly among the front-runners for the Democratic presidential nomination, Warren has increasingly centered her campaign on a broad anti-corruption platform . In past rollouts, she promised to forbid lobbyists from making political contributions, acting as bundlers or hosting fundraisers for candidates. Former top federal officials -- including presidents, vice presidents, members of Congress, judges, and cabinet secretaries -- would also be permanently prohibited from taking lobbying jobs.

While Warren does not name any of her competitors in her Medium post, the new call for campaigns to ""disclose any donor or fundraiser who has a special title on their campaign, including national and regional finance committee members and bundler designations"" is an apparent nudge to a number of top rivals, like former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and California Sen. Kamala Harris, who all regularly attend big-dollar fundraising events.

Warren's call to cut off the donor-to-ambassador pipeline, which she acknowledges has been common practice in both Republican and Democratic administrations, comes with increased resonance now that President Donald Trump's EU ambassador, Gordon Sondland , a Republican megadonor who gave $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee, has emerged as a key figure in the Ukraine scandal.

(CNN) President Donald Trump has a nose for weakness. And Joe Biden's softest spot is his near-mystical reverence for family.

Nothing is likely to cause Biden more pain, to test his cool and to force him into an error more than an attack on his kin. The former vice president can barely get through a sentence without a poignant reference to his late parents, his second wife, Jill, his children or his grandchildren. In a life scarred by tragedy, he has already buried two of his kids and a first wife. Grief over the death of his eldest son, Beau, from brain cancer nixed a run for president in 2016.

So Trump has plunged his 2020 election dagger into Biden's second son, targeting Hunter Biden with unsubstantiated allegations about his business dealings in Ukraine and China. Going after family is one of his preferred tricks: In the 2016 presidential race, Trump mocked the Bush dynasty, knowing it would unhinge its scion Jeb. He upset Ted Cruz by insulting his wife, and raised Bill Clinton's affairs while debating Hillary Clinton (though eliciting only a slow blink).

Yet, with little sense of irony, Trump resents attacks on his own clan (and has shown flagrant disregard for potential conflicts of interest in his own sons' business ventures. As is often the case with leaders with an authoritarian streak, his kids -- kept close in the White House and in Trump's businesses -- are the only ones who can offer the loyalty he craves.

Trump signaled to then-special counsel Robert Mueller that probing his family accounts would cross a red line. But there are no such lines when the President himself perceives an enemy.

Postcard from Kiev

Demonstrators light smoke flares as they march in central Kiev.

About 20,000 people marched in a nationalist rally in Kiev, with many calling on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky not to move forward on a peace deal with Russia-backed separatists in the country's east.

""The protesters marched in groups. We saw regular soldiers, veterans and nationalist groups. Some had their faces covered and wore all black. Most striking was the diversity of ages -- we saw teenagers right up to pensioners,"" writes CNN's Sebastian Shukla to Meanwhile from Kiev.

""Flares were lit and chants such as 'Death to the enemy' and 'Glory to Ukraine' were shouted by the entire contingent. Protesters marched down to Maidan Square and the Presidential Administration, where they covered the building in stickers saying 'No to capitulation' -- a clear reference to Zelensky's recent move to form a peace deal in the east.""

'A strategic calamity'

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took the rare step of openly breaking with Trump over a key policy issue. ""I am gravely concerned by recent events in Syria and by our nation's apparent response thus far,"" the Kentucky Republican said. ""I look forward to discussing what the United States can do to avoid a strategic calamity with my Senate colleagues and with senior administration officials.""

Syria, in brief

Kurds in northern Syria are gambling with their autonomy by turning to Russia and the Syrian government for protection after Trump withdrew US troops. Now the White House is trying to cover its blushes after the President's strategy was panned as a foreign policy disaster at home and abroad. Here's the latest, in brief:

The Syrian Kurdish governing coalition said it would sign a ""memorandum of understanding"" with Moscow, in an attempt to ""prevent the Turkish attack.""

Syrian President Bashar Assad's army entered several cities in the area, according to state media -- part of a deal with the Kurds to enforce the border with Turkey.

Turkey accused the Kurds of deliberately releasing ISIS prisoners. Trump soon echoed that claim -- but a senior US official told CNN that's just not true.

Trump announced new sanctions on Turkey over an incursion for which he cleared the way last week, warning that its ""action is precipitating a humanitarian crisis and setting conditions for possible war crimes.""

Vice President Mike Pence said he would travel to Turkey to push for a ceasefire between groups in the area.

In a press briefing about US sanctions on Turkey, Vice President Mike Pence told reporters that Trump had spoken to both Kurdish General Mazloum Kobani Abdi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and CNN got a look at his notes in the process.

Democrats debate

The CNN/New York Times presidential debate tonight in Ohio will be the most pivotal moment yet in the Democratic race. The clash among 12 candidates will highlight growing vulnerabilities among front-runners and offer outsiders one of a dwindling number of chances to break through. Here's what each major candidate must do:

Joe Biden must make sure his debate is not overshadowed by Trump's unsubstantiated claims about his son's financial dealings. He has fiercely rebutted any suggestion of impropriety, and his Democratic rivals have defended him so far. But they may not be above wondering why Hunter Biden risked conflicts of interest by doing business abroad while his father was vice president.

Bernie Sanders is desperate for a strong showing after a heart attack raised questions about his age and health. The 78-year-old senator from Vermont was already in danger of losing the battle for the party's progressive left. He can't afford to slip.

Elizabeth Warren has overtaken Sanders and is now considered a co-front-runner with Biden. That means she's got a target on her back. The liberal senator from Massachusetts bills herself as the candidate with a plan for anything, but expect her rivals to attack her glaringly unspecific position on a top issue: health care.

Pete Buttigieg's quietly impressive campaign and bumper fundraising could set him up for a possible late surge into the first contest in Iowa. But he must disprove impressions that -- as the 37-year-old mayor of a small Indiana city -- he lacks the experience to be president.

Kamala Harris needs something to happen. Soon. A campaign that started with great promise has sputtered, partly due to the California senator's shaky grasp of her own policies. Time is running out for a leap into the top tier.

Everyone else -- including Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Obama administration Cabinet Secretary Julián Castro and former Congressman Beto O'Rourke of Texas -- simply must give voters a reason to care. Some of them are already in danger of falling short of the stricter criteria for the next debate, in November.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is causing him to rethink his decision to stay out of the presidential race, according to CNBC.

Bloomberg is reportedly mulling the possibility of entering the race – if Biden drops out – “according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were deemed private,” CNBC reported.

The former New York City mayor’s reconsideration has been ignited by Warren’s growing support over Biden.

Via CNBC:

Bloomberg has signaled he’s “still looking at” running for president, but people close him say that the only way he could even go down that path is if Biden’s fortunes suffer so much that he drops out before or during the early stages of the primary. Bloomberg could then enter the race as one of the rare moderates with enough name recognition and campaign funding to make a run. Forbes estimates his net worth at $51 billion, and he was planning to spend over $100 million on a campaign for president if he ran.

Bloomberg ruled out a presidential bid in March, telling supporters that he was “clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field.”

“While there would be no higher honor than serving as president, my highest obligation as a citizen is to help the country the best way I can, right now. That’s what I’ll do, including the launch of a new effort called Beyond Carbon,” he stated at the time.

Warren has positioned herself as a viable threat to Biden, who held the frontrunner status in the early months of the Democrat primary. The Massachusetts senator has surged in recent weeks, besting Biden in a number of national polls as well as early primary and caucus state polls. A YouGovUS/CBSNews poll released over the weekend showed Warren leading Biden in early states by six points– 31 percent to 25 percent:

Early Primary States @YouGovUS/@CBSNews Poll (10/3-11):

Warren 31%

Biden 25%

Sanders 17%

Harris 7%

Buttigieg 5%

O'Rourke 4%

Booker 1%

Klobuchar 1%

Castro 1%

Yang 1%

Steyer 1%

Messam 0

Sestak 0https://t.co/jbSJXHgUx6 pic.twitter.com/I7SVFSFFBq — Political Polls (@Politics_Polls) October 13, 2019

Warren surpassed Biden in the Real Clear Politics average last week and currently sits less than two points behind Biden in the current average, with 26 percent to Biden’s 27.8.

Biden’s loss of his previously held frontrunner status has Bloomberg mulling a bid, although a source told CNBC that Bloomberg would not make a move unless Biden dropped out of the race.

“I think it’s something he wants. He has not been shy about that,” a Bloomberg ally told CNBC. “Nothing can happen unless Biden drops out, and that’s not happening anytime soon.”

“He’s like everyone else. They can’t get it out of their system,” another source, described as a banking executive, told CNBC.

“Bloomberg is in if Biden is out,” another source added.

The former mayor told the Associated Press this year that – if he ran for president – his campaign would focus on “climate change, education, and public health.”

“Climate change could destroy the whole world and kill everyone on it,” Bloomberg said. “It’s frustrating that a lot of people don’t understand that.”

The gun-control activist joined California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) in September, announcing the Satellites for Climate Action initiative, which is “dedicated to monitoring climate change and the impact of the state’s policies,” as Breitbart News reported."

—

10:45 PM: Cooper, after discussing Ellen and Dubya hanging out at a Cowboys game, asks candidates about a friendship that they have had that would surprise people or had an impact on them. Serious question: Did Cooper or CNN producers watch Phil Mickelson’s “Tribute Tuesday” Instagram posts before asking this typical MSM question? Nothing MSM loves more than “unity” and “bipartisanship.”

Castro: Rambles about people who thought differently and grew up differently. Doesn’t name anyone. Castro says we should be kind to people but should also hold people to account like George W. Bush.

Gabbard: Names Republicans like Trey Gowdy. Says Gowdy has been there for her during some personally challenging times.

Klobuchar: Names McCain.

Steyer: A woman from Denmark, South Carolina, who is fighting for clean water and environmental justice. Different race, gender, and from a different part of the country.

Beto: Says he has always tried to bring people together. Names retiring Rep. Will Hurd (R-TX).

Booker: He says he has so many he can’t count… goes to Bible study in Sen. Inhofe’s (R-OK) office and went to dinner with Sen. Cruz (R-TX).

Yang: After saying he will spend ten hours answering questions on his website on Friday, names “Fred the Felon,” a white working-class truck driver who previously supported Trump and now supports Yang.

Harris: Rand Paul. Talks about how they joined together on a bill to end cash bail.

Mayor Pete: Talks about friendships formed in the military–different race, politics.

Warren: Harvard Law Prof. Charles Fried.

Sanders: McCain for working with him on veterans issues.

Biden: McCain. Whacks Trump for being a “liar” and a “cheat.”

10:30 PM: Biden says he’s the only one on the stage who has gotten anything really big done.

Sanders rips Biden — says he got the Iraq War, NAFTA, PNTR (permanent normal trade relations) with China done.

Oh Bernie with the combo on Biden and all the bad things (Iraq, bankruptcy bill) he got done. Bam bam bam. — Matt Stoller (@matthewstoller) October 16, 2019

Warren takes credit for the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Board (CFPB).

10:23 PM: Biden says he won’t pack the Supreme Court to protect abortion rights. Biden talks about defeating Robert Bork and says we should codify Roe v Wade. Biden says if a Supreme Court Justice steps down before the next election, Mitch McConnell and the Republicans should not be allowed to hold hearings.

Buttigieg wants a 15-person Supreme Court to depoliticize the process. He says 5 members will be appointed only with the unanimous consent of 10 others.

Castro calls for term limits (or cycling off to the appellate courts) rather than packing the courts.

Warren takes the question back to abortion and says she lived in an America where abortion was illegal and rich women still got abortions. She says poor women were the ones who got hurt.

10: 09 PM: Booker, interjecting, says as the vegan, he can say that Trump is the unhealthiest person to ever run for president.

10:06 PM: Yang says Warren is 100% accurate in diagnosing the problem when asked about breaking up tech companies. Yang says breaking up tech companies, though, will not revive Main Street. He talks about the impact of screen use on children and he says breaking up tech companies does nothing to make kids healthier. Yang says using 20th century anti-trust solutions will not work.

Warren says companies can be the umpire or have a team, but you don’t get to do both. She accuses Amazon of collecting data on what sells well on their site and then going into business against them.

Beto wants tech companies to be treated as publishers, but he does not think presidents should target individual companies.

Harris asks Warren to join her in calling for Twitter to shut down Trump’s Twitter account. Warren dodges and says she wants to push Trump out of the White House.

Steyer now says Democrats need to talk about “prosperity” and the “private sector” to beat Trump before calling Trump a “fraud.” If traction gets any traction, will be interesting to see Democrats hit back at his private equity past.

Yang says data is more valuable than oil and Americans need to get their “tech check” via the freedom dividend, and that’s the best way to deal with the Big Tech problem.

9:52 PM: Burnett tries to pivot to health and Sanders says he’s feeling great. Booker says Sanders supports medical marijuana and Sanders replies: “I’m not on it tonight.”

Burnett asks Sanders how he will assure voters that he is up for the presidency. Sanders talks about an upcoming rally in Queens and says he will mount a “vigorous campaign” to prove to people that he is fit for the presidency.

He thanks everyone who sent good wishes from the bottom of his heart and says he is so glad to be back up on the debate stage.

Biden says he is running because of his “age and experience” because with it comes “wisdom.” He says now, more than ever, someone with that capacity is needed in the White House.

Warren, when asked about age, says she will outwork, out-organize, and outlast everyone–and “that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with.”

9:50 PM: On opioids, Steyer goes back to one of the central themes of his campaign–that corporations have bought the government.

Yang calls for decriminalizing opioids. He says there were more opioid prescriptions than people in Ohio and the crisis is one of “capitalism run amok.” He says the government must invest in treatment plans and people cannot be worried about going to jail cells if they come in for treatment. He says first responders in New Hampshire have told him they see the same people over and over again.

Beto also says he is for decriminalization of opioids while Harris calls pharmaceutical companies and executives “high-level dope dealers” and says some executives need to go to jail. “This is a matter of justice,” she says, adding that we should end mass incarceration and the War on Drugs and go after pharmaceutical executives.

Castro says drug company executives should go to jail and also need to be held accountable financially. He says Wall Street executives also must be held to account.

9:40 PM: Warren in favor of voluntary buyback programs and not mandatory buyback programs. She says the former got machine guns off the streets.

Castro asked about preventing deaths via handguns. Castro says he has problems with mandatory buyback programs because people don’t want cops coming to their homes… talks about police officers killing innocent people in their homes. He says “police violence is also gun violence, and we need to address that.”

9:30 PM: Beto asked about mandatory buybacks. He has disagreed with Mayor Pete on this.

Beto asked how he would endorse that when he doesn’t even know who has AR-15s. Beto calls them “weapons of war” that are “too dangerous to sell.” Beto says they are also “too dangerous to own” because every single one of them is a “potential instrument of terror.” He says just ask “any Hispanic in Texas” and accused Trump of inciting racists to target Hispanics in his community. Beto says if someone does not turn in their “weapons of war” and “brandishes” it in public, that weapon “will be taken from them.”

Buttigieg asked whether mandatory buybacks equal “confiscation.” He says Beto just made it clear that he does not know how to get weapons off the street. Mayor Pete says we can’t wait for Red Flag laws and universal background checks. He says we can’t wait for purity test and must “get something done.”

Mayor Pete says he doesn’t need lessons from Beto on courage–political or personal. He goes on to rip the NRA and their “enablers” in Congress. Beto hits Mayor Pete for calling his buyback plan a “shiny object.” He says “that was a slap in the face” to every survivor of gun violence.

9:22 PM: Castro rips Trump for caging kids at the border while letting ISIS prisoners go free. He says there is no reason for Kim Jong Un to trust anything Trump has to say re: nuclear agreement when he ripped up the Iran Deal and betrayed the Kurds.

Booker accuses Trump of partnering more with Putin than Merkel and Macron.

Biden says he has spent time alone with Putin and Erdogan. He says Trump is an “erratic” and “crazy” president who doesn’t “know a damn” about foreign policy. Biden says Erdogan knows how terrible it would if Turkey got booted from NATO. Biden says if Trump is elected, there will be no NATO.

Biden counters Gabbard’s “regime-change” war claim, saying it was to prevent Assad from “wiping out” thousands of people.

Beto says Russia is “invading” American democracy and then says “in addition” in Spanish out of the blue.

9:12 PM: Gabbard, appropriately asked about Syria.

She says Trump “has the blood of the Kurds on his hand.” She rips both parties and the mainstream media for “championing” the regime-change war that has led to the death of the Kurds. She rips CNN and the New York Times for smearing veterans like her for wanting to end the “regime-change war” in Syria. Says it is “despicable” that CNN had a pundit who implied she was a “Russia asset.”

Gabbard asks Warren to join her in calling for an end to the regime-change wars.

Warren says she doesn’t want troops in the Middle East but America must do it in the right way. She then accuses Trump of sucking up to dictators and enriching himself at the expense of America. She accuses Trump of giving ISIS a “new lease on life.”

Gabbard rips Buttigieg for wanting more regime-change wars in Syria. The two veterans differing. Buttigieg says when he was deployed, what protected him was that the American flag meant keeping our word and says Trump is undermining the “honor” of our soldiers. He says if you take away their honor, you might as well take away their armor.

Sanders says Turkey is no longer a U.S. ally when they invade another country and engage in mass slaughter. Sanders says 11,000 Kurds died and 20,000 were wounded fighting ISIS and now no country will trust the word of the United States. Sanders says Trump, the “pathological liar,” has wrecked the country’s ability to engage with other nations re: foreign policy issues.

KAMALA makes it clear – there are 4 winners because of what Donald Trump has done: 1) Russia

2) Iran

3) Assad

4) ISIS — Lily Adams (@adamslily) October 16, 2019

9:10 PM: Debate turns to foreign policy. Biden says he would not have withdrawn troops from Syria or Iraq. He says when Trump said the ISIS prisoners who are freed would go to Europe, it is the most shameful thing ever said by a modern president. Biden says he will make it clear to Syria’s Assad that “Turkey is the real problem here.” When asked if he wants American troops back in Syria, Biden says he wants the 1,000 troops protected by air cover and will make it clear that they are not going anywhere and will protect the Kurds.

9:05: Interesting observation:

No candidate has attacked Biden tonight, even though he remains the front-runner, at least technically. They see that his campaign is deflating. Warren is the real threat. — Robert Reich (@RBReich) October 16, 2019

9:00 PM: Castro wants an inheritance tax and to raise the top marginal rate. He talks about having visited homeless people living in storm drains in Vegas.

Booker wants Democrats to talk more about child poverty. He says the country must deal with the “moral obscenity” of its high child poverty rate.

8:55 PM: Harris now being asked about her tax credit. She tells a story about her mom at the kitchen table “trying to figure out how to make it all work.” Harris again repeats lines from her stump speech about how “justice is on the ballot.”

Burnett asks Yang about the wealth tax. He says it makes a lot of sense in principle but countries have repealed it because it had massive implementation problems. Yang calls for a value-added tax (VAT). Again, credit to Burnett for bringing in Yang into the discussion.

Beto says Democrats need to be more focused on lifting people on… he says Warren is more focused on “being punitive” and pitting some part of the country against the other.

Warren says she doesn’t “have a beef” with billionaires. She says billionaires made it because “all of us” helped them get there. She again calls for them to “pitch in” two cents so every other kids gets a chance.

(Bernie’s national press secretary, though, does have a “beef” with billionaires):

8:50 PM: Buttigieg, on Warren’s wealth tax, says it sounds good but could be an example of yet another Washington policy that sounds great but will accomplish nothing. Warren keeps defending her wealth tax, says it is needed for investments in the next generation. Yang has been making the case that it will be so easy for people to game the wealth tax, perhaps even renouncing citizenship, to avoid paying it but he has yet to jump in to make that point.

8:45 PM: Beto says if Mexicans should join unions if their companies do business with America.

Biden wants to double the capital gains tax and says the problem with these debates is that everyone wants to cram everything in in a short amount of time. Biden says the greedy corporations and the Fourth Industrial revolution creating job losses.

8:35 PM: Warren says the top reason Americans have lost jobs is bad trade policies and corporations with no loyalty to America workers, consumers, and communities.

8:30 PM: Debate now turns to jobs and automation. And Erin Burnett goes to Sanders first and asks him about his jobs guarantee program. Sanders says “damn right” everyone will get a job. Yang and Sanders have disagreed on this issue. Yang says his freedom dividend is more practical than Sanders’s jobs program.

Yang points out that not everyone wants to work for the federal government and many people who lose their jobs to automation cannot be “retrained” for various federal jobs. He says $1,000/month is better for the “trickle up economy.”

YANG, on jobs: 'Most Americans do not want to work for the federal government… If we put the money into our hands, we can build a trickle-up economy.' #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/3PO4RBpMt8 — NowThis (@nowthisnews) October 16, 2019

Booker jumps in to rip CNN for asking Biden about Hunter and says Trump was happy with that exchange. Says CNN elevated a lie and attacked a statesman.

Yang talks about the impact that automation will have on various communities that rely on truck drivers (diners). Gabbard is against a federal jobs guarantee and agrees with her friend Yang about UBI.

An important segment about automation and the new economy in a state that will be impacted by it would not have been possible had it not been for Yang’s candidacy. Credit to Erin Burnett for outstanding questioning and going to Yang right after Sanders and getting them to talk about their difference. Great segment for Burnett.

8:20 PM: Warren asked a “yes or no” answer about whether she will raise taxes for Medicare for all. Another dodge. She says costs will go up for the wealthy and down for those who are not. She rips insurance companies for “pulling the rug” from under people.

Buttigieg points out Warren is being evasive and says she is why why people are frustrated with Washington. Buttigieg says Warren supposedly has a plan for everything except for health care. He touts his “Medicare for all who want it” idea.

Warren says when someone hears “Medicare for all who want it,” it means “Medicare for all who can afford it.”

Sanders says his Medicare for All plan that Warren endorsed will be better than Canada’s but taxes will go up and will go up “significantly for the wealthy.” Warren keeps dodging the question and Klobuchar calls her out for not being honest and promoting a “pipe dream.”

Warren pivots to saying she spent most of her time not in Washington but studying how people went bankrupt–most due to healthcare bills even though they had insurance. Warren keeps dodging.

Biden talks again about building on Obamacare. Biden says Democrats must be straight with Americans on the single most important issue.

Sanders says the debate should be about whether Democrats have the “guts” to stand up to the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. Sanders says we must stop defending the “cruel” and “unjust” system.

Harris says Democrats should be talking more about abortion and says women, especially women of color, will die because of Republican legislatures in the states.

Kamala Harris: ""It's not an exaggeration to say women will die — poor women, women of color will die — because these Republican legislatures in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with their bodies"" #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/rtyjHfQnBT — CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 16, 2019

8:16 PM: Cooper asks Biden about his son Hunter. He asks if it is not okay for a president’s son to be involved in foreign businesses, why is it okay for a vice president’s son. Biden says neither he nor his son did “nothing wrong.” “My son’s statement speaks for itself,” Biden says, basically cuing up a potential attack ad. Biden says Trump is afraid of him because if he wins the nomination he will “beat him like a drum.” Biden says he and his son kept everything separate. Says Hunter made a judgment and he is “prod” of the judgment he made. Biden then pivots back to Trump’s “corruption.”

Sanders says Democrats must also focus on the “pain of the working class of this country.”

8:06 PM: Biden, who finally came around on impeachment, says Democrats have been fair and he agrees with Sanders that Trump is the most corrupt president in history.

Harris says Trump has committed crimes in “plain sight.” Cites Maya Angelou. She also accuses Trump of “selling out” working people, national security, and democracy. Harris, reciting her greatest Twitter hits, says as a prosecutor she knows a confession when she sees it and says the impeachment process won’t take long. She says Trump is the most corrupt and unpatriotic president.

Booker says impeachment has to be about “patriotism” and not “partisanship.” He says Democrats have to conduct this process in a way that is “honorable” and “doesn’t rip us apart.” Says Trump has violated his duty.

Now, for some reason, Cooper goes to Klobuchar, who is barely registering in the polls. She accuses Trump of “illegal conduct” for “digging up dirt” on an opponent. She says Trump has left the Kurds “for slaughter.” She says Trump has made “Russia great again.”

Castro says Democrats can “walk and chew gum at the same time” when asked if impeachment is a distraction. He says Trump is violating his oath of office and abusing his power.

Buttigieg says Trump has left Congress “no choice” but to launch an impeachment inquiry. He says the impeachment inquiry is about whether, when people look back 100 years from now, a president was above the law and could get away with anything. He presents himself as the bipartisan candidate.

Gabbard says impeachment will divide the country if driven by “hyper-partisan interests.”

Steyer says every candidate on stage is more decent and patriotic than “the criminal in the White House.” He talks about starting his Need to Impeach movement two years ago.

Yang supports impeachment (implies Senate will not convict) but says impeachment will not solve the issues that got Donald Trump elected. Pivots to the central theme of his campaign about Fourth Industrial Revolution. Yang says Democrats “are losing” when they are talking about Trump.

Beto says he thinks about everyone who has ever served in uniform and says we have a responsibility to be “fearless in the face of this president’s criminality and lawlessness.”

8:05 PM: Sanders says Democrats have “no choice” but to impeach Trump because Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of the country. He thinks the House will find him worthy of impeachment because of the Emoluments Clause. He says Trump is using the Oval Office to enrich himself. Sanders says Mitch McConnell must do the right thing and allow free and fair trial in the Senate.

8:00 PM: Debate begins. First question (for Warren) is about impeachment. Warren says the impeachment inquiry is necessary during an election year because some things are bigger than politics. She cites the Mueller report (obstruction of justice) and says “look what happened as a result” of not opening an impeachment inquiry after the Mueller report was released. Warren says this is also about the next president and the next president…

7:55 PM: Cooper introducing the candidates as the debate is about to get started.

7:36 PM: DNC Chair Tom Perez thinks Democrats can take back Ohio in 2020. Democrats want Ohio to be the state that ends Trump’s presidency. Perez rips Trump and says the election is not about “left versus right” but about “right versus wrong.”

7:35 PM: Watch what Ohio residents think of Democrats–Video from Breitbart’s Matt perdie and Zenny phuong in Ohio:

7:30 PM: CNN hyping the number of candidates (12) on stage as if it is a good thing.

Is the word out that Dems are not allowed to talk about Hunter Biden at the debate? If he did nothing wrong taking those jobs, why’d he promise not to do it again? Why’d he say he discussed it with his father when his father says they didn’t? Many questions. Will Dems ask? — Tim Murtaugh (@TimMurtaugh) October 15, 2019

Schiff also allegedly lied about having never spoken to the Ukrainian intelligence officer “whistleblower.”

Biggs’ legislation has quickly gained support from House Republicans across the political spectrum. House Freedom Caucus conservatives, moderates, and House Republican leadership have all backed the move to censure Schiff.

Since Biggs introduced the legislation in late September, the bill quickly gained 18 cosponsors. Now, the bill features support from nearly two-thirds of the House GOP caucus.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA), and House Republican Conference chairwoman Liz Cheney (R-WY) have sponsored the resolution to condemn Schiff.

The poll, taken September 29-October 7, 2019 among 998 registered voters in North Carolina, shows the president besting all of his potential rivals in the crucial battleground state.

Respondents were asked, “If the election for president was held today, would you vote for Republican Donald Trump, Democrat Joe Biden, or someone else?” The survey asked the same question for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D).

While Biden fared the best in a hypothetical general election matchup in the Republican-leaning swing state, Trump still led the former vice president with 38.4 percent to Biden’s 34.6 percent.

The others are as follows:

Trump: 39.1 percent

Warren: 33 percent Trump: 38.8 percent

Sanders: 32.5 percent Trump 39.1 percent

Harris 28.4 percent Trump: 39 percent

Buttigieg: 27 percent

One of the most significant narratives moving into the 2020 election is the state of the economy, which Trump has touted as one of his greatest accomplishments. Of those surveyed, 13.7 percent described the condition of the economy as “excellent,” 28.7 percent described it as “good,” and 33.1 percent described it as “fair.” Only 13.3 percent described the condition of the economy as “poor.”

Trump won North Carolina in 2016 with 49.8 percent of the vote to Hillary Clinton’s 46.2 percent. While Republicans hold an edge in the state, former President Barack Obama flipped the state blue in 2008, beating late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) by less than half of a percentage point."

While he was vice president, Biden failed to stop his son Hunter Biden from cashing in on lucrative foreign business deals with Ukraine and China even as he was leading the Obama administration’s diplomatic efforts with the two countries.

President Donald Trump made it a focal point of his campaign, using Hunter Biden’s name in back-to-back rallies last week, ultimately forcing Hunter Biden to step down from his role in an investment company backed by China on Sunday.

Hunter Biden’s lawyers, however, were unclear whether he would keep his stake in the company — estimated at an investment worth millions.

But 2020 candidates are hesitant to swing at Biden, and some even appear defensive of the vice president on the issue of corruption.

The Biden campaign also fired a warning to his campaign rallies.

An aide to Biden told Bloomberg News any candidate who “calls themselves a ‘Democrat'” and repeats what the aide said were “discredited lies” about Biden and his son “would be making a profound statement about themselves.”

Sen. Warren at first stumbled by suggesting she did not approve of the idea of a vice president allowing to serve on the board of a foreign company.

“No. … I don’t know. I mean, I’d have to go back and look at the details,” she replied.

Since then, Warren dodged media attempts to answer questions about Biden and his son, pivoting back to accuse Trump of trying to dodge his own misconduct in Ukraine.

Sen. Bernie Sanders has also dodged the question, demanding “evidence” of any impropriety by the Bidens.

“I know I’m a little bit old-fashioned. I like to see the evidence before I talk about things. I read the papers and I read what I read,” Sanders said last week. “But I don’t know that I know enough at this point to make any definitive statement.”

Sen. Kamala Harris has also defended Biden, pointing instead at Trump.

“Mr. President, telling lies about Joe Biden won’t protect you from the truth. Joe has more patriotism in his pinky finger than you’ll ever have,” Harris wrote on Twitter.

Harris scored an early hit on Biden by questioning his history of opposing public bussing in public schools, even earning a bump in the polls, but the early momentum soon faded.

Attacking Biden has not worked well for other candidates as well. Former Housing Secretary Julian Castro swung at Biden, questioning memory loss in the last debate, but missed, earning scorn from pundits and Democrat voters.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand tried to score points against Biden on women’s issues, but her attack came off as self-serving, leading her to ultimately drop out of the race.

Other low-polling candidates who tried to score points against Joe Biden, such as New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio and Rep. Eric Swalwell, soon dropped out of the race after their attacks failed to resonate with primary voters.

Castro did not appear interested in hitting the Bidens again, responding to questions about Hunter Biden by criticizing Trump.

“Donald Trump is trying to use the same playbook against Joe Biden as he used against Hillary Clinton,” he said.

Mayor Pete Buttigeig began the week by vocally defending Biden on CNN, earning praise from the former Vice President.

“I’m a friend of Pete Buttigieg,” Biden told the United Food and Commercial Workers 2020 presidential forum on Sunday. “By the way, he’s a really decent guy. I turned on the television this morning and he was defending me and my family against these outrageous, lying ads of the president of the United States of America. That’s a good man.”

Sen. Cory Booker, who at times cannot resist taking gratuitous shots at Biden, has also stood up for the president.

“This is unacceptable, that if you come after Joe Biden, you’re going to have to deal with me in this case, these are baseless, unfounded, scurrilous lies,” he said in October.

But in September, Booker also questioned Hunter Biden’s actions when Trump’s attacks took form.

“I just don’t think children of vice presidents, presidents during the administration should be out there doing that,” he said.

Other candidates have promised not to allow similar behavior if they were elected president.

“I would not allow a family member, anyone in my cabinet to have a family member, to work in a position like that,” Rep. Beto O’Rourke said

Sen. Amy Klobachar promised the same.

“I can promise you right now, my own daughter, who’s only 24, does not sit on the board of a foreign company,” she said on CNN.

Andrew Yang said Hunter Biden’s role in foreign companies “certainly has a bad look to it.”

“In my mind they can wait until the term is over before serving that term,” he said. “And that’s really the way it would be under my administration.”

Tulsi Gabbard remains the wildcard.

After a devastating series of attacks against Sen. Kamala Harris in the August debate, Gabbard demonstrated she knew how to criticize the substance of her opponent’s record, without sounding gratuitous.

When asked to weigh in on the Biden’s she said that allowing a vice president’s son to sit on a corporate board “would be a poor decision to make.”

“I don’t know what went into that or how he got hired or why or what influence there was used, if any, but I think the perception is certainly a concern,” she said."

The rap stars said in a podcast conversation with Tip “T.I.” Harris Tuesday that President Trump generates a level of enthusiasm among his supporters that none of the Democratic candidates can match. The three rap stars were talking to promote their new Netflix reality competition series Rhythm + Flow.

“You all can quote me on this a couple of years down the line,” Chance the Rapper said. “I think Trump is going to win again at the next election because he’s got the biggest base.”

“He does. I believe it,” said Cardi B, citing the passion levels of Trump supporters.

“I really hate to say it, but sometimes I do believe that Trump will be winning,” she said. “Just because due to the fact that every single time I don’t see nobody saying they love a Democratic candidate. There’s no candidate that people are saying like we love, we want them to win.”

Cardi B said Trump supporters are motivated by racism against Mexicans.

“Every single time he always talk about how he want to take away Medicare and shit like that. A poor white man that’s getting Medicare is not even caring that he’s saying that, he just cares that he hates Mexicans and he want to get rid of them,” she said.

“A lot of people vote with feelings in America and a lot of their feelings is racism and religion.”

Cardi B is a vocal supporter of Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders and has appeared with the candidate at public events.

Chance the Rapper said the two-party system is responsible for President Trump’s ruse to power.

“There’s two parties that pick who they want to run for office, and then there’s a bunch of lobbying and money that gets thrown around, and eventually they come out and say, ‘This is who our leader is,'” he said.

Maddie McGarvey for CNN Twelve presidential candidates take part in the Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio, on Tuesday, October 15. The candidates, from left, are US Rep. Tulsi Gabbard; businessman Tom Steyer; US Sen. Cory Booker; US Sen. Kamala Harris; US Sen. Bernie Sanders; former Vice President Joe Biden; US Sen. Elizabeth Warren; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; businessman Andrew Yang; former US Rep. Beto O'Rourke; US Sen. Amy Klobuchar; and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro.

It was the most crowded debate stage in the history of US presidential primaries.

Twelve candidates shared the spotlight Tuesday at the Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus. The event was hosted by CNN and The New York Times on the campus of Otterbein University.

This was the fourth Democratic debate of the campaign season, and it came three and a half months before the Iowa caucuses.

The first two debates had so many candidates that they had to be split up over two nights. But the Democratic National Committee raised the polling and fundraising thresholds that candidates need to qualify.

Those thresholds will be raised once again ahead of next month's debate in Georgia, so Tuesday might have been a make-or-break night for some of the lower-polling candidates."

Kamala Harris on Wednesday defended her calls for Twitter to suspend President Donald Trump's account, a plan she reiterated on stage at the fourth Democratic primary presidential debate hosted by CNN and The New York Times.",2019-10-16,CNN,Kamala Harris defends her push to get Trump's Twitter account suspended,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/16/politics/kamala-harris-trump-twitter-suspension-cnntv/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Sen. Kamala Harris on Wednesday defended her calls for Twitter to suspend President Donald Trump's account, a plan she reiterated on stage at the fourth Democratic primary presidential debate hosted by CNN and The New York Times.

Harris first made her call following the President's tweets about the whistleblower complaint at the center of the Ukraine scandal. During Tuesday night's debate, Harris called out Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, one of the field's front-runners, for not following her lead in saying Trump's Twitter account should be taken down. Warren brushed off Harris' proposal, saying she didn't just want to ""push Trump off Twitter"" but also out of the White House.

The contentious moment led to some criticism for Harris, including from former US National Security Council spokesperson Tommy Vietor, who called Harris' push during the debate ""small ball.""

Harris, however, told CNN's John Berman on ""New Day"" Wednesday that Trump's ""threatening remarks"" about the whistleblower and others is a ""serious matter.""

""It's a serious matter. And it is a matter of the safety of those individuals,"" she said. ""You can look at the fact that the shooter in El Paso was influenced by the words that the President of the United States, unfiltered, uses through this medium on Twitter. He has 65 million followers. And we have to take seriously the implications that are about the threatening witnesses, intimidating witnesses and obstructing justice.""

She added: ""When witnesses are threatened by the President of the United States, it is a very serious matter. And people will be influenced by those threats. And we have to say that it is not OK and that he has revoked his privilege to use this platform because it is a privilege that can be and should be taken away.""

Harris also said companies like Facebook and Twitter need to adopt the same set of standards to govern what is allowed on their platforms.

""And the point also has to be, you can't have one set of standards for Facebook and another for Twitter,"" she said on Wednesday. ""All of these social media companies and these online platforms, which are so powerful in their ability to impact perception about an issue and to influence behaviors. Let's be clear about that. There have to be standards, and the standards have to be the same. You can't have one standard for Facebook and another for Twitter.""

While companies like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter collaborate closely and are closely aligned on policing content from terrorist groups, each is a separate company and has their own set of standards for political speech.

In May, for instance, when a fake video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi circulated, the three major platforms acted differently. YouTube removed the video, Facebook let the video stay online but downranked it meaning it would be seen by less people and Twitter allowed the video to stay online.

Earlier this month, Harris sent a letter to the Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey listing six tweets by the President that she says violated Twitter's rules. The White House called Harris' demand ""authoritarian"" and defended Trump's use of Twitter.

""It is not surprising that Kamala Harris, someone who believes in bigger government and more regulation, would like to silence her political opponents,"" the White House said in a statement. ""In fact, it's rather authoritarian of her. President Trump's use of technology to communicate directly with the American people and share his Administration's unprecedented accomplishments should be praised, not criticized.""

On Tuesday, Twitter issued a clarification in a blog post on rules for tweets by world leaders, saying ""that the accounts of world leaders are not above our policies entirely."" The social media network reiterated its announcement from June that some tweets from world leaders that break its rules would not be removed from the platform if the company decided they were in the ""public interest."" Twitter said it would instead put a disclaimer on the tweets explaining that although they broke the company's rules they would not be removed.

Twitter has not labeled any of Trump's tweets in this way."

Current and former officials are painting an ever more damning picture of a wider than originally perceived scheme by President Donald Trump and his crew to pressure Ukraine that they warned could amount to a trampling of US law.

Vice President Mike Pence launched a new effort Tuesday to bolster White House hopes of stalling the House inquiry long enough for Trump to turn public opinion against it. He refused to turn over documents related to Trump's now notorious call with the President of Ukraine on July 25.

But White House officials are becoming increasingly frustrated at revelations from the closed-door hearings. Given that there is no presidential counsel in the room, they struggle to frame a defense, learning about almost daily bombshells only from news reports, CNN reported on Tuesday.

And the possibility that former national security adviser John Bolton -- who may have little incentive to shield the President who recently ousted him -- could soon be called to testify will do little to ease the impression among White House officials that they are flying blind.

Fresh testimony in recent days has elevated the crisis for Trump. It has appeared to expose an off-the-books effort to perform an end run around US foreign policy officials with political appointees that predated his notorious phone call with the President of Ukraine in which he sought dirt on his possible 2020 foe Joe Biden.

On Monday, former senior White House Russia aide Fiona Hill testified that she had tried to raise the alarm about possibly illegal activity -- and had been encouraged to do so by Bolton.

A senior State Department official, George Kent, testified Tuesday that he'd been told by a supervisor to lie low after complaining about Rudy Giuliani's meddling in Ukraine, according to Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia, who sits on the House Oversight Committee.

More peril looms for the White House on Thursday, when Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, is expected to tell lawmakers that a text he sent to a colleague insisting there was no quid pro quo offered to Ukraine was dictated by the President himself.

The most worrying development so far this week for the Trump team is that Hill's stunning mention of Bolton raises the possibility that a possibly disgruntled former national security adviser, who was forced out under a cloud, may have an incentive to offer testimony that could damage his former boss.

Trump's rather worn defense of his actions exemplifies the depth of his problem. The Ukraine story has outpaced the President's attacks on a whistleblower who first exposed the story and his defense of his ""perfect"" call with Ukraine's President. Trump's allies are bemoaning what they say is a lack of due process in the Democratic impeachment investigation -- but they often seem unable to effectively parry the damaging tidbits leaking out of depositions.

Trump's defense is beginning to look insufficient

The President stuck to generalities on Tuesday.

""We just hit the greatest economy we've ever had. 'Let's impeach the President' -- isn't that a good idea?"" Trump said during an event with the Stanley Cup champion St. Louis Blues.

""I wouldn't worry about it, fellas. I wouldn't worry about it,"" the President told several senators in the audience, referring to impeachment -- raising questions as to whether he understands the seriousness of his plight.

Democrats are expressing deep satisfaction with the pace of their three-week-old investigation so far.

And in a sign that GOP attacks on their process are not yet biting, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday that she had no plans yet to bow to demands for a vote formally authorizing the impeachment proceedings.

House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff laid claim to ""dramatic progress"" Tuesday in digging out the truth about Trump's call with President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25.

And Democratic presidential candidates -- in a grave moment at the start of their latest debate in Ohio -- reflected polls showing growing public support for investigating the President.

Former Vice President Joe Biden blasted Trump as ""the most corrupt"" President ""in modern history and all of our history.""

When asked whether she was not giving the President a fair shot by already calling for his ouster, Sen. Kamala Harris of California said: ""It is just being observant. He has committed crimes in plain sight.""

The White House attempted on Tuesday to try to reassert control over an impeachment drama with which it has struggled to keep pace. Vice President Mike Pence said he would refuse a subpoena for documents related to Ukraine.

""The House of Representatives has not authorized any 'impeachment inquiry,' "" Matthew Morgan, counsel to the vice president, wrote in a letter to Democratic House committee chairmen.

There is no constitutional requirement for Democrats to hold a vote authorizing impeachment proceedings. Such a vote did take place, however, in the previous two impeachment showdowns, involving Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. There is a case to be made that Democrats should go out of their way to offer a fair process to the President -- since their slim hopes of winning a Senate conviction after any impeachment vote in the full House rely on reshaping public opinion.

Worries about illegal behavior

Hill's testimony suggested that senior figures inside Trump's White House were deeply concerned that the activities by the President and those close to him could reach the level of illegal behavior.

While it remains unclear whether Trump or his lawyer Giuliani did actually break the law in going around official channels to deal with Ukraine, much of the conduct now emerging at least appears unethical, off-the-books of regular diplomatic activity and more expansive than it initially appeared.

On Tuesday, Giuliani's lawyer informed Congress that the former New York mayor will defy House Democrats' impeachment subpoena. The Office of Management and Budget also does not plan to turn over the documents that impeachment committees subpoenaed, a spokeswoman said.

According to sources familiar with Hill's testimony, she also said Bolton had warned her that he would not get caught up in what he referred to as a ""drug deal"" being cooked up on Ukraine by Sondland and White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.

One source told CNN that Hill, a Trump appointee, saw ""wrongdoing"" in the White House approach to Ukraine and tried to report it to officials.

Hill was concerned that Giuliani was circumventing the State Department to run what some Democrats have labeled a ""shadow foreign policy"" by seeking the removal of US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and pushing for Ukraine to open an investigation into the former vice president and his son Hunter Biden. There is no evidence of wrongdoing in Ukraine by either Biden."

Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday challenged her Democratic primary rivals to release the names of contributors and fundraisers with influential positions on their campaigns, while pledging to champion legislation that would effectively disqualify big-dollar donors from being appointed to cushy diplomatic posts.

The requests were written into a series of mostly new proposed campaign finance restrictions, which would ban corporate PACs from donating to federal candidates and make it illegal for certain super PACs to be run by operatives with professional or personal ties to the candidate they're backing.

Now firmly among the front-runners for the Democratic presidential nomination, Warren has increasingly centered her campaign on a broad anti-corruption platform . In past rollouts, she promised to forbid lobbyists from making political contributions, acting as bundlers or hosting fundraisers for candidates. Former top federal officials -- including presidents, vice presidents, members of Congress, judges, and cabinet secretaries -- would also be permanently prohibited from taking lobbying jobs.

While Warren does not name any of her competitors in her Medium post, the new call for campaigns to ""disclose any donor or fundraiser who has a special title on their campaign, including national and regional finance committee members and bundler designations"" is an apparent nudge to a number of top rivals, like former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and California Sen. Kamala Harris, who all regularly attend big-dollar fundraising events.

Warren's call to cut off the donor-to-ambassador pipeline, which she acknowledges has been common practice in both Republican and Democratic administrations, comes with increased resonance now that President Donald Trump's EU ambassador, Gordon Sondland , a Republican megadonor who gave $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee, has emerged as a key figure in the Ukraine scandal.

(CNN) President Donald Trump's ears must have been burning as Democrats met in Ohio at the most crowded presidential debate in US history on Tuesday.

The 12 candidates at the CNN/New York Times debate conjured up visions of a vastly different America should they evict him from the White House in 2020. They'd reverse Trump's erratic, ""America First"" twists and turns, and restore the US leadership in the world -- somehow. But as the heated exchanges on health care, tax and billionaires showed, the Democratic Party still doesn't know how far left it wants to go.

Who won and lost a debate often takes a few days to become clear as viral moments ignite on social media and voters chew over the post-game analysis. But the early money suggests that this debate will not shake up the wider shape of the race. Former Vice President Joe Biden is a wobbly front runner. Elizabeth Warren has joined him in the top tier (and attacks that she faced on Tuesday night -- the most withering of her career -- show that the rest of the field knows it.)

While some outsiders did well -- like 30-something Pete Buttigieg and centrist Senator Amy Klobuchar, who brought sharp knives for Warren -- everyone else is still struggling to get a look in.

Four takeaways that will shape the campaign

The shadow of impeachment

Joe Biden, reaching for gravitas, said Trump's presidency was ""the most corrupt in modern history and all of our history."" Kamala Harris said the President had ""committed crimes in plain sight."" Elizabeth Warren said this was ""bigger than politics."" Whatever happens with the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump will tear America even further apart. And if one of the men or women on stage beats him at the polls, they'll end up with the job of trying to put it back together.

What about the Kurds?

All of the candidates agreed Trump was wrong to abruptly remove US troops from the side of Kurdish allies in Syria. But there was a strong isolationist strain onstage, in keeping with the mood of a nation exhausted by foreign wars. Co-frontrunner Warren did not quarrel with Trump's instinct to bring troops home, just with how he's doing it. ""I think we want to get out of the Middle East. I do think we should do it responsibly,"" she said. Until further notice, that is America's message to the rest of the world.

So that's what it's like to be a front-runner

Elizabeth Warren now knows what it's like to have a target on her back. Her rise to effective co-front-runner status exposed her to attacks from all sides on Tuesday. Both Buttigieg and Klobuchar piled on -- seeking to grab the middle ground of many Democrats who fear Warren and Sanders are too left wing. ""The difference between a plan and a pipedream is something you can actually get done,"" said Klobuchar, desperate for a viral moment as she struggles to reach polling thresholds to get her into the next debate.

In one of the most electric moments of the campaign, Biden and Warren -- the two most likely nominees -- clashed directly for the first time.

What heart attack?

Those two stents inserted into one of Bernie Sanders' arteries did the trick. The Vermont senator was ""feeling great"" and keen to wrest the debate away from Trump-bashing and back to his wheelhouse: health care, student debt and getting rid of billionaires. Sanders supporters will be relieved. But millions of moderate Americans watching at home might be more concerned at his frank admission that taxes will go up to pay for his ambitious social reforms.

Shameful. Shameful!

That was Biden letting off steam at Trump's decision to let Syria roll into northeastern Syria at the expense of America's Kurdish allies. The former vice president has much to vent about the President.

Brexit interlude

There's a generally held view of the European Union as an 11th hour decision-maker, working its way out of difficulties with late-night summits fueled by dozens of cups of coffee and pastries, and prime ministers and presidents only staggering out after midnight to announce a breakthrough.

Sometimes that really is what happens (it's also not uncommon for heads of state convening in Brussels to nip out for frites and a beer during negotiating breaks) but that's not how the EU likes to do things.

In fact, the European Council prefers to have its agenda set two weeks ahead of each summit. That gives the Commission -- its executive body -- time to analyze everything and make recommendations to member states, who also have to prepare. But Brexit is no ordinary agenda item.

This month, the EU has blown through one self-imposed deadline after another, as they try to settle the conditions of a UK exit from the union, before heads of government start turning up in Brussels. On Tuesday, they missed another deadline. As things stand now, no one will have time to digest any Brexit deal before the Thursday summit -- which could mean more stale pastries, fries and head-scratching in the middle of the night, instead.

-- CNN's Richard Greene , writing to Meanwhile

Who said it? Debate edition

""I don't need lessons from you on courage — political or personal.""

""That is dead wrong.""

""It didn't work in 2016 and it will be a disaster for us in 2020.""

""The mainstream media, who have been championing and cheerleading this regime-change war.""

""You got the disastrous war in Iraq done.""

""MATH""

What good is a 12-person debate anyway?

Glad you asked.

The US electoral map is so vast that most Americans only see presidential candidates on TV, so these events are necessary for Democratic officials to build enthusiasm among voters, reaching tens of millions of viewers -- and not just Democrats. And the crowded field offers more than a soundbite fest — it fleshes out a broader divide between liberal and moderate positions that grassroots voters must adjudicate before choosing a candidate.

There is something quintessentially American about opening the White House race to everyone. The last two US presidents have been a rookie senator from Illinois and a businessman from New York with almost no political experience between them and little in common. Debates are part of a process that must be sufficiently elastic to accommodate sharp shifts in public opinion over a four year cycle.

In a populist age, party elites fear charges of dictating voters' choices, and the field will narrow soon enough anyway. When it does, the debates will have been good practice for the eventual Democratic nominee, who must debate Donald Trump a year from now. Whether they're the right way to pick a decent president is a whole other ballgame."

(CNN) President Donald Trump has a nose for weakness. And Joe Biden's softest spot is his near-mystical reverence for family.

Nothing is likely to cause Biden more pain, to test his cool and to force him into an error more than an attack on his kin. The former vice president can barely get through a sentence without a poignant reference to his late parents, his second wife, Jill, his children or his grandchildren. In a life scarred by tragedy, he has already buried two of his kids and a first wife. Grief over the death of his eldest son, Beau, from brain cancer nixed a run for president in 2016.

So Trump has plunged his 2020 election dagger into Biden's second son, targeting Hunter Biden with unsubstantiated allegations about his business dealings in Ukraine and China. Going after family is one of his preferred tricks: In the 2016 presidential race, Trump mocked the Bush dynasty, knowing it would unhinge its scion Jeb. He upset Ted Cruz by insulting his wife, and raised Bill Clinton's affairs while debating Hillary Clinton (though eliciting only a slow blink).

Yet, with little sense of irony, Trump resents attacks on his own clan (and has shown flagrant disregard for potential conflicts of interest in his own sons' business ventures. As is often the case with leaders with an authoritarian streak, his kids -- kept close in the White House and in Trump's businesses -- are the only ones who can offer the loyalty he craves.

Trump signaled to then-special counsel Robert Mueller that probing his family accounts would cross a red line. But there are no such lines when the President himself perceives an enemy.

Postcard from Kiev

Demonstrators light smoke flares as they march in central Kiev.

About 20,000 people marched in a nationalist rally in Kiev, with many calling on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky not to move forward on a peace deal with Russia-backed separatists in the country's east.

""The protesters marched in groups. We saw regular soldiers, veterans and nationalist groups. Some had their faces covered and wore all black. Most striking was the diversity of ages -- we saw teenagers right up to pensioners,"" writes CNN's Sebastian Shukla to Meanwhile from Kiev.

""Flares were lit and chants such as 'Death to the enemy' and 'Glory to Ukraine' were shouted by the entire contingent. Protesters marched down to Maidan Square and the Presidential Administration, where they covered the building in stickers saying 'No to capitulation' -- a clear reference to Zelensky's recent move to form a peace deal in the east.""

'A strategic calamity'

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took the rare step of openly breaking with Trump over a key policy issue. ""I am gravely concerned by recent events in Syria and by our nation's apparent response thus far,"" the Kentucky Republican said. ""I look forward to discussing what the United States can do to avoid a strategic calamity with my Senate colleagues and with senior administration officials.""

Syria, in brief

Kurds in northern Syria are gambling with their autonomy by turning to Russia and the Syrian government for protection after Trump withdrew US troops. Now the White House is trying to cover its blushes after the President's strategy was panned as a foreign policy disaster at home and abroad. Here's the latest, in brief:

The Syrian Kurdish governing coalition said it would sign a ""memorandum of understanding"" with Moscow, in an attempt to ""prevent the Turkish attack.""

Syrian President Bashar Assad's army entered several cities in the area, according to state media -- part of a deal with the Kurds to enforce the border with Turkey.

Turkey accused the Kurds of deliberately releasing ISIS prisoners. Trump soon echoed that claim -- but a senior US official told CNN that's just not true.

Trump announced new sanctions on Turkey over an incursion for which he cleared the way last week, warning that its ""action is precipitating a humanitarian crisis and setting conditions for possible war crimes.""

Vice President Mike Pence said he would travel to Turkey to push for a ceasefire between groups in the area.

In a press briefing about US sanctions on Turkey, Vice President Mike Pence told reporters that Trump had spoken to both Kurdish General Mazloum Kobani Abdi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and CNN got a look at his notes in the process.

Democrats debate

The CNN/New York Times presidential debate tonight in Ohio will be the most pivotal moment yet in the Democratic race. The clash among 12 candidates will highlight growing vulnerabilities among front-runners and offer outsiders one of a dwindling number of chances to break through. Here's what each major candidate must do:

Joe Biden must make sure his debate is not overshadowed by Trump's unsubstantiated claims about his son's financial dealings. He has fiercely rebutted any suggestion of impropriety, and his Democratic rivals have defended him so far. But they may not be above wondering why Hunter Biden risked conflicts of interest by doing business abroad while his father was vice president.

Bernie Sanders is desperate for a strong showing after a heart attack raised questions about his age and health. The 78-year-old senator from Vermont was already in danger of losing the battle for the party's progressive left. He can't afford to slip.

Elizabeth Warren has overtaken Sanders and is now considered a co-front-runner with Biden. That means she's got a target on her back. The liberal senator from Massachusetts bills herself as the candidate with a plan for anything, but expect her rivals to attack her glaringly unspecific position on a top issue: health care.

Pete Buttigieg's quietly impressive campaign and bumper fundraising could set him up for a possible late surge into the first contest in Iowa. But he must disprove impressions that -- as the 37-year-old mayor of a small Indiana city -- he lacks the experience to be president.

Kamala Harris needs something to happen. Soon. A campaign that started with great promise has sputtered, partly due to the California senator's shaky grasp of her own policies. Time is running out for a leap into the top tier.

Everyone else -- including Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Obama administration Cabinet Secretary Julián Castro and former Congressman Beto O'Rourke of Texas -- simply must give voters a reason to care. Some of them are already in danger of falling short of the stricter criteria for the next debate, in November.

(CNN) In Tuesday night's Democratic presidential debate, I'm afraid most of the candidates blended into the stage for me at some point. But that doesn't mean there wasn't a star among them. Here's how each candidate performed:

Bernie Sanders: A

Throughout the three-hour event, Sen. Sanders was consistently sharper than normal, and he outperformed the others, especially Elizabeth Warren, when explaining the financials of his healthcare plan. I liked his attitude about his health: we can judge it by watching him take the campaign by storm. He was the star of the evening.

Sanders remained firm and defiant when it was called for, asserting that nobody can trust our foreign policy because President Donald Trump is unpredictable. And when Joe Biden heated up toward the end of the debate, saying,""I'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done,"" Sanders was ready to put things in perspective by replying: ""You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country. You got trade agreements, like NAFTA (The North American Free Trade Agreement) and PNTR (Permanent Normal Trade Relations), with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs.""

Overall, Sanders' nonverbal communication -- typically hyper with lots of hand-waving -- was reined in, and that served him well. His animation was kept to a minimum, which was smart and effective.

Kamala Harris: A-

Sen. Harris flourished by doing the opposite of Sanders. Rather than being restrained, she brought a bit more energy to her debate performance, which she needed.

On the topic of abortion, nobody was more powerful than Harris, who declared: ""Women are the majority of the population in this country. People need to keep their hands off of women's bodies and let women make the decisions about their own lives."" And Harris got the better of Elizabeth Warren when asking Warren to support the suspension of President Trump's Twitter account.

But a couple of stories didn't land. For instance, when debating a tax credit to close the income gap, Harris told a childhood anecdote about her mom sitting at the kitchen table wondering how to ""make it all work."" In the past, Harris has hit home runs with these personal stories, but this time around, she had none that were especially memorable.

Pete Buttigieg: B

Mayor Pete was pretty effective in policy arguments. He provided several options for depoliticizing the Supreme Court, and more than held his own on health care and gun control. Buttigieg also won most of the direct skirmishes he entered with other candidates. He got the best of Tulsi Gabbard when discussing Syria and keeping our military commitments. He called out Elizabeth Warren when she failed to satisfactorily explain how she'd pay for Medicare for All.

But then he slipped up when he made a back-and-forth about gun control with Beto O'Rourke needlessly personal. After O'Rourke remarked that policymakers should ""lead and not be limited by the polls and the consultants and the focus groups,"" Buttigieg retorted: ""I don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal."" The remark seemed to come from left field. Mayor Pete responded as if he was called a coward, but that simply wasn't the case.

Phantom attacks like these happen often in competitive debates when expectations of an opponent's arguments don't always match the reality of what has been said. It was an unfortunate miscalculation by Buttigieg.

Cory Booker: B

Sen. Booker had a good tone throughout the evening. He was conversational, which is what I teach my students to strive for. Booker was also solid on content, consistently taking arguments one step further, like when he mentioned how anti-abortion laws disproportionately affect low-income women and the need to talk about child poverty when discussing tax systems.

On the downside, Booker focused too much energy on chastising everyone else over their tones and argument style when talking to one another (he was right, but then he overplayed his hand and his criticism seemed canned). Speaking of canned, what was the joke about Bernie Sanders being a fan of medical marijuana? Round peg, meet square hole.

Andrew Yang: B-

Bold ideas suit him well. While Yang's defense of his Freedom Dividend (a universal basic income of $1,000 a month) was lacking in support in this debate, he made up for it by defending other unconventional ideas. Yang floated the idea of decriminalizing opioids, which impressively got support from O'Rourke. Yang was smart to point out that Elizabeth Warren's plan to implement a wealth tax has been tried. ""The problem is that it's been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all those countries ended up repealing it, because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they'd projected,"" Yang said.

There were a few arguments where Yang was less successful. Booker overshadowed him on the topic of breaking up large tech companies. While Yang expressed skepticism over some benefits of breaking them up, Booker pointed out that the issue is not just competition, but that these large monopolies ""undermine our democracy.""

Yang also could use a bit more practice finishing his arguments. While he made a good point that our data should be treated as our property, his analysis was incomplete. Yang needed to more fully explain what having control of our data would mean for Americans.

Julian Castro: C+

He all but disappeared in parts of the debate, so it was difficult for him to climb the grading scale. However, Castro had some on-point analysis when discussing why communities don't want cops coming to their house under the guise of confiscating assault weapons. This approach was bold but risky. It could work against him if his criticism of weapon confiscation is interpreted as anti-police.

Elizabeth Warren: C

Sen. Warren needs to answer the questions. She is simply too smart to ignore the topic she is being asked to address -- especially when she's asked the same thing multiple times. Should Trump's Twitter account be suspended? I personally don't know -- and neither, it seems, does Warren. How is she planning to pay for Medicare for all? Again, she left us wondering,

Warren also came across as petty by implying it was not Biden but President Obama who should be credited with helping some of her bills become laws during the Obama administration.

Amy Klobuchar: C

While I found her delivery to be less than optimal at times, Klobuchar had some good points. She spoke thoughtfully on Roe v. Wade, taking on Big Pharma and income inequality.

Unfortunately, Klobuchar got caught in an awkward nonverbal moment when Castro was speaking on the topic of monopolies and the camera panned over to her. Her blank expression reminded me of when I catch a student on a cell phone during class. It's a good reminder to look engaged at all times -- you never know when you'll be in the spotlight.

If I could give her one piece of advice it would be to please stop using the scripted jokes. No one is laughing.

Beto O'Rourke: C

O'Rourke was simply average the entire time. He argued better than he did during the first debate, but was an expected let-down from his last debate. Unfortunately, the issue of guns, which he has made a central point of his campaign, was probably the worst part of his performance on Tuesday. O'Rourke needed more evidence to support his belief that owners of AR-15s and AK-47s will voluntarily give up their weapons under an assault rifle ban.

Joe Biden: C-

The best part of former Vice President Joe Biden's debate came toward the end when he highlighted his accomplishments. While still not as smooth as it could have been, he made a convincing argument: ""I'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done, from the Violence Against Women Act to making sure that we pass the Affordable Care Act to being in a position where we, in fact, took almost a $90 billion act that kept us from going into a depression...""

Unfortunately, this came a bit late in the night. And for every good answer, Biden had multiple slipups. Examples include whatever this means: ""And lastly, and I apologize for going on, but lastly, what is happening in Iraq is going to -- I mean, excuse me, in Afghanistan, as well as all the way over to Syria, we have ISIS that's going to come here ..."" Once you've fumbled that much, you've lost the audience.

Biden needs to take his own advice and eliminate some of the clutter in his mind when he's answering questions. As he said in the debate, ""And this is one of the reasons why these debates are kind of crazy, because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given."" Exactly.

Tulsi Gabbard: D

Congresswoman Gabbard probably put off a lot of people with her responses. Drawing from the Republican playbook, she complained about the mainstream media and pointed out that she disagreed with Hillary Clinton on many issues. At the end of the night, when candidates were asked to explain a surprising friendship, Gabbard talked about her relationship with Republican Trey Gowdy. The same Trey Gowdy that Trump tried to hire for his impeachment defense team

However, my favorite part of the whole debate was when apparently Gabbard tried to take over the moderators' jobs and pose a question to the other candidates. She was quickly shut down when moderator Erin Burnett jumped in and announced a commercial break.

Tom Steyer: D

This was Steyer's first debate, and I had no problem with any of his answers, so in that regard, it was a success. But on public speaking 101, he failed. Have you ever met a person who never breaks eye contact until you feel uncomfortable? Steyer's nonstop eye contact with the camera made me feel the need to look away. It looked totally unnatural. We can only hope that he watches himself back and makes a note to blink in the next debate."

Look, Maya Angelou told us years ago, listen to somebody when they tell you who they are the first time. During that election, Donald Trump told us he could shoot somebody on 5th Avenue and get away with it.”

“And he has consistently since he won been selling out the American people, he’s been selling out working people, he’s been selling out our values, he’s been selling out our national security,” Harris said. “And on this issue with Ukraine, he’s been selling out our democracy.”

“Our framers imagined this moment, a moment where we would have a corrupt president,” Harris continued. “And our framers then rightly designed our system of democracy to be checks and balances. This is one of those moments. And so Congress must act.”

Harris then said Trump is “the most corrupt and unpatriotic president we have ever had.”

Kamala Harris (D-CA) falsely claimed during the Democrat debate Tuesday night that “women will die, poor women, women of color will die” because Republican-led states have passed abortion restrictions.

Sen. Kamala Harris said during the segment of the debate on health care in Ohio that Republicans “have passed laws that will virtually prevent women from having access to reproductive healthcare.”

She added:

And it is not an exaggeration to say, women will die, poor women, women of color will die because these Republican legislators in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with their bodies. Women are the majority of the population in this country. People need to keep their hands off of women’s bodies and let women make the decisions about healthcare issues in America today.

Harris’s statement is a deception that has been spread by Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry for years, but has reached feverish pitch since the pro-life Trump administration has now appointed two Supreme Court justices who intend to interpret the Constitution as it was originally written.

The fear for abortion rights supporters is that Roe v. Wade will ultimately be overturned. Proponents of abortion have increasingly made more claims that “women will die” if this happens, hoping to feed the narrative that a multitude of women died before the 1973 landmark Supreme Court ruling that invented a right to abortion.

‘The consequence will be women’s lives.’ — @PPFA Pres. @DrLeanaWen is explaining the real, deadly results of banning abortion pic.twitter.com/cykbl4JjCA — NowThis (@nowthisnews) May 20, 2019

Prior to her recent sudden termination from Planned Parenthood, Dr. Leana Wen, its former president, was a frequent guest on talk shows and posted to Twitter that, if her organization is defunded or abortion is banned, women’s lives will be endangered.

“Thousands of women died before Roe v. Wade,” Wen told the Daily Show. “That could happen now.”

However, Planned Parenthood’s own fact sheets tell a very different story.

The abortion industry giant states:

In 1965, when abortion was still illegal nationwide except in cases of life endangerment, at least 193 women died from illegal abortions, and illegal abortion accounted for nearly 17 percent of all deaths due to pregnancy and childbirth in that year (Gold, 1990; NCHS, 1967).

The pro-choice Guttmacher Institute also reported:

By 1950, illegal abortion deaths fell to “just over 300,” likely “because of the introduction of antibiotics in 1940s, which permitted more effective treatment of the infections frequently developed after illegal abortion.” By 1965, “the number of deaths due to illegal abortion had fallen to just under 200.”

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 1972, the year before the Supreme Court’s decision in Roe, 24 women died from legal induced abortion – legal in a handful of states in which abortion in some very limited cases was permitted – and 39 women died from illegal abortion.

Let’s not kid ourselves. Abortion restrictions work. They have large, rapid effects and save tens of thousands of lives from the cruelty of murder in the womb.https://t.co/zTx7jBWfEo — The Federalist (@FDRLST) May 20, 2019

In 1973, when the Supreme Court created a right to abortion, CDC reported 19 deaths from illegal abortions and 25 deaths from legal abortions.

Though abortion reporting measures have not been consistent – leading to differing results – none of the reports gave the indication that “thousands” of women died in illegal abortions prior to Roe v. Wade.

As pro-life organization Live Action reported, NARAL founder and former abortionist Bernard Nathanson admitted he and others fabricated large numbers of deaths from illegal abortions prior to the high court’s decision in Roe.

According to the report, in his 1979 book, Aborting America, Nathanson called the “thousands” claim a “nice, round, shocking figure.”

Life News reported Nathanson said of the fabrication, “[I]n the ‘morality’ of our revolution, it was a useful figure, widely accepted so why go out of our way to correct it with honest statistics?”

Wen and now other abortion industry leaders and their political allies, however, are still suggesting “women will die” if abortion is banned. The fact is, women still die during “legal” abortions and “thousands” of children die each year because abortion is not banned.

Sen. Kamala Harris especially claimed “women of color” will die. Ironically, Planned Parenthood aborts the lives of more than 300,000 children each year, and 18 million of the 59 million abortions that have been performed in this country since the Roe v. Wade decision have ended the lives of babies “of color.”

Harris likely interjected the comments about abortion in the wake of complaints by Planned Parenthood and its allies that Democrats had failed to raise the issue of abortion rights during any of their debates thus far. Planned Parenthood responded favorably on Twitter to Harris’s remarks:"

And it could result literally in the threat to safety of human beings who are participating in the process of justice.”

She continued, “Are speech does not condone or protect threats to the safety of other human beings. and so that is what we are talking about.

She added, “The fact is that he is irresponsible. He is erratic. He does not —he is like a two-year-old with a machine gun. Right? He doesn’t understand the power of his words or his actions in way that they will actually impact and could end other human beings’ lives. So whether he understands it or not, look, he is the president of the United States. I don’t actually care where he understands it or not. Because he is he has shown that he is not responsible enough to self-regulate. He has shown he is not responsible enough to edit what he says.”

After Harris demanded that tech corporations like Twitter ban President Trump from their platforms, Warren touted that she, unlike Harris, has refused to take donations from Big Tech and Big Pharma.

Harris, despite claiming that she will fight Big Tech and Big Pharma companies if elected, has taken donor money from employees of the country’s biggest tech conglomerates and pharmaceutical executives, as Breitbart News has detailed.

In fact, Harris’s campaign has been almost exclusively propped up by a base of elite coastal donors with less than 40 percent of her funding coming from small-dollar donors giving $200 or less. The majority of Harris’s donations, more than 56 percent, have come from large-dollar donors giving $200 or more.

Harris’s top donors include lawyers from the Paul, Weiss, et al. law firm, which has represented Citigroup, as well as American job outsourcers and offshorers such as the Walt Disney Company; multinational communications services AT&T; Alphabet Inc., which is the parent corporation of Google; as well as Apple Inc.

In May, billionaire Gordon Getty of the Getty Oil dynasty hosted a fundraiser for Harris at his mansion in San Francisco, California, with Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA). Campaign records find that the billionaire Getty family has contributed thousands to Harris.

Likewise, though Harris’s campaign has claimed that she does not accept funding from Big Pharma, a number of pharmaceutical executives have gifted the California senator with campaign cash, The Intercept notes:

Donors include Therese Meaney, a vice president at Endo Pharmaceuticals, a company that manufacturers opioid painkillers, who has given $1,250 to the Harris campaign; Ted Love, the president and chief executive of Global Blood Therapeutics, a startup biopharmaceutical company, who gave $2,800; J. Dana Hughes, a vice president at Pfizer, gave $250; Damian Wilmot, an executive at Vertex Pharmaceuticals, gave $1,000; and Jeffrey Stein, the chief executive of Cidara Therapeutics, another drug startup, who gave $1,000.

Silicon Valley’s tech elites have been major contributors to Harris’s bid as she has campaigned against slapping tariffs on the foreign-made products of tech corporations.

Seven Facebook executives and employees have donated $1,000 or more to Harris’s campaign, while nearly 20 Google executives and employees have donated more than $1,000, four Twitter executives and employees have donated more than $1,000, and 71 Amazon executives and employees have donated anywhere from $5 to $2,000.

The Walt Disney Company’s Craig Hunegs, who heads Disney Television Studios, is one of Harris’s top donors, giving nearly $6,000 to her campaign. California real estate developer John Dinapoli, Coastal Healthcare Services President Quiana Mitchem, and New York Attorney Fraser Hunter Jr. have all donated more than $5,000 to Harris as well.

That is a crime.”

Harris began by saying, “[W]e’re talking about a private corporation, Twitter, that has terms of use. And as far as I’m concerned, and I think most people would say, including members of Congress who he has threatened, that he has lost his privileges and it should be taken down.”

She added, “He does not have a right to commit a crime because he is president of the United States. He does not have the right to threaten witnesses and threaten their safety because he is president of the United States. In fact, that’s the very problem with Donald Trump. He thinks he’s above the law, and we cannot keep reinforcing that. And anyone who wants to say, well, this is a matter of free speech, you are not free to threaten the life of a witness. That is a crime.”

Harris later stated, “We have to have a very serious conversation about what should be the rules placed on these private corporations, and in that context, Twitter has a responsibility.”

CNN anchors Anderson Cooper and Erin Burnett will moderate the debate with New York Times Editor Marc Lacey.

Stay tuned to Breitbart News for live updates. All times eastern.





—

10:45 PM: Cooper, after discussing Ellen and Dubya hanging out at a Cowboys game, asks candidates about a friendship that they have had that would surprise people or had an impact on them. Serious question: Did Cooper or CNN producers watch Phil Mickelson’s “Tribute Tuesday” Instagram posts before asking this typical MSM question? Nothing MSM loves more than “unity” and “bipartisanship.”

Castro: Rambles about people who thought differently and grew up differently. Doesn’t name anyone. Castro says we should be kind to people but should also hold people to account like George W. Bush.

Gabbard: Names Republicans like Trey Gowdy. Says Gowdy has been there for her during some personally challenging times.

Klobuchar: Names McCain.

Steyer: A woman from Denmark, South Carolina, who is fighting for clean water and environmental justice. Different race, gender, and from a different part of the country.

Beto: Says he has always tried to bring people together. Names retiring Rep. Will Hurd (R-TX).

Booker: He says he has so many he can’t count… goes to Bible study in Sen. Inhofe’s (R-OK) office and went to dinner with Sen. Cruz (R-TX).

Yang: After saying he will spend ten hours answering questions on his website on Friday, names “Fred the Felon,” a white working-class truck driver who previously supported Trump and now supports Yang.

Harris: Rand Paul. Talks about how they joined together on a bill to end cash bail.

Mayor Pete: Talks about friendships formed in the military–different race, politics.

Warren: Harvard Law Prof. Charles Fried.

Sanders: McCain for working with him on veterans issues.

Biden: McCain. Whacks Trump for being a “liar” and a “cheat.”

10:30 PM: Biden says he’s the only one on the stage who has gotten anything really big done.

Sanders rips Biden — says he got the Iraq War, NAFTA, PNTR (permanent normal trade relations) with China done.

Oh Bernie with the combo on Biden and all the bad things (Iraq, bankruptcy bill) he got done. Bam bam bam. — Matt Stoller (@matthewstoller) October 16, 2019

Warren takes credit for the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Board (CFPB).

10:23 PM: Biden says he won’t pack the Supreme Court to protect abortion rights. Biden talks about defeating Robert Bork and says we should codify Roe v Wade. Biden says if a Supreme Court Justice steps down before the next election, Mitch McConnell and the Republicans should not be allowed to hold hearings.

Buttigieg wants a 15-person Supreme Court to depoliticize the process. He says 5 members will be appointed only with the unanimous consent of 10 others.

Castro calls for term limits (or cycling off to the appellate courts) rather than packing the courts.

Warren takes the question back to abortion and says she lived in an America where abortion was illegal and rich women still got abortions. She says poor women were the ones who got hurt.

10: 09 PM: Booker, interjecting, says as the vegan, he can say that Trump is the unhealthiest person to ever run for president.

10:06 PM: Yang says Warren is 100% accurate in diagnosing the problem when asked about breaking up tech companies. Yang says breaking up tech companies, though, will not revive Main Street. He talks about the impact of screen use on children and he says breaking up tech companies does nothing to make kids healthier. Yang says using 20th century anti-trust solutions will not work.

Warren says companies can be the umpire or have a team, but you don’t get to do both. She accuses Amazon of collecting data on what sells well on their site and then going into business against them.

Beto wants tech companies to be treated as publishers, but he does not think presidents should target individual companies.

Harris asks Warren to join her in calling for Twitter to shut down Trump’s Twitter account. Warren dodges and says she wants to push Trump out of the White House.

Steyer now says Democrats need to talk about “prosperity” and the “private sector” to beat Trump before calling Trump a “fraud.” If traction gets any traction, will be interesting to see Democrats hit back at his private equity past.

Yang says data is more valuable than oil and Americans need to get their “tech check” via the freedom dividend, and that’s the best way to deal with the Big Tech problem.

9:52 PM: Burnett tries to pivot to health and Sanders says he’s feeling great. Booker says Sanders supports medical marijuana and Sanders replies: “I’m not on it tonight.”

Burnett asks Sanders how he will assure voters that he is up for the presidency. Sanders talks about an upcoming rally in Queens and says he will mount a “vigorous campaign” to prove to people that he is fit for the presidency.

He thanks everyone who sent good wishes from the bottom of his heart and says he is so glad to be back up on the debate stage.

Biden says he is running because of his “age and experience” because with it comes “wisdom.” He says now, more than ever, someone with that capacity is needed in the White House.

Warren, when asked about age, says she will outwork, out-organize, and outlast everyone–and “that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with.”

9:50 PM: On opioids, Steyer goes back to one of the central themes of his campaign–that corporations have bought the government.

Yang calls for decriminalizing opioids. He says there were more opioid prescriptions than people in Ohio and the crisis is one of “capitalism run amok.” He says the government must invest in treatment plans and people cannot be worried about going to jail cells if they come in for treatment. He says first responders in New Hampshire have told him they see the same people over and over again.

Beto also says he is for decriminalization of opioids while Harris calls pharmaceutical companies and executives “high-level dope dealers” and says some executives need to go to jail. “This is a matter of justice,” she says, adding that we should end mass incarceration and the War on Drugs and go after pharmaceutical executives.

Castro says drug company executives should go to jail and also need to be held accountable financially. He says Wall Street executives also must be held to account.

9:40 PM: Warren in favor of voluntary buyback programs and not mandatory buyback programs. She says the former got machine guns off the streets.

Castro asked about preventing deaths via handguns. Castro says he has problems with mandatory buyback programs because people don’t want cops coming to their homes… talks about police officers killing innocent people in their homes. He says “police violence is also gun violence, and we need to address that.”

9:30 PM: Beto asked about mandatory buybacks. He has disagreed with Mayor Pete on this.

Beto asked how he would endorse that when he doesn’t even know who has AR-15s. Beto calls them “weapons of war” that are “too dangerous to sell.” Beto says they are also “too dangerous to own” because every single one of them is a “potential instrument of terror.” He says just ask “any Hispanic in Texas” and accused Trump of inciting racists to target Hispanics in his community. Beto says if someone does not turn in their “weapons of war” and “brandishes” it in public, that weapon “will be taken from them.”

Buttigieg asked whether mandatory buybacks equal “confiscation.” He says Beto just made it clear that he does not know how to get weapons off the street. Mayor Pete says we can’t wait for Red Flag laws and universal background checks. He says we can’t wait for purity test and must “get something done.”

Mayor Pete says he doesn’t need lessons from Beto on courage–political or personal. He goes on to rip the NRA and their “enablers” in Congress. Beto hits Mayor Pete for calling his buyback plan a “shiny object.” He says “that was a slap in the face” to every survivor of gun violence.

9:22 PM: Castro rips Trump for caging kids at the border while letting ISIS prisoners go free. He says there is no reason for Kim Jong Un to trust anything Trump has to say re: nuclear agreement when he ripped up the Iran Deal and betrayed the Kurds.

Booker accuses Trump of partnering more with Putin than Merkel and Macron.

Biden says he has spent time alone with Putin and Erdogan. He says Trump is an “erratic” and “crazy” president who doesn’t “know a damn” about foreign policy. Biden says Erdogan knows how terrible it would if Turkey got booted from NATO. Biden says if Trump is elected, there will be no NATO.

Biden counters Gabbard’s “regime-change” war claim, saying it was to prevent Assad from “wiping out” thousands of people.

Beto says Russia is “invading” American democracy and then says “in addition” in Spanish out of the blue.

9:12 PM: Gabbard, appropriately asked about Syria.

She says Trump “has the blood of the Kurds on his hand.” She rips both parties and the mainstream media for “championing” the regime-change war that has led to the death of the Kurds. She rips CNN and the New York Times for smearing veterans like her for wanting to end the “regime-change war” in Syria. Says it is “despicable” that CNN had a pundit who implied she was a “Russia asset.”

Gabbard asks Warren to join her in calling for an end to the regime-change wars.

Warren says she doesn’t want troops in the Middle East but America must do it in the right way. She then accuses Trump of sucking up to dictators and enriching himself at the expense of America. She accuses Trump of giving ISIS a “new lease on life.”

Gabbard rips Buttigieg for wanting more regime-change wars in Syria. The two veterans differing. Buttigieg says when he was deployed, what protected him was that the American flag meant keeping our word and says Trump is undermining the “honor” of our soldiers. He says if you take away their honor, you might as well take away their armor.

Sanders says Turkey is no longer a U.S. ally when they invade another country and engage in mass slaughter. Sanders says 11,000 Kurds died and 20,000 were wounded fighting ISIS and now no country will trust the word of the United States. Sanders says Trump, the “pathological liar,” has wrecked the country’s ability to engage with other nations re: foreign policy issues.

KAMALA makes it clear – there are 4 winners because of what Donald Trump has done: 1) Russia

2) Iran

3) Assad

4) ISIS — Lily Adams (@adamslily) October 16, 2019

9:10 PM: Debate turns to foreign policy. Biden says he would not have withdrawn troops from Syria or Iraq. He says when Trump said the ISIS prisoners who are freed would go to Europe, it is the most shameful thing ever said by a modern president. Biden says he will make it clear to Syria’s Assad that “Turkey is the real problem here.” When asked if he wants American troops back in Syria, Biden says he wants the 1,000 troops protected by air cover and will make it clear that they are not going anywhere and will protect the Kurds.

9:05: Interesting observation:

No candidate has attacked Biden tonight, even though he remains the front-runner, at least technically. They see that his campaign is deflating. Warren is the real threat. — Robert Reich (@RBReich) October 16, 2019

9:00 PM: Castro wants an inheritance tax and to raise the top marginal rate. He talks about having visited homeless people living in storm drains in Vegas.

Booker wants Democrats to talk more about child poverty. He says the country must deal with the “moral obscenity” of its high child poverty rate.

8:55 PM: Harris now being asked about her tax credit. She tells a story about her mom at the kitchen table “trying to figure out how to make it all work.” Harris again repeats lines from her stump speech about how “justice is on the ballot.”

Burnett asks Yang about the wealth tax. He says it makes a lot of sense in principle but countries have repealed it because it had massive implementation problems. Yang calls for a value-added tax (VAT). Again, credit to Burnett for bringing in Yang into the discussion.

Beto says Democrats need to be more focused on lifting people on… he says Warren is more focused on “being punitive” and pitting some part of the country against the other.

Warren says she doesn’t “have a beef” with billionaires. She says billionaires made it because “all of us” helped them get there. She again calls for them to “pitch in” two cents so every other kids gets a chance.

(Bernie’s national press secretary, though, does have a “beef” with billionaires):

8:50 PM: Buttigieg, on Warren’s wealth tax, says it sounds good but could be an example of yet another Washington policy that sounds great but will accomplish nothing. Warren keeps defending her wealth tax, says it is needed for investments in the next generation. Yang has been making the case that it will be so easy for people to game the wealth tax, perhaps even renouncing citizenship, to avoid paying it but he has yet to jump in to make that point.

8:45 PM: Beto says if Mexicans should join unions if their companies do business with America.

Biden wants to double the capital gains tax and says the problem with these debates is that everyone wants to cram everything in in a short amount of time. Biden says the greedy corporations and the Fourth Industrial revolution creating job losses.

8:35 PM: Warren says the top reason Americans have lost jobs is bad trade policies and corporations with no loyalty to America workers, consumers, and communities.

8:30 PM: Debate now turns to jobs and automation. And Erin Burnett goes to Sanders first and asks him about his jobs guarantee program. Sanders says “damn right” everyone will get a job. Yang and Sanders have disagreed on this issue. Yang says his freedom dividend is more practical than Sanders’s jobs program.

Yang points out that not everyone wants to work for the federal government and many people who lose their jobs to automation cannot be “retrained” for various federal jobs. He says $1,000/month is better for the “trickle up economy.”

YANG, on jobs: 'Most Americans do not want to work for the federal government… If we put the money into our hands, we can build a trickle-up economy.' #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/3PO4RBpMt8 — NowThis (@nowthisnews) October 16, 2019

Booker jumps in to rip CNN for asking Biden about Hunter and says Trump was happy with that exchange. Says CNN elevated a lie and attacked a statesman.

Yang talks about the impact that automation will have on various communities that rely on truck drivers (diners). Gabbard is against a federal jobs guarantee and agrees with her friend Yang about UBI.

An important segment about automation and the new economy in a state that will be impacted by it would not have been possible had it not been for Yang’s candidacy. Credit to Erin Burnett for outstanding questioning and going to Yang right after Sanders and getting them to talk about their difference. Great segment for Burnett.

8:20 PM: Warren asked a “yes or no” answer about whether she will raise taxes for Medicare for all. Another dodge. She says costs will go up for the wealthy and down for those who are not. She rips insurance companies for “pulling the rug” from under people.

Buttigieg points out Warren is being evasive and says she is why why people are frustrated with Washington. Buttigieg says Warren supposedly has a plan for everything except for health care. He touts his “Medicare for all who want it” idea.

Warren says when someone hears “Medicare for all who want it,” it means “Medicare for all who can afford it.”

Sanders says his Medicare for All plan that Warren endorsed will be better than Canada’s but taxes will go up and will go up “significantly for the wealthy.” Warren keeps dodging the question and Klobuchar calls her out for not being honest and promoting a “pipe dream.”

Warren pivots to saying she spent most of her time not in Washington but studying how people went bankrupt–most due to healthcare bills even though they had insurance. Warren keeps dodging.

Biden talks again about building on Obamacare. Biden says Democrats must be straight with Americans on the single most important issue.

Sanders says the debate should be about whether Democrats have the “guts” to stand up to the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. Sanders says we must stop defending the “cruel” and “unjust” system.

Harris says Democrats should be talking more about abortion and says women, especially women of color, will die because of Republican legislatures in the states.

Kamala Harris: ""It's not an exaggeration to say women will die — poor women, women of color will die — because these Republican legislatures in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with their bodies"" #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/rtyjHfQnBT — CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 16, 2019

8:16 PM: Cooper asks Biden about his son Hunter. He asks if it is not okay for a president’s son to be involved in foreign businesses, why is it okay for a vice president’s son. Biden says neither he nor his son did “nothing wrong.” “My son’s statement speaks for itself,” Biden says, basically cuing up a potential attack ad. Biden says Trump is afraid of him because if he wins the nomination he will “beat him like a drum.” Biden says he and his son kept everything separate. Says Hunter made a judgment and he is “prod” of the judgment he made. Biden then pivots back to Trump’s “corruption.”

Sanders says Democrats must also focus on the “pain of the working class of this country.”

8:06 PM: Biden, who finally came around on impeachment, says Democrats have been fair and he agrees with Sanders that Trump is the most corrupt president in history.

Harris says Trump has committed crimes in “plain sight.” Cites Maya Angelou. She also accuses Trump of “selling out” working people, national security, and democracy. Harris, reciting her greatest Twitter hits, says as a prosecutor she knows a confession when she sees it and says the impeachment process won’t take long. She says Trump is the most corrupt and unpatriotic president.

Booker says impeachment has to be about “patriotism” and not “partisanship.” He says Democrats have to conduct this process in a way that is “honorable” and “doesn’t rip us apart.” Says Trump has violated his duty.

Now, for some reason, Cooper goes to Klobuchar, who is barely registering in the polls. She accuses Trump of “illegal conduct” for “digging up dirt” on an opponent. She says Trump has left the Kurds “for slaughter.” She says Trump has made “Russia great again.”

Castro says Democrats can “walk and chew gum at the same time” when asked if impeachment is a distraction. He says Trump is violating his oath of office and abusing his power.

Buttigieg says Trump has left Congress “no choice” but to launch an impeachment inquiry. He says the impeachment inquiry is about whether, when people look back 100 years from now, a president was above the law and could get away with anything. He presents himself as the bipartisan candidate.

Gabbard says impeachment will divide the country if driven by “hyper-partisan interests.”

Steyer says every candidate on stage is more decent and patriotic than “the criminal in the White House.” He talks about starting his Need to Impeach movement two years ago.

Yang supports impeachment (implies Senate will not convict) but says impeachment will not solve the issues that got Donald Trump elected. Pivots to the central theme of his campaign about Fourth Industrial Revolution. Yang says Democrats “are losing” when they are talking about Trump.

Beto says he thinks about everyone who has ever served in uniform and says we have a responsibility to be “fearless in the face of this president’s criminality and lawlessness.”

8:05 PM: Sanders says Democrats have “no choice” but to impeach Trump because Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of the country. He thinks the House will find him worthy of impeachment because of the Emoluments Clause. He says Trump is using the Oval Office to enrich himself. Sanders says Mitch McConnell must do the right thing and allow free and fair trial in the Senate.

8:00 PM: Debate begins. First question (for Warren) is about impeachment. Warren says the impeachment inquiry is necessary during an election year because some things are bigger than politics. She cites the Mueller report (obstruction of justice) and says “look what happened as a result” of not opening an impeachment inquiry after the Mueller report was released. Warren says this is also about the next president and the next president…

7:55 PM: Cooper introducing the candidates as the debate is about to get started.

7:36 PM: DNC Chair Tom Perez thinks Democrats can take back Ohio in 2020. Democrats want Ohio to be the state that ends Trump’s presidency. Perez rips Trump and says the election is not about “left versus right” but about “right versus wrong.”

7:35 PM: Watch what Ohio residents think of Democrats–Video from Breitbart’s Matt perdie and Zenny phuong in Ohio:

7:30 PM: CNN hyping the number of candidates (12) on stage as if it is a good thing.

Is the word out that Dems are not allowed to talk about Hunter Biden at the debate? If he did nothing wrong taking those jobs, why’d he promise not to do it again? Why’d he say he discussed it with his father when his father says they didn’t? Many questions. Will Dems ask? — Tim Murtaugh (@TimMurtaugh) October 15, 2019

One-hundred and twenty-three House Republicans have backed a movement to condemn Chairman Schiff by cosponsoring House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs’ (R-AZ) H. Res. 604, according to a list obtained by Breitbart News. H. Res. 604 would condemn Schiff for retelling a fictional phone call between Zelensky and Trump.

Schiff also allegedly lied about having never spoken to the Ukrainian intelligence officer “whistleblower.”

Biggs’ legislation has quickly gained support from House Republicans across the political spectrum. House Freedom Caucus conservatives, moderates, and House Republican leadership have all backed the move to censure Schiff.

Since Biggs introduced the legislation in late September, the bill quickly gained 18 cosponsors. Now, the bill features support from nearly two-thirds of the House GOP caucus.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA), and House Republican Conference chairwoman Liz Cheney (R-WY) have sponsored the resolution to condemn Schiff.

Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday night during the fourth Democrat primary debate.

Warren was attacked sixteen times during the debate, according to an NBC tracker, primarily on her proposals for universal health care and her proposed extreme wealth tax.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar attacked Warren five different times, while former Vice President Joe Biden and Mayor Pete Buttigieg attacked her on three different occasions.

Kamala Harris and Beto O’Rourke attacked Warren on two occasions each, and Andrew Yang attacked her one time.

Klobuchar defended her attacks, saying that she wanted to be president of all of America, not just half of America.

“If people are tired of the noise and nonsense and the extremes, they’ve got a home with me,” she said afterward to CNN.

Klobuchar said that Warren’s Medicare-for-all was a “pipe dream” and she did “not even come close” to answering the question about how she planned to pay for her plan.

“As I’ve said, Bernie [Sanders] has answered that question, he’s made that very clear, and I think that’s one of the things she needs to do,” she said afterward.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who signaled his criticism of Warren’s plan in a campaign ad earlier Tuesday, immediately challenged Warren on her healthcare plan.

Sen. Kamala Harris challenged Warren for failing to join her call to ban President Donald Trump from Twitter. Biden repeated that Warren was being “vague” on the cost of her healthcare plan.

The attacks on Warren spoke volumes to the pundits, who described her as the clear frontrunner for the Democrat primary.

However, despite the Democrats’ claim, an overwhelming majority of Americans received a tax cut through the Trump Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Eighty-two percent of American middle-class households received a tax cut and received an average tax cut of $1,260. In Ohio, where CNN is hosting the debate, the average Ohioan received $1,476. Ninety percent of Americans saw an increase in take-home pay. The tax cuts3.3% raise wage growth by 3.3 percent and helped foster historic lows in unemployment.

The Trump tax cuts also doubled the child tax credit and expanded its eligibility, which greatly helps the American working-class family.

Further, the Trump Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also repealed the Obamacare individual mandate, which serves as a giant middle-class tax cut. Eighty percent of those who paid the Obamacare individual mandate fine made less than $50,000, making the mandate’s repeal a significant tax cut."

The poll, taken September 29-October 7, 2019 among 998 registered voters in North Carolina, shows the president besting all of his potential rivals in the crucial battleground state.

Respondents were asked, “If the election for president was held today, would you vote for Republican Donald Trump, Democrat Joe Biden, or someone else?” The survey asked the same question for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D).

While Biden fared the best in a hypothetical general election matchup in the Republican-leaning swing state, Trump still led the former vice president with 38.4 percent to Biden’s 34.6 percent.

The others are as follows:

Trump: 39.1 percent

Warren: 33 percent Trump: 38.8 percent

Sanders: 32.5 percent Trump 39.1 percent

Harris 28.4 percent Trump: 39 percent

Buttigieg: 27 percent

One of the most significant narratives moving into the 2020 election is the state of the economy, which Trump has touted as one of his greatest accomplishments. Of those surveyed, 13.7 percent described the condition of the economy as “excellent,” 28.7 percent described it as “good,” and 33.1 percent described it as “fair.” Only 13.3 percent described the condition of the economy as “poor.”

Trump won North Carolina in 2016 with 49.8 percent of the vote to Hillary Clinton’s 46.2 percent. While Republicans hold an edge in the state, former President Barack Obama flipped the state blue in 2008, beating late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) by less than half of a percentage point."

While he was vice president, Biden failed to stop his son Hunter Biden from cashing in on lucrative foreign business deals with Ukraine and China even as he was leading the Obama administration’s diplomatic efforts with the two countries.

President Donald Trump made it a focal point of his campaign, using Hunter Biden’s name in back-to-back rallies last week, ultimately forcing Hunter Biden to step down from his role in an investment company backed by China on Sunday.

Hunter Biden’s lawyers, however, were unclear whether he would keep his stake in the company — estimated at an investment worth millions.

But 2020 candidates are hesitant to swing at Biden, and some even appear defensive of the vice president on the issue of corruption.

The Biden campaign also fired a warning to his campaign rallies.

An aide to Biden told Bloomberg News any candidate who “calls themselves a ‘Democrat'” and repeats what the aide said were “discredited lies” about Biden and his son “would be making a profound statement about themselves.”

Sen. Warren at first stumbled by suggesting she did not approve of the idea of a vice president allowing to serve on the board of a foreign company.

“No. … I don’t know. I mean, I’d have to go back and look at the details,” she replied.

Since then, Warren dodged media attempts to answer questions about Biden and his son, pivoting back to accuse Trump of trying to dodge his own misconduct in Ukraine.

Sen. Bernie Sanders has also dodged the question, demanding “evidence” of any impropriety by the Bidens.

“I know I’m a little bit old-fashioned. I like to see the evidence before I talk about things. I read the papers and I read what I read,” Sanders said last week. “But I don’t know that I know enough at this point to make any definitive statement.”

Sen. Kamala Harris has also defended Biden, pointing instead at Trump.

“Mr. President, telling lies about Joe Biden won’t protect you from the truth. Joe has more patriotism in his pinky finger than you’ll ever have,” Harris wrote on Twitter.

Harris scored an early hit on Biden by questioning his history of opposing public bussing in public schools, even earning a bump in the polls, but the early momentum soon faded.

Attacking Biden has not worked well for other candidates as well. Former Housing Secretary Julian Castro swung at Biden, questioning memory loss in the last debate, but missed, earning scorn from pundits and Democrat voters.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand tried to score points against Biden on women’s issues, but her attack came off as self-serving, leading her to ultimately drop out of the race.

Other low-polling candidates who tried to score points against Joe Biden, such as New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio and Rep. Eric Swalwell, soon dropped out of the race after their attacks failed to resonate with primary voters.

Castro did not appear interested in hitting the Bidens again, responding to questions about Hunter Biden by criticizing Trump.

“Donald Trump is trying to use the same playbook against Joe Biden as he used against Hillary Clinton,” he said.

Mayor Pete Buttigeig began the week by vocally defending Biden on CNN, earning praise from the former Vice President.

“I’m a friend of Pete Buttigieg,” Biden told the United Food and Commercial Workers 2020 presidential forum on Sunday. “By the way, he’s a really decent guy. I turned on the television this morning and he was defending me and my family against these outrageous, lying ads of the president of the United States of America. That’s a good man.”

Sen. Cory Booker, who at times cannot resist taking gratuitous shots at Biden, has also stood up for the president.

“This is unacceptable, that if you come after Joe Biden, you’re going to have to deal with me in this case, these are baseless, unfounded, scurrilous lies,” he said in October.

But in September, Booker also questioned Hunter Biden’s actions when Trump’s attacks took form.

“I just don’t think children of vice presidents, presidents during the administration should be out there doing that,” he said.

Other candidates have promised not to allow similar behavior if they were elected president.

“I would not allow a family member, anyone in my cabinet to have a family member, to work in a position like that,” Rep. Beto O’Rourke said

Sen. Amy Klobachar promised the same.

“I can promise you right now, my own daughter, who’s only 24, does not sit on the board of a foreign company,” she said on CNN.

Andrew Yang said Hunter Biden’s role in foreign companies “certainly has a bad look to it.”

“In my mind they can wait until the term is over before serving that term,” he said. “And that’s really the way it would be under my administration.”

Tulsi Gabbard remains the wildcard.

After a devastating series of attacks against Sen. Kamala Harris in the August debate, Gabbard demonstrated she knew how to criticize the substance of her opponent’s record, without sounding gratuitous.

When asked to weigh in on the Biden’s she said that allowing a vice president’s son to sit on a corporate board “would be a poor decision to make.”

“I don’t know what went into that or how he got hired or why or what influence there was used, if any, but I think the perception is certainly a concern,” she said."

TechCrunch reports that Twitter has stated recently that it will restrict how users can interact with tweets from world leaders who break the site’s rules. The site will not allow users to like, reply, share, or retweet any offending tweets from world leaders but will allow them to “quote-tweet” in order to express their opinion about the tweet.

Twitter stated that this decision was made in an effort to help users stay informed about current events while balancing the need to enforce rules on the website. The company stated in a blog post:

Twitter generally removes Tweets that violate our rules. However, we recognize that sometimes it may be in the public interest to allow people to view Tweets that would otherwise be taken down. We consider content to be in the public interest if it directly contributes to understanding or discussion of a matter of public concern. At present, we limit exceptions to one critical type of public-interest content—Tweets from elected and government officials—given the significant public interest in knowing and being able to discuss their actions and statements. As a result, in rare instances, we may choose to leave up a Tweet from an elected or government official that would otherwise be taken down. Instead we will place it behind a notice providing context about the rule violation that allows people to click through to see the Tweet. Placing a Tweet behind this notice also limits the ability to engage with the Tweet through likes, Retweets, or sharing on Twitter, and makes sure the Tweet isn’t algorithmically recommended by Twitter. These actions are meant to limit the Tweet’s reach while maintaining the public’s ability to view and discuss it. Learn more about this notice and other enforcement actions.

The company summarized its decision in a tweet which can be seen below:

We haven’t used this notice yet, but when we do, you will not be able to like, reply, share, or Retweet the Tweet in question. You will still be able to express your opinion with Retweet with Comment. — Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) October 15, 2019

The company added in a tweet: “Our goal is to enforce our rules judiciously and impartially. In doing so, we aim to provide direct insight into our enforcement decision-making, to serve public conversation, and protect the public’s right to hear from their leaders and to hold them to account.”

Twitter has previously refused to ban the president stating that doing so would not silence him but would instead hamper discussion around his words and actions:

There’s been a lot of discussion about political figures and world leaders on Twitter, and we want to share our stance. Twitter is here to serve and help advance the global, public conversation. Elected world leaders play a critical role in that conversation because of their outsized impact on our society. Blocking a world leader from Twitter or removing their controversial Tweets, would hide important information people should be able to see and debate. It would also not silence that leader, but it would certainly hamper necessary discussion around their words and actions. We review Tweets by leaders within the political context that defines them, and enforce our rules accordingly. No one person’s account drives Twitter’s growth, or influences these decisions. We work hard to remain unbiased with the public interest in mind. We are working to make Twitter the best place to see and freely discuss everything that matters. We believe that’s the best way to help our society make progress.

The segment began when CNN host Anderson Cooper asked Biden about an interview that Hunter Biden gave to ABC on Tuesday where he admitted he “made a mistake and showed poor judgment” by accepting a position on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.

“My son did nothing wrong,” Biden declared. “I did nothing wrong.”

He explained:

“Look, the fact that George Washington on the first time he spoke after being elected, that we had to worry about is foreign interference in our elections, it was the greatest threat to America. This president on three occasions, three occasions, has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections. The fact is that it is outrageous. Rudy Giuliani, the president and his thugs have already proven that they, in fact, are flat lying. What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. He doesn’t want me to be the candidate. He is going after me because he knows if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum.”

In his attempt to recap Biden’s meandering answer, Noah said that he understood what Biden meant but that it “took a while for him to get there.”

“OK, one minute he’s talking about his son, then George Washington, then something about the seventeenth?” the Comedy Central host remarked. “Joe Biden is the only candidate who remixes his speech while he’s giving it.”

After mocking the number of candidates on the debate stage, Noah also described the “weirdest part of the night” as when Kamala Harris (D-CA) “started a real-life Twitter beef” with Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) over Twitter’s refusal to ban Trump from its platform.

“I’ll be honest, I kind of understand Warren’s point here,” he explained. “We need Trump on Twitter. It’s the only way we can monitor what he’s up to. Otherwise, he’s doing that shit in secret. You’ve got to think of Twitter as a presidential baby monitor. The whole time you’re looking, you’re like, ‘Hold on, he’s awake and wants to nuke a hurricane, I gotta go!’”

Warren came in fourth place, right behind Buttigieg, with seven percent support, despite having more speaking time (roughly 23 minutes) than any other candidate:

Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) spoke for a total of less than 13 minutes each.

In past Democratic debates, candidates Andrew Yang and Marianne Williamson claimed that their mics appeared to be turned off when they tried to jump into the live discussion.

As much fun as I've had laughing at all the understandable hilarious tweets about me today, the mic issue is not funny and yes it did happen. I tried a couple of times to jump in and my mic was not on. Particularly wanted in on the subject of race. — Marianne Williamson (@marwilliamson) June 29, 2019

Second, I feel bad for those who tuned in to see and support me that I didn’t get more airtime. Will do better (my mic being off unless called on didn’t help) and glad to have another opportunity in July (and afterwards)! — Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) June 28, 2019

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) threatened to boycott Tuesday’s debate, saying on Twitter that she is trying to bring attention to the “DNC/corporate media’s effort to rig [the] 2020 primary.”

Gabbard ended up participating in Tuesday’s televised event, but CNN only gave her a little more than eight minutes of air time, just ahead of entrepreneur Tom Steyer, who spoke for a total of seven minutes.

Yang clocked in a total of over nine minutes of speaking time on Tuesday.

When CNN hosted the first Democrat debate in July — which was divided into two nights — Biden emerged with the most speaking time at 21 minutes, followed by Warren with 18 minutes.

“As usual Senator Warren is 100% wrong in diagnosing the problem, there absolutely [are] excesses in technology and in some cases having them divest parts of their business is the right move,” conceded Yang.

“But we also have to be realistic that competition doesn’t solve all the problems.”

“It’s not like any of us want to use the fourth-best navigation app… There’s a reason why nobody is using Bing today. Sorry Microsoft, it’s true!”

“It’s not like breaking up these tech companies will revive mainstream businesses around the country.”

“And as the parent of two young children, I’m particularly concerned about screen use and its effect on our children. Studies clearly show that we’re seeing record levels of anxiety and depression coincident with smartphone adoption and social media use.”

“Breaking up the tech companies does nothing to make our kids healthier. What we have to do is we have to hone in on the specific problems we’re trying to solve and use 21st-century solutions for 21st-century problems. Using a 20th-century antitrust framework will not work. We need new solutions and a new toolkit.”

Elizabeth Warren responded to Yang’s remarks, stating “I’m not willing to give up and let a handful of monopolists dominate our economy and our democracy. It’s time to fight back.”

She went on to slam Amazon for its domination of America’s retail market, and the way it crowds out competition from small businesses.

“Think about it this way — when you talk about it this way when you talk about how it works, and competition. About eight percent [to] nine percent of retail sales in bricks and sticks stores happen at Walmart. About 49 percent of all sales online happen in one place — that’s Amazon. It collects information from every little business. And then Amazon does something else — it runs the platform, gets all the information, and then goes into competition with those little businesses.”

“You get to be the umpire in the baseball or you get to be a team, but you don’t get to do both at the same time. We need to enforce our antitrust laws, break up these giant companies that are dominating big tech, big pharma, big oil — all of them.”

Whereas Tulsi Gabbard has been consistent on the question of censorship, criticizing big tech companies for “throwing free speech out the window,” Warren has flip-flopped on the issue. She condemned Facebook for its power to “shut down debate” after it removed an ad for her campaign in March this year, but a few months later called for tech companies to censor criticism of Kamala Harris.

Some 2020 Democrats have embraced the move to automatically specify preferred pronouns. During CNN’s Equality Town Hall this month, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) walked onto the stage and announced her preferred pronouns as “she, her, and hers.”

CNN’s Chris Cuomo issued an awkward response, which ultimately triggered backlash.

“‘She,’ ‘her,’ and ‘hers’? Mine, too,” he said, later apologizing for the remark:

PLEASE READ: When Sen. Harris said her pronouns were she her and her's, I said mine too. I should not have. I apologize. I am an ally of the LGBTQ community, and I am sorry because I am committed to helping us achieve equality. Thank you for watching our townhall. — Christopher C. Cuomo (@ChrisCuomo) October 11, 2019

Like Harris, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has publicly specified her preferred pronouns, listing “She/her” on her Twitter bio:

Preferred pronouns have become a topic of interest among far-left millennials and social justice warriors, particularly. Those who identify as part of the ultra-progressive group argue that gender is a social construct and should be viewed as a spectrum, hence the varying genders and accompanying pronouns. Preferred pronouns can range from the traditional “his” or “hers” to lesser-known terms such as “xem,” “hirself,” “xyrs,” or “zir.”"

Despite being the leading issue among all American voters, according to Harvard/Harris polling, CNN anchors and a New York Times reporter ignored the immigration issue that motivated millions of voters in the 2016 presidential election.

Instead, debate moderators focused largely on impeachment, gun control, health care, and abortion.

Various 2020 Democrats have vowed to implement the most open borders agenda in the history of the country with candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) promising to decriminalize illegal immigration and the majority endorsing a plan to force American taxpayers to provide free health care to all illegal aliens.

The lack of questions on immigration to 2020 Democrats comes as swing voters are increasingly turned off by the candidates’ plans to bring millions of more foreign workers to the U.S.

The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds that the 2020 Democrats’ health care for illegal aliens plan is the most unpopular policy position thus far in the race for president, with opposition from 62 percent of all likely voters.

Polling from Harvard/Harris reveals among all U.S. voters, and particularly with swing voters, that presidential candidates campaigning for immigration, illegal and legal, is the most unpopular policy position.

CNN and the New York Times opened the debate with a discussion on the partisan-based impeachment inquiry.

“Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support,” Anderson Cooper, one of the debate’s moderators, said.

“Sen. Warren, I want to start with you,” Cooper continued.

“You have said that there’s already enough evidence for President Trump to be impeached and removed from office. But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate?” he asked.

The Massachusetts senator said impeachment is necessary because the president broke the law “over and over.” She said she initially made the determination after reading the Mueller report and falsely claimed that Mueller had shown “that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly,” despite the fact that Mueller made no such determination.

Attorney General William Barr determined that Trump did not obstruct justice, explaining that the evidence was “not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense.”

“Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences,” Warren said, adding that impeachment is about Trump as well as “the next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country.”

“The impeachment must go forward,” she proclaimed.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) concurred, repeating the false claim that Trump obstructed justice and calling him the “most corrupt president in the history of this country.”

“I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment because of the emoluments clause. This is a president who is enriching himself while using the Oval Office to do that, and that is outrageous,” he said, adding that he looks forward to a “speedy and expeditious impeachment process.”

“Mitch McConnell has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate,” he added.

While there are varying degrees of support, all of Warren and Sanders’ colleagues signaled support for the Democrat-led impeachment efforts.

Here are their most significant lines on impeachment:

Joe Biden (D):

I said from the beginning that if, in fact, Trump continued to stonewall what the Congress is entitled to know about his background, what he did, all the accusations in the Mueller report, if they did that, they would have no choice — no choice — but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information. This president — and I agree with Bernie, Sen. Sanders — is the most corrupt president in modern history and I think all of our history. And the fact is that this president of the United States has gone so far as to say, since this latest event, that, in fact, he will not cooperate in any way at all, will not list any witnesses, will not provide any information, will not do anything to cooperate with the impeachment. They have no choice but to move.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA):

But the reality of it is that I don’t really think this impeachment process is going to take very long, because as a former prosecutor, I know a confession when I see it. And he did it in plain sight. He has given us the evidence. And he tried to cover it up, putting it in that special server. And there’s been a clear consciousness of guilt. This will not take very long. Donald Trump needs to be held accountable. He is, indeed, the most corrupt and unpatriotic president we have ever had.

Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ):

Anybody who has criticisms about a process that is making all the facts bare before the American public, that works to build consensus, that’s what this nation needs, in what is a moral moment and not a political one. So I swore an oath to do my job as a senator, do my duty. This president has violated his. I will do mine.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN):

We can do two things at once. That’s our job. We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment, but we also can stand up for America, because this president has not been putting America in front of his own personal interests.

Julián Castro (D):

Not only that, what we have to recognize is that not only did the Mueller report point out ten different instances where the president obstructed justice or tried to, and he made that call to President Zelensky of the Ukraine, but he is in ongoingly — in an ongoing way violating his oath of office and abusing his power. We have to impeach this president. And the majority of Americans not only support impeachment, they support removal. He should be removed.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D):

Look, the president has left the Congress with no choice. And this is not just about holding the president accountable, for not just the things emerging in these investigations, but actions that he has confessed to on television. It’s also about the presidency itself, because a president ten years or 100 years from now will look back at this moment and draw the conclusion either that no one is above the law or that a president can get away with anything.

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI):

The serious issues that have been raised around this phone call that he had with the president of Ukraine and many other things that transpired around that are what caused me to support the inquiry in the House. And I think that it should continue to play its course out, to gather all the information, provide that to the American people, recognizing that that is the only way forward. If the House votes to impeach, the Senate does not vote to remove Donald Trump, he walks out and he feels exonerated, further deepening the divides in this country that we cannot afford.

Tom Steyer (D):

Two years ago, I started the Need to Impeach movement, because I knew there was something desperately wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, that we did have the most corrupt president in the country, and that only the voice and the will of the American people would drag Washington to see it as a matter of right and wrong, not of political expediency. So, in fact, impeaching and removing this president is something that the American people are demanding. They’re the voice that counts, and that’s who I went to, the American people.

Andrew Yang (D):

I support impeachment, but we shouldn’t have any illusions that impeaching Donald Trump will, one, be successful or, two, erase the problems that got him elected in 2016.

Beto O’Rourke (D):

And we have a responsibility to be fearless in the face of this president’s criminality and his lawlessness. The fact that as a candidate for the highest office in the land, he invited the participation, the invasion of a foreign power in our democracy. As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the FBI, tried to fire Mueller, head of the investigation, then invited President Zelensky to involve himself in our politics, as well as China, in exchange for favorable trade terms in an upcoming trade deal.

Trump reacted to the Democrat debate on Wednesday, writing, “You would think there is NO WAY that any of the Democrat Candidates that we witnessed last night could possibly become President of the United States.”

“Now you see why they have no choice but to push a totally illegal & absurd Impeachment of one of the most successful Presidents!” he exclaimed:

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced on Tuesday that the House will hold off on a House-wide vote on the impeachment inquiry.

“There’s no requirement that we have a vote, and at this time, we will not have a vote,” Pelosi said at a press conference on Tuesday.

“We’re not here to call bluffs. We’re here to find the truth, to uphold the Constitution of the United States,” she added. “This is not a game for us, this is deadly serious.”"

The poll – taken October 11-13, 2019, among 1,993 registered voters, 860 of which are likely Democrat primary voters – found that 31 percent of voters expect the most from the Massachusetts senator during the fourth Democrat debate and predict that she will perform the best. The same poll – taken in September – only had 19 percent expecting Warren to perform the best.

Biden came in second, with 25 percent of voters expecting the former vice president to have the best debate performance. Both Warren and Biden topped Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) by double digits. Only 12 percent of respondents expect him to dominate in terms of debate performance. The margin of error for the full survey is +/- 2 percent.

While enthusiasm for the debate remains relatively high, with 72 percent indicating that they are “motivated” to watch Tuesday evening’s debate, that is seven percent down from the September debate.

Tuesday’s debate at Otterbein University will feature 12 candidates on the debate stage, making it the “largest televised presidential primary debate ever, regardless of party,” Politico notes. Over half – 63 percent – of respondents believe there are too many people on the debate stage.

Warren’s high expectations follow weeks of a slow, steady surge in both national and early state polls. A YouGovUS/CBSNews poll released over the weekend showed Warren dominating in early states, with 31 percent support to Biden’s 25 percent and Sanders’ 17 percent.

The rap stars said in a podcast conversation with Tip “T.I.” Harris Tuesday that President Trump generates a level of enthusiasm among his supporters that none of the Democratic candidates can match. The three rap stars were talking to promote their new Netflix reality competition series Rhythm + Flow.

“You all can quote me on this a couple of years down the line,” Chance the Rapper said. “I think Trump is going to win again at the next election because he’s got the biggest base.”

“He does. I believe it,” said Cardi B, citing the passion levels of Trump supporters.

“I really hate to say it, but sometimes I do believe that Trump will be winning,” she said. “Just because due to the fact that every single time I don’t see nobody saying they love a Democratic candidate. There’s no candidate that people are saying like we love, we want them to win.”

Cardi B said Trump supporters are motivated by racism against Mexicans.

“Every single time he always talk about how he want to take away Medicare and shit like that. A poor white man that’s getting Medicare is not even caring that he’s saying that, he just cares that he hates Mexicans and he want to get rid of them,” she said.

“A lot of people vote with feelings in America and a lot of their feelings is racism and religion.”

Cardi B is a vocal supporter of Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders and has appeared with the candidate at public events.

Chance the Rapper said the two-party system is responsible for President Trump’s ruse to power.

“There’s two parties that pick who they want to run for office, and then there’s a bunch of lobbying and money that gets thrown around, and eventually they come out and say, ‘This is who our leader is,'” he said.

Little clarity could be found on the subject during Tuesday night’s Democrat presidential debate , during which the candidates energetically criticized President Donald Trump, but grew vague and evasive when asked to describe the situation in Syria or explain how they would handle it.

Former Vice President Joe Biden boasted about how much time he spent in the White House on foreign policy and Syria for a while, then seemingly threatened to declare war on Turkey, something neither he nor any other Democrat would actually do if they became president:

I would not have withdrawn the troops and I would not have withdrawn the additional thousand troops who are in Iraq, which are in retreat now, being fired on by Assad’s people. And the president of the United States saying, if those ISIS folks escape from the prisons they’re in, they’ll only go to Europe and won’t affect us. It has been the most shameful thing that any president has done in modern history — excuse me, in terms of foreign policy. And the fact of the matter is, I’ve never seen a time — and I’ve spent thousands of hours in the Situation Room, I’ve spent many hours on the ground in those very places, in Syria and in Iraq, and guess what? Our commanders across the board, former and present, are ashamed of what’s happening here. What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where he’s going to have a problem — because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real lockdown conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done now. Pay that price.

Note that there is no evidence of the Syrian army firing at American troops, but Biden might have been confusing Syrian with Turkish forces, which have reportedly fired uncomfortably close to American positions in Iraq.

A real journalist would have pointed out to Biden that some of the Syrian groups his administration told us were reliable “white hat” military allies have joined the Turks to attack the Kurds and asked how he failed to discern the true nature of those groups during the “thousands of hours” he boasted of spending in the White House Situation Room, but fortunately for Biden, CNN does not employ anyone who would ask a question like that of a Democrat.

The only candidate who did not try to stuff herself into a war hawk costume at the debate was Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), who got to speak next, and challenged both Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Mayor Pete Buttigieg on their positions.

Gabbard has her own issues when it comes to Syria — which she attempted to deal with by denying that she has been a “Russian asset” or “Assad apologist” — and she professed to have qualms about President Trump’s sudden pullout from the Turkish border region, but she described the Turkish attack on the Kurds as “yet another negative consequence of the regime change war we’ve been waging in Syria,” a war the media was “championing and cheerleading” throughout the Obama administration.

Gabbard said she would take two steps on Syria: ending sanctions against the Assad regime “that are really a modern-day siege, the likes of which we are seeing Saudi Arabia wage against Yemen, that have caused tens of thousands of Syrian civilians to die and to starve,” and ending U.S. support for Syrian rebel forces, some of which are linked to terrorist groups like al-Qaeda. Neither of those steps would ameliorate Turkey’s concerns in any way or persuade it to halt its invasion of Syria.

Gabbard taunted Warren about living up to the anti-war stance she took so ostentatiously during the second Bush administration. Warren, boxed into a corner, had nothing meaningful to say beyond vague platitudes about getting out of the Middle East “the smart way” and complaints about Trump helping ISIS “get another foothold, a new lease on life.”

“I sit on the Armed Services Committee. I talk with our military leaders about this. I was in Iraq and went through the neighborhoods that ISIS destroyed. We need to get out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no military solution in this region,” Warren said.

Turkey certainly seems to think there is a “military solution” to its security concerns, having worked for years to obtain a “negotiated solution” without satisfactory results. Russia and Iran somehow found a “military solution” to the Syrian civil war.

CNN moved very quickly along to Buttigieg, who was allowed to simultaneously claim he opposes “endless wars” but also call for an endless American presence in the worst quagmire on the planet.

Buttigieg, a military veteran, abandoned years of Democrat Party dogma about Afghanistan being the “good war” to argue that Syria is the only place American troops should be stationed.

“Look, I didn’t think we should have gone to Iraq in the first place. I think we need to get out of Afghanistan. But it’s also the case that a small number of specialized, special operations forces and intelligence capabilities were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and what we’re seeing now, which is the beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS,” he said.

Buttigieg claimed pulling out of Syria would be “taking away what makes America America” and would make “the world a more dangerous place,” which oddly enough is exactly the opposite of what Democrats said when they urged a pullout from Iraq. They used to get very angry at people who implied their criticism of the Iraq deployment would be “taking away what makes America America.” They routinely portrayed American soldiers in Iraq as helpless victims of the insurgency whose lives were being squandered.

Gabbard jumped in and called Buttigieg out on his claim to oppose endless wars while “continuing to support having U.S. troops in Syria for an indefinite period of time to continue this regime change war,” a policy that involves “providing arms in support to terrorist groups in Syria, like al-Qaeda, HTS, al-Nusra and others.”

Buttigieg never answered her question. Instead, he claimed he would not be able to look Afghan civilians or soldiers in the eye after Trump’s pullout from Syria, which is funny because not three minutes earlier he said he wanted to pull out from Afghanistan.

Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) refused to say whether he would support kicking Turkey out of NATO but insisted Turkey should no longer be seen as a U.S. ally “when they invade another country and engage in mass slaughter.” Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) evaded the same question about NATO membership, condemning Turkey’s actions as “outrageous” and a “horror” but advising continued engagement and negotiations with Turkey.

Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) said Trump endangered U.S. national security by “basically giving 10,000 ISIS fighters a get-out-of-jail-free card” and making the Islamic State one of the “big winners” in Syria, in addition to Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime. It appears to have escaped her notice that the latter three were already the “big winners” in Syria before Trump’s election, even though she boasted of sitting on the Senate Intelligence Committee, where such things are presumably discussed.

Biden came back to wrap up the Syria section of the debate with a characteristically disjointed rant about how Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan “understands if he’s out of NATO, he’s in real trouble,” but also efforts to break up NATO are the demonic work of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“And with regard to regime change in Syria, that has not been the policy we change the regime. It has been to make sure that the regime did not wipe out hundreds of thousands of innocent people between there and the Iraqi border,” Biden insisted, forgetting that President Obama explicitly stated Assad had to go, and a very large number of innocent people were indeed “wiped out” or driven out of Syria on his and Obama’s watch.

Biden’s rambling closer typifies the problem the Democrats face on Syria: All of them, with the exception of no-hope candidate Tulsi Gabbard, want to virtue-signal as loud as they can and slam President Trump as hard as possible, but none of them wants to discuss the details of what has been happening in Syria since 2011 or propose a cogent strategy for changing conditions on the ground in a meaningful way. None of them talked about an “exit strategy,” a phrase they were very big on during the Iraq operation.

None of the Democrats wanted to discuss Turkey’s claims of a severe security threat from northeastern Syria, discuss why the international community did nothing to address those claims, or explain why the United States was held solely responsible for preventing Turkey from taking action. They treated the notion of Russian and Syrian involvement against the Turkish assault as inherently outrageous without explaining why the Syrian government should not be held responsible for protecting its own citizens and securing its own borders. They complained about escaping ISIS prisoners without discussing why thousands of them were still parked in Kurdish prison camps and how long they should be left there.

None of the Democrats was asked to present a war plan for fighting Turkey or discuss how much the U.S. depends on Turkish bases for operations in the Middle East. None of them, not even Biden, was pressed on how the Obama administration set the table for current events. None of them acknowledged the difficulty of getting reliable information from any party involved in the savage Syrian civil war, although Gabbard came close when she pointed out how dodgy some of the groups supported by the Obama administration were.

And of course, CNN would not dream of asking the Democrat candidates — several of whom are sitting senators — why their caucus did not authorize military force against Turkey to protect the Kurds, instead spending all of its time on an impeachment crusade against President Trump. Trump said he wanted to pull troops out of Syria almost a year ago, and Erdogan was threatening to invade long before that. The Democrats had plenty of time to pass the appropriate congressional resolutions and send a strong message to Turkey, but that would have involved putting real political capital on the line instead of sniping from the sidelines."

South Korean officials seized the dark web server which contained about eight terabytes of child porn content.

“Children around the world are safer because of the actions taken by U.S. and foreign law enforcement to prosecute this case and recover funds for victims,” U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jessie K. Liu said in a written statement. “We will continue to pursue such criminals on and off the darknet in the United States and abroad, to ensure they receive the punishment their terrible crimes deserve.”

In March, South Korean officials seized the server which housed the Welcome to Video website. They also arrested Jong Woo Son, 23, a South Korean national who allegedly operated the website. Following the arrest and seizure, officials carried out an investigation that led to Wednesday’s announcement of a nine-count indictment against Jong and 337 other site users.

Investigators traced Bitcoin transactions and server logs to track down users from Alabama, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington State, and Washington, D.C. They also found users of the child porn service in the United Kingdom, South Korea, Germany, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the Czech Republic, Canada, Ireland, Spain, Brazil, and Australia

“Darknet sites that profit from the sexual exploitation of children are among the most vile and reprehensible forms of criminal behavior,” said Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “This Administration will not allow child predators to use lawless online spaces as a shield. Today’s takedown demonstrates that the Department of Justice remains firmly committed to working closely with our partners in South Korea and around the world to rescue child victims and bring to justice the perpetrators of these abhorrent crimes.”

The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) analyzed the images and videos stored on the server and found more than 250,000 unique videos. The organization reported that 45 percent of the video images were new to investigators and had never been documented before. The site boasted in its DearkNet marketing more than 1,000,000 downloads of its child porn content. Investigators believe the website had the capacity to handle more than one million users.

However, today’s indictment sends a strong message to criminals that no matter how sophisticated the technology or how widespread the network, child exploitation will not be tolerated in the United States. Our entire justice system will stop at nothing to prevent these heinous crimes, safeguard our children, and bring justice to all.”"

It was the most crowded debate stage in the history of US presidential primaries.

Twelve candidates shared the spotlight Tuesday at the Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus. The event was hosted by CNN and The New York Times on the campus of Otterbein University.

This was the fourth Democratic debate of the campaign season, and it came three and a half months before the Iowa caucuses.

The first two debates had so many candidates that they had to be split up over two nights. But the Democratic National Committee raised the polling and fundraising thresholds that candidates need to qualify.

Those thresholds will be raised once again ahead of next month's debate in Georgia, so Tuesday might have been a make-or-break night for some of the lower-polling candidates."

In response, the Harris campaign told CNN on Wednesday, ""Twitter is not holding Donald Trump accountable for abusing their platform to threaten people and incite and inspire violent behavior.""

The California Democrat had written to Twitter two weeks ago saying that Trump had used his account to ""target, harass, and attempt to out the whistleblower"" whose allegations about the President's call with the leader of Ukraine prompted Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry

Harris also pointed to a tweet from Trump with a quote that she said ""suggested violence could be incited should Congress issue formal articles of impeachment against him.""

In the letter to Harris on Tuesday, obtained by CNN, Twitter said it would not be suspending the President.

Kamala Harris on Wednesday defended her calls for Twitter to suspend President Donald Trump's account, a plan she reiterated on stage at the fourth Democratic primary presidential debate hosted by CNN and The New York Times.

Harris first made her call following the President's tweets about the whistleblower complaint at the center of the Ukraine scandal. During Tuesday night's debate, Harris called out Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, one of the field's front-runners, for not following her lead in saying Trump's Twitter account should be taken down. Warren brushed off Harris' proposal, saying she didn't just want to ""push Trump off Twitter"" but also out of the White House.

The contentious moment led to some criticism for Harris, including from former US National Security Council spokesperson Tommy Vietor, who called Harris' push during the debate ""small ball.""

Harris, however, told CNN's John Berman on ""New Day"" Wednesday that Trump's ""threatening remarks"" about the whistleblower and others is a ""serious matter.""

""It's a serious matter. And it is a matter of the safety of those individuals,"" she said. ""You can look at the fact that the shooter in El Paso was influenced by the words that the President of the United States, unfiltered, uses through this medium on Twitter. He has 65 million followers. And we have to take seriously the implications that are about the threatening witnesses, intimidating witnesses and obstructing justice.""

She added: ""When witnesses are threatened by the President of the United States, it is a very serious matter. And people will be influenced by those threats. And we have to say that it is not OK and that he has revoked his privilege to use this platform because it is a privilege that can be and should be taken away.""

Harris also said companies like Facebook and Twitter need to adopt the same set of standards to govern what is allowed on their platforms.

""And the point also has to be, you can't have one set of standards for Facebook and another for Twitter,"" she said on Wednesday. ""All of these social media companies and these online platforms, which are so powerful in their ability to impact perception about an issue and to influence behaviors. Let's be clear about that. There have to be standards, and the standards have to be the same. You can't have one standard for Facebook and another for Twitter.""

While companies like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter collaborate closely and are closely aligned on policing content from terrorist groups, each is a separate company and has their own set of standards for political speech.

In May, for instance, when a fake video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi circulated, the three major platforms acted differently. YouTube removed the video, Facebook let the video stay online but downranked it meaning it would be seen by less people and Twitter allowed the video to stay online.

Earlier this month, Harris sent a letter to the Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey listing six tweets by the President that she says violated Twitter's rules. The White House called Harris' demand ""authoritarian"" and defended Trump's use of Twitter.

""It is not surprising that Kamala Harris, someone who believes in bigger government and more regulation, would like to silence her political opponents,"" the White House said in a statement. ""In fact, it's rather authoritarian of her. President Trump's use of technology to communicate directly with the American people and share his Administration's unprecedented accomplishments should be praised, not criticized.""

On Tuesday, Twitter issued a clarification in a blog post on rules for tweets by world leaders, saying ""that the accounts of world leaders are not above our policies entirely."" The social media network reiterated its announcement from June that some tweets from world leaders that break its rules would not be removed from the platform if the company decided they were in the ""public interest."" Twitter said it would instead put a disclaimer on the tweets explaining that although they broke the company's rules they would not be removed.

Twitter has not labeled any of Trump's tweets in this way."

On Thursday, Lee failed for the fourth time to get his legislation, S. 386, passed out of the Senate. The legislation, sponsored by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), would allow Indian nationals to effectively monopolize the U.S. green card system for at least ten years and reward tech corporations like Google, Oracle, and Microsoft — all of which are donors to Lee.

Cook said in a post online:

Immigrants make this country stronger and our economy more dynamic. As a first step toward needed comprehensive reform, I urge the Senate to move quickly to pass the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act. The contributions of these workers are critical to America’s future.

Lee’s S. 386 will ensure outsourcing firms such as Cognizant and Infosys, as well as giant tech conglomerates like Amazon and Facebook, have a green card system wherein only foreign workers on H-1B visas are able to obtain employment green cards by creating a backlog of seven to eight years for all foreign nationals.

This process would solidify that employment-based green cards only go to temporary foreign visa workers who have been imported to the U.S. by corporations to replace American workers, thus rewarding the employers of H-1B foreign workers.

While about 25 percent of all employment-based green cards currently are rewarded to Indian nationals today, should Lee’s legislation pass, Indian nationals will obtain more than 90 percent of all the employment-based green cards for at least a decade.

As Breitbart News has detailed, tech corporations like Google, Microsoft, Oracle, and Hewlett-Packard have lobbied Republican and Democrat Senators for the last few months to get Lee’s S. 386 passed.

At the same time, Microsoft has been Lee’s largest tech donor for the last five election cycles, dishing out nearly $130,000 to him since 2015. More than $97,000 of those funds went directly to Lee, while another $30,000 went to PAC aligned with Lee.

Likewise, Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc. has donated $55,900 to Lee since 2015, while the Oracle Corporation has donated $44,200.

Others bankrolling Lee’s S. 386 are the outsourcing lobby, like Cognizant and the IBM Corporation. Cognizant and IBM have a total of seven lobbyists pushing the legislation. IBM and Cognizant are set to gain hugely from S. 386, as they are two of the largest outsourcers of American jobs in the nation.

This year, alone, Cognizant sought to outsource more than 13,000 U.S. jobs to H-1B foreign visa workers. IBM — headed by Ginni Rometty, who takes in a salary of $16.45 million a year — attempted to outsource nearly 8,500 U.S. jobs to H-1B foreign visa workers.

Current and former officials are painting an ever more damning picture of a wider than originally perceived scheme by President Donald Trump and his crew to pressure Ukraine that they warned could amount to a trampling of US law.

Vice President Mike Pence launched a new effort Tuesday to bolster White House hopes of stalling the House inquiry long enough for Trump to turn public opinion against it. He refused to turn over documents related to Trump's now notorious call with the President of Ukraine on July 25.

But White House officials are becoming increasingly frustrated at revelations from the closed-door hearings. Given that there is no presidential counsel in the room, they struggle to frame a defense, learning about almost daily bombshells only from news reports, CNN reported on Tuesday.

And the possibility that former national security adviser John Bolton -- who may have little incentive to shield the President who recently ousted him -- could soon be called to testify will do little to ease the impression among White House officials that they are flying blind.

Fresh testimony in recent days has elevated the crisis for Trump. It has appeared to expose an off-the-books effort to perform an end run around US foreign policy officials with political appointees that predated his notorious phone call with the President of Ukraine in which he sought dirt on his possible 2020 foe Joe Biden.

On Monday, former senior White House Russia aide Fiona Hill testified that she had tried to raise the alarm about possibly illegal activity -- and had been encouraged to do so by Bolton.

A senior State Department official, George Kent, testified Tuesday that he'd been told by a supervisor to lie low after complaining about Rudy Giuliani's meddling in Ukraine, according to Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia, who sits on the House Oversight Committee.

More peril looms for the White House on Thursday, when Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, is expected to tell lawmakers that a text he sent to a colleague insisting there was no quid pro quo offered to Ukraine was dictated by the President himself.

The most worrying development so far this week for the Trump team is that Hill's stunning mention of Bolton raises the possibility that a possibly disgruntled former national security adviser, who was forced out under a cloud, may have an incentive to offer testimony that could damage his former boss.

Trump's rather worn defense of his actions exemplifies the depth of his problem. The Ukraine story has outpaced the President's attacks on a whistleblower who first exposed the story and his defense of his ""perfect"" call with Ukraine's President. Trump's allies are bemoaning what they say is a lack of due process in the Democratic impeachment investigation -- but they often seem unable to effectively parry the damaging tidbits leaking out of depositions.

Trump's defense is beginning to look insufficient

The President stuck to generalities on Tuesday.

""We just hit the greatest economy we've ever had. 'Let's impeach the President' -- isn't that a good idea?"" Trump said during an event with the Stanley Cup champion St. Louis Blues.

""I wouldn't worry about it, fellas. I wouldn't worry about it,"" the President told several senators in the audience, referring to impeachment -- raising questions as to whether he understands the seriousness of his plight.

Democrats are expressing deep satisfaction with the pace of their three-week-old investigation so far.

And in a sign that GOP attacks on their process are not yet biting, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday that she had no plans yet to bow to demands for a vote formally authorizing the impeachment proceedings.

House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff laid claim to ""dramatic progress"" Tuesday in digging out the truth about Trump's call with President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25.

And Democratic presidential candidates -- in a grave moment at the start of their latest debate in Ohio -- reflected polls showing growing public support for investigating the President.

Former Vice President Joe Biden blasted Trump as ""the most corrupt"" President ""in modern history and all of our history.""

When asked whether she was not giving the President a fair shot by already calling for his ouster, Sen. Kamala Harris of California said: ""It is just being observant. He has committed crimes in plain sight.""

The White House attempted on Tuesday to try to reassert control over an impeachment drama with which it has struggled to keep pace. Vice President Mike Pence said he would refuse a subpoena for documents related to Ukraine.

""The House of Representatives has not authorized any 'impeachment inquiry,' "" Matthew Morgan, counsel to the vice president, wrote in a letter to Democratic House committee chairmen.

There is no constitutional requirement for Democrats to hold a vote authorizing impeachment proceedings. Such a vote did take place, however, in the previous two impeachment showdowns, involving Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. There is a case to be made that Democrats should go out of their way to offer a fair process to the President -- since their slim hopes of winning a Senate conviction after any impeachment vote in the full House rely on reshaping public opinion.

Worries about illegal behavior

Hill's testimony suggested that senior figures inside Trump's White House were deeply concerned that the activities by the President and those close to him could reach the level of illegal behavior.

While it remains unclear whether Trump or his lawyer Giuliani did actually break the law in going around official channels to deal with Ukraine, much of the conduct now emerging at least appears unethical, off-the-books of regular diplomatic activity and more expansive than it initially appeared.

On Tuesday, Giuliani's lawyer informed Congress that the former New York mayor will defy House Democrats' impeachment subpoena. The Office of Management and Budget also does not plan to turn over the documents that impeachment committees subpoenaed, a spokeswoman said.

According to sources familiar with Hill's testimony, she also said Bolton had warned her that he would not get caught up in what he referred to as a ""drug deal"" being cooked up on Ukraine by Sondland and White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.

One source told CNN that Hill, a Trump appointee, saw ""wrongdoing"" in the White House approach to Ukraine and tried to report it to officials.

Hill was concerned that Giuliani was circumventing the State Department to run what some Democrats have labeled a ""shadow foreign policy"" by seeking the removal of US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and pushing for Ukraine to open an investigation into the former vice president and his son Hunter Biden. There is no evidence of wrongdoing in Ukraine by either Biden."

(CNN) President Donald Trump's ears must have been burning as Democrats met in Ohio at the most crowded presidential debate in US history on Tuesday.

The 12 candidates at the CNN/New York Times debate conjured up visions of a vastly different America should they evict him from the White House in 2020. They'd reverse Trump's erratic, ""America First"" twists and turns, and restore the US leadership in the world -- somehow. But as the heated exchanges on health care, tax and billionaires showed, the Democratic Party still doesn't know how far left it wants to go.

Who won and lost a debate often takes a few days to become clear as viral moments ignite on social media and voters chew over the post-game analysis. But the early money suggests that this debate will not shake up the wider shape of the race. Former Vice President Joe Biden is a wobbly front runner. Elizabeth Warren has joined him in the top tier (and attacks that she faced on Tuesday night -- the most withering of her career -- show that the rest of the field knows it.)

While some outsiders did well -- like 30-something Pete Buttigieg and centrist Senator Amy Klobuchar, who brought sharp knives for Warren -- everyone else is still struggling to get a look in.

Four takeaways that will shape the campaign

The shadow of impeachment

Joe Biden, reaching for gravitas, said Trump's presidency was ""the most corrupt in modern history and all of our history."" Kamala Harris said the President had ""committed crimes in plain sight."" Elizabeth Warren said this was ""bigger than politics."" Whatever happens with the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump will tear America even further apart. And if one of the men or women on stage beats him at the polls, they'll end up with the job of trying to put it back together.

What about the Kurds?

All of the candidates agreed Trump was wrong to abruptly remove US troops from the side of Kurdish allies in Syria. But there was a strong isolationist strain onstage, in keeping with the mood of a nation exhausted by foreign wars. Co-frontrunner Warren did not quarrel with Trump's instinct to bring troops home, just with how he's doing it. ""I think we want to get out of the Middle East. I do think we should do it responsibly,"" she said. Until further notice, that is America's message to the rest of the world.

So that's what it's like to be a front-runner

Elizabeth Warren now knows what it's like to have a target on her back. Her rise to effective co-front-runner status exposed her to attacks from all sides on Tuesday. Both Buttigieg and Klobuchar piled on -- seeking to grab the middle ground of many Democrats who fear Warren and Sanders are too left wing. ""The difference between a plan and a pipedream is something you can actually get done,"" said Klobuchar, desperate for a viral moment as she struggles to reach polling thresholds to get her into the next debate.

In one of the most electric moments of the campaign, Biden and Warren -- the two most likely nominees -- clashed directly for the first time.

What heart attack?

Those two stents inserted into one of Bernie Sanders' arteries did the trick. The Vermont senator was ""feeling great"" and keen to wrest the debate away from Trump-bashing and back to his wheelhouse: health care, student debt and getting rid of billionaires. Sanders supporters will be relieved. But millions of moderate Americans watching at home might be more concerned at his frank admission that taxes will go up to pay for his ambitious social reforms.

Shameful. Shameful!

That was Biden letting off steam at Trump's decision to let Syria roll into northeastern Syria at the expense of America's Kurdish allies. The former vice president has much to vent about the President.

Brexit interlude

There's a generally held view of the European Union as an 11th hour decision-maker, working its way out of difficulties with late-night summits fueled by dozens of cups of coffee and pastries, and prime ministers and presidents only staggering out after midnight to announce a breakthrough.

Sometimes that really is what happens (it's also not uncommon for heads of state convening in Brussels to nip out for frites and a beer during negotiating breaks) but that's not how the EU likes to do things.

In fact, the European Council prefers to have its agenda set two weeks ahead of each summit. That gives the Commission -- its executive body -- time to analyze everything and make recommendations to member states, who also have to prepare. But Brexit is no ordinary agenda item.

This month, the EU has blown through one self-imposed deadline after another, as they try to settle the conditions of a UK exit from the union, before heads of government start turning up in Brussels. On Tuesday, they missed another deadline. As things stand now, no one will have time to digest any Brexit deal before the Thursday summit -- which could mean more stale pastries, fries and head-scratching in the middle of the night, instead.

-- CNN's Richard Greene , writing to Meanwhile

Who said it? Debate edition

""I don't need lessons from you on courage — political or personal.""

""That is dead wrong.""

""It didn't work in 2016 and it will be a disaster for us in 2020.""

""The mainstream media, who have been championing and cheerleading this regime-change war.""

""You got the disastrous war in Iraq done.""

""MATH""

What good is a 12-person debate anyway?

Glad you asked.

The US electoral map is so vast that most Americans only see presidential candidates on TV, so these events are necessary for Democratic officials to build enthusiasm among voters, reaching tens of millions of viewers -- and not just Democrats. And the crowded field offers more than a soundbite fest — it fleshes out a broader divide between liberal and moderate positions that grassroots voters must adjudicate before choosing a candidate.

There is something quintessentially American about opening the White House race to everyone. The last two US presidents have been a rookie senator from Illinois and a businessman from New York with almost no political experience between them and little in common. Debates are part of a process that must be sufficiently elastic to accommodate sharp shifts in public opinion over a four year cycle.

In a populist age, party elites fear charges of dictating voters' choices, and the field will narrow soon enough anyway. When it does, the debates will have been good practice for the eventual Democratic nominee, who must debate Donald Trump a year from now. Whether they're the right way to pick a decent president is a whole other ballgame."

(CNN) In Tuesday night's Democratic presidential debate, I'm afraid most of the candidates blended into the stage for me at some point. But that doesn't mean there wasn't a star among them. Here's how each candidate performed:

Bernie Sanders: A

Throughout the three-hour event, Sen. Sanders was consistently sharper than normal, and he outperformed the others, especially Elizabeth Warren, when explaining the financials of his healthcare plan. I liked his attitude about his health: we can judge it by watching him take the campaign by storm. He was the star of the evening.

Sanders remained firm and defiant when it was called for, asserting that nobody can trust our foreign policy because President Donald Trump is unpredictable. And when Joe Biden heated up toward the end of the debate, saying,""I'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done,"" Sanders was ready to put things in perspective by replying: ""You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country. You got trade agreements, like NAFTA (The North American Free Trade Agreement) and PNTR (Permanent Normal Trade Relations), with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs.""

Overall, Sanders' nonverbal communication -- typically hyper with lots of hand-waving -- was reined in, and that served him well. His animation was kept to a minimum, which was smart and effective.

Kamala Harris: A-

Sen. Harris flourished by doing the opposite of Sanders. Rather than being restrained, she brought a bit more energy to her debate performance, which she needed.

On the topic of abortion, nobody was more powerful than Harris, who declared: ""Women are the majority of the population in this country. People need to keep their hands off of women's bodies and let women make the decisions about their own lives."" And Harris got the better of Elizabeth Warren when asking Warren to support the suspension of President Trump's Twitter account.

But a couple of stories didn't land. For instance, when debating a tax credit to close the income gap, Harris told a childhood anecdote about her mom sitting at the kitchen table wondering how to ""make it all work."" In the past, Harris has hit home runs with these personal stories, but this time around, she had none that were especially memorable.

Pete Buttigieg: B

Mayor Pete was pretty effective in policy arguments. He provided several options for depoliticizing the Supreme Court, and more than held his own on health care and gun control. Buttigieg also won most of the direct skirmishes he entered with other candidates. He got the best of Tulsi Gabbard when discussing Syria and keeping our military commitments. He called out Elizabeth Warren when she failed to satisfactorily explain how she'd pay for Medicare for All.

But then he slipped up when he made a back-and-forth about gun control with Beto O'Rourke needlessly personal. After O'Rourke remarked that policymakers should ""lead and not be limited by the polls and the consultants and the focus groups,"" Buttigieg retorted: ""I don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal."" The remark seemed to come from left field. Mayor Pete responded as if he was called a coward, but that simply wasn't the case.

Phantom attacks like these happen often in competitive debates when expectations of an opponent's arguments don't always match the reality of what has been said. It was an unfortunate miscalculation by Buttigieg.

Cory Booker: B

Sen. Booker had a good tone throughout the evening. He was conversational, which is what I teach my students to strive for. Booker was also solid on content, consistently taking arguments one step further, like when he mentioned how anti-abortion laws disproportionately affect low-income women and the need to talk about child poverty when discussing tax systems.

On the downside, Booker focused too much energy on chastising everyone else over their tones and argument style when talking to one another (he was right, but then he overplayed his hand and his criticism seemed canned). Speaking of canned, what was the joke about Bernie Sanders being a fan of medical marijuana? Round peg, meet square hole.

Andrew Yang: B-

Bold ideas suit him well. While Yang's defense of his Freedom Dividend (a universal basic income of $1,000 a month) was lacking in support in this debate, he made up for it by defending other unconventional ideas. Yang floated the idea of decriminalizing opioids, which impressively got support from O'Rourke. Yang was smart to point out that Elizabeth Warren's plan to implement a wealth tax has been tried. ""The problem is that it's been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all those countries ended up repealing it, because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they'd projected,"" Yang said.

There were a few arguments where Yang was less successful. Booker overshadowed him on the topic of breaking up large tech companies. While Yang expressed skepticism over some benefits of breaking them up, Booker pointed out that the issue is not just competition, but that these large monopolies ""undermine our democracy.""

Yang also could use a bit more practice finishing his arguments. While he made a good point that our data should be treated as our property, his analysis was incomplete. Yang needed to more fully explain what having control of our data would mean for Americans.

Julian Castro: C+

He all but disappeared in parts of the debate, so it was difficult for him to climb the grading scale. However, Castro had some on-point analysis when discussing why communities don't want cops coming to their house under the guise of confiscating assault weapons. This approach was bold but risky. It could work against him if his criticism of weapon confiscation is interpreted as anti-police.

Elizabeth Warren: C

Sen. Warren needs to answer the questions. She is simply too smart to ignore the topic she is being asked to address -- especially when she's asked the same thing multiple times. Should Trump's Twitter account be suspended? I personally don't know -- and neither, it seems, does Warren. How is she planning to pay for Medicare for all? Again, she left us wondering,

Warren also came across as petty by implying it was not Biden but President Obama who should be credited with helping some of her bills become laws during the Obama administration.

Amy Klobuchar: C

While I found her delivery to be less than optimal at times, Klobuchar had some good points. She spoke thoughtfully on Roe v. Wade, taking on Big Pharma and income inequality.

Unfortunately, Klobuchar got caught in an awkward nonverbal moment when Castro was speaking on the topic of monopolies and the camera panned over to her. Her blank expression reminded me of when I catch a student on a cell phone during class. It's a good reminder to look engaged at all times -- you never know when you'll be in the spotlight.

If I could give her one piece of advice it would be to please stop using the scripted jokes. No one is laughing.

Beto O'Rourke: C

O'Rourke was simply average the entire time. He argued better than he did during the first debate, but was an expected let-down from his last debate. Unfortunately, the issue of guns, which he has made a central point of his campaign, was probably the worst part of his performance on Tuesday. O'Rourke needed more evidence to support his belief that owners of AR-15s and AK-47s will voluntarily give up their weapons under an assault rifle ban.

Joe Biden: C-

The best part of former Vice President Joe Biden's debate came toward the end when he highlighted his accomplishments. While still not as smooth as it could have been, he made a convincing argument: ""I'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done, from the Violence Against Women Act to making sure that we pass the Affordable Care Act to being in a position where we, in fact, took almost a $90 billion act that kept us from going into a depression...""

Unfortunately, this came a bit late in the night. And for every good answer, Biden had multiple slipups. Examples include whatever this means: ""And lastly, and I apologize for going on, but lastly, what is happening in Iraq is going to -- I mean, excuse me, in Afghanistan, as well as all the way over to Syria, we have ISIS that's going to come here ..."" Once you've fumbled that much, you've lost the audience.

Biden needs to take his own advice and eliminate some of the clutter in his mind when he's answering questions. As he said in the debate, ""And this is one of the reasons why these debates are kind of crazy, because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given."" Exactly.

Tulsi Gabbard: D

Congresswoman Gabbard probably put off a lot of people with her responses. Drawing from the Republican playbook, she complained about the mainstream media and pointed out that she disagreed with Hillary Clinton on many issues. At the end of the night, when candidates were asked to explain a surprising friendship, Gabbard talked about her relationship with Republican Trey Gowdy. The same Trey Gowdy that Trump tried to hire for his impeachment defense team

However, my favorite part of the whole debate was when apparently Gabbard tried to take over the moderators' jobs and pose a question to the other candidates. She was quickly shut down when moderator Erin Burnett jumped in and announced a commercial break.

Tom Steyer: D

This was Steyer's first debate, and I had no problem with any of his answers, so in that regard, it was a success. But on public speaking 101, he failed. Have you ever met a person who never breaks eye contact until you feel uncomfortable? Steyer's nonstop eye contact with the camera made me feel the need to look away. It looked totally unnatural. We can only hope that he watches himself back and makes a note to blink in the next debate."

Sen. Kamala Harris said during the segment of the debate on health care in Ohio that Republicans “have passed laws that will virtually prevent women from having access to reproductive healthcare.”

She added:

And it is not an exaggeration to say, women will die, poor women, women of color will die because these Republican legislators in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with their bodies. Women are the majority of the population in this country. People need to keep their hands off of women’s bodies and let women make the decisions about healthcare issues in America today.

Harris’s statement is a deception that has been spread by Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry for years, but has reached feverish pitch since the pro-life Trump administration has now appointed two Supreme Court justices who intend to interpret the Constitution as it was originally written.

The fear for abortion rights supporters is that Roe v. Wade will ultimately be overturned. Proponents of abortion have increasingly made more claims that “women will die” if this happens, hoping to feed the narrative that a multitude of women died before the 1973 landmark Supreme Court ruling that invented a right to abortion.

‘The consequence will be women’s lives.’ — @PPFA Pres. @DrLeanaWen is explaining the real, deadly results of banning abortion pic.twitter.com/cykbl4JjCA — NowThis (@nowthisnews) May 20, 2019

Prior to her recent sudden termination from Planned Parenthood, Dr. Leana Wen, its former president, was a frequent guest on talk shows and posted to Twitter that, if her organization is defunded or abortion is banned, women’s lives will be endangered.

“Thousands of women died before Roe v. Wade,” Wen told the Daily Show. “That could happen now.”

However, Planned Parenthood’s own fact sheets tell a very different story.

The abortion industry giant states:

In 1965, when abortion was still illegal nationwide except in cases of life endangerment, at least 193 women died from illegal abortions, and illegal abortion accounted for nearly 17 percent of all deaths due to pregnancy and childbirth in that year (Gold, 1990; NCHS, 1967).

The pro-choice Guttmacher Institute also reported:

By 1950, illegal abortion deaths fell to “just over 300,” likely “because of the introduction of antibiotics in 1940s, which permitted more effective treatment of the infections frequently developed after illegal abortion.” By 1965, “the number of deaths due to illegal abortion had fallen to just under 200.”

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 1972, the year before the Supreme Court’s decision in Roe, 24 women died from legal induced abortion – legal in a handful of states in which abortion in some very limited cases was permitted – and 39 women died from illegal abortion.

Let’s not kid ourselves. Abortion restrictions work. They have large, rapid effects and save tens of thousands of lives from the cruelty of murder in the womb.https://t.co/zTx7jBWfEo — The Federalist (@FDRLST) May 20, 2019

In 1973, when the Supreme Court created a right to abortion, CDC reported 19 deaths from illegal abortions and 25 deaths from legal abortions.

Though abortion reporting measures have not been consistent – leading to differing results – none of the reports gave the indication that “thousands” of women died in illegal abortions prior to Roe v. Wade.

As pro-life organization Live Action reported, NARAL founder and former abortionist Bernard Nathanson admitted he and others fabricated large numbers of deaths from illegal abortions prior to the high court’s decision in Roe.

According to the report, in his 1979 book, Aborting America, Nathanson called the “thousands” claim a “nice, round, shocking figure.”

Life News reported Nathanson said of the fabrication, “[I]n the ‘morality’ of our revolution, it was a useful figure, widely accepted so why go out of our way to correct it with honest statistics?”

Wen and now other abortion industry leaders and their political allies, however, are still suggesting “women will die” if abortion is banned. The fact is, women still die during “legal” abortions and “thousands” of children die each year because abortion is not banned.

Sen. Kamala Harris especially claimed “women of color” will die. Ironically, Planned Parenthood aborts the lives of more than 300,000 children each year, and 18 million of the 59 million abortions that have been performed in this country since the Roe v. Wade decision have ended the lives of babies “of color.”

Harris likely interjected the comments about abortion in the wake of complaints by Planned Parenthood and its allies that Democrats had failed to raise the issue of abortion rights during any of their debates thus far. Planned Parenthood responded favorably on Twitter to Harris’s remarks:"

Kamala Harris (D-CA) described President Donald Trump as being “like a two-year-old with a machine gun” when using Twitter.

Defending her repeated calls for Trump to be banned from Twitter, Harris said, “Ask the whistle-blower. Ask members of the United States Congress. Ask the people who are prepared to testify about this president’s lawlessness and obstruction of justice. Ask the people and the families in El Paso when that shooter admitted in his manifesto that he was influenced by Donald Trump’s tweets. Donald Trump has 65 million followers on Twitter, and we are to take seriously that the weaponization of this platform by the president and the need therefore of a private corporation to be held accountable to say he has abused the terms. And it could result literally in the threat to safety of human beings who are participating in the process of justice.”

She continued, “Are speech does not condone or protect threats to the safety of other human beings. and so that is what we are talking about.

She added, “The fact is that he is irresponsible. He is erratic. He does not —he is like a two-year-old with a machine gun. Right? He doesn’t understand the power of his words or his actions in way that they will actually impact and could end other human beings’ lives. So whether he understands it or not, look, he is the president of the United States. I don’t actually care where he understands it or not. Because he is he has shown that he is not responsible enough to self-regulate. He has shown he is not responsible enough to edit what he says.”

Kamala Harris (D-CA) is tanking in Iowa – despite a switch in campaign strategies to blitz the state, sarcastically telling a colleague in September that she is “f*cking moving” to the Hawkeye State – Emerson Polling results released this week reveal.

The California senator has experienced a steady decline in both national and early primary and caucus state polls in recent weeks. The trend was seemingly sparked by Rep. Tulsi Gabbard’s (D-HI) pointed attack on Harris’s controversial prosecutorial record – jailing hundreds of people for marijuana violations and later making light of smoking marijuana – during the Democrat debate in July.

Harris signaled a switch in campaign strategies in September, telling a colleague that she is “f*cking moving to Iowa.”

“‘I’m f*cking moving to Iowa’ – Kamala Harris,” read an email following the presidential hopeful’s quip.

“She cut to the chase!” the email stated. “We’re doubling our organizers on the ground in Iowa and Kamala is ramping up her time on the trail there, beginning today in Cedar Rapids.”

The following month, Harris launched her “I feel your pain” tour across Iowa, which featured the presidential hopeful speaking to Iowans in more “intimate” settings, even helping some “prepare Sunday suppers.”

Despite the Iowa push, Harris continues to tank in the polls, with the latest Emerson Polling survey showing Harris garnering just two percent among Democrat caucus-goers in Iowa.

The poll, taken October 13-16, 2019 among 313 Democrat caucus voters, showed Joe Biden (D) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) topping the field with 23 percent support each. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) overtook Sanders for third place with 16 percent support to the Vermont senator’s 13 percent.

Andrew Yang (D) came in fifth place with five percent support, followed by Gov. Steve Bullock (D) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with four percent and three percent, respectively.

Harris, who once mocked Gabbard’s low poll numbers, tied with both the Hawaiian lawmaker and Tom Steyer (D), with two percent support. The margin of error is +/- 5.5 percent:

Harris mocked Gabbard following their contentious face-off in July’s debate, telling CNN’s Anderson Cooper:

This is going to sound immodest, but I’m obviously a top tier candidate, and so, I did expect that I would be on the stage and take hits tonight because there are a lot of people that are trying to make the stage for the next debate.

“Especially when people are at zero or one percent or whatever she might be at, and so, I did expect that I might take hits tonight,” she added, a direct reference to Gabbard:

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) suggested that politicians cannot pretend to take on Big Tech and big pharmaceutical corporations after taking their donations — something Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) has continued to do throughout her run for president.

After Harris demanded that tech corporations like Twitter ban President Trump from their platforms, Warren touted that she, unlike Harris, has refused to take donations from Big Tech and Big Pharma.

Harris, despite claiming that she will fight Big Tech and Big Pharma companies if elected, has taken donor money from employees of the country’s biggest tech conglomerates and pharmaceutical executives, as Breitbart News has detailed.

In fact, Harris’s campaign has been almost exclusively propped up by a base of elite coastal donors with less than 40 percent of her funding coming from small-dollar donors giving $200 or less. The majority of Harris’s donations, more than 56 percent, have come from large-dollar donors giving $200 or more.

Harris’s top donors include lawyers from the Paul, Weiss, et al. law firm, which has represented Citigroup, as well as American job outsourcers and offshorers such as the Walt Disney Company; multinational communications services AT&T; Alphabet Inc., which is the parent corporation of Google; as well as Apple Inc.

In May, billionaire Gordon Getty of the Getty Oil dynasty hosted a fundraiser for Harris at his mansion in San Francisco, California, with Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA). Campaign records find that the billionaire Getty family has contributed thousands to Harris.

Likewise, though Harris’s campaign has claimed that she does not accept funding from Big Pharma, a number of pharmaceutical executives have gifted the California senator with campaign cash, The Intercept notes:

Donors include Therese Meaney, a vice president at Endo Pharmaceuticals, a company that manufacturers opioid painkillers, who has given $1,250 to the Harris campaign; Ted Love, the president and chief executive of Global Blood Therapeutics, a startup biopharmaceutical company, who gave $2,800; J. Dana Hughes, a vice president at Pfizer, gave $250; Damian Wilmot, an executive at Vertex Pharmaceuticals, gave $1,000; and Jeffrey Stein, the chief executive of Cidara Therapeutics, another drug startup, who gave $1,000.

Silicon Valley’s tech elites have been major contributors to Harris’s bid as she has campaigned against slapping tariffs on the foreign-made products of tech corporations.

Seven Facebook executives and employees have donated $1,000 or more to Harris’s campaign, while nearly 20 Google executives and employees have donated more than $1,000, four Twitter executives and employees have donated more than $1,000, and 71 Amazon executives and employees have donated anywhere from $5 to $2,000.

The Walt Disney Company’s Craig Hunegs, who heads Disney Television Studios, is one of Harris’s top donors, giving nearly $6,000 to her campaign. California real estate developer John Dinapoli, Coastal Healthcare Services President Quiana Mitchem, and New York Attorney Fraser Hunter Jr. have all donated more than $5,000 to Harris as well.

That is a crime.”

Harris began by saying, “[W]e’re talking about a private corporation, Twitter, that has terms of use. And as far as I’m concerned, and I think most people would say, including members of Congress who he has threatened, that he has lost his privileges and it should be taken down.”

She added, “He does not have a right to commit a crime because he is president of the United States. He does not have the right to threaten witnesses and threaten their safety because he is president of the United States. In fact, that’s the very problem with Donald Trump. He thinks he’s above the law, and we cannot keep reinforcing that. And anyone who wants to say, well, this is a matter of free speech, you are not free to threaten the life of a witness. That is a crime.”

Harris later stated, “We have to have a very serious conversation about what should be the rules placed on these private corporations, and in that context, Twitter has a responsibility.”

Kamala Harris and Beto O’Rourke attacked Warren on two occasions each, and Andrew Yang attacked her one time.

Klobuchar defended her attacks, saying that she wanted to be president of all of America, not just half of America.

“If people are tired of the noise and nonsense and the extremes, they’ve got a home with me,” she said afterward to CNN.

Klobuchar said that Warren’s Medicare-for-all was a “pipe dream” and she did “not even come close” to answering the question about how she planned to pay for her plan.

“As I’ve said, Bernie [Sanders] has answered that question, he’s made that very clear, and I think that’s one of the things she needs to do,” she said afterward.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who signaled his criticism of Warren’s plan in a campaign ad earlier Tuesday, immediately challenged Warren on her healthcare plan.

However, despite the Democrats’ claim, an overwhelming majority of Americans received a tax cut through the Trump Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Eighty-two percent of American middle-class households received a tax cut and received an average tax cut of $1,260. In Ohio, where CNN is hosting the debate, the average Ohioan received $1,476. Ninety percent of Americans saw an increase in take-home pay. The tax cuts3.3% raise wage growth by 3.3 percent and helped foster historic lows in unemployment.

The Trump tax cuts also doubled the child tax credit and expanded its eligibility, which greatly helps the American working-class family.

Further, the Trump Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also repealed the Obamacare individual mandate, which serves as a giant middle-class tax cut. Eighty percent of those who paid the Obamacare individual mandate fine made less than $50,000, making the mandate’s repeal a significant tax cut."

“Rep. Elijah Cummings was a giant in the House, an unwavering champion for his district and all Americans, and a dear friend. My heart goes out to his wife Maya and his family,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wrote.

“Good people everywhere will miss his rumbling voice, his kind heart, and his deep conviction that every human being has worth,” she continued, adding, “Rest in power, Elijah”:

“Elijah Cummings was a true public servant, his life defined by the love of his community and a fierce commitment to ensuring truth wins over power,” Joe Biden (D) said.

“The whole Biden family sends our condolences to his wife, Maya, his children, and the entire city of Baltimore,” he added in a tweet, alongside a lengthier statement:

TechCrunch reports that Twitter has stated recently that it will restrict how users can interact with tweets from world leaders who break the site’s rules. The site will not allow users to like, reply, share, or retweet any offending tweets from world leaders but will allow them to “quote-tweet” in order to express their opinion about the tweet.

Twitter stated that this decision was made in an effort to help users stay informed about current events while balancing the need to enforce rules on the website. The company stated in a blog post:

Twitter generally removes Tweets that violate our rules. However, we recognize that sometimes it may be in the public interest to allow people to view Tweets that would otherwise be taken down. We consider content to be in the public interest if it directly contributes to understanding or discussion of a matter of public concern. At present, we limit exceptions to one critical type of public-interest content—Tweets from elected and government officials—given the significant public interest in knowing and being able to discuss their actions and statements. As a result, in rare instances, we may choose to leave up a Tweet from an elected or government official that would otherwise be taken down. Instead we will place it behind a notice providing context about the rule violation that allows people to click through to see the Tweet. Placing a Tweet behind this notice also limits the ability to engage with the Tweet through likes, Retweets, or sharing on Twitter, and makes sure the Tweet isn’t algorithmically recommended by Twitter. These actions are meant to limit the Tweet’s reach while maintaining the public’s ability to view and discuss it. Learn more about this notice and other enforcement actions.

The company summarized its decision in a tweet which can be seen below:

We haven’t used this notice yet, but when we do, you will not be able to like, reply, share, or Retweet the Tweet in question. You will still be able to express your opinion with Retweet with Comment. — Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) October 15, 2019

The company added in a tweet: “Our goal is to enforce our rules judiciously and impartially. In doing so, we aim to provide direct insight into our enforcement decision-making, to serve public conversation, and protect the public’s right to hear from their leaders and to hold them to account.”

Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) has called on Twitter to ban President Trump over his tweets regarding the so-called Ukraine “whistleblower” and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA).

Twitter has previously refused to ban the president stating that doing so would not silence him but would instead hamper discussion around his words and actions:

There’s been a lot of discussion about political figures and world leaders on Twitter, and we want to share our stance. Twitter is here to serve and help advance the global, public conversation. Elected world leaders play a critical role in that conversation because of their outsized impact on our society. Blocking a world leader from Twitter or removing their controversial Tweets, would hide important information people should be able to see and debate. It would also not silence that leader, but it would certainly hamper necessary discussion around their words and actions. We review Tweets by leaders within the political context that defines them, and enforce our rules accordingly. No one person’s account drives Twitter’s growth, or influences these decisions. We work hard to remain unbiased with the public interest in mind. We are working to make Twitter the best place to see and freely discuss everything that matters. We believe that’s the best way to help our society make progress.

The segment began when CNN host Anderson Cooper asked Biden about an interview that Hunter Biden gave to ABC on Tuesday where he admitted he “made a mistake and showed poor judgment” by accepting a position on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.

“My son did nothing wrong,” Biden declared. “I did nothing wrong.”

He explained:

“Look, the fact that George Washington on the first time he spoke after being elected, that we had to worry about is foreign interference in our elections, it was the greatest threat to America. This president on three occasions, three occasions, has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections. The fact is that it is outrageous. Rudy Giuliani, the president and his thugs have already proven that they, in fact, are flat lying. What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. He doesn’t want me to be the candidate. He is going after me because he knows if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum.”

In his attempt to recap Biden’s meandering answer, Noah said that he understood what Biden meant but that it “took a while for him to get there.”

“OK, one minute he’s talking about his son, then George Washington, then something about the seventeenth?” the Comedy Central host remarked. “Joe Biden is the only candidate who remixes his speech while he’s giving it.”

After mocking the number of candidates on the debate stage, Noah also described the “weirdest part of the night” as when Kamala Harris (D-CA) “started a real-life Twitter beef” with Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) over Twitter’s refusal to ban Trump from its platform.

“I’ll be honest, I kind of understand Warren’s point here,” he explained. “We need Trump on Twitter. It’s the only way we can monitor what he’s up to. Otherwise, he’s doing that shit in secret. You’ve got to think of Twitter as a presidential baby monitor. The whole time you’re looking, you’re like, ‘Hold on, he’s awake and wants to nuke a hurricane, I gotta go!’”

Gabbard led the field of candidates with just under 40 percent of the vote shortly before midnight. The poll showed Yang in second place with 20 percent of the vote, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg with eight percent of the vote. Buttigieg attempted to target Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) during the debate, particularly for failing to explicitly state whether she would raise taxes on the middle class in order to pay for Medicare for All.

Warren came in fourth place, right behind Buttigieg, with seven percent support, despite having more speaking time (roughly 23 minutes) than any other candidate:

Elizabeth Warren spoke the most during tonight's debate, with 23.1 minutes. Joe Biden, who leads in speaking time across the three previous debates, got 16.6 minutes. The rest of the field follows, with between 7.2 and 13.2 minutes of air-time. https://t.co/f8GyyhyVVn pic.twitter.com/EgzGFqhpHq — The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) October 16, 2019

The Drudge Poll — framed with the simple question “WHO WON THE SIXTH DEM DEBATE” — is not scientific in its methodology and does not prevent multiple votes from respondents. However, as with the 2016 Republican primary, its results often indicate genuine enthusiasm from a candidate’s fan base. Corporate media and establishment pundits mocked then-candidate Donald Trump’s consistent Drudge Poll dominance, but those results ultimately matched the results of the race.

Tuesday’s poll shows many of the candidates separated by less than one percentage point.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MA) came in right behind Warren with 6.45 percent support, followed by Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Tom Steyer, Beto O’Rourke, and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with 6.1 percent, 3.69 percent, 3.33 percent, 2.06 percent, and 1.25 percent, respectively.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who desperately needed a breakout moment, came in second to last with 1.2 percent support. Julián Castro failed to top one percent as of midnight.

College Pulse and Chegg surveyedover 1,500 college students weekly in order to get a finger on the pulse of the presidential preferences of college students across the country. The results, based on Democrat and Democratic-leaning undergraduates, are updated once a week.

Students were asked, “Regardless of who you may support in the upcoming 2020 presidential election, who would you most like to be the Democratic nominee for President?”

The latest update, on October 15, showed Warren leaping to first place with 32 percent to Sanders’ 27 percent. This is significant, as Sanders has dominated as the frontrunner since the tracker’s formal launch in March. On March 26, Warren only had six percent support in the poll compared to Sanders’ 33 percent.

The “gender gap” on the two candidates is hitting an “all-time high,” according to College Pulse. Among female college students, Warren leads 34 percent to 27 percent, while Sanders leads among male college students with 31 percent to Warren’s 21 percent.

No other candidate comes close to Warren or Sanders, with Joe Biden (D) falling to a distant third with just ten percent support among Democrat and Democrat-leaning college students– a long fall from the 22 percent he garnered in March.

Andrew Yang (D) falls closely behind Biden with nine percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), Beto O’Rourke (D), and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), with seven percent, four percent, and three percent, respectively. The margin of error was not immediately available.

Harris’s three percent support marks an “all-time low” for the candidate,” College Pulse assessed.

The poll also found that the majority of college students, 54 percent, have an unfavorable view of Biden. Only 45 percent have a favorable view of the former vice president, whose role in the questionable foreign business dealings of his son has been a topic of controversy in recent weeks.

The vast majority of Democrat and Democrat-leaning college students, 89 percent, have a favorable view of Warren and Sanders, the survey showed."

“As usual Senator Warren is 100% wrong in diagnosing the problem, there absolutely [are] excesses in technology and in some cases having them divest parts of their business is the right move,” conceded Yang.

“But we also have to be realistic that competition doesn’t solve all the problems.”

“It’s not like any of us want to use the fourth-best navigation app… There’s a reason why nobody is using Bing today. Sorry Microsoft, it’s true!”

“It’s not like breaking up these tech companies will revive mainstream businesses around the country.”

“And as the parent of two young children, I’m particularly concerned about screen use and its effect on our children. Studies clearly show that we’re seeing record levels of anxiety and depression coincident with smartphone adoption and social media use.”

“Breaking up the tech companies does nothing to make our kids healthier. What we have to do is we have to hone in on the specific problems we’re trying to solve and use 21st-century solutions for 21st-century problems. Using a 20th-century antitrust framework will not work. We need new solutions and a new toolkit.”

Elizabeth Warren responded to Yang’s remarks, stating “I’m not willing to give up and let a handful of monopolists dominate our economy and our democracy. It’s time to fight back.”

She went on to slam Amazon for its domination of America’s retail market, and the way it crowds out competition from small businesses.

“Think about it this way — when you talk about it this way when you talk about how it works, and competition. About eight percent [to] nine percent of retail sales in bricks and sticks stores happen at Walmart. About 49 percent of all sales online happen in one place — that’s Amazon. It collects information from every little business. And then Amazon does something else — it runs the platform, gets all the information, and then goes into competition with those little businesses.”

“You get to be the umpire in the baseball or you get to be a team, but you don’t get to do both at the same time. We need to enforce our antitrust laws, break up these giant companies that are dominating big tech, big pharma, big oil — all of them.”

Whereas Tulsi Gabbard has been consistent on the question of censorship, criticizing big tech companies for “throwing free speech out the window,” Warren has flip-flopped on the issue. She condemned Facebook for its power to “shut down debate” after it removed an ad for her campaign in March this year, but a few months later called for tech companies to censor criticism of Kamala Harris.

Some 2020 Democrats have embraced the move to automatically specify preferred pronouns. During CNN’s Equality Town Hall this month, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) walked onto the stage and announced her preferred pronouns as “she, her, and hers.”

CNN’s Chris Cuomo issued an awkward response, which ultimately triggered backlash.

“‘She,’ ‘her,’ and ‘hers’? Mine, too,” he said, later apologizing for the remark:

PLEASE READ: When Sen. Harris said her pronouns were she her and her's, I said mine too. I should not have. I apologize. I am an ally of the LGBTQ community, and I am sorry because I am committed to helping us achieve equality. Thank you for watching our townhall. — Christopher C. Cuomo (@ChrisCuomo) October 11, 2019

Like Harris, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has publicly specified her preferred pronouns, listing “She/her” on her Twitter bio:

Preferred pronouns have become a topic of interest among far-left millennials and social justice warriors, particularly. Those who identify as part of the ultra-progressive group argue that gender is a social construct and should be viewed as a spectrum, hence the varying genders and accompanying pronouns. Preferred pronouns can range from the traditional “his” or “hers” to lesser-known terms such as “xem,” “hirself,” “xyrs,” or “zir.”"

Despite being the leading issue among all American voters, according to Harvard/Harris polling, CNN anchors and a New York Times reporter ignored the immigration issue that motivated millions of voters in the 2016 presidential election.

Instead, debate moderators focused largely on impeachment, gun control, health care, and abortion.

Various 2020 Democrats have vowed to implement the most open borders agenda in the history of the country with candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) promising to decriminalize illegal immigration and the majority endorsing a plan to force American taxpayers to provide free health care to all illegal aliens.

The lack of questions on immigration to 2020 Democrats comes as swing voters are increasingly turned off by the candidates’ plans to bring millions of more foreign workers to the U.S.

The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds that the 2020 Democrats’ health care for illegal aliens plan is the most unpopular policy position thus far in the race for president, with opposition from 62 percent of all likely voters.

Polling from Harvard/Harris reveals among all U.S. voters, and particularly with swing voters, that presidential candidates campaigning for immigration, illegal and legal, is the most unpopular policy position.

CNN and the New York Times opened the debate with a discussion on the partisan-based impeachment inquiry.

“Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support,” Anderson Cooper, one of the debate’s moderators, said.

“Sen. Warren, I want to start with you,” Cooper continued.

“You have said that there’s already enough evidence for President Trump to be impeached and removed from office. But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate?” he asked.

The Massachusetts senator said impeachment is necessary because the president broke the law “over and over.” She said she initially made the determination after reading the Mueller report and falsely claimed that Mueller had shown “that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly,” despite the fact that Mueller made no such determination.

Attorney General William Barr determined that Trump did not obstruct justice, explaining that the evidence was “not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense.”

“Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences,” Warren said, adding that impeachment is about Trump as well as “the next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country.”

“The impeachment must go forward,” she proclaimed.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) concurred, repeating the false claim that Trump obstructed justice and calling him the “most corrupt president in the history of this country.”

“I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment because of the emoluments clause. This is a president who is enriching himself while using the Oval Office to do that, and that is outrageous,” he said, adding that he looks forward to a “speedy and expeditious impeachment process.”

“Mitch McConnell has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate,” he added.

While there are varying degrees of support, all of Warren and Sanders’ colleagues signaled support for the Democrat-led impeachment efforts.

Here are their most significant lines on impeachment:

Joe Biden (D):

I said from the beginning that if, in fact, Trump continued to stonewall what the Congress is entitled to know about his background, what he did, all the accusations in the Mueller report, if they did that, they would have no choice — no choice — but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information. This president — and I agree with Bernie, Sen. Sanders — is the most corrupt president in modern history and I think all of our history. And the fact is that this president of the United States has gone so far as to say, since this latest event, that, in fact, he will not cooperate in any way at all, will not list any witnesses, will not provide any information, will not do anything to cooperate with the impeachment. They have no choice but to move.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA):

But the reality of it is that I don’t really think this impeachment process is going to take very long, because as a former prosecutor, I know a confession when I see it. And he did it in plain sight. He has given us the evidence. And he tried to cover it up, putting it in that special server. And there’s been a clear consciousness of guilt. This will not take very long. Donald Trump needs to be held accountable. He is, indeed, the most corrupt and unpatriotic president we have ever had.

Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ):

Anybody who has criticisms about a process that is making all the facts bare before the American public, that works to build consensus, that’s what this nation needs, in what is a moral moment and not a political one. So I swore an oath to do my job as a senator, do my duty. This president has violated his. I will do mine.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN):

We can do two things at once. That’s our job. We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment, but we also can stand up for America, because this president has not been putting America in front of his own personal interests.

Julián Castro (D):

Not only that, what we have to recognize is that not only did the Mueller report point out ten different instances where the president obstructed justice or tried to, and he made that call to President Zelensky of the Ukraine, but he is in ongoingly — in an ongoing way violating his oath of office and abusing his power. We have to impeach this president. And the majority of Americans not only support impeachment, they support removal. He should be removed.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D):

Look, the president has left the Congress with no choice. And this is not just about holding the president accountable, for not just the things emerging in these investigations, but actions that he has confessed to on television. It’s also about the presidency itself, because a president ten years or 100 years from now will look back at this moment and draw the conclusion either that no one is above the law or that a president can get away with anything.

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI):

The serious issues that have been raised around this phone call that he had with the president of Ukraine and many other things that transpired around that are what caused me to support the inquiry in the House. And I think that it should continue to play its course out, to gather all the information, provide that to the American people, recognizing that that is the only way forward. If the House votes to impeach, the Senate does not vote to remove Donald Trump, he walks out and he feels exonerated, further deepening the divides in this country that we cannot afford.

Tom Steyer (D):

Two years ago, I started the Need to Impeach movement, because I knew there was something desperately wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, that we did have the most corrupt president in the country, and that only the voice and the will of the American people would drag Washington to see it as a matter of right and wrong, not of political expediency. So, in fact, impeaching and removing this president is something that the American people are demanding. They’re the voice that counts, and that’s who I went to, the American people.

Andrew Yang (D):

I support impeachment, but we shouldn’t have any illusions that impeaching Donald Trump will, one, be successful or, two, erase the problems that got him elected in 2016.

Beto O’Rourke (D):

And we have a responsibility to be fearless in the face of this president’s criminality and his lawlessness. The fact that as a candidate for the highest office in the land, he invited the participation, the invasion of a foreign power in our democracy. As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the FBI, tried to fire Mueller, head of the investigation, then invited President Zelensky to involve himself in our politics, as well as China, in exchange for favorable trade terms in an upcoming trade deal.

Trump reacted to the Democrat debate on Wednesday, writing, “You would think there is NO WAY that any of the Democrat Candidates that we witnessed last night could possibly become President of the United States.”

“Now you see why they have no choice but to push a totally illegal & absurd Impeachment of one of the most successful Presidents!” he exclaimed:

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced on Tuesday that the House will hold off on a House-wide vote on the impeachment inquiry.

“There’s no requirement that we have a vote, and at this time, we will not have a vote,” Pelosi said at a press conference on Tuesday.

“We’re not here to call bluffs. We’re here to find the truth, to uphold the Constitution of the United States,” she added. “This is not a game for us, this is deadly serious.”"

Rapinoe, an out and proud lesbian, raised eyebrows during the 2019 Women’s World Cup games by turning the tournament into her personal political platform to attack President Trump and the United States.

The BBC celebrated the two-time World Cup winner and co-captain of the U.S. Women’s National Team, and 2019 Best FIFA Women’s Player, for being an “advocate for equality in soccer, taking legal action against the US Soccer Federation over equal pay, calling out racism by fans and has become the face of LGBTQ rights in the game.”

“If everybody was as outraged about racism as those who suffer it, if everybody was as outraged about homophobia as LGBTQ players, if everybody was as outraged about the lack of equal pay as women, that would be the most inspiring thing for the future to me,” Rapinoe told the BBC.

Rapinoe joined Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and teen-aged climate alarmist Greta Thunberg on this year’s list.

Thirteen of the 100 women on the list are athletes, including Bangladeshi Cricketer Jasmin Akter, Iranian athlete Kimia Alizadeh, British athletes Dina Asher-Smith, Bethany Firth, and Jawahir Roble, Nigerian Salwa Eid Naser, Jamaican Shelly-Ann Fraiser-Pryce, Australian Tayla Harris, China’s Huang Wensi, German cyclist Fiona Kolbinger, Japanese sumo wrestler Hiyori Kon, and Egypt’s Farida Osman.

Also of note, the BBC included trans woman Nisha Ayub, who was placed in a male prison at age 21 for breaking Malaysia’s sharia law prohibiting a man from wearing women’s clothing in public.

Little clarity could be found on the subject during Tuesday night’s Democrat presidential debate , during which the candidates energetically criticized President Donald Trump, but grew vague and evasive when asked to describe the situation in Syria or explain how they would handle it.

Former Vice President Joe Biden boasted about how much time he spent in the White House on foreign policy and Syria for a while, then seemingly threatened to declare war on Turkey, something neither he nor any other Democrat would actually do if they became president:

I would not have withdrawn the troops and I would not have withdrawn the additional thousand troops who are in Iraq, which are in retreat now, being fired on by Assad’s people. And the president of the United States saying, if those ISIS folks escape from the prisons they’re in, they’ll only go to Europe and won’t affect us. It has been the most shameful thing that any president has done in modern history — excuse me, in terms of foreign policy. And the fact of the matter is, I’ve never seen a time — and I’ve spent thousands of hours in the Situation Room, I’ve spent many hours on the ground in those very places, in Syria and in Iraq, and guess what? Our commanders across the board, former and present, are ashamed of what’s happening here. What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where he’s going to have a problem — because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real lockdown conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he’s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done now. Pay that price.

Note that there is no evidence of the Syrian army firing at American troops, but Biden might have been confusing Syrian with Turkish forces, which have reportedly fired uncomfortably close to American positions in Iraq.

A real journalist would have pointed out to Biden that some of the Syrian groups his administration told us were reliable “white hat” military allies have joined the Turks to attack the Kurds and asked how he failed to discern the true nature of those groups during the “thousands of hours” he boasted of spending in the White House Situation Room, but fortunately for Biden, CNN does not employ anyone who would ask a question like that of a Democrat.

The only candidate who did not try to stuff herself into a war hawk costume at the debate was Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), who got to speak next, and challenged both Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Mayor Pete Buttigieg on their positions.

Gabbard has her own issues when it comes to Syria — which she attempted to deal with by denying that she has been a “Russian asset” or “Assad apologist” — and she professed to have qualms about President Trump’s sudden pullout from the Turkish border region, but she described the Turkish attack on the Kurds as “yet another negative consequence of the regime change war we’ve been waging in Syria,” a war the media was “championing and cheerleading” throughout the Obama administration.

Gabbard said she would take two steps on Syria: ending sanctions against the Assad regime “that are really a modern-day siege, the likes of which we are seeing Saudi Arabia wage against Yemen, that have caused tens of thousands of Syrian civilians to die and to starve,” and ending U.S. support for Syrian rebel forces, some of which are linked to terrorist groups like al-Qaeda. Neither of those steps would ameliorate Turkey’s concerns in any way or persuade it to halt its invasion of Syria.

Gabbard taunted Warren about living up to the anti-war stance she took so ostentatiously during the second Bush administration. Warren, boxed into a corner, had nothing meaningful to say beyond vague platitudes about getting out of the Middle East “the smart way” and complaints about Trump helping ISIS “get another foothold, a new lease on life.”

“I sit on the Armed Services Committee. I talk with our military leaders about this. I was in Iraq and went through the neighborhoods that ISIS destroyed. We need to get out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no military solution in this region,” Warren said.

Turkey certainly seems to think there is a “military solution” to its security concerns, having worked for years to obtain a “negotiated solution” without satisfactory results. Russia and Iran somehow found a “military solution” to the Syrian civil war.

CNN moved very quickly along to Buttigieg, who was allowed to simultaneously claim he opposes “endless wars” but also call for an endless American presence in the worst quagmire on the planet.

Buttigieg, a military veteran, abandoned years of Democrat Party dogma about Afghanistan being the “good war” to argue that Syria is the only place American troops should be stationed.

“Look, I didn’t think we should have gone to Iraq in the first place. I think we need to get out of Afghanistan. But it’s also the case that a small number of specialized, special operations forces and intelligence capabilities were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and what we’re seeing now, which is the beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS,” he said.

Buttigieg claimed pulling out of Syria would be “taking away what makes America America” and would make “the world a more dangerous place,” which oddly enough is exactly the opposite of what Democrats said when they urged a pullout from Iraq. They used to get very angry at people who implied their criticism of the Iraq deployment would be “taking away what makes America America.” They routinely portrayed American soldiers in Iraq as helpless victims of the insurgency whose lives were being squandered.

Gabbard jumped in and called Buttigieg out on his claim to oppose endless wars while “continuing to support having U.S. troops in Syria for an indefinite period of time to continue this regime change war,” a policy that involves “providing arms in support to terrorist groups in Syria, like al-Qaeda, HTS, al-Nusra and others.”

Buttigieg never answered her question. Instead, he claimed he would not be able to look Afghan civilians or soldiers in the eye after Trump’s pullout from Syria, which is funny because not three minutes earlier he said he wanted to pull out from Afghanistan.

Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) refused to say whether he would support kicking Turkey out of NATO but insisted Turkey should no longer be seen as a U.S. ally “when they invade another country and engage in mass slaughter.” Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) evaded the same question about NATO membership, condemning Turkey’s actions as “outrageous” and a “horror” but advising continued engagement and negotiations with Turkey.

Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) said Trump endangered U.S. national security by “basically giving 10,000 ISIS fighters a get-out-of-jail-free card” and making the Islamic State one of the “big winners” in Syria, in addition to Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime. It appears to have escaped her notice that the latter three were already the “big winners” in Syria before Trump’s election, even though she boasted of sitting on the Senate Intelligence Committee, where such things are presumably discussed.

Biden came back to wrap up the Syria section of the debate with a characteristically disjointed rant about how Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan “understands if he’s out of NATO, he’s in real trouble,” but also efforts to break up NATO are the demonic work of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“And with regard to regime change in Syria, that has not been the policy we change the regime. It has been to make sure that the regime did not wipe out hundreds of thousands of innocent people between there and the Iraqi border,” Biden insisted, forgetting that President Obama explicitly stated Assad had to go, and a very large number of innocent people were indeed “wiped out” or driven out of Syria on his and Obama’s watch.

Biden’s rambling closer typifies the problem the Democrats face on Syria: All of them, with the exception of no-hope candidate Tulsi Gabbard, want to virtue-signal as loud as they can and slam President Trump as hard as possible, but none of them wants to discuss the details of what has been happening in Syria since 2011 or propose a cogent strategy for changing conditions on the ground in a meaningful way. None of them talked about an “exit strategy,” a phrase they were very big on during the Iraq operation.

None of the Democrats wanted to discuss Turkey’s claims of a severe security threat from northeastern Syria, discuss why the international community did nothing to address those claims, or explain why the United States was held solely responsible for preventing Turkey from taking action. They treated the notion of Russian and Syrian involvement against the Turkish assault as inherently outrageous without explaining why the Syrian government should not be held responsible for protecting its own citizens and securing its own borders. They complained about escaping ISIS prisoners without discussing why thousands of them were still parked in Kurdish prison camps and how long they should be left there.

None of the Democrats was asked to present a war plan for fighting Turkey or discuss how much the U.S. depends on Turkish bases for operations in the Middle East. None of them, not even Biden, was pressed on how the Obama administration set the table for current events. None of them acknowledged the difficulty of getting reliable information from any party involved in the savage Syrian civil war, although Gabbard came close when she pointed out how dodgy some of the groups supported by the Obama administration were.

And of course, CNN would not dream of asking the Democrat candidates — several of whom are sitting senators — why their caucus did not authorize military force against Turkey to protect the Kurds, instead spending all of its time on an impeachment crusade against President Trump. Trump said he wanted to pull troops out of Syria almost a year ago, and Erdogan was threatening to invade long before that. The Democrats had plenty of time to pass the appropriate congressional resolutions and send a strong message to Turkey, but that would have involved putting real political capital on the line instead of sniping from the sidelines."

So the story from Biden goes, gangster “Corn Pop” represented a serious threat to Biden when he was a lifeguard at a community pool. Corn Pop, who actually was real, supposedly carried a straight razor and after an altercation with young lifeguard Biden threatened to meet him in the parking lot later—so young Biden claims he threatened to wrap a chain around Corn Pop’s head.

The whole blowup was over Biden allegedly calling Corn Pop “Esther,” a derisive insult drawn from the swimmer Esther Williams that apparently was akin to calling the gangster a girl. But before things devolved into a razor-versus-chain race war in the parking lot later, Biden says he apologized to Corn Pop for the insult, which defused the situation—and the incident has become part of Biden’s political folklore storyline of being a grand negotiator who can calmly lead in tense political situations, especially those involving race.

Though it seems an incredible story, Biden included it in his 2007 autobiography and it was a central part of a dedication ceremony at a Delaware public pool at which Biden spoke in 2017. The NAACP even confirmed the details of Corn Pop and his existence for those questioning it.

So when moderator Anderson Cooper at the end of the CNN-New York Times debate on Tuesday night closed down the debate with a question about a unique and different friendship that has shaped their lives, one would have thought the moderators were teeing Biden up for a perfect Corn Pop moment.

Cooper said:

Last week, Ellen DeGeneres was criticized after she and former President George W. Bush were seen laughing together at a football game. Ellen defended their friendship, saying, we’re all different and I think that we’ve forgotten that that’s OK that we’re all different. So in that spirit, we’d like you to tell us about a friendship that you’ve had that would surprise us and what impact it’s had on you and your beliefs.

Cooper went to all 11 other candidates before getting to Biden, who closed it down at the end, giving Biden plenty of time to think about what he was going to say.

Instead of telling the story of Corn Pop, Biden opted for a more conventional and boring answer, and one already used by several of the other candidates: He talked about his friendship with the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ):

This is reassuring in the fact that we’re all acknowledging that we have to reach across the aisle, get things done. No other way to get anything done in this country. The two people maybe would surprise you the most were — he’s been mentioned twice, but John McCain. John McCain worked for me when he worked in the Navy, and he was — he was my assigned to me to travel around the world. We became close friends. He became very close friends with my wife, Jill. Visited our home. He was there with his children. And on his death bed, he asked me to do his eulogy. John, I would say to John, ‘John, you didn’t see a war you never wanted to fight.’ And he’d say, ‘You didn’t see a problem you never wanted to solve.’ But he was a great man of principle. He was honorable. He was honorable.

Biden finished with typical talking points from his stump speech about why he’s running for president—nothing remarkable, nothing outstanding, and nothing memorable.

Some pundits and observers on Twitter laughed about Biden leaving Corn Pop hanging in favor of the safer McCain story, mocking Biden for being unable to read the room.

Harris: Rand

Bernie: McCain

Missed opportunity to invoke Corn Pop — Ellen McGirt (@ellmcgirt) October 16, 2019

While this is more of a lighthearted ribbing of Biden, in an unserious and comedic manner—Corn Pop probably was not the right story anyway for the question—it does illustrate a larger problem with the sliding campaign of the former Vice President.

He again had no major memorable positive moments on a crowded debate stage for the fourth month in a row. Donald Trump, Jr., President Donald Trump’s eldest son, mocked Biden’s lackluster performance in a tweet by noting that, at least this time in the Ohio debate, Biden’s teeth didn’t nearly fall out—as they almost did in the previous debate.

On the bright side, at least Joe’s teeth didn’t fall out this time! — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 16, 2019

It seems cruel, but Biden’s teeth did slip and nearly fall out of his mouth in a previous debate, and in a forum his eye exploded, bleeding on live television. Another candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), suffered a heart attack less than two weeks before this debate, pushing health questions–like whether any of these Democrats are actually healthy enough to run for and serve as president–to the forefront of Americans’ minds heading into Tuesday night. Moderators even asked several of the candidates about these concerns in Ohio’s debate.

This all comes as it has been revealed by just-released Federal Election Commission (FEC) campaign finance reports that Biden’s campaign spent more than he raised in funds last quarter, and he keeps slipping in polls behind rivals Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and now lags in the fundraising race as well.

The bigger story that broke during the debate news cycle in its immediate aftermath is Biden spent nearly $2 million more than he raised last quarter—he raised $15.7 million and spent $17.6 million—while he had less than $9 million cash on hand at the end of September. That puts him at less than Sanders’ $33.7 million, less than Warren’s $25.7 million, less than Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s $23.4 million, and even less than the $10.5 million that the flaming-out Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) had.

At a burn rate like Biden’s running, with not much gas in the tank, the former Vice President could be in some serious trouble in attempting to remain near the front of the pack. He’s already lost his frontrunner status, as Warren has pulled ahead of him in most national polling and in almost every early and battleground state except in the South. CNN’s Chris Cillizza called Biden’s funding lapses a “bombshell” revelation multiple times in a post about the matter, writing that it represents a “SIREN” for Biden’s campaign.

Factor that together with burgeoning attacks on his son Hunter Biden’s business dealings from the White House and President Donald Trump, as well as a media beginning to be receptive to the criticisms, and Joe Biden has a tougher-than-ever road ahead. Hunter Biden’s interview earlier on Tuesday on ABC did his father no favors by most accounts, and even CNN and JournoList founder Ezra Klein of Vox are now saying there is something to all the questions swirling around him and that Democrats need to be prepared to deal with this.

CNN published a fact check after the debate contrasting Biden’s claims he never discussed Hunter’s business dealings with his son with Hunter’s claims he did discuss them with his father.

Klein, meanwhile, laid out in a Vox article how Democrats are woefully unprepared on the Hunter Biden issue should Joe Biden win the nomination, urging Democrats to learn how to talk about it, even if they don’t want to discuss the problems. Klein wrote:

A few things are true about the Hunter Biden story. One is that there’s no evidence Joe Biden did what Donald Trump has accused him of doing: pressuring Ukraine to fire a prosecutor to protect his son from investigation. But another is that Hunter Biden poses real problems for Joe Biden’s campaign, and if Democrats pretend otherwise, they’re making a mistake. Many Democrats consider raising the Hunter Biden question unfair to Joe Biden. Why should he have to answer for the legal actions of his adult son? But no one said politics was fair. And if Democrats avoid the issue, they can be certain Trump will not. Biden’s vulnerability here needs to be tested in the primary, when Democrats have other choices, rather than in the general, when they won’t.

The debate moderators and other candidates barely touched on Hunter Biden during the debate, and only to brush it aside as a non-concern. But Hunter Biden is hardly the only of Joe Biden’s problems after the debate on Tuesday.

There was a particularly memorable moment where, towards the end of the night, both Sanders and Warren extracted a pound of flesh from Biden from the left—significantly undermining his standing with Democrats.

Cooper asked Biden to respond to the broad visions of big, bold change that Warren and Sanders respectively have been laying out:

Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change. Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution. Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump?

Biden replied with a claim he is the only one who has gotten anything substantive actually “done” in Washington:

Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people, and I think a lot of what they have to say is really important. But, you know, Senator Warren said we can’t be running any vague campaigns. We’ve got to level with people. We’ve got to level with people and tell them exactly what we’re going to do, how we’re going to get it done, and if you can get it done. I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I’m the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done, from the Violence Against Women Act to making sure that we pass the Affordable Care Act to being in a position where we, in fact, took almost a $90 billion act that kept us from going into a depression, making us — putting us in a position where I was able to end roe — excuse me, able to end the issue of gun sales in terms of assault weapons. And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who is going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I’m not suggesting they can’t, but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it’s going to cost, how you’re going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade.

After a follow-up question from Cooper asking Biden to further specify exactly whom he said was being “vague,” he took a not-so-veiled shot at the Medicare-for-All vision put forward by Warren and Sanders.

Biden said:

Well, the senator said — she’s being vague on the issue of — actually, both are being vague on the issue of Medicare for all. No, look, here’s the deal. Come on. It costs $30 trillion. Guess what? That’s over $3 trillion — it’s more than the entire federal budget… If you eliminated the entire Pentagon, every single thing, plane, ship, troop, the buildings, everything, satellites, it would get you — it would pay for a total of four months. Four months. Where do you get the rest? Where does it come from?

That opened Sanders up to decimate Biden for “working with Republicans” to back endless wars in the Middle East and trade policies that hurt America’s working class:

Joe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done. But you know what you also got done? And I say this as a good friend. You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country. You got trade agreements, like NAFTA and PNTR, with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs. Now, let’s get to Medicare for all. Let’s be honest. We spend twice as much per person as do the people of any other major country on Earth. And the answer is, if we have the guts that I would like to see the Democratic Party have that guts, to stand up to the drug companies and the insurance companies and tell them that the function of health care is to guarantee care to all people, not to make $100 billion in profit.

After back-and-forth between Biden and Sanders in response to Sanders’ smack-down, Warren delivered another brutal blow to Biden. Warren’s reply focused on the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, with which she was intricately involved and for which she receives enormous credit among Democrats:

So you started this question with how you got something done. You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, don’t even try, because you will never get it passed. And sure enough, the big banks fought us. The Republicans fought us. Some of the Democrats fought us. But we got that agency passed into law. It has now forced big banks to return more than $12 billion directly to people they cheated. I served in the Obama administration. I know what we can do by executive authority, and I will use it. In Congress, on the first day, I will pass my anti-corruption bill, which will beat back the influence of money and repeal the filibuster. And the third, we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight for the things that touch people’s lives.

Buttigieg, who had sparred all night with Warren, seemed to sense what was coming next for Biden and attempted to interrupt to spare the former vice president any more pain from the socialists on either side of him. But Biden didn’t take the life raft from South Bend’s mayor, opting instead to further engage with Warren on the 2008 financial crisis. Biden, after fighting the moderators to respond to Warren, attempted to take credit for whipping U.S. Senate votes for the legislation that created the CFPB.

“I agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes,” Biden said. “I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let’s get those things straight, too.”

Big mistake for Biden, as evidenced by the leftists on Twitter ripping him for “yelling” at Warren, lecturing the former college professor on her subject of expertise and claiming she couldn’t have done it without his work whipping votes for her project.

I know I'm supposed to be commenting on this debate but honestly I blacked out when Joe Biden interrupted Elizabeth Warren to demand credit for the agency THAT SHE CREATED so I've pretty much missed the last 15 mins — Draculeah Greenberg (@Leahgreenb) October 16, 2019

The fight over the CFPB was my daily beat for basically a year. I don't remember Joe Biden being involved whatsoever. His adviser Jared Bernstein was a strong supporter but Biden was 100% AWOL. It was well known he and Warren clashed, so it made sense he stayed out. #DemDebate — Ryan Grim (@ryangrim) October 16, 2019

The fact that Biden yelled at Warren, “I got you the votes!” speaks to everything we know about peak white male fragility. #DemDebate — Preston Mitchum (@PrestonMitchum) October 16, 2019

That set Warren up for the line of the night, when Cooper gave the spotlight back to her to reply to Biden.

“I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law,” Warren said.

Holy crap, Elizabeth Warren responds with Joe Biden snapping at her about his role in getting votes for the CFPB by thanking Obama. Whoosh.#DemocraticDebatepic.twitter.com/dAOtNuLvAL — Erick Fernandez (@ErickFernandez) October 16, 2019

Warren thanking former President Barack Obama, but not Biden, was brutal to Biden. Obama has not endorsed his former vice president in the 2020 Democrat presidential primary, deliberately not supporting his one-time wingman. That void for Biden and lack of support from the Democrats’ most popular star, the former president—despite Biden’s best efforts to closely associate himself with Obama at every turn—cuts like a dagger into his support.

It raises all sorts of questions among Democrats, including most importantly about Biden’s electability, about why they should vote for Biden if Obama won’t even endorse and campaign with him. Making matters worse for Biden is that, the morning after this debate, Obama turned around and endorsed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s re-election north of the border—but still refuses to back his own former right-hand guy.

I was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as President. He's a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term. — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) October 16, 2019

“You did a hell of a job in your job,” Biden interrupted Warren’s answer.

“Thank you,” Warren coolly replied to laughter from the audience. She continued:

But understand this. It was a dream big, fight hard. People told me, go for something little, go for something small, go for something that the big corporations will be able to accept. I said, no, let’s go for an agency that will make structural change in our economy.

“And President Obama said, I will fight for that, and he sometimes had to fight against people in his own administration,” Warren continued before Biden interrupted her again.

“Not me!” Biden protested, as Warren refused to credit him with any involvement in the response to the financial crisis.

Warren kept plowing through her answer, ignoring Biden’s protests.

“We have to be willing to make good, big, structural change,” she said.

By Wednesday, Biden seems to have realized just how bad Tuesday’s debate was for his campaign, as before he even left Ohio he was out ripping Sanders and Warren to anyone in the press who would listen, accusing them of “playing Trump’s game and trying to con the American people.”

He ripped Sanders and Warren for not being able to explain how they would pay for their mass increases in government benefits and claimed both were disingenuous.

Meanwhile, the establishment media keeps playing up Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) as candidates they say had big nights, as Democrats desperately look for someone to be able to effectively counter Warren’s and Sanders’ socialist vision—all while establishment-favorite blasts from the past like former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the 2016 Democrat nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton are discussed as potential Democrat saviors from the leftist socialist abyss."

South Korean officials seized the dark web server which contained about eight terabytes of child porn content.

“Children around the world are safer because of the actions taken by U.S. and foreign law enforcement to prosecute this case and recover funds for victims,” U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jessie K. Liu said in a written statement. “We will continue to pursue such criminals on and off the darknet in the United States and abroad, to ensure they receive the punishment their terrible crimes deserve.”

In March, South Korean officials seized the server which housed the Welcome to Video website. They also arrested Jong Woo Son, 23, a South Korean national who allegedly operated the website. Following the arrest and seizure, officials carried out an investigation that led to Wednesday’s announcement of a nine-count indictment against Jong and 337 other site users.

Investigators traced Bitcoin transactions and server logs to track down users from Alabama, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington State, and Washington, D.C. They also found users of the child porn service in the United Kingdom, South Korea, Germany, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the Czech Republic, Canada, Ireland, Spain, Brazil, and Australia

“Darknet sites that profit from the sexual exploitation of children are among the most vile and reprehensible forms of criminal behavior,” said Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “This Administration will not allow child predators to use lawless online spaces as a shield. Today’s takedown demonstrates that the Department of Justice remains firmly committed to working closely with our partners in South Korea and around the world to rescue child victims and bring to justice the perpetrators of these abhorrent crimes.”

The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) analyzed the images and videos stored on the server and found more than 250,000 unique videos. The organization reported that 45 percent of the video images were new to investigators and had never been documented before. The site boasted in its DearkNet marketing more than 1,000,000 downloads of its child porn content. Investigators believe the website had the capacity to handle more than one million users.

Our entire justice system will stop at nothing to prevent these heinous crimes, safeguard our children, and bring justice to all.”"

Joe Biden (D) has been under fire in recent days after it was reported that his campaign dropped short of $1 million – $924,000 – on private jet usage in the third quarter (July 1 – September 30) alone. The expenses were attributed to the EJCR, LLC Dba Advanced Aviation Team, recent Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings show.

While Biden leads the pack, he is not alone in his exorbitant private air travel expenditures. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) reportedly spent just short of $500,000 – $479,000 – on private air travel. That is a $179,000 increase from his private air travel expenses in the previous quarter, according to the Hill.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) also put her climate change-related concerns aside, spending $253,000– $236,000 more than the $17,000 she spent in the previous three months.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) – who once described climate change as the “greatest threat to our national security” – spent $360,000 on private air travel in the third quarter. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) – who described climate change as an “existential crisis that threatens all of us” – also utilized private air travel, spending $132,000 in the third quarter. However, a campaign aide told the Hill that Warren makes an effort to offset her carbon output and gave $10,150 to Native Energy in the third quarter.

An outline of the Democrat-backed Green New Deal, released this year, lamented the existence of cows and air travel but admitted that neither could be totally eliminated.

The outline stated:

We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast, but we think we can ramp up renewable manufacturing and power production, retrofit every building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul transportation and agriculture, plant lots of trees and restore our ecosystem to get to net-zero.

The excessive air travel of the candidates calls their authenticity into question.

Warren has called climate change an “existential crisis that threatens all of us” and called for “bold action now to stop it before it’s too late”:

Climate change is an existential crisis that threatens all of us—and we need to take bold action now to stop it before it's too late. That's why we need to have a #ClimateDebate. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) August 24, 2019

Biden – who spent nearly $1 million on private jet usage in a three-month span – warned that it is going to take “leadership” to combat the “climate crisis”:

It’s critical to have a plan to combat climate change, but it’s going to take more than plans — it’s going to take leadership. I have the experience and relationships necessary to rally the world to meet the urgency of this climate crisis. #ClimateTownHall pic.twitter.com/aXvhwUDHMq — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 5, 2019

Harris has called climate change an “imminent threat to our planet,” while Buttigieg warned that the threat “isn’t theoretical”:

Climate change isn't theoretical. Parts of California are on fire, in Florida they're talking about sea level rise.

Sanders, who unveiled a $16 trillion climate change proposal in August, called President Trump an “idiot” for not taking climate change seriously:

Donald Trump believes climate change is a hoax. Donald Trump is an idiot. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) August 10, 2019

Nevertheless, critics argue that Democrats are demonstrating that they are not taking the matter seriously, as their actions do not always coincide with their rhetoric.

For instance, Democrats came under fire last month after attending the Polk County Democrats Steak Fry, which featured thousands of steaks. While climate change alarmists argue that red meat consumption is contributing to the “crisis,” several Democrat candidates happily assisted in grilling the juicy cuts of meat, despite some of the presidential hopefuls previously floating limiting beef consumption in order to curb the looming threat:

Mike Lee’s green card giveaway plan to reward multinational tech corporations after years of them importing foreign visa workers to take American jobs.

On Thursday, Lee failed for the fourth time to get his legislation, S. 386, passed out of the Senate. The legislation, sponsored by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), would allow Indian nationals to effectively monopolize the U.S. green card system for at least ten years and reward tech corporations like Google, Oracle, and Microsoft — all of which are donors to Lee.

Cook said in a post online:

Immigrants make this country stronger and our economy more dynamic. As a first step toward needed comprehensive reform, I urge the Senate to move quickly to pass the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act. The contributions of these workers are critical to America’s future.

The contributions of these workers are critical to America’s future. — Tim Cook (@tim_cook) October 17, 2019

Lee’s S. 386 will ensure outsourcing firms such as Cognizant and Infosys, as well as giant tech conglomerates like Amazon and Facebook, have a green card system wherein only foreign workers on H-1B visas are able to obtain employment green cards by creating a backlog of seven to eight years for all foreign nationals.

This process would solidify that employment-based green cards only go to temporary foreign visa workers who have been imported to the U.S. by corporations to replace American workers, thus rewarding the employers of H-1B foreign workers.

While about 25 percent of all employment-based green cards currently are rewarded to Indian nationals today, should Lee’s legislation pass, Indian nationals will obtain more than 90 percent of all the employment-based green cards for at least a decade.

As Breitbart News has detailed, tech corporations like Google, Microsoft, Oracle, and Hewlett-Packard have lobbied Republican and Democrat Senators for the last few months to get Lee’s S. 386 passed.

At the same time, Microsoft has been Lee’s largest tech donor for the last five election cycles, dishing out nearly $130,000 to him since 2015. More than $97,000 of those funds went directly to Lee, while another $30,000 went to PAC aligned with Lee.

Likewise, Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc. has donated $55,900 to Lee since 2015, while the Oracle Corporation has donated $44,200.

Others bankrolling Lee’s S. 386 are the outsourcing lobby, like Cognizant and the IBM Corporation. Cognizant and IBM have a total of seven lobbyists pushing the legislation. IBM and Cognizant are set to gain hugely from S. 386, as they are two of the largest outsourcers of American jobs in the nation.

This year, alone, Cognizant sought to outsource more than 13,000 U.S. jobs to H-1B foreign visa workers. IBM — headed by Ginni Rometty, who takes in a salary of $16.45 million a year — attempted to outsource nearly 8,500 U.S. jobs to H-1B foreign visa workers.

The comment appears to be directed at Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard , who has been accused of being cozy with Russia in the past.

""I'm not making any predictions, but I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,"" Clinton said, speaking on a podcast with former Obama adviser David Plouffe. ""She's the favorite of the Russians.""

Clinton never names Gabbard, but there are only five women running for President -- Gabbard, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and author Marianne Williamson -- and none of the other woman have been accused of being boosted by Russia.

Clinton did not provide proof about how Russia is ""grooming"" Gabbard. She and her team pointed to allegations that Russian news and propaganda sites often report on Gabbard's campaign and that moments in Gabbard's campaign have been reportedly amplified by trolls and bots on Twitter with ties to Russia. Gabbard has denied those allegations.

""They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far,"" Clinton said.

Clinton's team also noted that some of Gabbard's foreign policy views align closely with Russian interests.

Gabbard responded on Twitter Friday afternoon to Clinton's comments.

""Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain,"" she tweeted.

""From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a concerted campaign to destroy my reputation,"" she added. ""We wondered who was behind it and why. Now we know — it was always you, through your proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose.""

""It's now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don't cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly.""

Responding to Gabbard's attacks, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said, ""Divisive language filled with vitriol and conspiracy theories? Can't imagine a better proof point than this.""

Asked earlier if the former secretary of state was referring to Gabbard in her comment, Merrill told CNN, ""If the nesting doll fits.""

""This is not some outlandish claim. This is reality,"" Merrill said. ""If the Russian propaganda machine, both their state media and their bot and troll operations, is backing a candidate aligned with their interests, that is just a reality, it is not speculation.""

On Friday evening, after Clinton's comments drew considerable criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, Merrill backed away from the former secretary of state's allegation, tweeting, ""She doesn't say the Russians are grooming anyone. It was a question about Republicans.""

Gabbard, in a late August interview with CNN, ruled out a third-party bid.

""I will not,"" the Hawaii Democrat told CNN. ""No, I have ruled that out.""

Gabbard has tried to fight off the charge that she is being pushed by Russian interests.

""Just two days ago, the New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears,"" Gabbard said, referring to a recent story that said she is being backed by Russians on Twitter. ""This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.""

Clinton also accused Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate in both the 2012 and 2016 elections, of being a ""Russian asset.""

""That's assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not, because she's also a Russian asset,"" Clinton said. ""Yes, she's a Russian asset, I mean, totally. They know they can't win without a third-party candidate.""

Stein's campaign, which earned nearly 1.5 million votes in the 2016 election, was part of Russia's meddling efforts, according to a host of congressional reports, including a Senate Intelligence Committee report that indicated Russian social media efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election included messaging in support of Stein.

summation of the report's findings on ""comprehensive anti-Hillary Clinton operations"" said while the group's assumed Twitter personas had some pro-Clinton content, ""the developed Left-wing Twitter personas were still largely anti-Clinton and expressed pro-Bernie Sanders and pro-Jill Stein sentiments.""

Stein, who had dinner with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2015, has also compared Russian interference in the 2016 election to American overseas efforts.

""I think it would be naive to think that Russia did not try to interfere."" But, she said, ""Certainly that's what the United States does,"" though she added, ""that's not to justify it.""

""Interference is wrong and it's an assault against democracy, and it should be pursued, but (the United States) should pursue it knowing that we do it, too.""

Kamala Harris (D-CA) is tanking in Iowa – despite a switch in campaign strategies to blitz the state, sarcastically telling a colleague in September that she is “f*cking moving” to the Hawkeye State – Emerson Polling results released this week reveal.

The California senator has experienced a steady decline in both national and early primary and caucus state polls in recent weeks. The trend was seemingly sparked by Rep. Tulsi Gabbard’s (D-HI) pointed attack on Harris’s controversial prosecutorial record – jailing hundreds of people for marijuana violations and later making light of smoking marijuana – during the Democrat debate in July.

Harris signaled a switch in campaign strategies in September, telling a colleague that she is “f*cking moving to Iowa.”

“‘I’m f*cking moving to Iowa’ – Kamala Harris,” read an email following the presidential hopeful’s quip.

“She cut to the chase!” the email stated. “We’re doubling our organizers on the ground in Iowa and Kamala is ramping up her time on the trail there, beginning today in Cedar Rapids.”

The following month, Harris launched her “I feel your pain” tour across Iowa, which featured the presidential hopeful speaking to Iowans in more “intimate” settings, even helping some “prepare Sunday suppers.”

Despite the Iowa push, Harris continues to tank in the polls, with the latest Emerson Polling survey showing Harris garnering just two percent among Democrat caucus-goers in Iowa.

The poll, taken October 13-16, 2019 among 313 Democrat caucus voters, showed Joe Biden (D) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) topping the field with 23 percent support each. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) overtook Sanders for third place with 16 percent support to the Vermont senator’s 13 percent.

Andrew Yang (D) came in fifth place with five percent support, followed by Gov. Steve Bullock (D) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with four percent and three percent, respectively.

Harris, who once mocked Gabbard’s low poll numbers, tied with both the Hawaiian lawmaker and Tom Steyer (D), with two percent support. The margin of error is +/- 5.5 percent:

Harris mocked Gabbard following their contentious face-off in July’s debate, telling CNN’s Anderson Cooper:

This is going to sound immodest, but I’m obviously a top tier candidate, and so, I did expect that I would be on the stage and take hits tonight because there are a lot of people that are trying to make the stage for the next debate.

“Especially when people are at zero or one percent or whatever she might be at, and so, I did expect that I might take hits tonight,” she added, a direct reference to Gabbard:

Harris continues to struggle in national polls, dropping to fifth place with 5.2 percent in the current Real Clear Politics average, behind Biden, Warren, Sanders, and Buttigieg."

Happily, this five-years-later follow-up, ""Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,"" flies a bit higher, building on the central relationship while adding Michelle Pfeiffer's regal presence as a killer queen.

The first ""Maleficent"" actually felt somewhat out of step with Disney's live-action movie strategy, offering a revisionist take -- unlike mostly dutiful remakes like ""The Lion King"" or ""Aladdin"" -- that transformed the dark fairy into the good gal, one who grew to love Aurora, a.k.a. Sleeping Beauty.

Despite that ambition, it was a pretty lifeless affair, beyond the kick of seeing Angelina Jolie vamp it up in the title role, and the appealing notion (which also found a home in ""Frozen"") that ""true love"" -- the kind that can break a spell -- isn't merely the province of winsome maidens and handsome princes.

Opening six decades after the animated ""Sleeping Beauty,"" ""Mistress of Evil"" picks up several years later, and begins with a very decent proposal -- namely, Prince Philip (Harris Dickinson) asking Aurora (Elle Fanning) to live happily ever after with him. When he suggests they tell their parents, however, Aurora swallows hard at the thought.

Maleficent loves ""Beastie,"" as she still calls her, but isn't so thrilled about her marrying a, well, human. Philip's mom, Queen Ingrith (Pfeiffer), is equally unenthused, producing one of those uncomfortable meet-the-in-laws dinners, bringing some welcome humor into the movie.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), however, appeared to hold an advantage in a hypothetical matchup, leading the president by two points– 51 percent to Trump’s 49 percent. The margin of error is +/-3.2 percent, indicating that the race is in flux:

Sanders’ lead against the president comes in spite of the fact that he is not leading the Democrat field in the Hawkeye State. Rather, Warren and Biden are tied with 23 percent support each, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who garnered 16 percent support. Sanders fell to fourth place with 13 percent support, followed by Andrew Yang (D), Gov. Steve Bullock (D), and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with five percent, four percent, and three percent, respectively.

The results outlined the most trouble for Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who has tried to revive her floundering campaign by focusing on Iowa.

As Breitbart News detailed:

Harris signaled a switch in campaign strategies in September, telling a colleague that she is “f*cking moving to Iowa.” “‘I’m f*cking moving to Iowa’ – Kamala Harris,” read an email following the presidential hopeful’s quip. “She cut to the chase!” the email stated. “We’re doubling our organizers on the ground in Iowa and Kamala is ramping up her time on the trail there, beginning today in Cedar Rapids.” The following month, Harris launched her “I feel your pain” tour across Iowa, which featured the presidential hopeful speaking to Iowans in more “intimate” settings, even helping some “prepare Sunday suppers.”

Despite those efforts, she was only able to garner two percent support in the state, alongside Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and Tom Steyer (D):

The poll also showed that more Iowans oppose impeachment than support it, 48 percent to 42 percent:

42% Support

10% Unsurehttps://t.co/CIjFwBESSE — Emerson Polling (@EmersonPolling) October 17, 2019

Impeachment does not appear to be a top priority among Iowans across the board, with only six percent considering it an important factor in choosing whom to support for president. Thirty-three percent said the economy, 19 percent said health care, and ten percent chose “social issues.”

“The Democrats have some work to do in Iowa convincing voters that impeachment is a top priority of Congress; 67% of Democrats in Iowa support impeaching the president, but only 10% identify it as the most important issue in deciding their vote for president,” Emerson Polling Director Spencer Kimball said."

What would a home on Mars look like? What sort of clothes would we wear on the Red Planet? And how would we grow our food? The answers to some of these questions are beautifully imagined in a new exhibition, ""Moving to Mars,"" at London's Design Museum.

The race is on for a successful manned mission to Mars, with NASA leading a pack of public and private institutions competing to be the first to land, including Elon Musk's Space X, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, Boeing, and the China National Space Administration.

NASA plans to launch a manned mission in the 2030s, a timeframe shared by other private groups, although this goal might be more aspirational than realistic. Many technologies required don't yet exist, including the spacecraft, which are either under development or at the prototype stage. What a Mars mission would look like is far from clear, with some teams planning to build a full-blown Martian habitat, while others foresee orbiting stations that could function as launch pads for limited trips to the surface. But it's not too early to dream, nor to start imagining how it will all take shape.

The interior of a proposed Mars habitat by London-based design firm Hassell.

Centered on the role that design will play in sending humans to Mars, the exhibition is rich with historical materials but also more forward-looking or speculative elements, with a wide range of works by designers from various fields.

Curator Eleanor Watson said the designs on show were response to questions about future Mars missions. ""Such as what would microgravity clothing need to look like, what would a Mars habitat look like, very speculative questions on what the planet might look in 1,000 or even 10,000 years,"" said Watson in a phone interview.

Among the experimental works is a fashion collection by sustainable design company RÆBURN, which imagines clothing to be used inside Martian habitats, tailored from recycled spacecraft materials.

The clothes are made from recycled parachutes and thermal blankets.

""At $18,000 per kilo of payload, sending stuff to Mars is expensive, so anything that you bring with you, you have to be able to reuse intelligently. All of the rovers that are being flown over, for example, come with landing parachutes. What are you gonna use these parachutes for after the landing? Well, one option would be to make all of the clothing for the astronauts from them,"" said Watson.

The RÆBURN collection.

The exhibition includes five architectural projects for potential Mars habitat modules, all derived from NASA's 3D Printing Habitat Challenge, a $3 million competition to build 3D-printed homes for deep space exploration. One of them, by London-based international design firm Hassell, is scaled up to full size, for people to get into and explore.

""Hassell very kindly agreed to make a one-to-one scale mockup of one of their modules and it's six meters in diameter. It includes a system that would allow you to reconfigure the space easily. They've created a group of six modules that link together and are covered by a shield to protect from radiation. These six modules are in a ring, so that you have an internal courtyard and when you're in one module, even though it's quite small, there's a big window and you can see across and see what other people are up to,"" said Watson.

The Hassell habitat includes hydroponics.

Outside of habitats, normal clothes won't cut it in the thin and unbreathable Martian atmosphere. Astonauts will need space suits, such as the NDX-1, one of the very first designed for Mars, by two University of North Dakota engineers, Gary L. Harris and Dr de Leon. Compared to suits designed for the Apollo Moon program, for example, Mars suits would need to be much more flexible, as they would be worn for months or even years rather than just days.

The NDX-1 suit.

Currently, exploration of Mars is done solely by robots, and there have been four successful landings of rovers on the surface of the planet, with only one of them, Curiosity, still operational. The exhibition includes a replica of Rosalind Franklin, a Mars rover that will be launched in 2020 by the European Space Agency and will land in 2021. It's named after an English scientist who made crucial discoveries about DNA, and was previously known as ExoMars. ""It's a lab on wheels and it's going to drill quite far down into the Martian surface, to try and find traces of life,"" said Watson.

The Rosalind Franklin.

Among the historical documents on display is the very first map of Mars, drawn by Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli in 1877. He identified darker and lighter features of the map as seas and continents. ""He also famously described the straight lines he saw on the surface as canali, which then was translated as ""canals"" rather than ""channels"" and sparked the canal craze that led to the misconception that there might be or have been intelligent life on Mars,"" said Watson.

Schiaparelli, G. V. (Giovanni Vi

The interactive components of the show will focus on a multi-sensory experience designed to simulate the conditions on the surface of Mars, complete with smells and sound, and a family trail that invites visitors of all ages to solve their own design challenges, by completing tasks set by experts including British astronaut Tim Peake.

While Mars has always been a fascinating subject for scientists, designers and dreamers alike, interest for the Red Planet has reached its peak in recent years. That might be down to the fact that the technologies required to go there are now mature. But it's also due to the current state of our own planet, argues Watson.

""The climate crisis is -- rightly -- frightening a lot of people, and there is a tendency to think of Mars as a sort of escape hatch for humanity, a planet B, which is very dangerous and problematic,"" said Watson.

""But I think that the endeavor is worthwhile, because all the technologies required to develop a mission to Mars, such as zero waste habitats and sustainable farming, have very tangible earth applications that we need right now."""

The Hill reported Friday:

Spending on private flights by Democratic presidential candidates soared over the past three months, from roughly $680,000 in the second quarter to more than $2.2 million in the third fundraising period of the year. Topping the spending list was former Vice President Joe Biden, who dropped about $924,000 on private air travel … South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg spent nearly $479,000 on private flights over the past three months, up from roughly $300,000 in the second quarter. And Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) used about $253,000 in campaign cash to charter flights, significantly more than the $17,000 she spent in the second quarter. The Democratic primary field’s leading progressives, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), also saw their private air travel spending swell in the three-month fundraising period. … Other candidates who dropped campaign cash on private flights include Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, who spent about $40,500; Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who spent about $23,000; and former tech executive Andrew Yang, who spent just under $26,000.

Biden, Buttigieg, Harris, Sanders, Warren, Klobuchar, and Yang all support the “Green New Deal,” a plan introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) in February that calls for the elimination of fossil fuels by 2030. Of those listed above, only Bullock opposes the plan, calling it “resolution aspiration” at the second debate.

A typical private jet flight on a Cessna Citation XLS jet seating seven passengers would burn just under one ton of carbon per person — about 20% of the average annual global per capita consumption, and about one third of what the total annual per capita consumption of carbon ought to be, according to calculations by the Sierra Club in 2015.

Breitbart News captured the greatest “share of voice” on Facebook among U.S. news outlets during the debate, while Fox News came in second place and the President’s personal Facebook page came in third.

CNN, which hosted the debate, received approximately one third of the number of engagements that Breitbart News earned during the debate. The New York Times, which co-hosted the Democrat debate alongside CNN, did not even break the list of the top ten social media pages with the highest “share of voice” on Facebook.

Below are the top three pages ranked by Facebook’s “share of voice” metric:

Breitbart News has consistently topped polls on social media interaction during this election cycle. It was reported by Axios in July that Breitbart News was dominating the political landscape during the Democrat primaries.

The House Oversight Committee chairman passed away at Johns Hopkins Hospital early Thursday morning due to “complications concerning long-standing health challenges,” his office stated. Cummings had not returned to work due to an unnamed medical procedure and had not participated in a roll call vote since September 11, according to the Baltimore Sun.

Tributes have been pouring in on social media, and several of the 2020 Democrat candidates remarked on the lawmaker’s unexpected passing.

College Pulse and Chegg surveyedover 1,500 college students weekly in order to get a finger on the pulse of the presidential preferences of college students across the country. The results, based on Democrat and Democratic-leaning undergraduates, are updated once a week.

Students were asked, “Regardless of who you may support in the upcoming 2020 presidential election, who would you most like to be the Democratic nominee for President?”

The latest update, on October 15, showed Warren leaping to first place with 32 percent to Sanders’ 27 percent. This is significant, as Sanders has dominated as the frontrunner since the tracker’s formal launch in March. On March 26, Warren only had six percent support in the poll compared to Sanders’ 33 percent.

The “gender gap” on the two candidates is hitting an “all-time high,” according to College Pulse. Among female college students, Warren leads 34 percent to 27 percent, while Sanders leads among male college students with 31 percent to Warren’s 21 percent.

No other candidate comes close to Warren or Sanders, with Joe Biden (D) falling to a distant third with just ten percent support among Democrat and Democrat-leaning college students– a long fall from the 22 percent he garnered in March.

Andrew Yang (D) falls closely behind Biden with nine percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), Beto O’Rourke (D), and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), with seven percent, four percent, and three percent, respectively. The margin of error was not immediately available.

Harris’s three percent support marks an “all-time low” for the candidate,” College Pulse assessed.

The poll also found that the majority of college students, 54 percent, have an unfavorable view of Biden. Only 45 percent have a favorable view of the former vice president, whose role in the questionable foreign business dealings of his son has been a topic of controversy in recent weeks.

The vast majority of Democrat and Democrat-leaning college students, 89 percent, have a favorable view of Warren and Sanders, the survey showed."

Rapinoe, an out and proud lesbian, raised eyebrows during the 2019 Women’s World Cup games by turning the tournament into her personal political platform to attack President Trump and the United States.

The BBC celebrated the two-time World Cup winner and co-captain of the U.S. Women’s National Team, and 2019 Best FIFA Women’s Player, for being an “advocate for equality in soccer, taking legal action against the US Soccer Federation over equal pay, calling out racism by fans and has become the face of LGBTQ rights in the game.”

“If everybody was as outraged about racism as those who suffer it, if everybody was as outraged about homophobia as LGBTQ players, if everybody was as outraged about the lack of equal pay as women, that would be the most inspiring thing for the future to me,” Rapinoe told the BBC.

Rapinoe joined Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and teen-aged climate alarmist Greta Thunberg on this year’s list.

Thirteen of the 100 women on the list are athletes, including Bangladeshi Cricketer Jasmin Akter, Iranian athlete Kimia Alizadeh, British athletes Dina Asher-Smith, Bethany Firth, and Jawahir Roble, Nigerian Salwa Eid Naser, Jamaican Shelly-Ann Fraiser-Pryce, Australian Tayla Harris, China’s Huang Wensi, German cyclist Fiona Kolbinger, Japanese sumo wrestler Hiyori Kon, and Egypt’s Farida Osman.

Also of note, the BBC included trans woman Nisha Ayub, who was placed in a male prison at age 21 for breaking Malaysia’s sharia law prohibiting a man from wearing women’s clothing in public.

The New York Times reported this week that the gender non-conforming Dillon is calling on the Television Academy to drop gendered acting categories from the Emmys, telling the newspaper in an interview, “I presume no one has asked them directly to make that change, so perhaps this is the right moment… What are the first steps that need to be taken to make that change? Call me. Email me. Let’s get it done.”

A spokesman for the Television Academy told the Times that while the organization “celebrates inclusiveness,” it has no plans to make that change.

The Oscars and the Tony Awards are also expected to maintain separate awards for actors and actresses.

The one award show that has done away with gendered categories is the MTV Movie & TV Awards. The Viacom-owned MTV announced in 2017 that its flagship awards show would eliminate gender-specific categories for the first time.

Instead of categories like “Best Actress” and “Best Actor,” the show honors “Best Actor in a Movie” and “Best Actor in a Show.”

Dillon plays the gender non-binary character Taylor Mason in Showtime’s Billions, and chose to be submitted for Emmy consideration in the supporting actor category two years ago. Dillon, who has so far failed to earn an Emmy nomination, was born female and but now identifies as non-binary and uses the pronoun “they.”

“If we separated categories by the colors of eyes, hair or skin, people would go, ‘This is unacceptable,’” Dillon told the Times. “That’s how I feel about gender categories. At this point, it feels unacceptable and unnecessary and archaic.”

Opponents of such a measure said that men would end up dominating non-gendered acting categories.

“It’s placing this huge bet that sexism is so solved that it doesn’t need to be paid attention to anymore,” Mark Harris, the writer and entertainment journalist, told the Times. “It’s so solved even though a vast majority of voters in awards groups are men. It’s so solved even though actresses have absolutely no shortage of important and fascinating things to say about the way gender inequities persist in the industry.”

The John Wick 3 star kicked off the MTV Movie & TV Awards night by presenting the award for Best Actor in a Movie.

“This year has been full of firsts for me. I am the first openly non-binary actor to play a non-binary character on a major television show,” Dillon said. “And now it’s so cool to be here presenting the first acting award ever that celebrates performance free of any gender distinction.”

Billions, which has been renewed for a fifth season, was co-created by Brian Koppelman, who has repeatedly ripped President Donald Trump.

Koppelman recently said in a blog post that he will “refuse to call him Mr. President and I’d hope you’d do the same.”

So the story from Biden goes, gangster “Corn Pop” represented a serious threat to Biden when he was a lifeguard at a community pool. Corn Pop, who actually was real, supposedly carried a straight razor and after an altercation with young lifeguard Biden threatened to meet him in the parking lot later—so young Biden claims he threatened to wrap a chain around Corn Pop’s head.

The whole blowup was over Biden allegedly calling Corn Pop “Esther,” a derisive insult drawn from the swimmer Esther Williams that apparently was akin to calling the gangster a girl. But before things devolved into a razor-versus-chain race war in the parking lot later, Biden says he apologized to Corn Pop for the insult, which defused the situation—and the incident has become part of Biden’s political folklore storyline of being a grand negotiator who can calmly lead in tense political situations, especially those involving race.

Though it seems an incredible story, Biden included it in his 2007 autobiography and it was a central part of a dedication ceremony at a Delaware public pool at which Biden spoke in 2017. The NAACP even confirmed the details of Corn Pop and his existence for those questioning it.

So when moderator Anderson Cooper at the end of the CNN-New York Times debate on Tuesday night closed down the debate with a question about a unique and different friendship that has shaped their lives, one would have thought the moderators were teeing Biden up for a perfect Corn Pop moment.

Cooper said:

Last week, Ellen DeGeneres was criticized after she and former President George W. Bush were seen laughing together at a football game. Ellen defended their friendship, saying, we’re all different and I think that we’ve forgotten that that’s OK that we’re all different. So in that spirit, we’d like you to tell us about a friendship that you’ve had that would surprise us and what impact it’s had on you and your beliefs.

Cooper went to all 11 other candidates before getting to Biden, who closed it down at the end, giving Biden plenty of time to think about what he was going to say.

Instead of telling the story of Corn Pop, Biden opted for a more conventional and boring answer, and one already used by several of the other candidates: He talked about his friendship with the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ):

This is reassuring in the fact that we’re all acknowledging that we have to reach across the aisle, get things done. No other way to get anything done in this country. The two people maybe would surprise you the most were — he’s been mentioned twice, but John McCain. John McCain worked for me when he worked in the Navy, and he was — he was my assigned to me to travel around the world. We became close friends. He became very close friends with my wife, Jill. Visited our home. He was there with his children. And on his death bed, he asked me to do his eulogy. John, I would say to John, ‘John, you didn’t see a war you never wanted to fight.’ And he’d say, ‘You didn’t see a problem you never wanted to solve.’ But he was a great man of principle. He was honorable. He was honorable.

Biden finished with typical talking points from his stump speech about why he’s running for president—nothing remarkable, nothing outstanding, and nothing memorable.

Some pundits and observers on Twitter laughed about Biden leaving Corn Pop hanging in favor of the safer McCain story, mocking Biden for being unable to read the room.

Missed opportunity to invoke Corn Pop — Ellen McGirt (@ellmcgirt) October 16, 2019

While this is more of a lighthearted ribbing of Biden, in an unserious and comedic manner—Corn Pop probably was not the right story anyway for the question—it does illustrate a larger problem with the sliding campaign of the former Vice President.

He again had no major memorable positive moments on a crowded debate stage for the fourth month in a row. Donald Trump, Jr., President Donald Trump’s eldest son, mocked Biden’s lackluster performance in a tweet by noting that, at least this time in the Ohio debate, Biden’s teeth didn’t nearly fall out—as they almost did in the previous debate.

On the bright side, at least Joe’s teeth didn’t fall out this time! — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 16, 2019

It seems cruel, but Biden’s teeth did slip and nearly fall out of his mouth in a previous debate, and in a forum his eye exploded, bleeding on live television. Another candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), suffered a heart attack less than two weeks before this debate, pushing health questions–like whether any of these Democrats are actually healthy enough to run for and serve as president–to the forefront of Americans’ minds heading into Tuesday night. Moderators even asked several of the candidates about these concerns in Ohio’s debate.

This all comes as it has been revealed by just-released Federal Election Commission (FEC) campaign finance reports that Biden’s campaign spent more than he raised in funds last quarter, and he keeps slipping in polls behind rivals Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and now lags in the fundraising race as well.

The bigger story that broke during the debate news cycle in its immediate aftermath is Biden spent nearly $2 million more than he raised last quarter—he raised $15.7 million and spent $17.6 million—while he had less than $9 million cash on hand at the end of September. That puts him at less than Sanders’ $33.7 million, less than Warren’s $25.7 million, less than Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s $23.4 million, and even less than the $10.5 million that the flaming-out Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) had.

NEWS: Joe Biden has $8.98 million cash on hand Sanders: $33.7 million

Warren: $25.7 million

Buttigieg: $23.4 million

Harris: $10.5 million — Shane Goldmacher (@ShaneGoldmacher) October 16, 2019

At a burn rate like Biden’s running, with not much gas in the tank, the former Vice President could be in some serious trouble in attempting to remain near the front of the pack. He’s already lost his frontrunner status, as Warren has pulled ahead of him in most national polling and in almost every early and battleground state except in the South. CNN’s Chris Cillizza called Biden’s funding lapses a “bombshell” revelation multiple times in a post about the matter, writing that it represents a “SIREN” for Biden’s campaign.

Factor that together with burgeoning attacks on his son Hunter Biden’s business dealings from the White House and President Donald Trump, as well as a media beginning to be receptive to the criticisms, and Joe Biden has a tougher-than-ever road ahead. Hunter Biden’s interview earlier on Tuesday on ABC did his father no favors by most accounts, and even CNN and JournoList founder Ezra Klein of Vox are now saying there is something to all the questions swirling around him and that Democrats need to be prepared to deal with this.

CNN published a fact check after the debate contrasting Biden’s claims he never discussed Hunter’s business dealings with his son with Hunter’s claims he did discuss them with his father.

Klein, meanwhile, laid out in a Vox article how Democrats are woefully unprepared on the Hunter Biden issue should Joe Biden win the nomination, urging Democrats to learn how to talk about it, even if they don’t want to discuss the problems. Klein wrote:

A few things are true about the Hunter Biden story. One is that there’s no evidence Joe Biden did what Donald Trump has accused him of doing: pressuring Ukraine to fire a prosecutor to protect his son from investigation. But another is that Hunter Biden poses real problems for Joe Biden’s campaign, and if Democrats pretend otherwise, they’re making a mistake. Many Democrats consider raising the Hunter Biden question unfair to Joe Biden. Why should he have to answer for the legal actions of his adult son? But no one said politics was fair. And if Democrats avoid the issue, they can be certain Trump will not. Biden’s vulnerability here needs to be tested in the primary, when Democrats have other choices, rather than in the general, when they won’t.

The debate moderators and other candidates barely touched on Hunter Biden during the debate, and only to brush it aside as a non-concern. But Hunter Biden is hardly the only of Joe Biden’s problems after the debate on Tuesday.

There was a particularly memorable moment where, towards the end of the night, both Sanders and Warren extracted a pound of flesh from Biden from the left—significantly undermining his standing with Democrats.

Cooper asked Biden to respond to the broad visions of big, bold change that Warren and Sanders respectively have been laying out:

Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change. Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution. Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump?

Biden replied with a claim he is the only one who has gotten anything substantive actually “done” in Washington:

Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people, and I think a lot of what they have to say is really important. But, you know, Senator Warren said we can’t be running any vague campaigns. We’ve got to level with people. We’ve got to level with people and tell them exactly what we’re going to do, how we’re going to get it done, and if you can get it done. I’m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I’m the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done, from the Violence Against Women Act to making sure that we pass the Affordable Care Act to being in a position where we, in fact, took almost a $90 billion act that kept us from going into a depression, making us — putting us in a position where I was able to end roe — excuse me, able to end the issue of gun sales in terms of assault weapons. And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who is going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I’m not suggesting they can’t, but I’m suggesting that that’s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it’s going to cost, how you’re going to do it, and why you’re going to do it. That’s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade.

After a follow-up question from Cooper asking Biden to further specify exactly whom he said was being “vague,” he took a not-so-veiled shot at the Medicare-for-All vision put forward by Warren and Sanders.

Biden said:

Well, the senator said — she’s being vague on the issue of — actually, both are being vague on the issue of Medicare for all. No, look, here’s the deal. Come on. It costs $30 trillion. Guess what? That’s over $3 trillion — it’s more than the entire federal budget… If you eliminated the entire Pentagon, every single thing, plane, ship, troop, the buildings, everything, satellites, it would get you — it would pay for a total of four months. Four months. Where do you get the rest? Where does it come from?

That opened Sanders up to decimate Biden for “working with Republicans” to back endless wars in the Middle East and trade policies that hurt America’s working class:

Joe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done. But you know what you also got done? And I say this as a good friend. You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country. You got trade agreements, like NAFTA and PNTR, with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs. Now, let’s get to Medicare for all. Let’s be honest. We spend twice as much per person as do the people of any other major country on Earth. And the answer is, if we have the guts that I would like to see the Democratic Party have that guts, to stand up to the drug companies and the insurance companies and tell them that the function of health care is to guarantee care to all people, not to make $100 billion in profit.

After back-and-forth between Biden and Sanders in response to Sanders’ smack-down, Warren delivered another brutal blow to Biden. Warren’s reply focused on the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, with which she was intricately involved and for which she receives enormous credit among Democrats:

So you started this question with how you got something done. You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, don’t even try, because you will never get it passed. And sure enough, the big banks fought us. The Republicans fought us. Some of the Democrats fought us. But we got that agency passed into law. It has now forced big banks to return more than $12 billion directly to people they cheated. I served in the Obama administration. I know what we can do by executive authority, and I will use it. In Congress, on the first day, I will pass my anti-corruption bill, which will beat back the influence of money and repeal the filibuster. And the third, we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight for the things that touch people’s lives.

Buttigieg, who had sparred all night with Warren, seemed to sense what was coming next for Biden and attempted to interrupt to spare the former vice president any more pain from the socialists on either side of him. But Biden didn’t take the life raft from South Bend’s mayor, opting instead to further engage with Warren on the 2008 financial crisis. Biden, after fighting the moderators to respond to Warren, attempted to take credit for whipping U.S. Senate votes for the legislation that created the CFPB.

“I agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes,” Biden said. “I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let’s get those things straight, too.”

Big mistake for Biden, as evidenced by the leftists on Twitter ripping him for “yelling” at Warren, lecturing the former college professor on her subject of expertise and claiming she couldn’t have done it without his work whipping votes for her project.

That set Warren up for the line of the night, when Cooper gave the spotlight back to her to reply to Biden.

“I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law,” Warren said.

Holy crap, Elizabeth Warren responds with Joe Biden snapping at her about his role in getting votes for the CFPB by thanking Obama. Whoosh.#DemocraticDebatepic.twitter.com/dAOtNuLvAL — Erick Fernandez (@ErickFernandez) October 16, 2019

Warren thanking former President Barack Obama, but not Biden, was brutal to Biden. Obama has not endorsed his former vice president in the 2020 Democrat presidential primary, deliberately not supporting his one-time wingman. That void for Biden and lack of support from the Democrats’ most popular star, the former president—despite Biden’s best efforts to closely associate himself with Obama at every turn—cuts like a dagger into his support.

It raises all sorts of questions among Democrats, including most importantly about Biden’s electability, about why they should vote for Biden if Obama won’t even endorse and campaign with him. Making matters worse for Biden is that, the morning after this debate, Obama turned around and endorsed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s re-election north of the border—but still refuses to back his own former right-hand guy.

I was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as President. He's a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term. — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) October 16, 2019

“You did a hell of a job in your job,” Biden interrupted Warren’s answer.

“Thank you,” Warren coolly replied to laughter from the audience. She continued:

But understand this. It was a dream big, fight hard. People told me, go for something little, go for something small, go for something that the big corporations will be able to accept. I said, no, let’s go for an agency that will make structural change in our economy.

“And President Obama said, I will fight for that, and he sometimes had to fight against people in his own administration,” Warren continued before Biden interrupted her again.

“Not me!” Biden protested, as Warren refused to credit him with any involvement in the response to the financial crisis.

Warren kept plowing through her answer, ignoring Biden’s protests.

“We have to be willing to make good, big, structural change,” she said.

By Wednesday, Biden seems to have realized just how bad Tuesday’s debate was for his campaign, as before he even left Ohio he was out ripping Sanders and Warren to anyone in the press who would listen, accusing them of “playing Trump’s game and trying to con the American people.”

He ripped Sanders and Warren for not being able to explain how they would pay for their mass increases in government benefits and claimed both were disingenuous.

Meanwhile, the establishment media keeps playing up Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) as candidates they say had big nights, as Democrats desperately look for someone to be able to effectively counter Warren’s and Sanders’ socialist vision—all while establishment-favorite blasts from the past like former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the 2016 Democrat nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton are discussed as potential Democrat saviors from the leftist socialist abyss."

Think tanks The Bow Group and The Bruges Group, along with the pro-Brexit pressure group Fishing for Leave, have joined the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) in opposing the government’s new EU-approved proposed exit treaty. The Bruges Group’s chairman Barry Legg called it a “defective agreement”, while Fishing for Leave’s Aaron Brown labelled it “Brexit in Name Only”.

Chairman of The Bow Group, the UK’s oldest conservative think tank, Ben Harris-Quinney said: “We were open-minded to a new deal and would support any deal that fulfils the terms of the Brexit vote with Britain leaving the EU in full, as well as both the Single Market and Customs Union.

“This deal does not do that. Serious concerns remain over Northern Ireland and future regulatory alignment with the EU the UK would be forced to comply to. We oppose this deal and call on conservative and Brexit supporting MPs to vote against it to push for a managed no-deal settlement on October 31st.”

On Thursday morning, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and president of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker announced that the two sides had agreed on an exit treaty. Later that evening, the EU27 endorsed the deal, and MPs will be voting on it in the House of Commons on Saturday.

The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier outlined some of the arrangements for dealing with the Irish border issue: Northern Ireland will be part of a “limited” set of EU rules related to goods, and while remaining in the UK’s customs territory, would be an entry point into the EU’s Single Market. What would be of significant objection to the DUP is that that the party has lost its veto over whether new Northern Ireland arrangements come into force.

While some Eurosceptics may have softened to the deal — in preference over a clean-break Brexit — the Northern Irish DUP has said it was “unable to support these proposals in parliament”, adding they “undermine the integrity of the union”.

DUP MP Sammy Wilson called on his Conservative colleagues to “take a stand for the Union and join us in rejecting this deal. Internal and burdensome trade barriers will be erected within the UK without parallel consent from both unionists and nationalists. This is not Brexit.”

Mr Harris-Quinney continued in the statement that the Bow Group believes the proposed deal “fails to achieve sovereign independence of all the United Kingdom whilst committing to send in excess of £39 billion to the EU”.

The think tank also warned that the Political Declaration — which sets out the future relationship between the UK and EU — opens up the UK to regulatory alignment with the bloc as well as military cooperation, spending commitments, and abiding by Brussels’ financial regulations “which would potentially allow the EU and our parliament to further neuter Brexit”.

“A no-deal Brexit remains the closest to honouring the Brexit vote and preventing its overturning by an unrepresentative parliament. That is the cause Brexiteer and conservative MPs should be committed to. The Bow Group, The Bruges Group, and Fishing for Leave call on them to listen to the people outside of Westminster and do so,” he concluded."

(CNN) Tuesday's Democratic debate featured something we have never witnessed before on a presidential debate stage: 15 full minutes of open back-and-forth about how the government should contend with the increasing power of Silicon Valley .

At the center of the exchange was a tussle between Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has been pushing for the break-up of tech giants like Facebook and Google, and Sen. Kamala Harris, who pointedly asked whether Warren would join her in demanding that Twitter suspend President Donald Trump's account on the platform.

This debate moment set the stage for what will doubtless be an election-long spat over what form regulations against internet companies should take.

This is a highly-charged and heavily politicized question, particularly for Democratic candidates. Last month, Facebook formalized a bold new policy that shocked many observers, announcing that the company would not seek to fact-check or censor politicians -- including in the context of paid political advertising, and even during an election season.

Over the past few days, this decree has pushed US political advertising into something like the Wild West: President Donald Trump, who will likely face the Democratic candidate in next year's general election, has already taken the opportunity to spread political lies with no accountability.

A frightening new world of political communication

In the aftermath of Facebook's announcement, Trump's presidential campaign disseminated an advertisement on Facebook's platform claiming that 2020 Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden had used his power as vice president to try to influence Ukraine to help his son, Hunter Biden.

The ""facts"" behind the Trump advertisement implicating Biden — which has been viewed on Facebook no fewer than five million times — have been definitively debunked , and CNN declined to air the ad for that reason.

This new Facebook policy opens a frightening new world for political communication — and for national politics. It is now the case that leading politicians can openly spread political lies without repercussion. Indeed, the Trump campaign was already spreading other falsehoods through online advertising immediately before Facebook made its announcement — and as one might predict, most of those advertisements have not been removed from the platform.

Should our politicians fail to reform regulations for internet platforms and digital advertising, our political future will be at risk. The 2016 election revealed the tremendous harm to the American democratic process that can result from coordinated misinformation campaigns ; 2020 will be far worse if we do nothing to contain the capacity for politicians to lie on social media.

The same capabilities by which political campaigns sliced up audience segments in 2016 via Facebook's advertisements will continue to exist in 2020. The difference will be that this time, the lies can be distributed by agents of the Trump campaign, instead of shell accounts operated by the Russian government and others.

Facebook's derogation of fact-checking will thus only lend greater credibility to coordinated disinformation operations — as in the case of the recent Trump campaign ad.

Warren responded to the Trump ad with a cheeky point: In an ad she has circulated over Facebook, she claims that ""Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election."" Later in the ad, she acknowledges this is a falsehood, and contends that ""what [Mark] Zuckerberg has done is given Donald Trump free rein to lie on his platform — and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters.""

Warren's mockery of the ad — and of the underlying policy that allowed its dissemination — helps illuminate how Facebook's new policy will have grave implications for our political future. Facebook's decision not to take down the Trump ad amounts to knowingly enabling the insidious political manipulation of American voters.

Facebook's power and ""free expression""

The irony is that Facebook already censors advertisements -- including those placed by presidential campaigns in the United States -- for a host of reasons. One investigation found that the company had taken down paid content from four of the Democratic candidates, including 117 ads that had been placed by the Biden campaign, for reasons ranging from the use of profanity to the display of fake buttons.

It is disconcerting to think that by fiat, Facebook can deem a political ad to be dishonest because it contains fake buttons (which can deceive the viewer into clicking on a survey button when in fact there is no interactive feature in the ad), but the company will refuse to take action against ads containing widely-debunked political lies, even during an American presidential election.

This perilous inconsistency in Facebook's policy decisions is a sign that its corporate power has grown too great. Concern for the public interest and the health of our democracy should compel us to action. And the only entity that has the power to do anything to improve the situation for the American people is Congress.

Facebook has one principal counterargument against regulation: that the company must maintain strong commitments to free speech and freedom of political expression. This came across in Mark Zuckerberg's speech at Georgetown University on Thursday, in which he described social media as a kind of ""Fifth Estate"" and characterized politicians' calls to take action as an attempt to restrict freedom of expression. Quoting at times from Frederick Douglass and Supreme Court jurisprudence, Zuckerberg said ""we are at a crossroads"" and asserted: ""When it's not absolutely clear what to do, we should err on the side of free expression.""

Unfortunately for Facebook, this argument holds little water. If you determine that an ad containing a fake button is non-compliant because it ""[entices] users to select an answer,"" then you certainly should not knowingly broadcast ads that entice voters to unwittingly consume publicly-known lies -- whether they are distributed by the President or any other politician. Indeed, as one official in Biden's presidential campaign has noted , Zuckerberg's argumentation amounts to an insidious ""choice to cloak Facebook's policy in a feigned concern for free expression"" to ""use the Constitution as a shield for his company's bottom line.""

Behind what the company claims to be a commitment to free speech lies a commercial convenience.

Regulatory policy is the way forward

If Facebook cannot take appropriate action and remove paid political lies from its platform, the only answer must be earnest regulation of the company -- regulation that forces Facebook to be transparent about the nature of political ads and prevents it from propagating political falsehoods, even if they are enthusiastically distributed by President Trump.

Our nation has always aspired to place the interests of our democratic purpose over the interests of markets. Silicon Valley should be no exception."

Joe Biden (D) has been under fire in recent days after it was reported that his campaign dropped short of $1 million – $924,000 – on private jet usage in the third quarter (July 1 – September 30) alone. The expenses were attributed to the EJCR, LLC Dba Advanced Aviation Team, recent Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings show.

While Biden leads the pack, he is not alone in his exorbitant private air travel expenditures. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) reportedly spent just short of $500,000 – $479,000 – on private air travel. That is a $179,000 increase from his private air travel expenses in the previous quarter, according to the Hill.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) also put her climate change-related concerns aside, spending $253,000– $236,000 more than the $17,000 she spent in the previous three months.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) – who once described climate change as the “greatest threat to our national security” – spent $360,000 on private air travel in the third quarter. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) – who described climate change as an “existential crisis that threatens all of us” – also utilized private air travel, spending $132,000 in the third quarter. However, a campaign aide told the Hill that Warren makes an effort to offset her carbon output and gave $10,150 to Native Energy in the third quarter.

An outline of the Democrat-backed Green New Deal, released this year, lamented the existence of cows and air travel but admitted that neither could be totally eliminated.

The outline stated:

We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast, but we think we can ramp up renewable manufacturing and power production, retrofit every building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul transportation and agriculture, plant lots of trees and restore our ecosystem to get to net-zero.

The excessive air travel of the candidates calls their authenticity into question.

Warren has called climate change an “existential crisis that threatens all of us” and called for “bold action now to stop it before it’s too late”:

Climate change is an existential crisis that threatens all of us—and we need to take bold action now to stop it before it's too late. That's why we need to have a #ClimateDebate. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) August 24, 2019

Biden – who spent nearly $1 million on private jet usage in a three-month span – warned that it is going to take “leadership” to combat the “climate crisis”:

Harris has called climate change an “imminent threat to our planet,” while Buttigieg warned that the threat “isn’t theoretical”:

Donald Trump believes climate change is a hoax. Donald Trump is an idiot. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) August 10, 2019

Nevertheless, critics argue that Democrats are demonstrating that they are not taking the matter seriously, as their actions do not always coincide with their rhetoric.

For instance, Democrats came under fire last month after attending the Polk County Democrats Steak Fry, which featured thousands of steaks. While climate change alarmists argue that red meat consumption is contributing to the “crisis,” several Democrat candidates happily assisted in grilling the juicy cuts of meat, despite some of the presidential hopefuls previously floating limiting beef consumption in order to curb the looming threat:

The comment appears to be directed at Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard , who has been accused of being cozy with Russia in the past.

""I'm not making any predictions, but I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,"" Clinton said, speaking on a podcast with former Obama adviser David Plouffe. ""She's the favorite of the Russians.""

Clinton never names Gabbard, but there are only five women running for President -- Gabbard, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and author Marianne Williamson -- and none of the other woman have been accused of being boosted by Russia.

Clinton did not provide proof about how Russia is ""grooming"" Gabbard. She and her team pointed to allegations that Russian news and propaganda sites often report on Gabbard's campaign and that moments in Gabbard's campaign have been reportedly amplified by trolls and bots on Twitter with ties to Russia. Gabbard has denied those allegations.

""They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far,"" Clinton said.

Clinton's team also noted that some of Gabbard's foreign policy views align closely with Russian interests.

Gabbard responded on Twitter Friday afternoon to Clinton's comments.

""Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain,"" she tweeted.

""From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a concerted campaign to destroy my reputation,"" she added. ""We wondered who was behind it and why. Now we know — it was always you, through your proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose.""

""It's now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don't cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly.""

Responding to Gabbard's attacks, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said, ""Divisive language filled with vitriol and conspiracy theories? Can't imagine a better proof point than this.""

Asked earlier if the former secretary of state was referring to Gabbard in her comment, Merrill told CNN, ""If the nesting doll fits.""

""This is not some outlandish claim. This is reality,"" Merrill said. ""If the Russian propaganda machine, both their state media and their bot and troll operations, is backing a candidate aligned with their interests, that is just a reality, it is not speculation.""

On Friday evening, after Clinton's comments drew considerable criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, Merrill backed away from the former secretary of state's allegation, tweeting, ""She doesn't say the Russians are grooming anyone. It was a question about Republicans.""

Gabbard, in a late August interview with CNN, ruled out a third-party bid.

""I will not,"" the Hawaii Democrat told CNN. ""No, I have ruled that out.""

Gabbard has tried to fight off the charge that she is being pushed by Russian interests.

""Just two days ago, the New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears,"" Gabbard said, referring to a recent story that said she is being backed by Russians on Twitter. ""This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.""

Clinton also accused Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate in both the 2012 and 2016 elections, of being a ""Russian asset.""

""That's assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not, because she's also a Russian asset,"" Clinton said. ""Yes, she's a Russian asset, I mean, totally. They know they can't win without a third-party candidate.""

Stein's campaign, which earned nearly 1.5 million votes in the 2016 election, was part of Russia's meddling efforts, according to a host of congressional reports, including a Senate Intelligence Committee report that indicated Russian social media efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election included messaging in support of Stein.

summation of the report's findings on ""comprehensive anti-Hillary Clinton operations"" said while the group's assumed Twitter personas had some pro-Clinton content, ""the developed Left-wing Twitter personas were still largely anti-Clinton and expressed pro-Bernie Sanders and pro-Jill Stein sentiments.""

Stein, who had dinner with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2015, has also compared Russian interference in the 2016 election to American overseas efforts.

""I think it would be naive to think that Russia did not try to interfere."" But, she said, ""Certainly that's what the United States does,"" though she added, ""that's not to justify it.""

""Interference is wrong and it's an assault against democracy, and it should be pursued, but (the United States) should pursue it knowing that we do it, too.""

PERIOD.""

It's a sentiment some African Americans are expressing on social media and elsewhere since Atatiana Jefferson , a 28-year-old black woman, was shot and killed last weekend by a Fort Worth, Texas, police officer who was conducting a wellness check at her home.

DJ Cunningham, a clinical psychology doctoral student in New Jersey, called Jefferson's fatal shooting an ""eye-opener.""

In an interview with CNN, he said the incident -- and the 2018 accidental killing of a black man in his home by a Dallas police officer -- have made him more cautious at home.

""This could easily be me. Someone could stumble into the wrong apartment after a long shift and 'bam' -- I'm not able to talk to my mom again,"" said Cunningham, who urged his followers on Twitter to never call the cops if they wanted to check on him.

""It makes you recognize your blackness,"" he added. ""You're almost instantly seen as a threat as opposed to a kid or another member of society.""

For many black Americans, Jefferson's fatal shooting has revealed yet another sobering facet of modern life. Blacks have long feared interactions with police while driving. And recent years have seen a litany of incidents in which African Americans have been questioned or detained by police while going about their daily business

But now some blacks say they are increasingly worried about the dangers of confronting police in their own homes.

Achmat Akkad, a mental health first aid teacher in New York, told CNN he's experienced wellness checks himself. Often officers respond as if the people they are checking on have done something wrong, he said.

""Just their presence when you open your door, especially as a black male, that can be very frightening,"" he said.

For these Americans and others, it creates yet another layer of mistrust between law enforcement and the black community.

It's not the first time this type of thing has happened

In recent years there have been other incidents, similar to Jefferson's, in which black people were killed during a wellness check.

One of them was the 2011 shooting death of Kenneth Chamberlain Sr., a 68-year-old former Marine with a severe heart condition who accidentally set off a medical-alert pendant. When police showed up at his White Plains, New York, apartment, they say he refused to open the door. A police report states Chamberlain stuck an 8-inch butcher knife through a crack in the door and jammed it shut with a chair when officers tried to enter. Police then forced open the door and used a Taser, bean-bag bullets and finally live bullets after Chamberlain approached an officer with the knife raised.

In 2015 James Allen, a 74-year-old Army vet from Gastonia, North Carolina, was killed by a police officer after firefighters forced his door open during a wellness check, CNN affiliate WSOC reported. An officer shot Allen after the vet pointed a gun at him. ""I think that he probably thought somebody was breaking in his house or robbing him,"" Allen's sister, Mary Battle, told the TV station.

Douglas Harris , a 77-year-old Birmingham, Alabama, man, was shot by police in February 2015 after officers went to his apartment for a wellness check. Harris' son had asked for the safety check, the Birmingham News reported, but Harris answered the door holding a gun aimed at an officer. Harris died a month after he was shot.

Harris' son had asked for the safety check, the Birmingham News reported, but Harris answered the door holding a gun aimed at an officer. Harris died a month after he was shot. And last year 36-year-old Travis Jordan was killed by two Minneapolis police officers at his home after his girlfriend called 911, fearful he was going to kill himself, CNN affiliate WCCO reported. Jordan refused to come to the door when officers arrived, then stepped onto his porch holding a knife. After he stepped toward the officers, they opened fire.

It's not clear if race is the reason

Are black people really more in danger of being killed during a wellness check?

There hasn't been enough research on the subject to prove that, says Johnny Nhan, a criminal justice professor at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth. He says it's complicated because there are lots of factors that can turn a wellness check into a police shooting, such as if the person is armed, if they attack an officer or if they have a mental illness.

""In general, however, if you're talking about police bias against blacks and other minorities, that has been an ongoing issue that we're still trying to understand,"" Nhan told CNN. ""There has been research in the past few years on implicit bias and the idea that black people are perceived of as more dangerous than whites.""

Jefferson was playing video games with her nephew in the back bedroom of her home late at night when they heard noises coming from outside, according to court documents. She then pulled her handgun from her purse, her nephew told police, and was pointing it toward a window when she was shot by an officer who was outside the house.

Nhan says the officers seemed to approach the situation at Jefferson's house as being more dangerous than just a run-of-the-mill wellness.

""The officer(s) I'm guessing is thinking this is 2:30 at night, the door is open, etc. This may be something they have seen before with something related to crime and danger, so their approach would be to assume it's a dangerous situation, such as a burglary,"" Nhan said. ""So in other words, it's difficult to say if and how much race has to do with these.""

Authorities are looking into what Aaron Dean, the Fort Worth police officer who killed Jefferson, and his partner were told before arriving at her home.

""The information came from the neighbor to the call-takers and while it was relayed to the dispatch, it was determined to be an 'open structure' call,"" Fort Worth interim Police Chief Ed Kraus told reporters earlier this week.

Experts say the classification of an ""open structure"" call -- about a home or building with a door left open -- escalated things beyond a wellness check and meant the officers would respond differently.

Dean resigned from the department on Monday, just hours before he was arrested and charged with murder. If Dean had not resigned, he would have been fired for several policy violations, including the department's use of force and de-escalation policies, and unprofessional conduct, Kraus said.

It's in law enforcement's best interest to fix this

It's important to law enforcement's legitimacy to get a handle on these types of incidents, Cedric L. Alexander, a past president of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, wrote in an op-ed for CNN Digital.

""Every police executive and every police officer knows, or should know, that while the law gives them their official authority, it is the public who gives them their legitimacy, which is their more immediate authority -- their street authority,"" Alexander writes.

""Legitimacy is granted when people are confident that the police are competent, just, reasonable, fair and courageous. Most of all, people want to be safe in their homes. When people feel they can count on the police to enhance their safety at home, they grant them legitimacy. When the police themselves threaten their safety, they withdraw that legitimacy.""

2016 study from the Pew Research Center seems to back up Alexander's message. It found that black people were half as likely as white people to think that their local police were doing a good job when it comes to using force, treating different racial and ethnic groups equally and holding officers accountable for misconduct. And overall blacks were less likely than whites to have confidence in their local police.

Alexander argues that law enforcement agencies need to do three things to stop regular wellness checks from turning into deadly situations. He says police departments must re-evaluate the kind of people they hire, take a hard look at how officers are trained and reassess the kind of leaders picked to supervise the police force.

Akkad, the New York mental health teacher, says tragedies like Jefferson's death can compound problems because they further erode the trust that communities have with the police, he said.

""It leaves communities in limbo of letting people die, because they don't know how to reach out to someone for help,"" he said.

It all comes down to training

Police departments across the nation have made attempts over the years to improve their training, diversify their ranks and educate law enforcement officers about minorities and their histories.

Police in Washington, DC, last year added a nearly 10-hour training program that includes a trip to the National Museum of African American History and Culture so that officers can learn about the historical interactions between law enforcement and minority communities.

Similar training programs have been established in Chicago, Philadelphia and by policing agencies and academies in California.

But the best training isn't good enough when law enforcement agencies hire the wrong kind of people, said Maria Haberfeld, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.

""It has to start with proper recruitment and selection, and for this departments need to make transformational changes,"" Haberfeld told CNN. ""Assess the potential candidates based on their emotional maturity rather than how many push-ups they can do in a minute.""

Agencies need to start recruitment at an older and more mature age, said Haberfeld, who added that training for recruits should include components of emotional intelligence and more realistic scenarios.

""It's there but just not enough,"" she said. ""It's like teaching algebra with offering the students just the most basic equation.

""Police training is a complex and complicated subject that needs to be delivered by academic experts together with practitioners -- at the same time,"" she added. ""Only this will generate the desired results."""

Rand Paul (R-KY), in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, responded to Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) naming him as her “surprising friend” during the fourth Democrat debate.

“Yes! I made the Democratic Debate, isn’t that great?” he joked. But more seriously, he said, “As a person, I like Kamala, and I think one of the things is that the media and the Internet have to make it where we all hate each other.”

“So I work with Kamala on some things like bail, I think things ought to be fair, I don’t think people ought to be locked up for life. I think poor people who can’t get an attorney shouldn’t rot in jail, whereas a rich person might get out — you know her parents or somebody might have money to get us out of jail,” he said about the former California attorney general.

“Poor people rot in jail sometimes when they’re innocent, and so I’ve worked with her on it and I think it’s one of those things that is misrepresented that we can’t get along. Doesn’t mean we agree, doesn’t mean we split the difference, but can’t we get along, can’t we go out and have a beer, get along, and you might be for something I’m not for, but we say, ‘Well she’s for that, I’m for something a little bit different, and we still can be friends,” he said.

He also weighed in on another 2020 Democrat candidate — and one he is ideologically diametrically opposed to on socialism, about which he just authored a book, titled, The Case Against Socialism.

“I don’t dislike them — I work with Bernie,” he said. “Much of the book is how I don’t like Bernie’s socialism, but on issues of war? I don’t like war and I don’t think we should be involved in most of the wars in the world and I’ve sided with him. I don’t want arming Saudi Arabia in the Yemen War. I think Yemen is one of the poorest countries on the planet. I don’t want to aid or abet any war there, so I work with him.”

Paul said politicians in Washington get along better than most people think, and slammed the “cesspool of hatred” on the Internet.

“The real cesspool of hatred is the Internet. Frankly, people on the Internet just — they’re anonymous and you read down all the comments and everybody’s hateful and it’s like, what are all these people doing, do they not have a life – all they got to do is spew hatred for people that they hate online?” he said.

He said he was glad Harris named him as her surprising friend.

“I was kind of glad that she threw it out, because I do want to be known as somebody who’s not unreasonable and can get along with people on the other side of the aisle.”

Happily, this five-years-later follow-up, ""Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,"" flies a bit higher, building on the central relationship while adding Michelle Pfeiffer's regal presence as a killer queen.

The first ""Maleficent"" actually felt somewhat out of step with Disney's live-action movie strategy, offering a revisionist take -- unlike mostly dutiful remakes like ""The Lion King"" or ""Aladdin"" -- that transformed the dark fairy into the good gal, one who grew to love Aurora, a.k.a. Sleeping Beauty.

Despite that ambition, it was a pretty lifeless affair, beyond the kick of seeing Angelina Jolie vamp it up in the title role, and the appealing notion (which also found a home in ""Frozen"") that ""true love"" -- the kind that can break a spell -- isn't merely the province of winsome maidens and handsome princes.

Opening six decades after the animated ""Sleeping Beauty,"" ""Mistress of Evil"" picks up several years later, and begins with a very decent proposal -- namely, Prince Philip (Harris Dickinson) asking Aurora (Elle Fanning) to live happily ever after with him. When he suggests they tell their parents, however, Aurora swallows hard at the thought.

Maleficent loves ""Beastie,"" as she still calls her, but isn't so thrilled about her marrying a, well, human. Philip's mom, Queen Ingrith (Pfeiffer), is equally unenthused, producing one of those uncomfortable meet-the-in-laws dinners, bringing some welcome humor into the movie.

The poll – taken October 13-16, 2019, among 888 registered voters in Iowa – showed the president leading both Warren and Biden in hypothetical general election matchups in Iowa, besting both candidates 51 percent to 49 percent.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), however, appeared to hold an advantage in a hypothetical matchup, leading the president by two points– 51 percent to Trump’s 49 percent. The margin of error is +/-3.2 percent, indicating that the race is in flux:

Sanders’ lead against the president comes in spite of the fact that he is not leading the Democrat field in the Hawkeye State. Rather, Warren and Biden are tied with 23 percent support each, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who garnered 16 percent support. Sanders fell to fourth place with 13 percent support, followed by Andrew Yang (D), Gov. Steve Bullock (D), and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with five percent, four percent, and three percent, respectively.

The results outlined the most trouble for Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who has tried to revive her floundering campaign by focusing on Iowa.

As Breitbart News detailed:

Harris signaled a switch in campaign strategies in September, telling a colleague that she is “f*cking moving to Iowa.” “‘I’m f*cking moving to Iowa’ – Kamala Harris,” read an email following the presidential hopeful’s quip. “She cut to the chase!” the email stated. “We’re doubling our organizers on the ground in Iowa and Kamala is ramping up her time on the trail there, beginning today in Cedar Rapids.” The following month, Harris launched her “I feel your pain” tour across Iowa, which featured the presidential hopeful speaking to Iowans in more “intimate” settings, even helping some “prepare Sunday suppers.”

Despite those efforts, she was only able to garner two percent support in the state, alongside Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and Tom Steyer (D):

The poll also showed that more Iowans oppose impeachment than support it, 48 percent to 42 percent:

10% Unsurehttps://t.co/CIjFwBESSE — Emerson Polling (@EmersonPolling) October 17, 2019

Impeachment does not appear to be a top priority among Iowans across the board, with only six percent considering it an important factor in choosing whom to support for president. Thirty-three percent said the economy, 19 percent said health care, and ten percent chose “social issues.”

“The Democrats have some work to do in Iowa convincing voters that impeachment is a top priority of Congress; 67% of Democrats in Iowa support impeaching the president, but only 10% identify it as the most important issue in deciding their vote for president,” Emerson Polling Director Spencer Kimball said."

What would a home on Mars look like? What sort of clothes would we wear on the Red Planet? And how would we grow our food? The answers to some of these questions are beautifully imagined in a new exhibition, ""Moving to Mars,"" at London's Design Museum.

The race is on for a successful manned mission to Mars, with NASA leading a pack of public and private institutions competing to be the first to land, including Elon Musk's Space X, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, Boeing, and the China National Space Administration.

NASA plans to launch a manned mission in the 2030s, a timeframe shared by other private groups, although this goal might be more aspirational than realistic. Many technologies required don't yet exist, including the spacecraft, which are either under development or at the prototype stage. What a Mars mission would look like is far from clear, with some teams planning to build a full-blown Martian habitat, while others foresee orbiting stations that could function as launch pads for limited trips to the surface. But it's not too early to dream, nor to start imagining how it will all take shape.

The interior of a proposed Mars habitat by London-based design firm Hassell.

Centered on the role that design will play in sending humans to Mars, the exhibition is rich with historical materials but also more forward-looking or speculative elements, with a wide range of works by designers from various fields.

Curator Eleanor Watson said the designs on show were response to questions about future Mars missions. ""Such as what would microgravity clothing need to look like, what would a Mars habitat look like, very speculative questions on what the planet might look in 1,000 or even 10,000 years,"" said Watson in a phone interview.

Among the experimental works is a fashion collection by sustainable design company RÆBURN, which imagines clothing to be used inside Martian habitats, tailored from recycled spacecraft materials.

The clothes are made from recycled parachutes and thermal blankets.

""At $18,000 per kilo of payload, sending stuff to Mars is expensive, so anything that you bring with you, you have to be able to reuse intelligently. All of the rovers that are being flown over, for example, come with landing parachutes. What are you gonna use these parachutes for after the landing? Well, one option would be to make all of the clothing for the astronauts from them,"" said Watson.

The RÆBURN collection.

The exhibition includes five architectural projects for potential Mars habitat modules, all derived from NASA's 3D Printing Habitat Challenge, a $3 million competition to build 3D-printed homes for deep space exploration. One of them, by London-based international design firm Hassell, is scaled up to full size, for people to get into and explore.

""Hassell very kindly agreed to make a one-to-one scale mockup of one of their modules and it's six meters in diameter. It includes a system that would allow you to reconfigure the space easily. They've created a group of six modules that link together and are covered by a shield to protect from radiation. These six modules are in a ring, so that you have an internal courtyard and when you're in one module, even though it's quite small, there's a big window and you can see across and see what other people are up to,"" said Watson.

The Hassell habitat includes hydroponics.

Outside of habitats, normal clothes won't cut it in the thin and unbreathable Martian atmosphere. Astonauts will need space suits, such as the NDX-1, one of the very first designed for Mars, by two University of North Dakota engineers, Gary L. Harris and Dr de Leon. Compared to suits designed for the Apollo Moon program, for example, Mars suits would need to be much more flexible, as they would be worn for months or even years rather than just days.

The NDX-1 suit.

Currently, exploration of Mars is done solely by robots, and there have been four successful landings of rovers on the surface of the planet, with only one of them, Curiosity, still operational. The exhibition includes a replica of Rosalind Franklin, a Mars rover that will be launched in 2020 by the European Space Agency and will land in 2021. It's named after an English scientist who made crucial discoveries about DNA, and was previously known as ExoMars. ""It's a lab on wheels and it's going to drill quite far down into the Martian surface, to try and find traces of life,"" said Watson.

The Rosalind Franklin.

Among the historical documents on display is the very first map of Mars, drawn by Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli in 1877. He identified darker and lighter features of the map as seas and continents. ""He also famously described the straight lines he saw on the surface as canali, which then was translated as ""canals"" rather than ""channels"" and sparked the canal craze that led to the misconception that there might be or have been intelligent life on Mars,"" said Watson.

The interactive components of the show will focus on a multi-sensory experience designed to simulate the conditions on the surface of Mars, complete with smells and sound, and a family trail that invites visitors of all ages to solve their own design challenges, by completing tasks set by experts including British astronaut Tim Peake.

While Mars has always been a fascinating subject for scientists, designers and dreamers alike, interest for the Red Planet has reached its peak in recent years. That might be down to the fact that the technologies required to go there are now mature. But it's also due to the current state of our own planet, argues Watson.

""The climate crisis is -- rightly -- frightening a lot of people, and there is a tendency to think of Mars as a sort of escape hatch for humanity, a planet B, which is very dangerous and problematic,"" said Watson.

""But I think that the endeavor is worthwhile, because all the technologies required to develop a mission to Mars, such as zero waste habitats and sustainable farming, have very tangible earth applications that we need right now."""

The Hill reported Friday:

Spending on private flights by Democratic presidential candidates soared over the past three months, from roughly $680,000 in the second quarter to more than $2.2 million in the third fundraising period of the year. Topping the spending list was former Vice President Joe Biden, who dropped about $924,000 on private air travel … South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg spent nearly $479,000 on private flights over the past three months, up from roughly $300,000 in the second quarter. And Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) used about $253,000 in campaign cash to charter flights, significantly more than the $17,000 she spent in the second quarter. The Democratic primary field’s leading progressives, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), also saw their private air travel spending swell in the three-month fundraising period. … Other candidates who dropped campaign cash on private flights include Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, who spent about $40,500; Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who spent about $23,000; and former tech executive Andrew Yang, who spent just under $26,000.

Biden, Buttigieg, Harris, Sanders, Warren, Klobuchar, and Yang all support the “Green New Deal,” a plan introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) in February that calls for the elimination of fossil fuels by 2030. Of those listed above, only Bullock opposes the plan, calling it “resolution aspiration” at the second debate.

A typical private jet flight on a Cessna Citation XLS jet seating seven passengers would burn just under one ton of carbon per person — about 20% of the average annual global per capita consumption, and about one third of what the total annual per capita consumption of carbon ought to be, according to calculations by the Sierra Club in 2015.

The New York Times reported this week that the gender non-conforming Dillon is calling on the Television Academy to drop gendered acting categories from the Emmys, telling the newspaper in an interview, “I presume no one has asked them directly to make that change, so perhaps this is the right moment… What are the first steps that need to be taken to make that change? Call me. Email me. Let’s get it done.”

A spokesman for the Television Academy told the Times that while the organization “celebrates inclusiveness,” it has no plans to make that change.

The Oscars and the Tony Awards are also expected to maintain separate awards for actors and actresses.

The one award show that has done away with gendered categories is the MTV Movie & TV Awards. The Viacom-owned MTV announced in 2017 that its flagship awards show would eliminate gender-specific categories for the first time.

Instead of categories like “Best Actress” and “Best Actor,” the show honors “Best Actor in a Movie” and “Best Actor in a Show.”

Dillon plays the gender non-binary character Taylor Mason in Showtime’s Billions, and chose to be submitted for Emmy consideration in the supporting actor category two years ago. Dillon, who has so far failed to earn an Emmy nomination, was born female and but now identifies as non-binary and uses the pronoun “they.”

“If we separated categories by the colors of eyes, hair or skin, people would go, ‘This is unacceptable,’” Dillon told the Times. “That’s how I feel about gender categories. At this point, it feels unacceptable and unnecessary and archaic.”

Opponents of such a measure said that men would end up dominating non-gendered acting categories.

“It’s placing this huge bet that sexism is so solved that it doesn’t need to be paid attention to anymore,” Mark Harris, the writer and entertainment journalist, told the Times. “It’s so solved even though a vast majority of voters in awards groups are men. It’s so solved even though actresses have absolutely no shortage of important and fascinating things to say about the way gender inequities persist in the industry.”

The John Wick 3 star kicked off the MTV Movie & TV Awards night by presenting the award for Best Actor in a Movie.

“This year has been full of firsts for me. I am the first openly non-binary actor to play a non-binary character on a major television show,” Dillon said. “And now it’s so cool to be here presenting the first acting award ever that celebrates performance free of any gender distinction.”

Think tanks The Bow Group and The Bruges Group, along with the pro-Brexit pressure group Fishing for Leave, have joined the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) in opposing the government’s new EU-approved proposed exit treaty. The Bruges Group’s chairman Barry Legg called it a “defective agreement”, while Fishing for Leave’s Aaron Brown labelled it “Brexit in Name Only”.

Chairman of The Bow Group, the UK’s oldest conservative think tank, Ben Harris-Quinney said: “We were open-minded to a new deal and would support any deal that fulfils the terms of the Brexit vote with Britain leaving the EU in full, as well as both the Single Market and Customs Union.

“This deal does not do that. Serious concerns remain over Northern Ireland and future regulatory alignment with the EU the UK would be forced to comply to. We oppose this deal and call on conservative and Brexit supporting MPs to vote against it to push for a managed no-deal settlement on October 31st.”

On Thursday morning, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and president of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker announced that the two sides had agreed on an exit treaty. Later that evening, the EU27 endorsed the deal, and MPs will be voting on it in the House of Commons on Saturday.

The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier outlined some of the arrangements for dealing with the Irish border issue: Northern Ireland will be part of a “limited” set of EU rules related to goods, and while remaining in the UK’s customs territory, would be an entry point into the EU’s Single Market. What would be of significant objection to the DUP is that that the party has lost its veto over whether new Northern Ireland arrangements come into force.

While some Eurosceptics may have softened to the deal — in preference over a clean-break Brexit — the Northern Irish DUP has said it was “unable to support these proposals in parliament”, adding they “undermine the integrity of the union”.

DUP MP Sammy Wilson called on his Conservative colleagues to “take a stand for the Union and join us in rejecting this deal. Internal and burdensome trade barriers will be erected within the UK without parallel consent from both unionists and nationalists. This is not Brexit.”

Mr Harris-Quinney continued in the statement that the Bow Group believes the proposed deal “fails to achieve sovereign independence of all the United Kingdom whilst committing to send in excess of £39 billion to the EU”.

The think tank also warned that the Political Declaration — which sets out the future relationship between the UK and EU — opens up the UK to regulatory alignment with the bloc as well as military cooperation, spending commitments, and abiding by Brussels’ financial regulations “which would potentially allow the EU and our parliament to further neuter Brexit”.

“A no-deal Brexit remains the closest to honouring the Brexit vote and preventing its overturning by an unrepresentative parliament. That is the cause Brexiteer and conservative MPs should be committed to. The Bow Group, The Bruges Group, and Fishing for Leave call on them to listen to the people outside of Westminster and do so,” he concluded."

Rep. Biggs wanted to force a vote on the legislation this week but delayed the move after House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-MD) passed away. The Arizona conservative will reportedly force the vote Monday night.

The legislation to condemn Rep. Schiff has quickly gained support from House GOP across the political spectrum. House Freedom Caucus conservatives, moderates, and House Republican leadership have all cosponsored the legislation.

Since Biggs introduced the legislation in late September, the bill quickly gained 18 cosponsors. Now, the bill features support from 88 percent of the House Republican Conference.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA), and House Republican Conference chairwoman Liz Cheney (R-WY) have sponsored the resolution to condemn Schiff.

(CNN) Tuesday's Democratic debate featured something we have never witnessed before on a presidential debate stage: 15 full minutes of open back-and-forth about how the government should contend with the increasing power of Silicon Valley .

At the center of the exchange was a tussle between Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has been pushing for the break-up of tech giants like Facebook and Google, and Sen. Kamala Harris, who pointedly asked whether Warren would join her in demanding that Twitter suspend President Donald Trump's account on the platform.

This debate moment set the stage for what will doubtless be an election-long spat over what form regulations against internet companies should take.

This is a highly-charged and heavily politicized question, particularly for Democratic candidates. Last month, Facebook formalized a bold new policy that shocked many observers, announcing that the company would not seek to fact-check or censor politicians -- including in the context of paid political advertising, and even during an election season.

Over the past few days, this decree has pushed US political advertising into something like the Wild West: President Donald Trump, who will likely face the Democratic candidate in next year's general election, has already taken the opportunity to spread political lies with no accountability.

A frightening new world of political communication

In the aftermath of Facebook's announcement, Trump's presidential campaign disseminated an advertisement on Facebook's platform claiming that 2020 Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden had used his power as vice president to try to influence Ukraine to help his son, Hunter Biden.

The ""facts"" behind the Trump advertisement implicating Biden — which has been viewed on Facebook no fewer than five million times — have been definitively debunked , and CNN declined to air the ad for that reason.

This new Facebook policy opens a frightening new world for political communication — and for national politics. It is now the case that leading politicians can openly spread political lies without repercussion. Indeed, the Trump campaign was already spreading other falsehoods through online advertising immediately before Facebook made its announcement — and as one might predict, most of those advertisements have not been removed from the platform.

Should our politicians fail to reform regulations for internet platforms and digital advertising, our political future will be at risk. The 2016 election revealed the tremendous harm to the American democratic process that can result from coordinated misinformation campaigns ; 2020 will be far worse if we do nothing to contain the capacity for politicians to lie on social media.

The same capabilities by which political campaigns sliced up audience segments in 2016 via Facebook's advertisements will continue to exist in 2020. The difference will be that this time, the lies can be distributed by agents of the Trump campaign, instead of shell accounts operated by the Russian government and others.

Facebook's derogation of fact-checking will thus only lend greater credibility to coordinated disinformation operations — as in the case of the recent Trump campaign ad.

Warren responded to the Trump ad with a cheeky point: In an ad she has circulated over Facebook, she claims that ""Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election."" Later in the ad, she acknowledges this is a falsehood, and contends that ""what [Mark] Zuckerberg has done is given Donald Trump free rein to lie on his platform — and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters.""

Warren's mockery of the ad — and of the underlying policy that allowed its dissemination — helps illuminate how Facebook's new policy will have grave implications for our political future. Facebook's decision not to take down the Trump ad amounts to knowingly enabling the insidious political manipulation of American voters.

Facebook's power and ""free expression""

The irony is that Facebook already censors advertisements -- including those placed by presidential campaigns in the United States -- for a host of reasons. One investigation found that the company had taken down paid content from four of the Democratic candidates, including 117 ads that had been placed by the Biden campaign, for reasons ranging from the use of profanity to the display of fake buttons.

It is disconcerting to think that by fiat, Facebook can deem a political ad to be dishonest because it contains fake buttons (which can deceive the viewer into clicking on a survey button when in fact there is no interactive feature in the ad), but the company will refuse to take action against ads containing widely-debunked political lies, even during an American presidential election.

This perilous inconsistency in Facebook's policy decisions is a sign that its corporate power has grown too great. Concern for the public interest and the health of our democracy should compel us to action. And the only entity that has the power to do anything to improve the situation for the American people is Congress.

Facebook has one principal counterargument against regulation: that the company must maintain strong commitments to free speech and freedom of political expression. This came across in Mark Zuckerberg's speech at Georgetown University on Thursday, in which he described social media as a kind of ""Fifth Estate"" and characterized politicians' calls to take action as an attempt to restrict freedom of expression. Quoting at times from Frederick Douglass and Supreme Court jurisprudence, Zuckerberg said ""we are at a crossroads"" and asserted: ""When it's not absolutely clear what to do, we should err on the side of free expression.""

Unfortunately for Facebook, this argument holds little water. If you determine that an ad containing a fake button is non-compliant because it ""[entices] users to select an answer,"" then you certainly should not knowingly broadcast ads that entice voters to unwittingly consume publicly-known lies -- whether they are distributed by the President or any other politician. Indeed, as one official in Biden's presidential campaign has noted , Zuckerberg's argumentation amounts to an insidious ""choice to cloak Facebook's policy in a feigned concern for free expression"" to ""use the Constitution as a shield for his company's bottom line.""

Behind what the company claims to be a commitment to free speech lies a commercial convenience.

Regulatory policy is the way forward

If Facebook cannot take appropriate action and remove paid political lies from its platform, the only answer must be earnest regulation of the company -- regulation that forces Facebook to be transparent about the nature of political ads and prevents it from propagating political falsehoods, even if they are enthusiastically distributed by President Trump.

Elizabeth Warren committed for the first time on Sunday to putting out a plan detailing how ""Medicare for All"" would be funded, after facing criticism and being pressed on how she would pay for the national health insurance plan without raising taxes on the middle class.

""We need to talk about the cost, and I plan, over the next few weeks, to put out a plan that talks about specifically the cost of 'Medicare for All' and specifically how we pay for it,"" Warren said at a town hall in Indianola, Iowa, on Sunday. She told the crowd gathered that the plan ""is something I've been working for months and months, and it's got just a little more work until it's finished, but I want to bring this out.""

""I think there have been many estimates about what the cost will be, and many different payment streams, and I've been working on how to give the exact details to make that work,"" the Democrat told reporters on Sunday, adding later that she's ""ready to put out a plan soon on exactly what the costs will be, and how to pay for it.""

Warren's campaign said last week it was studying a range of options for paying for Medicare for All, leaving open the possibility that the senator may ultimately diverge from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders on how to pay for his sweeping health care plan -- which Warren has endorsed. Warren has not outlined her own health care plan , and instead is running on Sanders' single-payer legislation that she first signed on to in 2017.

Warren spoke for more than an hour at the event in Indianola before making the announcement. The campaign hoped she would simply mention her upcoming plan when asked about health care, but Warren was not asked the question at the town hall so she delivered this pre-planned message at the end of the event.

PERIOD.""

It's a sentiment some African Americans are expressing on social media and elsewhere since Atatiana Jefferson , a 28-year-old black woman, was shot and killed last weekend by a Fort Worth, Texas, police officer who was conducting a wellness check at her home.

DJ Cunningham, a clinical psychology doctoral student in New Jersey, called Jefferson's fatal shooting an ""eye-opener.""

In an interview with CNN, he said the incident -- and the 2018 accidental killing of a black man in his home by a Dallas police officer -- have made him more cautious at home.

""This could easily be me. Someone could stumble into the wrong apartment after a long shift and 'bam' -- I'm not able to talk to my mom again,"" said Cunningham, who urged his followers on Twitter to never call the cops if they wanted to check on him.

""It makes you recognize your blackness,"" he added. ""You're almost instantly seen as a threat as opposed to a kid or another member of society.""

For many black Americans, Jefferson's fatal shooting has revealed yet another sobering facet of modern life. Blacks have long feared interactions with police while driving. And recent years have seen a litany of incidents in which African Americans have been questioned or detained by police while going about their daily business

But now some blacks say they are increasingly worried about the dangers of confronting police in their own homes.

Achmat Akkad, a mental health first aid teacher in New York, told CNN he's experienced wellness checks himself. Often officers respond as if the people they are checking on have done something wrong, he said.

""Just their presence when you open your door, especially as a black male, that can be very frightening,"" he said.

For these Americans and others, it creates yet another layer of mistrust between law enforcement and the black community.

It's not the first time this type of thing has happened

In recent years there have been other incidents, similar to Jefferson's, in which black people were killed during a wellness check.

One of them was the 2011 shooting death of Kenneth Chamberlain Sr., a 68-year-old former Marine with a severe heart condition who accidentally set off a medical-alert pendant. When police showed up at his White Plains, New York, apartment, they say he refused to open the door. A police report states Chamberlain stuck an 8-inch butcher knife through a crack in the door and jammed it shut with a chair when officers tried to enter. Police then forced open the door and used a Taser, bean-bag bullets and finally live bullets after Chamberlain approached an officer with the knife raised.

In 2015 James Allen, a 74-year-old Army vet from Gastonia, North Carolina, was killed by a police officer after firefighters forced his door open during a wellness check, CNN affiliate WSOC reported. An officer shot Allen after the vet pointed a gun at him. ""I think that he probably thought somebody was breaking in his house or robbing him,"" Allen's sister, Mary Battle, told the TV station.

Douglas Harris , a 77-year-old Birmingham, Alabama, man, was shot by police in February 2015 after officers went to his apartment for a wellness check. Harris' son had asked for the safety check, the Birmingham News reported, but Harris answered the door holding a gun aimed at an officer. Harris died a month after he was shot.

Jordan refused to come to the door when officers arrived, then stepped onto his porch holding a knife. After he stepped toward the officers, they opened fire.

It's not clear if race is the reason

Are black people really more in danger of being killed during a wellness check?

There hasn't been enough research on the subject to prove that, says Johnny Nhan, a criminal justice professor at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth. He says it's complicated because there are lots of factors that can turn a wellness check into a police shooting, such as if the person is armed, if they attack an officer or if they have a mental illness.

""In general, however, if you're talking about police bias against blacks and other minorities, that has been an ongoing issue that we're still trying to understand,"" Nhan told CNN. ""There has been research in the past few years on implicit bias and the idea that black people are perceived of as more dangerous than whites.""

Jefferson was playing video games with her nephew in the back bedroom of her home late at night when they heard noises coming from outside, according to court documents. She then pulled her handgun from her purse, her nephew told police, and was pointing it toward a window when she was shot by an officer who was outside the house.

Nhan says the officers seemed to approach the situation at Jefferson's house as being more dangerous than just a run-of-the-mill wellness.

""The officer(s) I'm guessing is thinking this is 2:30 at night, the door is open, etc. This may be something they have seen before with something related to crime and danger, so their approach would be to assume it's a dangerous situation, such as a burglary,"" Nhan said. ""So in other words, it's difficult to say if and how much race has to do with these.""

Authorities are looking into what Aaron Dean, the Fort Worth police officer who killed Jefferson, and his partner were told before arriving at her home.

""The information came from the neighbor to the call-takers and while it was relayed to the dispatch, it was determined to be an 'open structure' call,"" Fort Worth interim Police Chief Ed Kraus told reporters earlier this week.

Experts say the classification of an ""open structure"" call -- about a home or building with a door left open -- escalated things beyond a wellness check and meant the officers would respond differently.

Dean resigned from the department on Monday, just hours before he was arrested and charged with murder. If Dean had not resigned, he would have been fired for several policy violations, including the department's use of force and de-escalation policies, and unprofessional conduct, Kraus said.

It's in law enforcement's best interest to fix this

It's important to law enforcement's legitimacy to get a handle on these types of incidents, Cedric L. Alexander, a past president of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, wrote in an op-ed for CNN Digital.

""Every police executive and every police officer knows, or should know, that while the law gives them their official authority, it is the public who gives them their legitimacy, which is their more immediate authority -- their street authority,"" Alexander writes.

""Legitimacy is granted when people are confident that the police are competent, just, reasonable, fair and courageous. Most of all, people want to be safe in their homes. When people feel they can count on the police to enhance their safety at home, they grant them legitimacy. When the police themselves threaten their safety, they withdraw that legitimacy.""

2016 study from the Pew Research Center seems to back up Alexander's message. It found that black people were half as likely as white people to think that their local police were doing a good job when it comes to using force, treating different racial and ethnic groups equally and holding officers accountable for misconduct. And overall blacks were less likely than whites to have confidence in their local police.

Alexander argues that law enforcement agencies need to do three things to stop regular wellness checks from turning into deadly situations. He says police departments must re-evaluate the kind of people they hire, take a hard look at how officers are trained and reassess the kind of leaders picked to supervise the police force.

Akkad, the New York mental health teacher, says tragedies like Jefferson's death can compound problems because they further erode the trust that communities have with the police, he said.

""It leaves communities in limbo of letting people die, because they don't know how to reach out to someone for help,"" he said.

It all comes down to training

Police departments across the nation have made attempts over the years to improve their training, diversify their ranks and educate law enforcement officers about minorities and their histories.

Police in Washington, DC, last year added a nearly 10-hour training program that includes a trip to the National Museum of African American History and Culture so that officers can learn about the historical interactions between law enforcement and minority communities.

Similar training programs have been established in Chicago, Philadelphia and by policing agencies and academies in California.

But the best training isn't good enough when law enforcement agencies hire the wrong kind of people, said Maria Haberfeld, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.

""It has to start with proper recruitment and selection, and for this departments need to make transformational changes,"" Haberfeld told CNN. ""Assess the potential candidates based on their emotional maturity rather than how many push-ups they can do in a minute.""

Agencies need to start recruitment at an older and more mature age, said Haberfeld, who added that training for recruits should include components of emotional intelligence and more realistic scenarios.

""It's there but just not enough,"" she said. ""It's like teaching algebra with offering the students just the most basic equation.

""Police training is a complex and complicated subject that needs to be delivered by academic experts together with practitioners -- at the same time,"" she added. ""Only this will generate the desired results."""

Rand Paul (R-KY), in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, responded to Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) naming him as her “surprising friend” during the fourth Democrat debate.

“Yes! I made the Democratic Debate, isn’t that great?” he joked. But more seriously, he said, “As a person, I like Kamala, and I think one of the things is that the media and the Internet have to make it where we all hate each other.”

“So I work with Kamala on some things like bail, I think things ought to be fair, I don’t think people ought to be locked up for life. I think poor people who can’t get an attorney shouldn’t rot in jail, whereas a rich person might get out — you know her parents or somebody might have money to get us out of jail,” he said about the former California attorney general.

“Poor people rot in jail sometimes when they’re innocent, and so I’ve worked with her on it and I think it’s one of those things that is misrepresented that we can’t get along. Doesn’t mean we agree, doesn’t mean we split the difference, but can’t we get along, can’t we go out and have a beer, get along, and you might be for something I’m not for, but we say, ‘Well she’s for that, I’m for something a little bit different, and we still can be friends,” he said.

He also weighed in on another 2020 Democrat candidate — and one he is ideologically diametrically opposed to on socialism, about which he just authored a book, titled, The Case Against Socialism.

“I don’t dislike them — I work with Bernie,” he said. “Much of the book is how I don’t like Bernie’s socialism, but on issues of war? I don’t like war and I don’t think we should be involved in most of the wars in the world and I’ve sided with him. I don’t want arming Saudi Arabia in the Yemen War. I think Yemen is one of the poorest countries on the planet. I don’t want to aid or abet any war there, so I work with him.”

Paul said politicians in Washington get along better than most people think, and slammed the “cesspool of hatred” on the Internet.

“The real cesspool of hatred is the Internet. Frankly, people on the Internet just — they’re anonymous and you read down all the comments and everybody’s hateful and it’s like, what are all these people doing, do they not have a life – all they got to do is spew hatred for people that they hate online?” he said.

He said he was glad Harris named him as her surprising friend.

“I was kind of glad that she threw it out, because I do want to be known as somebody who’s not unreasonable and can get along with people on the other side of the aisle.”

Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) is taking the fight to Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party establishment after a spat Friday in which the party’s 2016 presidential nominee claimed Gabbard was a Russian puppet.

In a video released Sunday on Twitter, Gabbard talks about the origins of her long-simmering feud with Democratic leaders, dating back to her support for the insurgent campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in 2016.

Gabbard resigned from her post within the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in protest at the way then-chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) was treating Sanders. Her concerns were later vindicated by Wikileaks, which released emails showing that party leaders had conspired to help Clinton secure the nomination, forcing Schultz to resign.

In Sunday’s video, Gabbard recalls: “People warned me in 2016 that my endorsement of Bernie Sanders would be the end of my ‘political career.’ They said, ‘Clinton will never forget,’ that ‘she and her rich and powerful friends, her allies in politics and the media, will make sure that you are destroyed.'”

Hillary & her gang of rich, powerful elite are going after me to send a msg to YOU: “Shut up, toe the line, or be destroyed.” But we, the people, will NOT be silenced.

Gibbered then refers to the “countless hit pieces” against her in the mainstream media, the most recent of which was an Oct. 11 article in the New York Times painting Gabbard as a right-wing extremist. (The Times hosted the fourth primary debate just three days later, and the article — which lacked any evidence — was seen by some as an effort to marginalize Gabbard after she had attacked Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) effectively in the second debate.)

Citing her 16 years of military service in the U.S. Army National Guard, and her congressional service on national security committees, Gabbard rebukes Clinton and others for “falsely portray[ing] me as a traitor.”

Clinton claimed in a podcast hosted by former Barack Obama 2008 campaign manager David Plouffe last week that Gabbard was a “Russian asset” likely to run as a third-party candidate. She cited no evidence to back up her claim — which Gabbard promptly rejected, calling Clinton the “queen of the warmongers” and blaming her for a string of media smears.

In her video, Gabbard goes on to say that the message of the party establishment is that “if you stand up against Hillary and the party power brokers, if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message.”

“They will not intimidate us,” she declares. “The will not silence us.”

Gabbard goes on to say that not only is she running against corruption, but against the Democratic Party elite.

“I’m running for president to bring about a New Democratic Party, a new leadership that will fight for peace, fight for the people, and protect our planet.”

Separately the Gabbard campaign sent fundraising emails over the weekend capitalizing on the confrontation with Hillary Clinton. The email from Gabbard read, in part (original emphasis):

Hillary Clinton — the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long — finally came out from behind the curtain yesterday, accusing me of being a Russian asset, asserting I was being “groomed” by Russian interests. If this a fight she wants to have, one that has implications for all of us and the future of our democracy, then I challenge her to come out from behind her proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media, and face me directly.

Gabbard has struggled to escape the second tier of presidential candidates, and failed to qualify for the third debate in September. However, she has made an impact in each debate appearance, partly because of her strong anti-war stance, and partly because of her willingness to attack other candidates’ positions — something few others have been bold enough to do until recently.

Though she supported Sanders in 2016, Gabbard has more moderate positions on several issues. She does not believe in decriminalizing illegal border crossings, for example, and would restrict many abortions in the third trimester — a position widely shared by the American public but which few of her rivals would dare to take.

She has come under fire in recent years for her opposition to U.S. military involvement in Syria — a position she has pursued, in part, through a controversial visit to Syrian dictator Bashar Assad in 2017. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi made a similar visit in 2007.

Then, on Friday, Hillary Clinton herself kept the smear campaign going, saying in a podcast hosted by Barack Obama’s former campaign manager David Plouffe that Russia is grooming Gabbard to be a third party candidate.

“I’m not making any predictions, but I think they’ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,” Clinton said. “She’s the favorite of the Russians.”

Gabbard lashed back at the Democratic Party’s 2016 presidential nominee, tweeting in response, “Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain.”

Days before Gabbard appeared on the debate stage in Ohio, she had threatened to boycott the event, because she believes the DNC is rigged against outsider candidates such as herself. She declared that the Democratic National Committee and the “corporate media” were “trying to hijack the entire election process.”

Among other reasons, Gabbard argued that the polls the DNC chose for certifying the candidates for the November debate were not as accurate as many of the non-certified polls that could actually help her qualify. So far, the only candidates who have qualified for November are former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

But the media smears, and the evident bias of the debate hosts, were the driving force.

Two days after Gabbard’s threat, the New York Times published what she called “ a greatest hits smear piece.” Gabbard later noted: “These are the folks who will be acting as the neutral questioners/moderators of Tuesday’s debate lol!”

At the debate itself, Gabbard took aim at the hosts: “Just two days ago the New York Times put out an article saying that I’m a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning a CNN commentator said on national television that I’m an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.”

It was actually very kind of Gabbard to not mention the name attached to the CNN smear. Bakari Sellers said hours before the event that he firmly believed that Tulsi is a ‘puppet for the Russian government.”

The fact is that Gabbard, a reservist in the U.S. Army National Guard who took time off her campaign to drill with her unit this summer, is more cautious about the use of military force than other candidates. For that, she is being attacked as a traitor.

But it is a stance that has appeal to members of both parties who are weary of interventionist foreign policies.

Another political outsider, former Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX), is a Tulsi Gabbard fan. Paul praised Gabbard when he said, “She’s the most intelligent and would be the best. “ He also said, “If we had to pick one of them [Democrats] to be our president I think she would be giving us the best chance as for bringing about peace.”

Gabbard is a proud veteran who founded and is the co-chair of the Congressional Post 9/11 Veteran Caucus, which demonstrates her continual work in defending the work her military brothers and sisters continue to do to fight for their country.

At the debate, when Gabbard calmly asked if she could ask Warren a question, she was cut off. Silenced by the very media who smeared her, as if to protect Warren.

Yet Gabbard, as after the second debate, was the most googled candidate after the candidates left the stage.

Apparently American want to hear more from Tulsi despite the smears. The Times called Gabbard’s supporters “unusual Americans”; that has now become a rallying cry.

These “Unusual Amerians” include the ”unconventional mix of anti-interventionist progressives, libertarians, [and] contrarian culture-war skeptics…” that the Times mocked as Gabbard’s base by associating them with extremists.

Gabbard delivered a powerful response in her closing statement at the debate: “I don’t see deplorables. I see fellow Americans worthy of respect even when we disagree strongly.”

Gabbard’s use of the word “deplorables” was a clear allusion Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables,” a phrase that the former secretary of state used to tarnish her opponent’s supporters back in 2016. It came back to haunt Clinton — as will her declaration that Gabbard is Russia’s favorite.

Gabbard, unlike Clinton and many of the presidential hopefuls in 2020, has sacrificed for her country through her military service in a combat zone, and understands the cost of war from first-hand experience.

That is the simple secret of her appeal. It is amazing how far the corporate media and the party establishment will go in their attempt to stop that message from breaking through.

Altuve homered off Aroldis Chapman with two outs in the ninth inning and Houston outlasted the New York Yankees 6-4 Saturday night to advance to the World Series for the second time in three years.

“That’s one of the best moments of postseason history,” Houston general manager Jeff Luhnow said.

In a bullpen Game 6 with a back-and-forth finish, DJ LeMahieu hit a tying, two-run shot off Astros closer Roberto Osuna in the top of the ninth. Altuve answered with a two-run drive to left-center, setting off a wild celebration at Minute Maid Park and earning himself AL Championship Series MVP.

“Beautiful game,” Altuve said.

“I was thanking God” Jose Altuve is a true role model and deserves the #mvp https://t.co/3XHNI6BVJj — Kelli Bias (@kelli_rawls) October 20, 2019

Astros ace Gerrit Cole was waiting to pitch a potential Game 7 on Sunday. Instead, the postseason star — undefeated since May 22 — can be lined up for Game 1 at home against the NL champion Washington Nationals on Tuesday night.

Yuli Gurriel hit a three-run homer in the first inning, and flashy outfield defense helped Houston’s relievers defeat the Yankees and their vaunted bullpen.

It almost fell apart in the ninth. Gio Urshela singled off Osuna leading off for his third hit of the game, and LeMahieu put a ball into the first row of seats in right field — inches over the glove of leaping George Springer — to tie it at 4.

Altuve, a sparkplug touted as Houston’s heart and soul, didn’t let this one get away.

“I get asked to describe Jose Altuve all the time,” manager AJ Hinch said. “I think MVP is what he is.”

The teams combined to use 14 pitchers in a drawn-out game that lasted 4 hours, 9 minutes.

Houston’s Will Harris, who got four outs over the sixth and seventh innings and has yet to allow a run this postseason, was glad Houston’s bullpen got to show its stuff.

“We have a lot of guys with a lot of pride that are really good at their jobs,” he said. “And I was excited for the opportunity for us to prove that today.”

The defense helped. Right fielder Josh Reddick dived for Brett Gardner’s liner for the second out of the sixth. An inning later, left fielder Michael Brantley laid out for Aaron Hicks’ shallow floater and doubled off Aaron Judge at first.

Gurriel, a holdover from Houston’s 2017 championship team, was 1 for 20 to start the ALCS before his drive in the first inning. He jumped all over a high-and-tight fastball from opener Chad Green, and his shot into the Crawford Boxes was his first connection this postseason.

It’s the third time Houston has eliminated New York in the past five postseasons. The Astros won the 2015 wild-card game in the Bronx and beat the Yankees in seven games in the 2017 ALCS before winning their first title.

“I feel like we are on equal footing with them,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. “Unfortunately, sports can be a little bit cruel for the team that goes home.”

Washington is seeking its first championship in the 51-season history of the Montreal Expos/Nationals franchise. The original Washington Senators won their only championship for the nation’s capital in 1924 and last reached the World Series in 1933 before becoming the Minnesota Twins for the 1961 season.

Gary Sánchez had an RBI single in the second and Urshela homered in the fourth for the Yankees.

Alex Bregman gave the Astros an insurance run with an RBI on a forceout in the sixth inning.

Brantley’s double play elicited one of the loudest ovations of the night — before Altuve’s blast — from the sellout crowd of 43,357 which included Hall of Famers Nolan Ryan and Craig Biggio and Rockets stars James Harden and Russell Westbrook, who watched from the front row in personalized orange Astros jerseys.

New York was 1 for 6 with runners in scoring position and 3 for 24 over the final five games of the series. The franchise lost its fourth straight ALCS after falling in 2010, 2012 and 2017. The Yankees will go without a World Series appearance in a calendar decade for the first time since the 1910s.

“The work never ends,” Boone said. “And we’ll continue to try and I guess close that gap.”

Altuve doubled off Green with one out in the first inning and Bregman drew a walk with two outs. After a short visit to the mound, Gurriel knocked the next pitch into the seats in left field for a 3-0 lead. The runs were Houston’s first with two outs in the series.

Houston had been 4 for 40 with runners in scoring position before that big swing.

Brad Peacock, who threw eight pitches in a scoreless eighth inning Friday night, became the fourth pitcher ever to finish a postseason game and then start the next day, and the first since 1924.

He needed seven pitches to retire the side in the first before running into trouble with two outs in the second. Josh James ended the inning by striking out Gardner.

Ryan Pressly had another gutsy escape, too. He hurt his right knee again fielding a bases-loaded grounder by Didi Gregorius but limped over to tag him for the final out of the third. Pressly, who grimaced as he went toward the dugout after one pitch, had arthroscopic surgery on the same knee on Aug. 22 and returned Sept. 20. Pressly also got two strikeouts with the bases loaded in Game 4.

He said that some scar tissue broke off on the play but that he’ll be ready to go this week.

“It’s the World Series,” Hinch said. “It will be all hands on deck.”"

And they're here to meddle with 2020,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/21/tech/russia-instagram-accounts-2020-election/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) People linked to the Internet Research Agency, the Kremlin-backed troll group indicted by the United States for its alleged interference in the 2016 US presidential election , are laying the groundwork to do the same in 2020, new information released by Facebook on Monday suggests.

Profiles originating in Russia had since the beginning of this year been building a network of accounts on Instagram designed to look like groups in swing states, the company said . Instagram is owned by

Although the accounts posed as Americans from all sides of the political spectrum, many were united in their opposition to the candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden, according to Graphika , a social media investigations company that Facebook asked to analyze the accounts. The Russian trolls who used social media to interfere in the 2016 election employed a similar tactic , going after Hillary Clinton from the right and also trying to spread a perception on the left that Clinton was not liberal enough and that liberals and African Americans especially shouldn't bother voting for her.

The accounts Facebook revealed Monday, 50 of which were on Instagram and one of which was on Facebook, were designed to look like they were advocating on a broad range of issues across American life.

Accounts with usernames like @black.queen.chloe and @michigan_black_community_ looked like they were run by black activists. There were also pro and anti-Trump accounts, and accounts posing as feminists, LGBTQ rights advocates, and environmentalists. Other account names included @stop.trump2020, @bernie.2020__, @iowa.patriot, and @feminist_agenda_, according to Graphika.

Facebook said the accounts combined had more than 250,000 followers, more than half of which were based in the U.S. Facebook did not disclose how many of those followers were real and how many might have been fake or bot accounts designed to make the main accounts look more legitimate. Facebook says it has removed the accounts.

""It looked like there was a systematic focus on attacking Biden from both sides,"" Graphika director of investigations Ben Nimmo, who analyzed the accounts, told CNN Business.

In a statement responding to the news, Biden campaign spokesman TJ Ducklo said, ""We applaud Facebook for disclosing the existence of these fake accounts and shutting them down. ... [But] Donald Trump continues to benefit from spreading false information, all the while Facebook profits from amplifying his lies and debunked conspiracy theories on their platform. If Facebook is truly committed to protecting the integrity of our elections, they would immediately take down Trump's ads that attempt to gaslight the American people.""

Nimmo also observed attacks on other candidates, including Sen. Kamala Harris and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, but said those attacks seemed more the result of ""character building"" in which the accounts were sharing content to bolster their respective personas -- for instance, liberal-looking accounts attacked Trump, while conservative-looking accounts posted negative content about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

""Among the accounts focused on black activism, there was strong support for Bernie Sanders along with a moderate amount of content opposing Kamala Harris,"" Graphika said in its analysis. ""Education reform and student debt relief were two of the most commonly mentioned reasons for supporting Sanders, while Harris's record as a California DA was mentioned as a reason to oppose her candidacy. Mixed in with these was a small amount of content attacking Joe Biden, primarily due to gaffes related to his previous handling of racial issues.""

Nimmo said the accounts sent just under 75,000 posts, the majority of which were not directly related to the 2020 election, but to broader political and social issues in the US.

Facebook said Monday those behind the operation had taken steps to conceal their identities and locations. The company did not publicly say how it had determined the accounts were linked to the Internet Research Agency but said it had shared details with law enforcement.

The campaign mostly recycled existing memes and posts from real American news organizations and political groups.

""This wasn't Russians targeting Americans with Russian content, this was Russians targeting Americans with American content,"" Nimmo said.

The decision to recycle existing content, rather than create new material, might have been part of the campaign's strategy to conceal its Russian links, Nimmo said. However, errors in some of the accounts' posts suggested the accounts weren't run by native English speakers.

""What the future for their children will be?"" the caption read on one post apparently criticizing Americans who don't remember the Confederacy fondly. Another account posted ""What a bullsh**.""

Nathaniel Gleicher, who leads Facebook's team investigating foreign influence operations, said the company had caught the operation in its early stages and that the Russian group had been focusing on audience building. Gleicher said the accounts were ""trying to make themselves look like ordinary citizens"" in a way that could later have lent credibility to their posts.

Facebook has taken extensive steps to crack down on foreign disinformation on its platforms since the 2016 election, including hiring former intelligence officials to root out campaigns like those run from Russia. Gleicher said that the steps Facebook had taken appeared to make it difficult for the Russian accounts ""to build the following among authentic communities.""

""People in Russia are still trying this,"" Nimmo told CNN Business on Monday. But, he said, they are finding it a lot harder because the social media companies ""are hunting them.""

""In 2016, you could have set up an account posing as a Tennessee Republican and have it registered to a Russian phone number,"" he noted.

Facebook also announced Monday that it had removed several networks of Iranian accounts, some of which targeted Americans. One of the accounts directed audiences to content about Black Lives Matter -- a tactic that was very popular among the Russian trolls in 2016 . The network had a relatively small following of more than 7,000 accounts.

While most of the focus on online foreign interference in the US has been devoted to Russia, over the past 12 months, Facebook has detected multiple Iranian campaigns targeting the United States."

Elizabeth Warren committed for the first time on Sunday to putting out a plan detailing how ""Medicare for All"" would be funded, after facing criticism and being pressed on how she would pay for the national health insurance plan without raising taxes on the middle class.

""We need to talk about the cost, and I plan, over the next few weeks, to put out a plan that talks about specifically the cost of 'Medicare for All' and specifically how we pay for it,"" Warren said at a town hall in Indianola, Iowa, on Sunday. She told the crowd gathered that the plan ""is something I've been working for months and months, and it's got just a little more work until it's finished, but I want to bring this out.""

""I think there have been many estimates about what the cost will be, and many different payment streams, and I've been working on how to give the exact details to make that work,"" the Democrat told reporters on Sunday, adding later that she's ""ready to put out a plan soon on exactly what the costs will be, and how to pay for it.""

Warren's campaign said last week it was studying a range of options for paying for Medicare for All, leaving open the possibility that the senator may ultimately diverge from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders on how to pay for his sweeping health care plan -- which Warren has endorsed. Warren has not outlined her own health care plan , and instead is running on Sanders' single-payer legislation that she first signed on to in 2017.

Warren spoke for more than an hour at the event in Indianola before making the announcement. The campaign hoped she would simply mention her upcoming plan when asked about health care, but Warren was not asked the question at the town hall so she delivered this pre-planned message at the end of the event.

Then, on Friday, Hillary Clinton herself kept the smear campaign going, saying in a podcast hosted by Barack Obama’s former campaign manager David Plouffe that Russia is grooming Gabbard to be a third party candidate.

“I’m not making any predictions, but I think they’ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,” Clinton said. “She’s the favorite of the Russians.”

Gabbard lashed back at the Democratic Party’s 2016 presidential nominee, tweeting in response, “Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain.”

Days before Gabbard appeared on the debate stage in Ohio, she had threatened to boycott the event, because she believes the DNC is rigged against outsider candidates such as herself. She declared that the Democratic National Committee and the “corporate media” were “trying to hijack the entire election process.”

Among other reasons, Gabbard argued that the polls the DNC chose for certifying the candidates for the November debate were not as accurate as many of the non-certified polls that could actually help her qualify. So far, the only candidates who have qualified for November are former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

But the media smears, and the evident bias of the debate hosts, were the driving force.

Two days after Gabbard’s threat, the New York Times published what she called “ a greatest hits smear piece.” Gabbard later noted: “These are the folks who will be acting as the neutral questioners/moderators of Tuesday’s debate lol!”

At the debate itself, Gabbard took aim at the hosts: “Just two days ago the New York Times put out an article saying that I’m a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning a CNN commentator said on national television that I’m an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.”

It was actually very kind of Gabbard to not mention the name attached to the CNN smear. Bakari Sellers said hours before the event that he firmly believed that Tulsi is a ‘puppet for the Russian government.”

The fact is that Gabbard, a reservist in the U.S. Army National Guard who took time off her campaign to drill with her unit this summer, is more cautious about the use of military force than other candidates. For that, she is being attacked as a traitor.

But it is a stance that has appeal to members of both parties who are weary of interventionist foreign policies.

Another political outsider, former Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX), is a Tulsi Gabbard fan. Paul praised Gabbard when he said, “She’s the most intelligent and would be the best. “ He also said, “If we had to pick one of them [Democrats] to be our president I think she would be giving us the best chance as for bringing about peace.”

Gabbard is a proud veteran who founded and is the co-chair of the Congressional Post 9/11 Veteran Caucus, which demonstrates her continual work in defending the work her military brothers and sisters continue to do to fight for their country.

At the debate, when Gabbard calmly asked if she could ask Warren a question, she was cut off. Silenced by the very media who smeared her, as if to protect Warren.

Yet Gabbard, as after the second debate, was the most googled candidate after the candidates left the stage.

Apparently American want to hear more from Tulsi despite the smears. The Times called Gabbard’s supporters “unusual Americans”; that has now become a rallying cry.

These “Unusual Amerians” include the ”unconventional mix of anti-interventionist progressives, libertarians, [and] contrarian culture-war skeptics…” that the Times mocked as Gabbard’s base by associating them with extremists.

Gabbard delivered a powerful response in her closing statement at the debate: “I don’t see deplorables. I see fellow Americans worthy of respect even when we disagree strongly.”

Gabbard’s use of the word “deplorables” was a clear allusion Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables,” a phrase that the former secretary of state used to tarnish her opponent’s supporters back in 2016. It came back to haunt Clinton — as will her declaration that Gabbard is Russia’s favorite.

Gabbard, unlike Clinton and many of the presidential hopefuls in 2020, has sacrificed for her country through her military service in a combat zone, and understands the cost of war from first-hand experience.

That is the simple secret of her appeal. It is amazing how far the corporate media and the party establishment will go in their attempt to stop that message from breaking through.

In her video, Gabbard goes on to say that the message of the party establishment is that “if you stand up against Hillary and the party power brokers, if you stand up to the rich and powerful elite and the war machine, they will destroy you and discredit your message.”

“They will not intimidate us,” she declares. “The will not silence us.”

Gabbard goes on to say that not only is she running against corruption, but against the Democratic Party elite.

“I’m running for president to bring about a New Democratic Party, a new leadership that will fight for peace, fight for the people, and protect our planet.”

Gabbard has struggled to escape the second tier of presidential candidates, and failed to qualify for the third debate in September. However, she has made an impact in each debate appearance, partly because of her strong anti-war stance, and partly because of her willingness to attack other candidates’ positions — something few others have been bold enough to do until recently.

Though she supported Sanders in 2016, Gabbard has more moderate positions on several issues. She does not believe in decriminalizing illegal border crossings, for example, and would restrict many abortions in the third trimester — a position widely shared by the American public but which few of her rivals would dare to take.

She has come under fire in recent years for her opposition to U.S. military involvement in Syria — a position she has pursued, in part, through a controversial visit to Syrian dictator Bashar Assad in 2017. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi made a similar visit in 2007.

It almost fell apart in the ninth. Gio Urshela singled off Osuna leading off for his third hit of the game, and LeMahieu put a ball into the first row of seats in right field — inches over the glove of leaping George Springer — to tie it at 4.

Altuve, a sparkplug touted as Houston’s heart and soul, didn’t let this one get away.

“I get asked to describe Jose Altuve all the time,” manager AJ Hinch said. “I think MVP is what he is.”

The teams combined to use 14 pitchers in a drawn-out game that lasted 4 hours, 9 minutes.

Houston’s Will Harris, who got four outs over the sixth and seventh innings and has yet to allow a run this postseason, was glad Houston’s bullpen got to show its stuff.

“We have a lot of guys with a lot of pride that are really good at their jobs,” he said. “And I was excited for the opportunity for us to prove that today.”

The defense helped. Right fielder Josh Reddick dived for Brett Gardner’s liner for the second out of the sixth. An inning later, left fielder Michael Brantley laid out for Aaron Hicks’ shallow floater and doubled off Aaron Judge at first.

Gurriel, a holdover from Houston’s 2017 championship team, was 1 for 20 to start the ALCS before his drive in the first inning. He jumped all over a high-and-tight fastball from opener Chad Green, and his shot into the Crawford Boxes was his first connection this postseason.

It’s the third time Houston has eliminated New York in the past five postseasons. The Astros won the 2015 wild-card game in the Bronx and beat the Yankees in seven games in the 2017 ALCS before winning their first title.

“I feel like we are on equal footing with them,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. “Unfortunately, sports can be a little bit cruel for the team that goes home.”

Washington is seeking its first championship in the 51-season history of the Montreal Expos/Nationals franchise. The original Washington Senators won their only championship for the nation’s capital in 1924 and last reached the World Series in 1933 before becoming the Minnesota Twins for the 1961 season.

Gary Sánchez had an RBI single in the second and Urshela homered in the fourth for the Yankees.

Alex Bregman gave the Astros an insurance run with an RBI on a forceout in the sixth inning.

Brantley’s double play elicited one of the loudest ovations of the night — before Altuve’s blast — from the sellout crowd of 43,357 which included Hall of Famers Nolan Ryan and Craig Biggio and Rockets stars James Harden and Russell Westbrook, who watched from the front row in personalized orange Astros jerseys.

New York was 1 for 6 with runners in scoring position and 3 for 24 over the final five games of the series. The franchise lost its fourth straight ALCS after falling in 2010, 2012 and 2017. The Yankees will go without a World Series appearance in a calendar decade for the first time since the 1910s.

“The work never ends,” Boone said. “And we’ll continue to try and I guess close that gap.”

Altuve doubled off Green with one out in the first inning and Bregman drew a walk with two outs. After a short visit to the mound, Gurriel knocked the next pitch into the seats in left field for a 3-0 lead. The runs were Houston’s first with two outs in the series.

Houston had been 4 for 40 with runners in scoring position before that big swing.

Brad Peacock, who threw eight pitches in a scoreless eighth inning Friday night, became the fourth pitcher ever to finish a postseason game and then start the next day, and the first since 1924.

He needed seven pitches to retire the side in the first before running into trouble with two outs in the second. Josh James ended the inning by striking out Gardner.

Ryan Pressly had another gutsy escape, too. He hurt his right knee again fielding a bases-loaded grounder by Didi Gregorius but limped over to tag him for the final out of the third. Pressly, who grimaced as he went toward the dugout after one pitch, had arthroscopic surgery on the same knee on Aug. 22 and returned Sept. 20. Pressly also got two strikeouts with the bases loaded in Game 4.

He said that some scar tissue broke off on the play but that he’ll be ready to go this week.

“It’s the World Series,” Hinch said. “It will be all hands on deck.”"

Over 184 House Republicans, or 93 percent, have cosponsored House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs’ (R-AZ) H. Res. 604, according to a list obtained by Breitbart News. H. Res. 604 would condemn Schiff for reading a fictional phone call between Zelensky and Trump into the record.

Schiff also allegedly lied about having never spoken to the Ukrainian intelligence officer “whistleblower.”

Rep. Biggs wanted to force a vote on the legislation this week but delayed the move after House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-MD) passed away. The Arizona conservative will reportedly force the vote Monday night.

The legislation to condemn Rep. Schiff has quickly gained support from House GOP across the political spectrum. House Freedom Caucus conservatives, moderates, and House Republican leadership have all cosponsored the legislation.

Since Biggs introduced the legislation in late September, the bill quickly gained 18 cosponsors. Now, the bill features support from 93 percent of the House Republican Conference.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA), and House Republican Conference chairwoman Liz Cheney (R-WY) have sponsored the resolution to condemn Schiff.

And they're here to meddle with 2020,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/21/tech/russia-instagram-accounts-2020-election/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) People linked to the Internet Research Agency, the Kremlin-backed troll group indicted by the United States for its alleged interference in the 2016 US presidential election , are laying the groundwork to do the same in 2020, new information released by Facebook on Monday suggests.

Profiles originating in Russia had since the beginning of this year been building a network of accounts on Instagram designed to look like groups in swing states, the company said . Instagram is owned by

Although the accounts posed as Americans from all sides of the political spectrum, many were united in their opposition to the candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden, according to Graphika , a social media investigations company that Facebook asked to analyze the accounts. The Russian trolls who used social media to interfere in the 2016 election employed a similar tactic , going after Hillary Clinton from the right and also trying to spread a perception on the left that Clinton was not liberal enough and that liberals and African Americans especially shouldn't bother voting for her.

The accounts Facebook revealed Monday, 50 of which were on Instagram and one of which was on Facebook, were designed to look like they were advocating on a broad range of issues across American life.

Accounts with usernames like @black.queen.chloe and @michigan_black_community_ looked like they were run by black activists. There were also pro and anti-Trump accounts, and accounts posing as feminists, LGBTQ rights advocates, and environmentalists. Other account names included @stop.trump2020, @bernie.2020__, @iowa.patriot, and @feminist_agenda_, according to Graphika.

Facebook said the accounts combined had more than 250,000 followers, more than half of which were based in the U.S. Facebook did not disclose how many of those followers were real and how many might have been fake or bot accounts designed to make the main accounts look more legitimate. Facebook says it has removed the accounts.

""It looked like there was a systematic focus on attacking Biden from both sides,"" Graphika director of investigations Ben Nimmo, who analyzed the accounts, told CNN Business.

In a statement responding to the news, Biden campaign spokesman TJ Ducklo said, ""We applaud Facebook for disclosing the existence of these fake accounts and shutting them down. ... [But] Donald Trump continues to benefit from spreading false information, all the while Facebook profits from amplifying his lies and debunked conspiracy theories on their platform. If Facebook is truly committed to protecting the integrity of our elections, they would immediately take down Trump's ads that attempt to gaslight the American people.""

Nimmo also observed attacks on other candidates, including Sen. Kamala Harris and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, but said those attacks seemed more the result of ""character building"" in which the accounts were sharing content to bolster their respective personas -- for instance, liberal-looking accounts attacked Trump, while conservative-looking accounts posted negative content about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

""Among the accounts focused on black activism, there was strong support for Bernie Sanders along with a moderate amount of content opposing Kamala Harris,"" Graphika said in its analysis. ""Education reform and student debt relief were two of the most commonly mentioned reasons for supporting Sanders, while Harris's record as a California DA was mentioned as a reason to oppose her candidacy. Mixed in with these was a small amount of content attacking Joe Biden, primarily due to gaffes related to his previous handling of racial issues.""

Nimmo said the accounts sent just under 75,000 posts, the majority of which were not directly related to the 2020 election, but to broader political and social issues in the US.

Facebook said Monday those behind the operation had taken steps to conceal their identities and locations. The company did not publicly say how it had determined the accounts were linked to the Internet Research Agency but said it had shared details with law enforcement.

The campaign mostly recycled existing memes and posts from real American news organizations and political groups.

""This wasn't Russians targeting Americans with Russian content, this was Russians targeting Americans with American content,"" Nimmo said.

The decision to recycle existing content, rather than create new material, might have been part of the campaign's strategy to conceal its Russian links, Nimmo said. However, errors in some of the accounts' posts suggested the accounts weren't run by native English speakers.

""What the future for their children will be?"" the caption read on one post apparently criticizing Americans who don't remember the Confederacy fondly. Another account posted ""What a bullsh**.""

Nathaniel Gleicher, who leads Facebook's team investigating foreign influence operations, said the company had caught the operation in its early stages and that the Russian group had been focusing on audience building. Gleicher said the accounts were ""trying to make themselves look like ordinary citizens"" in a way that could later have lent credibility to their posts.

Facebook has taken extensive steps to crack down on foreign disinformation on its platforms since the 2016 election, including hiring former intelligence officials to root out campaigns like those run from Russia. Gleicher said that the steps Facebook had taken appeared to make it difficult for the Russian accounts ""to build the following among authentic communities.""

""People in Russia are still trying this,"" Nimmo told CNN Business on Monday. But, he said, they are finding it a lot harder because the social media companies ""are hunting them.""

""In 2016, you could have set up an account posing as a Tennessee Republican and have it registered to a Russian phone number,"" he noted.

Facebook also announced Monday that it had removed several networks of Iranian accounts, some of which targeted Americans. One of the accounts directed audiences to content about Black Lives Matter -- a tactic that was very popular among the Russian trolls in 2016 . The network had a relatively small following of more than 7,000 accounts.

While most of the focus on online foreign interference in the US has been devoted to Russia, over the past 12 months, Facebook has detected multiple Iranian campaigns targeting the United States."

While most national polls have shown a tight race between the former vice president and Sen. Elizabeth Warren in recent weeks – with Warren topping Biden in some cases – Morning Consult has consistently shown Biden leading the field.

The current results, taken Oct. 16-20, 2019, show Biden leading the field with 30 percent and Warren in second place with 21 percent. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) came in third with 18 percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), both of whom garnered six percent support each. Sen. Cory Booker (D), Beto O’Rourke (D), and Andrew Yang (D) garnered three percent, and the remaining candidates saw two percent support or less.

While there seems to be a disparity between the national polling results of Morning Consult and that of other polls, the trend remains the same. Morning Consult shows Biden on a slow decline – falling from a 40 percent high in May – and Warren rising, jumping from her seven percent low in March.

Notably, though, is Biden’s drop in favorability. The post-debate poll shows that Biden lost five favorability points following the last debate, dropping from 55 percent to 50 percent. Sanders’ remained the same with 57 percent, and Warren’s jumped by one point, from 52 percent to 53 percent.

Additionally, Warren remains the top second choice for Biden voters, with 28 percent choosing her and 26 percent choosing Sanders. The results are not necessarily reciprocated, as the Sanders holds a slight edge, earning the second choice support from 25 percent of Warren voters compared to Biden’s 24 percent.

The Massachusetts senator remains the top second choice candidate for supporters of Sanders, Harris, and Buttigieg.

The results of the survey are based on 11,521 interviews with registered voters “who indicate they may vote in the Democratic primary or caucus.” The margin of error is +/- 1 percent."

Democrats raced to condemn the president’s remark, branding it “despicable and disgusting,” while accusing him of being a “white supremacist.”

However, Democrats seemed to forget that their own House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) used similar terminology to describe the impeachment effort against former President Bill Clinton in 1998. At the time, he accused the GOP of “running a lynch mob.”

“I am the president’s defender in the sense that I haven’t seen anything yet that would rise, in my opinion, to the level of impeachable offense,” Nadler said at the time. “I wish we could get this over with quickly.”

“In pushing the process, in pushing the arguments of fairness and due process the Republicans so far have been running a lynch mob,” he added.

This is not the first time the terminology has been used to describe issues in the political realm. In 2015, CNN featured an op-ed titled, “Benghazi hearing: The high-tech lynching of Hillary Clinton.”

“And Then the Breitbart Lynch Mob Came for Me,” a 2017 piece from Foreign Policy reads.

In 2016, the Washington Post featured an op-ed titled, “Comey caves to a lynch-mob mentality,” which claimed that Republicans had become a “lynch mob.”

“Republicans had become a lynch mob, demanding frontier justice, and they howled in outrage when Comey refused to participate in the hanging, accusing him of unfairly rigging the election when all he had done was his job,” the piece reads, later assessing that conservatives “have succumbed to the same lynch-mob mentality that Comey caved to that now threatens the integrity of our electoral process.”"

The New York lawmaker formally endorsed Sanders at a “Bernie’s Back Rally” in New York on Saturday, crediting him for helping her recognize her “inherent value as a human being who deserves health care, housing, education, and a living wage.” She echoed his vision to fundamentally transform the country and called for an America that is “multigeographic” and “multigendered.”

“Squad” member Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) also offered her endorsement of Sanders, calling him the “only candidate who has built a movement.”

Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) has not formally issued an endorsement, but Sanders is expected to join the congresswoman for a tour of her district later this month.

The endorsements from key members of the far-left “Squad” sparked questions about their devotion to feminism and diversity. There is no shortage of women in the crowded Democrat field – Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), and Marianne Williamson (D) – yet they chose the oldest male candidate in the race.

Their decision sparked backlash and inspired a Vice article, which defended their decision from the critiques of “white feminists.” It is titled “Don’t Tell AOC, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib Their Bernie Endorsement Isn’t Feminist.”

“But it’s safe to assume ‘The Squad’ doesn’t need white feminists to help them understand which candidate best supports their feminist principles,” it reads in part.

Ocasio-Cortez said her decision to back Sanders over Warren had nothing to do with gender. Rather, she looked at the “feminist values in the campaign.”

“For me, this is not about ‘Why not any other candidate?'” Ocasio-Cortez said, according to NPR. “The fact that [Sanders] has been fighting for these issues for so long struck me in a very personal way.”

“One of the things that’s so important about what Senator Sanders is talking about, and what this campaign is about, is that it’s far larger than a presidential campaign,” Ocasio-Cortez told NPR, echoing Omar’s remarks. “This is about creating a mass movement.”

Warren did not make a big deal out of Ocasio-Cortez’s endorsement of her opponent, praising the freshman lawmaker for doing “terrific work.”

“I am a fan of the congresswoman. She’s done some terrific work. We have worked together, and I know that once this primary is over we’re all going to be on the same side,” Warren said.

Ocasio-Cortez echoed that sentiment during an interview with CBS This Morning alongside Sanders.

“I think she’s [Warren] a fabulous candidate and so frankly, Senator Sanders, Senator Warren, and myself are all on the same team in the party,” she said:"

Rep. Biggs wanted to force a vote on the legislation this week but delayed the move after House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-MD) passed away. The Arizona conservative will reportedly force the vote Monday night.

The legislation to condemn Rep. Schiff has quickly gained support from House GOP across the political spectrum. House Freedom Caucus conservatives, moderates, and House Republican leadership have all cosponsored the legislation.

Since Biggs introduced the legislation in late September, the bill quickly gained 18 cosponsors. Now, the bill features support from 93 percent of the House Republican Conference.

Biden has the support of 34% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters, his best showing in CNN polling since just after his campaign's formal launch on April 25.

Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont are about even for second, with 19% and 16%, respectively. Behind them, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris of California each have 6% support, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke each at 3%.

Biden's rise comes largely from a consolidation of support among his core backers, and doesn't appear to harm any individual opponent. Warren and Sanders hold about even with their standing in the last CNN poll in September, and no other candidate has seen a shift of more than 2 points in that time.

But Biden has seen big spikes in support among moderate and conservative Democrats (43% support him now, up from 29% in the September poll), racial and ethnic minorities (from 28% among all nonwhites in September to 42% now) and older voters (up 13 points since September among those 45 and older) that outpace those among younger potential Democratic voters (up 5 points among those younger than 45).

The gains come as Biden's time as vice president is put under the spotlight by President Donald Trump and his allies. Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry by the House of Representatives over allegations that he pressured the Ukrainian government to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, as well as the 2016 US election in return for releasing hundreds of millions in congressionally mandated defense funding meant for Ukraine. Hunter Biden was on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while Biden was vice president. There is no evidence that either Biden did anything wrong in Ukraine.

The poll suggests that although Biden's October debate performance did not blow away the audience (15% who watched or followed news about it said he had done the best job in the debate, well behind Warren's 28% -- but better than most on the stage), the arguments he made on health care, foreign policy and the economy may have boosted his standing with the potential Democratic electorate.

Asked which candidate would best handle a range of top issues, Biden leads the way on four of the six issues tested in the poll. He holds a massive edge over the field on foreign policy (56% say he would handle it best, well ahead of Sanders at 13% and Warren at 11%), and tops the next closest candidate by nearly 20 points on the economy (38% Biden, 19% Sanders, 16% Warren). Biden also outpaces the rest of the field as most trusted on immigration (29% Biden, 16% each Warren and Sanders) and gun policy (27% vs. 13% Sanders and 11% Warren, with O'Rourke close at 9%).

Biden doesn't hold a significant edge on the critical issue of health care (31% Biden, 28% Sanders, 17% Warren) but he's surged 13 points on the issue since June, when he lagged behind Sanders. Neither Sanders' nor Warren's numbers on the issue have moved significantly in that time.

And Biden now runs even with Sanders at 26% as best able to handle the climate crisis. Warren is at 18% on that issue. The results mark increases for Biden and Sanders, who were each at 19% on handling the climate in June.

The former vice president's advantages on the issues come as he emphasizes an approach that appears to align with the preferences of most potential Democratic voters. A 53% majority say they want the nominee to advocate policies that have a good chance of becoming law, even if the changes aren't as big, vs. 42% who prefer advocating big changes even if they have less of a chance of becoming law.

Among those voters who prefer an approach that prioritizes policies with a better chance of becoming law, 38% support Biden for the Democratic nomination, 17% Warren and just 8% Sanders. On the other side, it's nearly a three-way split, with 27% behind Biden, 24% Sanders and 21% Warren.

About 1 in 5 potential Democratic voters say they watched last week's debate among 12 Democratic candidates, and those who watched it came away with a different assessment than those who mainly followed news about the debate. Overall, among everyone who either watched or followed news coverage on the debate, 28% say Warren had the best night, 15% Biden, 13% Sanders, 11% Buttigieg, 4% Klobuchar and 2% Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, with the rest at 1% or less. Among those who say they watched it, though, Warren remains on top at 29%, but 21% say Buttigieg had the best night, then 13% Biden, 11% Sanders, 10% Klobuchar and 4% Booker, with everyone else at 1% or less.

And those who watched the debate seem to have more favorable views of the lesser-known candidates who were seen as having good nights than do those who followed coverage. Among debate watchers, 74% have a favorable view of Buttigieg, vs. 54% among those who followed news instead. Booker's favorability rating is 80% among those who watched, vs. 55% among those who followed coverage, and Klobuchar's favorability stands at 56% among watchers vs. 36% among those who followed news.

Warren tops the list of candidates who potential Democratic voters say they want to hear more about: 31% name her, 24% Buttigieg, 23% Harris, 18% Booker, 17% Sanders, 16% Biden, 13% Klobuchar, 11% O'Rourke and 10% businessman Andrew Yang.

Majorities of potential Democratic voters say they would at least be satisfied with any of the top three becoming the party's nominee, with about 4 in 10 saying they'd be enthusiastic about Biden (43%), Warren (41%) or Sanders (39%). Fewer would feel as excited should Buttigieg become the party's nominee (27% enthusiastic).

Registered voters generally give Biden, Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg large advantages over President Donald Trump in hypothetical general election matchups. Biden leads the President by 10 points, 53% to 43%, with Sanders up 9 (52% to 43%) and Warren up 8 (52% to 44%). Buttigieg holds a 6-point edge, 50% to 44%.

The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS from October 17 through 20 among a random national sample of 1,003 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer, including 424 registered voters who are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points. For results among potential Democratic voters, it is plus or minus 5.8 points."

The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.

Venture capitalists identify and finance the innovators who create our future. But there's a problem with how some VCs are identifying the next big thing: They're leaving out female and ethnically diverse entrepreneurs.

In doing so, VCs are leaving money on the table. By Morgan Stanley's estimate, this funding gap is a trillion-dollar opportunity

That's why we surveyed almost 60 venture capitalists to find out why they aren't investing more in diverse founders. What we discovered surprised me: The VC industry has yet to prioritize investing in women and multicultural startups despite acknowledging the opportunity that these companies present. Consider these findings:

VCs know diverse entrepreneurs are a good investment that they aren't taking advantage of. An overwhelming majority (83%) told us they believe they can prioritize investments in companies led by women and multicultural entrepreneurs and maximize returns. A similar majority (60%) said their portfolios hold too few of these companies.

Yet, three in five VCs told us that prioritizing investments in women and multicultural entrepreneurs is not a firm-wide priority.

Even investors who say that they do prioritize investing in diverse entrepreneurs have outdated sourcing and vetting methods. They rely on connections within their existing networks, which don't usually include female and multicultural founders, instead of using other avenues where they're more likely to meet these entrepreneurs, like incubators, conferences and demo days.

VCs have a reputation for taking calculated ""expansion risks"" to invest in new and emerging markets — often with little precedent or data beyond their own due diligence. Of the VCs we surveyed, about 20% of the companies in their portfolios represent expansion risks. However, when they encounter companies founded by women and multicultural entrepreneurs, VCs are less likely to educate themselves or take the risk, especially when they're unfamiliar with the market or product.

Still, most (88%) of the VCs we surveyed view the experiences of underrepresented entrepreneurs as a competitive advantage when it comes to identifying different problems that need to be solved. The companies these entrepreneurs create usually address a market inefficiency or need they've identified based on their personal experiences, making them the exact types of calculated expansion risks that VCs should be considering.

Taken together, the only conclusion I can draw from these findings is that VCs' historical behaviors are holding them back. If they don't start operating differently, they'll continue to miss out.

At Morgan Stanley, we know that companies founded by women and multicultural entrepreneurs are a lucrative investment opportunity. For the past three years, we've been investing directly in startups led by diverse founders. It's time for VCs to recognize this same opportunity.

Based on our research, I believe by subtly shifting their mindset, VCs can substantially increase their exposure to diverse entrepreneurs and put their money to work.

Limited partners, like pension plans, foundations, endowments and universities, can help make the shift. They can make investing with women and multicultural entrepreneurs a condition to investing with general partners. They can make sure that the VCs they invest in reflect their values without sacrificing returns.

We also discovered that VC firms with more women and multicultural fund managers, limited partners and boards are more likely to increase investments in diverse founders. This also makes them better positioned to recognize opportunities and identify pitfalls, which improves portfolio performance. I can't think of a more compelling reason for firms to embrace increased diversity on both sides of the pitch table.

And let's be clear: The benefits of this approach aren't limited to VCs — improving diversity within our industry brings value to all of us. Attitudes aren't always easy to change, but we have a responsibility to learn from each other on how to address this issue, because banks aren't separate from society — we're part of society.

Women and multicultural entrepreneurs represent new market opportunities as the demographic shift continues and markets that serve these communities are growing and outpacing others. It's time VCs shift their investment perspective to take advantage of these opportunities and challenge industry norms, including their own."

(CNN) Will 2020 see the return of the brokered national political convention -- that is, a convention where delegates are unable to agree on a nominee during the first round of voting, making it necessary to ""broker"" delegates between candidates in subsequent rounds to arrive at a nominee?

It's hard to ignore the potential for a first-round deadlock at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) convention next July. While it's true that every four years political pundits warn of the potential for brokered convention, and it hasn't happened in over half a century, the combination of a historically large field of candidates, no clear front-runner , a heavily front-loaded primary schedule and a change in Democratic party rules means that 2020 could be the year the prediction finally comes true.

Let's start with the candidates. Despite several recent drop-outs, 19 Democrats remain in the hunt for the nomination. History tells us that more will quit the race before the Iowa caucuses on February 3, but it's easy to imagine eight or more of the current field, including Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Beto O'Rourke, Andrew Yang, Tulsi Gabbard and, of course, the top tier of Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden staying in the race at least through the New Hampshire primary on February 11.

One of the reasons they are likely to stay in the race is that former Vice President Joe Biden, long the front-runner, now looks weaker than he did. For months now, Biden's national poll average has remained stuck at around 30%. Democratic primary math, by which only candidates receiving at least 15% of the vote are awarded delegates, means the percentage of delegates earned will exceed the percentage of primary votes for the top candidates. Still, it will be a stretch for Biden, or any other candidate, to go from just below 30% in the polls to the 51% of delegates required to secure the nomination.

Polling in the early caucus and primary states provides more evidence for this uncertainty. Recent numbers show a tie between Biden and Elizabeth Warren in the Iowa caucuses, Warren ahead of Biden in New Hampshire and a tie in Nevada -- but it's a tie between Biden and Sanders, not Biden and Warren.

CBS News and YouGov have teamed up to use polling to try to estimate delegate allocation through Super Tuesday on March 3. In September, they estimated that although Biden was ahead, he would fall nearly 150 delegates short of a majority. About a week ago, though, CBS and YouGov changed their forecast to show Warren in the lead, though still somewhat short of a majority.

This swing shows the volatility of the Democratic primary.

Now, as the political scientist Josh Putnam has rightly pointed out , the problem with trusting this approach to forecasting is that all of the primaries do not take place on one day and, as Putnam puts it, ""sequence matters."" The results in one state can influence the result in subsequent states. Speculation about brokered conventions usually dies down once a candidate begins winning primaries and building up momentum. In 2020, though, there will be little time for the natural winnowing of the field that has occurred in the past.

In the one-month period between the Iowa caucuses and Super Tuesday, about 40% of the total number of delegates voting in the first round of the Democratic National Convention will have been selected. In comparison, in 2016 only about a quarter of the delegates were distributed during that same period. A few weeks later, by the end of March, nearly 70% of the delegates will have been chosen.

We are nearly four months from the first primary, and support may coalesce around one or two candidates prior to the start of voting, but if even three potentially viable candidates are left at the end of March, with none having a majority of the delegates already selected, it now becomes very difficult for any one candidate to get to a majority. There simply aren't that many delegates left, and the Democratic party mandates proportional allocation of delegates. The state-level formula is often complex, but in most cases, any candidate receiving at least 15% of either the statewide vote and/or the congressional district vote will be awarded delegates.

Which brings us to the final element that makes a brokered convention more likely this year than in the past: the rules change that the Democratic party made to how voting will work at the 2020 convention

Since delegates are awarded on a proportional basis, it is often difficult for Democratic candidates to get to a majority. This is why both the 2008 and the 2016 Democratic primaries remained competitive late into the spring in both of those years. In fact, neither Barack Obama in 2008 nor Hillary Clinton in 2016 actually earned a majority of what are called pledged delegates during their respective primaries.

The 2008 and 2016 DNC conventions weren't ""brokered,"" though, because Democrats since 1984 have allowed a large number of unpledged or uncommitted delegates to attend and vote at the national convention. These so-called ""superdelegates"" -- and there were more than 700 of them in Philadelphia in 2016 -- are not bound by voting outcomes in any of the states. In fact, this large number of uncommitted superdelegates has made it difficult for Democratic candidates to obtain a majority of committed convention delegates without them.

The influence of the superdelegates over the years has led to cries of unfairness from candidates who were not awarded the nomination. Both Hillary Clinton in 2008 and Bernie Sanders in 2016 could correctly argue that, had the superdelegates offered them support, they could have been the party's nominee.

The presence of unelected superdelegates at a convention of the ""Democratic"" party has become something of an embarrassment: It just seems undemocratic. So, during the 2016 convention, the party decided to establish a "" Unity Reform Commission ,"" which, among other things, devised ways to reduce the role of superdelegates.

The result was a change in the convention rules so that, in 2020, superdelegates will not participate in the first round of voting under this scenario. So it is up to Democratic primary and caucus participants to avoid a brokered convention.

If, for all of the reasons that I've just presented, they fail to unify behind a single candidate, then we will have our first brokered convention in more than 60 years

While this would be exciting to watch, it could also be disastrous for the Democratic party. The superdelegates will enter in round two, and if, as is likely, they throw their weight behind one candidate, how will the other candidates' supporters react? Remember, there is some evidence that ""Bernie or Bust"" voters cost Hillary Clinton the White House in 2016.

The poll, taken October 1-3, among 887 likely U.S. voters, shows the president edging out all of his potential Democrat challengers, minus Warren, who tied with Trump with 45 percent support. Notably, ten percent said they were “not sure” who they would vote for between the two.

While many Democrats view Biden as the most electable candidate, the survey’s results show Trump defeating Biden 47 percent to 45 percent thanks, in part, to the president closing the gap in support among independent, suburban, and Hispanics voters.

According to Zogby Analytics:

The reason President Trump is winning, barely, in a hypothetical match-up with the former vice president, Joe Biden, is that, in addition to winning with his normal base of men (Trump leads 54% to 39%), white voters (Trump leads 53% to 40%), union voters (Trump leads 62% to 32%), and southern voters (Trump leads 50% to 43%), Trump has also tightened the race with Independents (Biden leads 42% to 36%), suburban voters (Biden leads 49% to 43%), and Hispanics (Biden leads 47% to 43%). Trump is also beating Biden convincingly with two demographics he has recently made inroads with: large city voters (Trump leads 50% to 44%) and Generation X voters age 30-49 (Trump leads 49% to 41%).

Trump also beats Sanders by a two-point margin, 46 percent to 44 percent, although Sanders continues to hold an edge with younger voters (18-29) with 56 percent support to Trump’s 37 percent.

The president appears to perform the best against Buttigieg, who has failed to break through the top tier of candidates in the crowded Democrat field. Trump beats him by 11 points – 49 percent to 38 percent – and defeats Harris 47 percent to 41 percent. The margin of error is +/- 3.3 percent.

As Breitbart News reported:"

While most national polls have shown a tight race between the former vice president and Sen. Elizabeth Warren in recent weeks – with Warren topping Biden in some cases – Morning Consult has consistently shown Biden leading the field.

The current results, taken Oct. 16-20, 2019, show Biden leading the field with 30 percent and Warren in second place with 21 percent. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) came in third with 18 percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), both of whom garnered six percent support each. Sen. Cory Booker (D), Beto O’Rourke (D), and Andrew Yang (D) garnered three percent, and the remaining candidates saw two percent support or less.

While there seems to be a disparity between the national polling results of Morning Consult and that of other polls, the trend remains the same. Morning Consult shows Biden on a slow decline – falling from a 40 percent high in May – and Warren rising, jumping from her seven percent low in March.

Notably, though, is Biden’s drop in favorability. The post-debate poll shows that Biden lost five favorability points following the last debate, dropping from 55 percent to 50 percent. Sanders’ remained the same with 57 percent, and Warren’s jumped by one point, from 52 percent to 53 percent.

Additionally, Warren remains the top second choice for Biden voters, with 28 percent choosing her and 26 percent choosing Sanders. The results are not necessarily reciprocated, as the Sanders holds a slight edge, earning the second choice support from 25 percent of Warren voters compared to Biden’s 24 percent.

The Massachusetts senator remains the top second choice candidate for supporters of Sanders, Harris, and Buttigieg.

The results of the survey are based on 11,521 interviews with registered voters “who indicate they may vote in the Democratic primary or caucus.” The margin of error is +/- 1 percent."

However, Democrats seemed to forget that their own House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) used similar terminology to describe the impeachment effort against former President Bill Clinton in 1998. At the time, he accused the GOP of “running a lynch mob.”

“I am the president’s defender in the sense that I haven’t seen anything yet that would rise, in my opinion, to the level of impeachable offense,” Nadler said at the time. “I wish we could get this over with quickly.”

“In pushing the process, in pushing the arguments of fairness and due process the Republicans so far have been running a lynch mob,” he added.

This is not the first time the terminology has been used to describe issues in the political realm. In 2015, CNN featured an op-ed titled, “Benghazi hearing: The high-tech lynching of Hillary Clinton.”

“And Then the Breitbart Lynch Mob Came for Me,” a 2017 piece from Foreign Policy reads.

In 2016, the Washington Post featured an op-ed titled, “Comey caves to a lynch-mob mentality,” which claimed that Republicans had become a “lynch mob.”

“Republicans had become a lynch mob, demanding frontier justice, and they howled in outrage when Comey refused to participate in the hanging, accusing him of unfairly rigging the election when all he had done was his job,” the piece reads, later assessing that conservatives “have succumbed to the same lynch-mob mentality that Comey caved to that now threatens the integrity of our electoral process.”"

“Squad” member Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) also offered her endorsement of Sanders, calling him the “only candidate who has built a movement.”

Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) has not formally issued an endorsement, but Sanders is expected to join the congresswoman for a tour of her district later this month.

The endorsements from key members of the far-left “Squad” sparked questions about their devotion to feminism and diversity. There is no shortage of women in the crowded Democrat field – Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), and Marianne Williamson (D) – yet they chose the oldest male candidate in the race.

Their decision sparked backlash and inspired a Vice article, which defended their decision from the critiques of “white feminists.” It is titled “Don’t Tell AOC, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib Their Bernie Endorsement Isn’t Feminist.”

“But it’s safe to assume ‘The Squad’ doesn’t need white feminists to help them understand which candidate best supports their feminist principles,” it reads in part.

Ocasio-Cortez said her decision to back Sanders over Warren had nothing to do with gender. Rather, she looked at the “feminist values in the campaign.”

“For me, this is not about ‘Why not any other candidate?'” Ocasio-Cortez said, according to NPR. “The fact that [Sanders] has been fighting for these issues for so long struck me in a very personal way.”

“One of the things that’s so important about what Senator Sanders is talking about, and what this campaign is about, is that it’s far larger than a presidential campaign,” Ocasio-Cortez told NPR, echoing Omar’s remarks. “This is about creating a mass movement.”

Warren did not make a big deal out of Ocasio-Cortez’s endorsement of her opponent, praising the freshman lawmaker for doing “terrific work.”

“I am a fan of the congresswoman. She’s done some terrific work. We have worked together, and I know that once this primary is over we’re all going to be on the same side,” Warren said.

“Lynching is a reprehensible stain on this nation’s history, as is this President,” Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) wrote. “We’ll never erase the pain and trauma of lynching, and to invoke that torture to whitewash your own corruption is disgraceful”:

Biden has the support of 34% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters, his best showing in CNN polling since just after his campaign's formal launch on April 25.

Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont are about even for second, with 19% and 16%, respectively. Behind them, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris of California each have 6% support, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke each at 3%.

Biden's rise comes largely from a consolidation of support among his core backers, and doesn't appear to harm any individual opponent. Warren and Sanders hold about even with their standing in the last CNN poll in September, and no other candidate has seen a shift of more than 2 points in that time.

But Biden has seen big spikes in support among moderate and conservative Democrats (43% support him now, up from 29% in the September poll), racial and ethnic minorities (from 28% among all nonwhites in September to 42% now) and older voters (up 13 points since September among those 45 and older) that outpace those among younger potential Democratic voters (up 5 points among those younger than 45).

The gains come as Biden's time as vice president is put under the spotlight by President Donald Trump and his allies. Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry by the House of Representatives over allegations that he pressured the Ukrainian government to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, as well as the 2016 US election in return for releasing hundreds of millions in congressionally mandated defense funding meant for Ukraine. Hunter Biden was on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while Biden was vice president. There is no evidence that either Biden did anything wrong in Ukraine.

The poll suggests that although Biden's October debate performance did not blow away the audience (15% who watched or followed news about it said he had done the best job in the debate, well behind Warren's 28% -- but better than most on the stage), the arguments he made on health care, foreign policy and the economy may have boosted his standing with the potential Democratic electorate.

Asked which candidate would best handle a range of top issues, Biden leads the way on four of the six issues tested in the poll. He holds a massive edge over the field on foreign policy (56% say he would handle it best, well ahead of Sanders at 13% and Warren at 11%), and tops the next closest candidate by nearly 20 points on the economy (38% Biden, 19% Sanders, 16% Warren). Biden also outpaces the rest of the field as most trusted on immigration (29% Biden, 16% each Warren and Sanders) and gun policy (27% vs. 13% Sanders and 11% Warren, with O'Rourke close at 9%).

Biden doesn't hold a significant edge on the critical issue of health care (31% Biden, 28% Sanders, 17% Warren) but he's surged 13 points on the issue since June, when he lagged behind Sanders. Neither Sanders' nor Warren's numbers on the issue have moved significantly in that time.

And Biden now runs even with Sanders at 26% as best able to handle the climate crisis. Warren is at 18% on that issue. The results mark increases for Biden and Sanders, who were each at 19% on handling the climate in June.

The former vice president's advantages on the issues come as he emphasizes an approach that appears to align with the preferences of most potential Democratic voters. A 53% majority say they want the nominee to advocate policies that have a good chance of becoming law, even if the changes aren't as big, vs. 42% who prefer advocating big changes even if they have less of a chance of becoming law.

Among those voters who prefer an approach that prioritizes policies with a better chance of becoming law, 38% support Biden for the Democratic nomination, 17% Warren and just 8% Sanders. On the other side, it's nearly a three-way split, with 27% behind Biden, 24% Sanders and 21% Warren.

About 1 in 5 potential Democratic voters say they watched last week's debate among 12 Democratic candidates, and those who watched it came away with a different assessment than those who mainly followed news about the debate. Overall, among everyone who either watched or followed news coverage on the debate, 28% say Warren had the best night, 15% Biden, 13% Sanders, 11% Buttigieg, 4% Klobuchar and 2% Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, with the rest at 1% or less. Among those who say they watched it, though, Warren remains on top at 29%, but 21% say Buttigieg had the best night, then 13% Biden, 11% Sanders, 10% Klobuchar and 4% Booker, with everyone else at 1% or less.

And those who watched the debate seem to have more favorable views of the lesser-known candidates who were seen as having good nights than do those who followed coverage. Among debate watchers, 74% have a favorable view of Buttigieg, vs. 54% among those who followed news instead. Booker's favorability rating is 80% among those who watched, vs. 55% among those who followed coverage, and Klobuchar's favorability stands at 56% among watchers vs. 36% among those who followed news.

Warren tops the list of candidates who potential Democratic voters say they want to hear more about: 31% name her, 24% Buttigieg, 23% Harris, 18% Booker, 17% Sanders, 16% Biden, 13% Klobuchar, 11% O'Rourke and 10% businessman Andrew Yang.

Majorities of potential Democratic voters say they would at least be satisfied with any of the top three becoming the party's nominee, with about 4 in 10 saying they'd be enthusiastic about Biden (43%), Warren (41%) or Sanders (39%). Fewer would feel as excited should Buttigieg become the party's nominee (27% enthusiastic).

Registered voters generally give Biden, Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg large advantages over President Donald Trump in hypothetical general election matchups. Biden leads the President by 10 points, 53% to 43%, with Sanders up 9 (52% to 43%) and Warren up 8 (52% to 44%). Buttigieg holds a 6-point edge, 50% to 44%.

The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS from October 17 through 20 among a random national sample of 1,003 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer, including 424 registered voters who are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points. For results among potential Democratic voters, it is plus or minus 5.8 points."

The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.

Venture capitalists identify and finance the innovators who create our future. But there's a problem with how some VCs are identifying the next big thing: They're leaving out female and ethnically diverse entrepreneurs.

In doing so, VCs are leaving money on the table. By Morgan Stanley's estimate, this funding gap is a trillion-dollar opportunity

That's why we surveyed almost 60 venture capitalists to find out why they aren't investing more in diverse founders. What we discovered surprised me: The VC industry has yet to prioritize investing in women and multicultural startups despite acknowledging the opportunity that these companies present. Consider these findings:

VCs know diverse entrepreneurs are a good investment that they aren't taking advantage of. An overwhelming majority (83%) told us they believe they can prioritize investments in companies led by women and multicultural entrepreneurs and maximize returns. A similar majority (60%) said their portfolios hold too few of these companies.

Yet, three in five VCs told us that prioritizing investments in women and multicultural entrepreneurs is not a firm-wide priority.

Even investors who say that they do prioritize investing in diverse entrepreneurs have outdated sourcing and vetting methods. They rely on connections within their existing networks, which don't usually include female and multicultural founders, instead of using other avenues where they're more likely to meet these entrepreneurs, like incubators, conferences and demo days.

VCs have a reputation for taking calculated ""expansion risks"" to invest in new and emerging markets — often with little precedent or data beyond their own due diligence. Of the VCs we surveyed, about 20% of the companies in their portfolios represent expansion risks. However, when they encounter companies founded by women and multicultural entrepreneurs, VCs are less likely to educate themselves or take the risk, especially when they're unfamiliar with the market or product.

Still, most (88%) of the VCs we surveyed view the experiences of underrepresented entrepreneurs as a competitive advantage when it comes to identifying different problems that need to be solved. The companies these entrepreneurs create usually address a market inefficiency or need they've identified based on their personal experiences, making them the exact types of calculated expansion risks that VCs should be considering.

Taken together, the only conclusion I can draw from these findings is that VCs' historical behaviors are holding them back. If they don't start operating differently, they'll continue to miss out.

At Morgan Stanley, we know that companies founded by women and multicultural entrepreneurs are a lucrative investment opportunity. For the past three years, we've been investing directly in startups led by diverse founders. It's time for VCs to recognize this same opportunity.

Based on our research, I believe by subtly shifting their mindset, VCs can substantially increase their exposure to diverse entrepreneurs and put their money to work.

Limited partners, like pension plans, foundations, endowments and universities, can help make the shift. They can make investing with women and multicultural entrepreneurs a condition to investing with general partners. They can make sure that the VCs they invest in reflect their values without sacrificing returns.

We also discovered that VC firms with more women and multicultural fund managers, limited partners and boards are more likely to increase investments in diverse founders. This also makes them better positioned to recognize opportunities and identify pitfalls, which improves portfolio performance. I can't think of a more compelling reason for firms to embrace increased diversity on both sides of the pitch table.

And let's be clear: The benefits of this approach aren't limited to VCs — improving diversity within our industry brings value to all of us. Attitudes aren't always easy to change, but we have a responsibility to learn from each other on how to address this issue, because banks aren't separate from society — we're part of society.

Women and multicultural entrepreneurs represent new market opportunities as the demographic shift continues and markets that serve these communities are growing and outpacing others. It's time VCs shift their investment perspective to take advantage of these opportunities and challenge industry norms, including their own."

(CNN) Will 2020 see the return of the brokered national political convention -- that is, a convention where delegates are unable to agree on a nominee during the first round of voting, making it necessary to ""broker"" delegates between candidates in subsequent rounds to arrive at a nominee?

It's hard to ignore the potential for a first-round deadlock at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) convention next July. While it's true that every four years political pundits warn of the potential for brokered convention, and it hasn't happened in over half a century, the combination of a historically large field of candidates, no clear front-runner , a heavily front-loaded primary schedule and a change in Democratic party rules means that 2020 could be the year the prediction finally comes true.

Let's start with the candidates. Despite several recent drop-outs, 19 Democrats remain in the hunt for the nomination. History tells us that more will quit the race before the Iowa caucuses on February 3, but it's easy to imagine eight or more of the current field, including Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Beto O'Rourke, Andrew Yang, Tulsi Gabbard and, of course, the top tier of Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden staying in the race at least through the New Hampshire primary on February 11.

One of the reasons they are likely to stay in the race is that former Vice President Joe Biden, long the front-runner, now looks weaker than he did. For months now, Biden's national poll average has remained stuck at around 30%. Democratic primary math, by which only candidates receiving at least 15% of the vote are awarded delegates, means the percentage of delegates earned will exceed the percentage of primary votes for the top candidates. Still, it will be a stretch for Biden, or any other candidate, to go from just below 30% in the polls to the 51% of delegates required to secure the nomination.

Polling in the early caucus and primary states provides more evidence for this uncertainty. Recent numbers show a tie between Biden and Elizabeth Warren in the Iowa caucuses, Warren ahead of Biden in New Hampshire and a tie in Nevada -- but it's a tie between Biden and Sanders, not Biden and Warren.

CBS News and YouGov have teamed up to use polling to try to estimate delegate allocation through Super Tuesday on March 3. In September, they estimated that although Biden was ahead, he would fall nearly 150 delegates short of a majority. About a week ago, though, CBS and YouGov changed their forecast to show Warren in the lead, though still somewhat short of a majority.

This swing shows the volatility of the Democratic primary.

Now, as the political scientist Josh Putnam has rightly pointed out , the problem with trusting this approach to forecasting is that all of the primaries do not take place on one day and, as Putnam puts it, ""sequence matters."" The results in one state can influence the result in subsequent states. Speculation about brokered conventions usually dies down once a candidate begins winning primaries and building up momentum. In 2020, though, there will be little time for the natural winnowing of the field that has occurred in the past.

In the one-month period between the Iowa caucuses and Super Tuesday, about 40% of the total number of delegates voting in the first round of the Democratic National Convention will have been selected. In comparison, in 2016 only about a quarter of the delegates were distributed during that same period. A few weeks later, by the end of March, nearly 70% of the delegates will have been chosen.

We are nearly four months from the first primary, and support may coalesce around one or two candidates prior to the start of voting, but if even three potentially viable candidates are left at the end of March, with none having a majority of the delegates already selected, it now becomes very difficult for any one candidate to get to a majority. There simply aren't that many delegates left, and the Democratic party mandates proportional allocation of delegates. The state-level formula is often complex, but in most cases, any candidate receiving at least 15% of either the statewide vote and/or the congressional district vote will be awarded delegates.

Which brings us to the final element that makes a brokered convention more likely this year than in the past: the rules change that the Democratic party made to how voting will work at the 2020 convention

Since delegates are awarded on a proportional basis, it is often difficult for Democratic candidates to get to a majority. This is why both the 2008 and the 2016 Democratic primaries remained competitive late into the spring in both of those years. In fact, neither Barack Obama in 2008 nor Hillary Clinton in 2016 actually earned a majority of what are called pledged delegates during their respective primaries.

The 2008 and 2016 DNC conventions weren't ""brokered,"" though, because Democrats since 1984 have allowed a large number of unpledged or uncommitted delegates to attend and vote at the national convention. These so-called ""superdelegates"" -- and there were more than 700 of them in Philadelphia in 2016 -- are not bound by voting outcomes in any of the states. In fact, this large number of uncommitted superdelegates has made it difficult for Democratic candidates to obtain a majority of committed convention delegates without them.

The influence of the superdelegates over the years has led to cries of unfairness from candidates who were not awarded the nomination. Both Hillary Clinton in 2008 and Bernie Sanders in 2016 could correctly argue that, had the superdelegates offered them support, they could have been the party's nominee.

The presence of unelected superdelegates at a convention of the ""Democratic"" party has become something of an embarrassment: It just seems undemocratic. So, during the 2016 convention, the party decided to establish a "" Unity Reform Commission ,"" which, among other things, devised ways to reduce the role of superdelegates.

The result was a change in the convention rules so that, in 2020, superdelegates will not participate in the first round of voting under this scenario. So it is up to Democratic primary and caucus participants to avoid a brokered convention.

If, for all of the reasons that I've just presented, they fail to unify behind a single candidate, then we will have our first brokered convention in more than 60 years

While this would be exciting to watch, it could also be disastrous for the Democratic party. The superdelegates will enter in round two, and if, as is likely, they throw their weight behind one candidate, how will the other candidates' supporters react? Remember, there is some evidence that ""Bernie or Bust"" voters cost Hillary Clinton the White House in 2016.

This year, month after month, he has drawn most of the major presidential candidates to his doorstep and championed ""Medicare for All"" while forcing the presidential contenders to think through the impact of their health care agendas in the most personal terms.

He brought California Sen. Kamala Harris to tears recalling the day her mother was diagnosed with colon cancer. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren used Barkan's case to punctuate the failures of the healthcare system during a July presidential debate: ""Ady has health insurance, good health insurance, and it's not nearly enough,"" she said.

Barkan and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the author of the Medicare for All legislation, discussed their legacies during their conversation, which was posted online in early September.

""In terms of your legacy, Ady,"" Sanders told Barkan, ""I think it will be very clear that even with the terrible illness that you're struggling with right now, that you didn't give up, that you understood that -- especially given your illness -- that you could play a significant in rallying the American people toward a sane and humane health care system.""

In the latest interview released Thursday with Pete Buttigieg , the South Bend, Indiana Mayor told Barkan that it was the first time he'd been around breathing equipment since the death of his father, who had cancer, in January.

""We sat down with a social worker who basically explained to us at the hospital that in terms of long term care our best option was probably for our family to spend down everything that we had until we were asset-poor enough to qualify for Medicaid,"" Buttigieg told Barkan, according to the transcript shared with CNN. ""I remember just thinking, is that how this works in America?""

The two debated their differing views on Medicare for All, and Barkan told Buttigieg he appreciated that the mayor was ""willing to have the tough conversations even when someone doesn't agree with you.""

In their exchange, Barkan called out former Vice President Joe Biden, who Barkan says is the only top-tier presidential candidate who has not responded to his invitation to meet.

On September 18, he issued a searing plea to Biden, noting that Biden has his own heartbreaking struggles involving the healthcare system (most recently with the death of his son Beau in 2015 from a brain tumor).

""Mr. Vice President you know about illness. You know about doctors and hospitals. You know that health care is personal. ... You won't come talk to me about it?"" Barkan said in video missive to Biden the day before undergoing surgery for a tracheostomy to help him breathe. ""Look a dying man in the eyes and tell me how we fix this country.""

In an interview with CNN this month, Barkan described ALS as ""the story of things becoming impossible"" -- from a simple stroll around the neighborhood to his ability to tickle his 3-year-old son Carl. ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, ultimately depriving the brain of its ability to initiate and control muscle movement, including the loss of speech. (Barkan now speaks through a computer).

""It's exhausting and overwhelming,"" Barkan told CNN. ""For me, ALS has been a lesson in exactly how broken our health care system is and why it's so important to fix it.""

In this family photo, Barkan is pictured with his wife Rachael and son Carl in October 2016.

Barkan, a life-long advocate on economic justice issues who was diagnosed with ALS in October 2016, has imparted those lessons not only with high-profile testimony in Washington, but also in these intimate one-on-one conversations with candidates.

He and his crew film publish the interviews as part of the work of their PAC, the Be A Hero fund, which attempts to hold politicians accountable on health care and other issues by using the stories of average Americans as their persuasion tool.

Barkan realized the power of his exchanges with politicians when he met former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake by chance in December 2017 on an airplane. Overwhelmed by his mounting medical bills, Barkan urged Flake not to support the GOP tax bill, which he believed would disrupt his health care coverage. ""You can save my life,"" Barkan told Flake in a n exchange captured by a fellow passenger . ""Please remember this conversation."" Flake did end up voting for the tax bill -- in contradiction to Barkan's request -- but that exchange vaulted Barkan into the national spotlight.

As Barkan has explained to the current crop of presidential candidates, his insurance company tried to deny coverage for a breathing assistance machine that he needed to live. He said he, his wife Rachael, an assistant and a lawyer spent ""endless time on the phone trying to get our insurance company to behave properly, lawfully. Beyond that, his family is billed $20,000 a month out of pocket for the 24-hour home care that he needs.

""I'm lucky to have wealthy supporters cover the cost for us, but that's not an option for a lot of people -- most just go bankrupt,"" he told CNN, which provided questions to Barkan ahead of time to give him enough time to write out answers.

""Ninety percent of Americans with ALS choose not to go on a ventilator because it requires 24-hour care, which most insurance plans don't cover. In Japan, where long-term care is guaranteed, the numbers are reversed. That just isn't right, and it doesn't need to be this way.""

That view has fueled Barkan's advocacy for Medicare for All, the signature health care proposal from Sanders: ""I've come to believe that fundamentally we need radical, disruptive change to the status quo,"" he said. ""The only plan I've seen that aims for that level of ambition is Medicare for All.""

He believes that any plan that stops short of the promise of Medicare for All -- the kinds of plans that have been proposed by Buttigieg, Biden and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, for example — ""won't deliver the universal coverage or the cost savings that we need.""

Barkan testifies before the House Rules Committee at a hearing on a ""Medicare for All"" bill on Capitol Hill in April 2019.

Barkan, who gets around in a wheelchair, speaks through a vocalizer and takes his meals through a feeding tube in his stomach, has still managed to make his sense of urgency felt through in-depth conversations with Buttigieg, Sanders, Harris, Warren, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, and Julián Castro, the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Barack Obama.

He says Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and businessman Asndrew Yang have also agreed to meet with him. The Be A Hero PAC has started a petition calling on Biden to meet with Barkan. Biden's team did not respond to CNN's query about why the former vice president has not responded to Barkan's invitation.

But Barkan isn't giving up on his hope for a one-on-one with one of the 2020 race's front-runners.

It's a persistence that New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez notes in the prologue she wrote for his new memoir, ""Eyes to the Wind.""

Even through his vocalizer, Barkan's testimony to Congress ""forced an urgency and moral clarity that members could not look away from or ignore,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote.

""I saw their discomfort at issuing the usual excuses, and Ady also would not tolerate them—even with many physical capabilities gone,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote.

The New York Democrat first met Barkan when he stopped by a labor town hall that she was holding at a church in the Bronx after winning her primary election last year. He could still speak at that point and she held the microphone for him as he addressed the crowd.

They met again this year, at her congressional office after the his testimony to Congress.

Barkan acknowledges that part of the power of his advocacy is that he is dying from ALS, a fact he points out in his Twitter profile. He told CNN he is ""trying to use the time I have left here to make things better for as long as I still can.""

""If I could be healthy and completely anonymous, I would do it in a heartbeat,"" he said. But because of his illness, his activism with Be a Hero and the Center for Popular Democracy have drawn national notice. His team went on to travel the country making health-care ads that he said were among the top-performing spots of 2018.

""We built a platform that made it hard for candidates to ignore us,"" Barkan said. ""There are millions of folks who the candidates should sit down with. I'm just hoping I can be a voice for them and force candidates to answer questions that really matter to people."""
747,"Jeff Zeleny, Arlette Saenz, Dan Merica, Fredreka Schouten and David Wright, CNN","Washington (CNN)A coalition of top Democratic strategists and donors are intensifying conversations about setting up an outside group to bolster Joe Biden's presidential candidacy, people familiar with the matter tell CNN, aiming to create a super PAC designe… [+8193 chars]","The former vice president has relied on maxed-out contributors for 38% of the money he's raised so far, new figures show. His key rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination have far less tapped-out donors to help fuel their campaigns.",2019-10-24,CNN,Biden allies intensify push for super PAC after lackluster fundraising quarter,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/23/politics/joe-biden-fundraising-super-pac/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Joe Biden's presidential campaign on Thursday signaled that it was dropping its objections to the creation of an outside group that would defend against well-financed attacks from President Donald Trump's campaign.

""In this time of crisis in our politics, it is not surprising that those who are dedicated to defeating Donald Trump are organizing in every way permitted by current law to bring an end to his disastrous presidency,"" Kate Bedingfield, Biden's deputy campaign manager, said in a statement. ""Nothing changes unless we defeat Donald Trump.""

The statement, which is a stark shift in the position of the Biden campaign, came after CNN reported a coalition of top Democratic strategists and donors loyal to Biden were moving closer to setting up a super PAC to help the former vice president's candidacy.

The idea of building an outside organization had been the subject of discussion for weeks by Biden allies, but the conversations intensified in the wake of a cash crunch for the former vice president's campaign. Biden reported last week having less than $9 million in the bank, significantly less than his leading rivals.

Larry Rasky, the former Biden aide who is spearheading the effort to stand up the super PAC, responded to the Biden campaign by pledging to ""have (Biden's) back.""

""We intend to fight back against the lies and distortions we're seeing now from Trump, his allies, the Russians, and the Republican Party. While other candidates have groups supporting their efforts, no other Democrat has to fight this two-front war,"" Rasky said.

While Biden had previously spoken out against the creation of a super PAC, which would operate entirely separately from his campaign, several longtime allies say it's clear that his presidential bid needs help. No final decision has been made about launching the outside group, but allies have started contacting potential vendors and lining up possible donors to fuel a super PAC, sources familiar with the efforts tell CNN.

""They know they can use all the help they can get,"" one Biden ally told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the group. ""Trump is crushing him with spending.""

In the statement on Thursday, Bedingfield said Biden would ""push to remove private money from our federal elections"" if he won the White House.

But it was also clear Biden has no intention of unilaterally disarming in the wake of the attacks from Trump, with Bedingfield saying: ""He and his allies are already spending massive amounts of money on paid television and digital advertising to intervene directly in the Democratic primaries with the goal of preventing Joe Biden, the opponent that Trump fears most, from becoming the Democratic nominee.""

The Biden campaign's apparent reversal drew immediate criticism Thursday from one of his rivals, Bernie Sanders. In a statement, Sanders' campaign manager Faiz Shakir said Biden was ""endorsing an effort to buy the primary through a super PAC that can rake in unlimited cash from billionaires and corporations.""

Shakir called it ""a recipe to maintain a corrupt political system.""

The group End Citizens United, which opposes unlimited money in politics, also blasted the former vice president.

""It is incredibly disappointing to see Vice President Biden completely reverse his position now that times are tough,"" group president Tiffany Miller said in a statement. ""This is exactly the time he needs support from real people the most. We urge him to reconsider this decision and disavow this super PAC.""

The potential outside group would be comprised of longtime Biden supporters and admirers from the Obama-Biden administration who believe the former vice president has the best chance of defeating Trump. But they worry he is unable to compete in the Democratic primary while simultaneously fighting back against Trump.

Biden's fundraising haul last quarter totaled nearly $15.7 million, but the candidate spent more than he raised, ending the quarter with $8.98 million cash on hand. Biden is outmatched in cash reserves by South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has amassed a stockpile of $33.7 million.

Biden's allies are most concerned about combating the attacks coming from Trump. His reelection campaign, joint fundraising committees and the Republican National Committee ended the quarter with a combined $158 million cash on hand. Trump's massive war chest has already been used to target Biden and Democrats with millions of dollars in campaign ads in the wake of the Ukraine controversy, which prompted an impeachment inquiry into the President.

The former vice president recently told reporters he's ""confident"" his campaign will have the resources to engage in a potentially long primary fight despite the fundraising lag.

""Remember we got started later than anybody at all in this campaign, number one. Number two, we did not start off by dropping $10 million from a Senate campaign, wherever that money was raised from into a race,"" Biden said in Columbus following the debate last week. ""We're doing fine, our fundraising is building. We've raised a lot of money online, and we've raised money offline as well, so we feel confident we're going to be ready.""

A Biden adviser says the campaign has raised as much money online during the first two weeks of October as it did during the entire month of September.

Yet there is deep concern inside the Biden campaign and among his supporters.

Campaign filings show that one-quarter of Biden's spending in the July to September period went to payroll, and his campaign spent more than $920,000 on private charter flights in that same timeframe. Additionally, the Biden campaign spent $2 million on digital advertising and media ad buys last quarter, and earlier this month, it announced a $6 million digital and broadcast ad campaign in the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.

""We're comfortable with where we are, and we're comfortable with the investments we've made to date,"" said Pete Kavanaugh, deputy campaign manager for Biden. ""We feel we have more than enough resources to execute as we want to over the next 90 days as we head into Iowa.""

""There's not going to be any changes in the plans because this is where we planned to be,"" added Kavanaugh.

Biden has dedicated a significant portion of his time to traditional high dollar fundraisers, attending more than 70 donor events since he launched his campaign. But he's lagged in small-dollar donations, which have powered the fundraising apparatus of Sanders and Warren, who both have eschewed big-dollar fundraising in their campaigns.

The former vice president has relied on maxed-out contributors for 38% of the money he's raised so far in his presidential bid, according to an analysis of financial disclosure reports, giving the candidate fewer opportunities than many of his rivals to return to loyal donors again for cash as the Democratic primary campaign heats up.

More than $14 million of the $37.6 million Biden collected from individual contributors through the end of September came from donors who gave $2,800 or more to his bid for his party's presidential nomination, according to a tally provided to CNN by the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute, which examines money in politics.

By comparison, just 3% and 5% of the money raised by his Sanders and Warren, respectively, came from donors who donated at least $2,800 -- the maximum an individual can donate to a candidate for a primary election.

By contrast, Warren and Sanders have fueled their campaigns largely with online small-dollar contributors, who can be tapped repeatedly for money before hitting the $2,800 limit on primary donations. Nearly 70% of the individual contributions that Sanders has raised so far came from donors giving $200 or less; Warren has a similar profile, at about 64%.

Biden's share of individual contributions raised from small dollar donors during the course of the campaign stands at roughly 35%.

Joe Trippi, a veteran Democratic strategist, said Biden has enough money, right now.

""He can get through the early states without much of a problem, but if he stumbles during that period, his money could easily dry up,"" Trippi said. ""He's working without a net at that point. It's hard to see how small-dollar Internet money would flow for him at that moment, and the maxed-out donors can't do more.""

In recent days, the Biden campaign has intensified its pleas for money, pointing out in urgent fundraising requests the significant gap in campaign cash with some of his leading rivals.

""Right now, we're trailing Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders' cash-on-hand by big margins,"" Biden wrote in a fundraising e-mail Tuesday morning. ""We've got to make up lost ground quickly.""

A source close to the campaign acknowledged they intend to try dramatically ramping up their digital focus aiming to increase contributions and support, but it's not clear what immediate adjustments might be made to their fundraising operation.

""What you've got here is clearly the frontrunner for the entire time and a finance team that can't capitalize on that,"" said John Morgan, a Florida attorney who held a fundraiser for Biden earlier this year. ""Changes have to be made, and you know, Joe Biden is probably the nicest guy in the world, and it may be hard for him to do that, but too much is at stake not to do it.""

Since the start of his presidential bid, Biden's campaign has said he would disavow any spending from a super PAC.

But as he faces an onslaught of attacks from Trump and sluggish fundraising numbers, several allies say it's time for him to accept the help. Bernard Schwartz, a private investor and donor to the former vice president's campaign, said he spoke with Biden within the last two weeks and encouraged him to do just that.

""People out there need some assurance that he has other, additional funds that he expects to come in,"" Schwartz said.

This story has been updated with the Biden campaign's response to the creation of a potential super PAC."

Harris is struggling to regain the top-tier status she once held early in her campaign. While the presidential hopefuls are vying to win over early primary state voters, a candidate’s support in their respective home state – particularly among those who are currently serving as a lawmaker – can speak volumes.

The California lawmaker is failing to capture support from residents of her home state, falling to fourth place, a Change Research poll shows.

According to the poll, taken for KQED October 15-18, 2019, among 2,605 Democrat voters, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is leading in the Golden State with 28 percent support, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) with 24 percent, and Joe Biden (D) with 19 percent. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who is beginning to surpass Harris in key national and early caucus state polls, came in fourth place with nine percent support, causing Harris to drop to fifth place with eight percent support.

The gap between Warren and Harris has widened by six points over the last month.

“The October survey puts Harris 20 percentage points behind Sen. Warren, compared with a 14 percentage point gap in our September poll,” KQED reports.

Even among women, Harris falls far behind the top tier, earning just seven percent support from female Democrat voters in her state:

By gender, Warren is the top choice of female voters with 31% support, followed by Sanders with 23% and Biden at 21%. Buttigieg and Harris are the choice of 8% and 7% of women respectively. Among men, Sanders edges out Warren 25% to 23% with Biden third at 16%, followed by Buttigieg at 10% and Harris with 9%.

The poll’s margin of error is +/- 2.4 percent.

The Change Research poll’s results coincide with a Civiqs survey released this week, which shows Harris continuing to fall in Iowa with just three percent support. This is despite her change in strategy, beefing up resources and appearances in the Hawkeye State in recent weeks."

The poll, taken October 1-3, among 887 likely U.S. voters, shows the president edging out all of his potential Democrat challengers, minus Warren, who tied with Trump with 45 percent support. Notably, ten percent said they were “not sure” who they would vote for between the two.

While many Democrats view Biden as the most electable candidate, the survey’s results show Trump defeating Biden 47 percent to 45 percent thanks, in part, to the president closing the gap in support among independent, suburban, and Hispanics voters.

According to Zogby Analytics:

The reason President Trump is winning, barely, in a hypothetical match-up with the former vice president, Joe Biden, is that, in addition to winning with his normal base of men (Trump leads 54% to 39%), white voters (Trump leads 53% to 40%), union voters (Trump leads 62% to 32%), and southern voters (Trump leads 50% to 43%), Trump has also tightened the race with Independents (Biden leads 42% to 36%), suburban voters (Biden leads 49% to 43%), and Hispanics (Biden leads 47% to 43%). Trump is also beating Biden convincingly with two demographics he has recently made inroads with: large city voters (Trump leads 50% to 44%) and Generation X voters age 30-49 (Trump leads 49% to 41%).

Trump also beats Sanders by a two-point margin, 46 percent to 44 percent, although Sanders continues to hold an edge with younger voters (18-29) with 56 percent support to Trump’s 37 percent.

The president appears to perform the best against Buttigieg, who has failed to break through the top tier of candidates in the crowded Democrat field. Trump beats him by 11 points – 49 percent to 38 percent – and defeats Harris 47 percent to 41 percent. The margin of error is +/- 3.3 percent.

Shares of Twitter plummeted more than 19 percent during trading Thursday. The company posted earnings per share of 17 cents, falling short of the 20 cents that was expected by Wall Street analysts. Revenue for the period was $823.7 million, versus the $874 million expected.

For the third quarter, “we discovered, and took steps to remediate bugs that primarily affected our legacy Mobile Application Promotion (MAP) product, impacting our ability to target ads and share data with measurement and ad partners,” Twitter said in its letter to shareholders.

“We also experienced greater-than-expected seasonality in our advertising business that began in July and continued into August.”

Twitter said these issues negatively impacted year-over-year revenue growth for the period.

Advertising revenue hit $702 million for the third quarter, which was up from the same period last year, but also failed to match analyst expectations.

Twitter also published fourth-quarter guidance that fell short of expectations. The company is forecasting total revenue to be between $940 million and $1.01 billion for the period, which is below the $1.06 billion that Wall Street is expecting.

In recent weeks, Twitter has found itself in the middle of a Democratic skirmish over whether President Donald Trump should be banned from the platform.

Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) has called on Twitter to give President Trump the boot, claiming that he incites “fear” and that he made comments about the so-called White House “whistleblower.”

But rival candidates Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) have both said President Trump should be allowed to remain on Twitter.

Klobuchar, the ninth candidate to qualify for the November debate, celebrated the news on Twitter and thanked her supporters.

“We just qualified for the November Democratic debate,” Klobuchar wrote. “Thanks to everyone for working so hard, making a small donation, and helping us grow our momentum.”

“We’ve made so much progress, but we need to keep going,” Klobuchar added. “Donate to our campaign today!”

Klobuchar’s qualification for the debate comes after she received more than three percent support in a national poll, conducted by Quinnipiac University, that was released Thursday. Klobuchar had previously hit three percent support in three other polls approved by the Democratic National Committee. Klobuchar’s campaign also announced that Klobuchar had reached the 165,000-donor threshold.

The debate, which will be held on November 20 in Atlanta, is sponsored by MSNBC and the Washington Post and will be moderated by NBC News’s Andrea Mitchell and Kristen Welker, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, and the Washington Post’s Ashley Parker.

Others who have qualified for the November Democrat presidential primary debate include former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Pete Buttigieg (D), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), billionaire Tom Steyer (D), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and tech guru Andrew Yang (D).

While the venue has not yet been announced, the qualification deadline for the fifth debate is November 13."

Biden has 34 percent support among Democrats/Democrat-leaning independents who are registered to vote while Sen. Elizabeth Warren only registers 19 percent support. Sen. Bernie Sanders has 16 percent while Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris only have six percent support each. Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke end up with three percent support.

Political analysts believed the fourth Democrat debate hosted by CNN would shake up the race, as Biden continued to deliver an underwhelming performance and other candidates targeted Sen. Elizabeth Warren. And respondents seemed to agree with this assessment. When asked “which candidate do you think did the best job in the debate?” Warren was ranked number one with 28%, Biden second at 15%, and Bernie Sanders third at 13%.

Yet Biden’s support jumped ten points from the last poll taken in September, from 24 percent to 34 percent. Warren only increased her support by one percent.

Biden was also targeted by President Donald Trump for corruption in recent weeks, as the president attacked Biden’s son Hunter for his shady foreign business deals in Ukraine and China while his father was vice president.

A big majority of moderate/conservative Democrat voters chose Biden as their first choice; 43 percent to Warren’s 12 percent and Bernie Sanders ten percent.

Fifty-three percent of potential Democrat voters in the poll said that they might change their minds, while 46 percent said that they would definitely support their first choice.

The CNN Poll was conducted from October 17-20 by SSRS of 1,003 adults, 424 registered voters who identified as Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents. The margin of error among potential Democrat voters is +/- 5.8 points."

While there has been significant fluctuation in national polling data in recent days, Biden’s fall in the Hawkeye State appears to be consistent with the overall trend.

According to the survey, taken October 18-22, 2019, among 598 likely Democratic Caucus attendees, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is leading the pack with 28 percent support – a four-point jump from last month’s results. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) jumped to second place with 20 percent support, marking a seven-point jump for the South Bend mayor. Buttigieg’s spike coincides with the Suffolk University/USA Today poll released Monday, which showed the presidential hopeful rising to third place with 13 percent support among the crowded field of candidates.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) fell to third place, trailing Buttigieg by two points with 18 percent support. Most significantly, perhaps, is Biden’s fourth-place status, garnering just 12 percent support – a four-point drop from September’s results.

The poll shows Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) in a distant fifth place with four percent support, followed by Tom Steyer (D) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) with three percent support each. Harris’s single-digit support follows weeks of pledging to blitz Iowa, telling one colleague that she was going to “f*cking” move there.

The poll’s margin of error is +/- five percentage points:

Iowa Democratic Caucus: Warren 28 (+4 Since last Month)

Buttigieg 20 (+7)

Sanders 18 (+2)

Biden 12 (-4)

Respondents were also asked to choose a second choice candidate.

“If the Democratic Caucuses were held today, which one of the following candidates would be your second choice?” the survey asked.

The order among top-tier candidates remained unchanged. According to the survey, 24 percent chose Warren as their second choice candidate, 14 percent selected Buttigieg, 13 percent chose Sanders, and 10 percent went with Biden."

Elizabeth Warren topping the field with 28 percent of the vote and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) slowly regaining his footing.

The poll, taken October 17-21, 2019, among 713 Democrat voters and Democrat-leaning independents, found Warren in the lead with 28 percent support, followed by Biden, who fell seven points behind with 21 percent support.

One of the most significant takeaways from the poll is Sanders’ slow regain, coming in third place with 15 percent support. The last Quinnipiac University Poll, taken prior to the October 15 debate, showed Sanders polling at 11 percent.

The poll also shows Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) with a notable boost, coming in fourth place with ten percent support, followed by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) with five percent support. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) garnered three percent support, with the remaining candidates seeing two percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.6 percent.

While voters still view Biden as the most viable candidate in a matchup against Trump, that position is slipping.

According to Quinnipiac:

Biden is still viewed as the candidate who has the best chance of winning against Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, but he is not as strong on this question as he once was. In today’s poll, Biden gets 42 percent, but this is down from 48 percent in the October 14 poll and his high of 56 percent in an April 30 poll. Warren comes in second on this electability question with 20 percent, followed by Sanders at 14 percent. Sanders is viewed as the most honest Democratic candidate for president by 28 percent of Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, followed by Biden and Warren who receive 15 percent apiece, and Buttigieg with 11 percent. Sanders and Warren are at the top on the question of which candidate “cares most about people like you,” as Sanders gets 28 percent, Warren receives 24 percent, and Biden gets 14 percent.

The October Quinnipiac University Poll showed Warren with 30 percent to Biden’s 27 percent, indicating that Sanders’ slow regain is affecting the top two candidates in an impactful way.

“Former Vice President Joe Biden slips, Senator Elizabeth Warren steadies, Senator Bernie Sanders gets his groove back, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg breaks back into double digits,” Quinnipiac University polling analyst Mary Snow said of the poll’s results.

Warren’s extended lead over Biden and Sanders’ bump follows a CNN poll released this week, showing the former vice president as the clear frontrunner with 34 percent to Warren’s 19 percent and Sanders’ 16 percent."

Katie Porter plans to endorse Elizabeth Warren,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/24/politics/katie-porter-elizabeth-warren-endorsement/index.html,"(CNN) Democratic Rep. Katie Porter of California, a first-term lawmaker who has gained wide notice for her forceful grilling of corporate executives in congressional hearings, plans to endorse Sen. Elizabeth Warren for president, two people familiar with the decision told CNN.

Porter, who captured a historically Republican district in 2018, is one of the highest-profile members of the freshman class, and just this week she conducted a scathing interrogation of Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, on Capitol Hill.

Her expected endorsement is a coup for Warren, whose rise in the polls has not yet been matched by support from Democratic elected officials. It would also be a blow to Porter's fellow Californian, Sen. Kamala Harris, who has been counting on her home state's primary to help her mount a comeback in the race.

Spokespeople for Warren and Porter declined to comment.

Both Warren and Harris are personally close with Porter, and both senators endorsed her in a competitive primary election last year. Porter is a former student of Warren's at Harvard Law School and, like Warren, is an expert on bankruptcy law. Porter worked closely with Harris when the senator was the attorney general of California, helping oversee a major legal settlement between the state and mortgage lenders.

The president is receiving the “Bipartisan Justice Award” Friday in Columbia, South Carolina, from “the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center, a group founded by twenty black Republicans and twenty black Democrats in 2015,” the Daily Caller reported.

The award is being presented at the 2019 Second Step Presidential Justice Forum, which is being held at Benedict College, one of roughly 100 historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in the U.S. The annual distinction recognizes a public servant who works with members of the other party to achieve criminal justice reform.

The Daily Caller adds that nearly every Democratic presidential candidate is scheduled to attend the gathering at some point this weekend:

The following Democrats are set to attend the forum: Maryland Rep. John Delaney, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former HUD Secretary Julian Castro, and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard as well as Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

(Not listed was former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX), whose campaign ejected this reporter from an event at Benedict in August.)

Trump signed the First Step Act last year, providing opportunities for certain federal prisoners to reduce their sentences by committing to more intensive rehabilitation programs, including job and skills training.

Some conservatives were skeptical of the legislation, but Trump earned bipartisan praise from within the black community.

Democratic candidates have tended to ignore the new law in making pledges for new criminal justice reforms, as if unwilling to acknowledge Trump’s success.

They will have trouble avoiding it this weekend.

Democratic candidates, in order to qualify for the debate, will now need to receive 4% in at least four national or early state polls that meet the DNC's criteria or 6% in two early state polls. These polls must be released between October 16 and December 12.

Candidates will also have to have received donations from at least 200,000 unique donors, with a minimum of 800 from at least 20 different states. Like the polling threshold, candidate will have until December 12 to meet the fundraising threshold.

PBS NewsHour and Politico will co-host the debate on December 19 in Los Angeles.

These new thresholds are an increase to what candidates had to achieve before the Democratic National Committee's November debate : 3% in at least four DNC-approved polls of Democratic voters nationally (or at least 5% in two polls of the early-voting states) and donations from 165,000 separate donors -- including a minimum of 600 donors each in at least 20 states or territories.

This year, month after month, he has drawn most of the major presidential candidates to his doorstep and championed ""Medicare for All"" while forcing the presidential contenders to think through the impact of their health care agendas in the most personal terms.

He brought California Sen. Kamala Harris to tears recalling the day her mother was diagnosed with colon cancer. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren used Barkan's case to punctuate the failures of the healthcare system during a July presidential debate: ""Ady has health insurance, good health insurance, and it's not nearly enough,"" she said.

Barkan and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the author of the Medicare for All legislation, discussed their legacies during their conversation, which was posted online in early September.

""In terms of your legacy, Ady,"" Sanders told Barkan, ""I think it will be very clear that even with the terrible illness that you're struggling with right now, that you didn't give up, that you understood that -- especially given your illness -- that you could play a significant in rallying the American people toward a sane and humane health care system.""

In the latest interview released Thursday with Pete Buttigieg , the South Bend, Indiana Mayor told Barkan that it was the first time he'd been around breathing equipment since the death of his father, who had cancer, in January.

""We sat down with a social worker who basically explained to us at the hospital that in terms of long term care our best option was probably for our family to spend down everything that we had until we were asset-poor enough to qualify for Medicaid,"" Buttigieg told Barkan, according to the transcript shared with CNN. ""I remember just thinking, is that how this works in America?""

The two debated their differing views on Medicare for All, and Barkan told Buttigieg he appreciated that the mayor was ""willing to have the tough conversations even when someone doesn't agree with you.""

In their exchange, Barkan called out former Vice President Joe Biden, who Barkan says is the only top-tier presidential candidate who has not responded to his invitation to meet.

On September 18, he issued a searing plea to Biden, noting that Biden has his own heartbreaking struggles involving the healthcare system (most recently with the death of his son Beau in 2015 from a brain tumor).

""Mr. Vice President you know about illness. You know about doctors and hospitals. You know that health care is personal. ... You won't come talk to me about it?"" Barkan said in video missive to Biden the day before undergoing surgery for a tracheostomy to help him breathe. ""Look a dying man in the eyes and tell me how we fix this country.""

In an interview with CNN this month, Barkan described ALS as ""the story of things becoming impossible"" -- from a simple stroll around the neighborhood to his ability to tickle his 3-year-old son Carl. ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, ultimately depriving the brain of its ability to initiate and control muscle movement, including the loss of speech. (Barkan now speaks through a computer).

""It's exhausting and overwhelming,"" Barkan told CNN. ""For me, ALS has been a lesson in exactly how broken our health care system is and why it's so important to fix it.""

In this family photo, Barkan is pictured with his wife Rachael and son Carl in October 2016.

Barkan, a life-long advocate on economic justice issues who was diagnosed with ALS in October 2016, has imparted those lessons not only with high-profile testimony in Washington, but also in these intimate one-on-one conversations with candidates.

He and his crew film publish the interviews as part of the work of their PAC, the Be A Hero fund, which attempts to hold politicians accountable on health care and other issues by using the stories of average Americans as their persuasion tool.

Barkan realized the power of his exchanges with politicians when he met former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake by chance in December 2017 on an airplane. Overwhelmed by his mounting medical bills, Barkan urged Flake not to support the GOP tax bill, which he believed would disrupt his health care coverage. ""You can save my life,"" Barkan told Flake in a n exchange captured by a fellow passenger . ""Please remember this conversation."" Flake did end up voting for the tax bill -- in contradiction to Barkan's request -- but that exchange vaulted Barkan into the national spotlight.

As Barkan has explained to the current crop of presidential candidates, his insurance company tried to deny coverage for a breathing assistance machine that he needed to live. He said he, his wife Rachael, an assistant and a lawyer spent ""endless time on the phone trying to get our insurance company to behave properly, lawfully. Beyond that, his family is billed $20,000 a month out of pocket for the 24-hour home care that he needs.

""I'm lucky to have wealthy supporters cover the cost for us, but that's not an option for a lot of people -- most just go bankrupt,"" he told CNN, which provided questions to Barkan ahead of time to give him enough time to write out answers.

""Ninety percent of Americans with ALS choose not to go on a ventilator because it requires 24-hour care, which most insurance plans don't cover. In Japan, where long-term care is guaranteed, the numbers are reversed. That just isn't right, and it doesn't need to be this way.""

That view has fueled Barkan's advocacy for Medicare for All, the signature health care proposal from Sanders: ""I've come to believe that fundamentally we need radical, disruptive change to the status quo,"" he said. ""The only plan I've seen that aims for that level of ambition is Medicare for All.""

He believes that any plan that stops short of the promise of Medicare for All -- the kinds of plans that have been proposed by Buttigieg, Biden and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, for example — ""won't deliver the universal coverage or the cost savings that we need.""

Barkan testifies before the House Rules Committee at a hearing on a ""Medicare for All"" bill on Capitol Hill in April 2019.

Barkan, who gets around in a wheelchair, speaks through a vocalizer and takes his meals through a feeding tube in his stomach, has still managed to make his sense of urgency felt through in-depth conversations with Buttigieg, Sanders, Harris, Warren, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, and Julián Castro, the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Barack Obama.

He says Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and businessman Asndrew Yang have also agreed to meet with him. The Be A Hero PAC has started a petition calling on Biden to meet with Barkan. Biden's team did not respond to CNN's query about why the former vice president has not responded to Barkan's invitation.

But Barkan isn't giving up on his hope for a one-on-one with one of the 2020 race's front-runners.

It's a persistence that New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez notes in the prologue she wrote for his new memoir, ""Eyes to the Wind.""

Even through his vocalizer, Barkan's testimony to Congress ""forced an urgency and moral clarity that members could not look away from or ignore,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote.

""I saw their discomfort at issuing the usual excuses, and Ady also would not tolerate them—even with many physical capabilities gone,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote.

The New York Democrat first met Barkan when he stopped by a labor town hall that she was holding at a church in the Bronx after winning her primary election last year. He could still speak at that point and she held the microphone for him as he addressed the crowd.

They met again this year, at her congressional office after the his testimony to Congress.

Barkan acknowledges that part of the power of his advocacy is that he is dying from ALS, a fact he points out in his Twitter profile. He told CNN he is ""trying to use the time I have left here to make things better for as long as I still can.""

""If I could be healthy and completely anonymous, I would do it in a heartbeat,"" he said. But because of his illness, his activism with Be a Hero and the Center for Popular Democracy have drawn national notice. His team went on to travel the country making health-care ads that he said were among the top-performing spots of 2018.

""We built a platform that made it hard for candidates to ignore us,"" Barkan said. ""There are millions of folks who the candidates should sit down with. I'm just hoping I can be a voice for them and force candidates to answer questions that really matter to people."""

""In this time of crisis in our politics, it is not surprising that those who are dedicated to defeating Donald Trump are organizing in every way permitted by current law to bring an end to his disastrous presidency,"" Kate Bedingfield, Biden's deputy campaign manager, said in a statement. ""Nothing changes unless we defeat Donald Trump.""

The statement, which is a stark shift in the position of the Biden campaign, came after CNN reported a coalition of top Democratic strategists and donors loyal to Biden were moving closer to setting up a super PAC to help the former vice president's candidacy.

The idea of building an outside organization had been the subject of discussion for weeks by Biden allies, but the conversations intensified in the wake of a cash crunch for the former vice president's campaign. Biden reported last week having less than $9 million in the bank, significantly less than his leading rivals.

Larry Rasky, the former Biden aide who is spearheading the effort to stand up the super PAC, responded to the Biden campaign by pledging to ""have (Biden's) back.""

""We intend to fight back against the lies and distortions we're seeing now from Trump, his allies, the Russians, and the Republican Party. While other candidates have groups supporting their efforts, no other Democrat has to fight this two-front war,"" Rasky said.

While Biden had previously spoken out against the creation of a super PAC, which would operate entirely separately from his campaign, several longtime allies say it's clear that his presidential bid needs help. No final decision has been made about launching the outside group, but allies have started contacting potential vendors and lining up possible donors to fuel a super PAC, sources familiar with the efforts tell CNN.

""They know they can use all the help they can get,"" one Biden ally told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the group. ""Trump is crushing him with spending.""

In the statement on Thursday, Bedingfield said Biden would ""push to remove private money from our federal elections"" if he won the White House.

But it was also clear Biden has no intention of unilaterally disarming in the wake of the attacks from Trump, with Bedingfield saying: ""He and his allies are already spending massive amounts of money on paid television and digital advertising to intervene directly in the Democratic primaries with the goal of preventing Joe Biden, the opponent that Trump fears most, from becoming the Democratic nominee.""

The Biden campaign's apparent reversal drew immediate criticism Thursday from one of his rivals, Bernie Sanders. In a statement, Sanders' campaign manager Faiz Shakir said Biden was ""endorsing an effort to buy the primary through a super PAC that can rake in unlimited cash from billionaires and corporations.""

Shakir called it ""a recipe to maintain a corrupt political system.""

The group End Citizens United, which opposes unlimited money in politics, also blasted the former vice president.

""It is incredibly disappointing to see Vice President Biden completely reverse his position now that times are tough,"" group president Tiffany Miller said in a statement. ""This is exactly the time he needs support from real people the most. We urge him to reconsider this decision and disavow this super PAC.""

The potential outside group would be comprised of longtime Biden supporters and admirers from the Obama-Biden administration who believe the former vice president has the best chance of defeating Trump. But they worry he is unable to compete in the Democratic primary while simultaneously fighting back against Trump.

Biden's fundraising haul last quarter totaled nearly $15.7 million, but the candidate spent more than he raised, ending the quarter with $8.98 million cash on hand. Biden is outmatched in cash reserves by South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has amassed a stockpile of $33.7 million.

Biden's allies are most concerned about combating the attacks coming from Trump. His reelection campaign, joint fundraising committees and the Republican National Committee ended the quarter with a combined $158 million cash on hand. Trump's massive war chest has already been used to target Biden and Democrats with millions of dollars in campaign ads in the wake of the Ukraine controversy, which prompted an impeachment inquiry into the President.

The former vice president recently told reporters he's ""confident"" his campaign will have the resources to engage in a potentially long primary fight despite the fundraising lag.

""Remember we got started later than anybody at all in this campaign, number one. Number two, we did not start off by dropping $10 million from a Senate campaign, wherever that money was raised from into a race,"" Biden said in Columbus following the debate last week. ""We're doing fine, our fundraising is building. We've raised a lot of money online, and we've raised money offline as well, so we feel confident we're going to be ready.""

A Biden adviser says the campaign has raised as much money online during the first two weeks of October as it did during the entire month of September.

Yet there is deep concern inside the Biden campaign and among his supporters.

Campaign filings show that one-quarter of Biden's spending in the July to September period went to payroll, and his campaign spent more than $920,000 on private charter flights in that same timeframe. Additionally, the Biden campaign spent $2 million on digital advertising and media ad buys last quarter, and earlier this month, it announced a $6 million digital and broadcast ad campaign in the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.

""We're comfortable with where we are, and we're comfortable with the investments we've made to date,"" said Pete Kavanaugh, deputy campaign manager for Biden. ""We feel we have more than enough resources to execute as we want to over the next 90 days as we head into Iowa.""

""There's not going to be any changes in the plans because this is where we planned to be,"" added Kavanaugh.

Biden has dedicated a significant portion of his time to traditional high dollar fundraisers, attending more than 70 donor events since he launched his campaign. But he's lagged in small-dollar donations, which have powered the fundraising apparatus of Sanders and Warren, who both have eschewed big-dollar fundraising in their campaigns.

The former vice president has relied on maxed-out contributors for 38% of the money he's raised so far in his presidential bid, according to an analysis of financial disclosure reports, giving the candidate fewer opportunities than many of his rivals to return to loyal donors again for cash as the Democratic primary campaign heats up.

More than $14 million of the $37.6 million Biden collected from individual contributors through the end of September came from donors who gave $2,800 or more to his bid for his party's presidential nomination, according to a tally provided to CNN by the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute, which examines money in politics.

By comparison, just 3% and 5% of the money raised by his Sanders and Warren, respectively, came from donors who donated at least $2,800 -- the maximum an individual can donate to a candidate for a primary election.

By contrast, Warren and Sanders have fueled their campaigns largely with online small-dollar contributors, who can be tapped repeatedly for money before hitting the $2,800 limit on primary donations. Nearly 70% of the individual contributions that Sanders has raised so far came from donors giving $200 or less; Warren has a similar profile, at about 64%.

Biden's share of individual contributions raised from small dollar donors during the course of the campaign stands at roughly 35%.

Joe Trippi, a veteran Democratic strategist, said Biden has enough money, right now.

""He can get through the early states without much of a problem, but if he stumbles during that period, his money could easily dry up,"" Trippi said. ""He's working without a net at that point. It's hard to see how small-dollar Internet money would flow for him at that moment, and the maxed-out donors can't do more.""

In recent days, the Biden campaign has intensified its pleas for money, pointing out in urgent fundraising requests the significant gap in campaign cash with some of his leading rivals.

""Right now, we're trailing Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders' cash-on-hand by big margins,"" Biden wrote in a fundraising e-mail Tuesday morning. ""We've got to make up lost ground quickly.""

A source close to the campaign acknowledged they intend to try dramatically ramping up their digital focus aiming to increase contributions and support, but it's not clear what immediate adjustments might be made to their fundraising operation.

""What you've got here is clearly the frontrunner for the entire time and a finance team that can't capitalize on that,"" said John Morgan, a Florida attorney who held a fundraiser for Biden earlier this year. ""Changes have to be made, and you know, Joe Biden is probably the nicest guy in the world, and it may be hard for him to do that, but too much is at stake not to do it.""

Since the start of his presidential bid, Biden's campaign has said he would disavow any spending from a super PAC.

But as he faces an onslaught of attacks from Trump and sluggish fundraising numbers, several allies say it's time for him to accept the help. Bernard Schwartz, a private investor and donor to the former vice president's campaign, said he spoke with Biden within the last two weeks and encouraged him to do just that.

""People out there need some assurance that he has other, additional funds that he expects to come in,"" Schwartz said.

This story has been updated with the Biden campaign's response to the creation of a potential super PAC."

Harris is struggling to regain the top-tier status she once held early in her campaign. While the presidential hopefuls are vying to win over early primary state voters, a candidate’s support in their respective home state – particularly among those who are currently serving as a lawmaker – can speak volumes.

The California lawmaker is failing to capture support from residents of her home state, falling to fourth place, a Change Research poll shows.

According to the poll, taken for KQED October 15-18, 2019, among 2,605 Democrat voters, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is leading in the Golden State with 28 percent support, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) with 24 percent, and Joe Biden (D) with 19 percent. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who is beginning to surpass Harris in key national and early caucus state polls, came in fourth place with nine percent support, causing Harris to drop to fifth place with eight percent support.

The gap between Warren and Harris has widened by six points over the last month.

“The October survey puts Harris 20 percentage points behind Sen. Warren, compared with a 14 percentage point gap in our September poll,” KQED reports.

Even among women, Harris falls far behind the top tier, earning just seven percent support from female Democrat voters in her state:

By gender, Warren is the top choice of female voters with 31% support, followed by Sanders with 23% and Biden at 21%. Buttigieg and Harris are the choice of 8% and 7% of women respectively. Among men, Sanders edges out Warren 25% to 23% with Biden third at 16%, followed by Buttigieg at 10% and Harris with 9%.

The poll’s margin of error is +/- 2.4 percent.

The Change Research poll’s results coincide with a Civiqs survey released this week, which shows Harris continuing to fall in Iowa with just three percent support. This is despite her change in strategy, beefing up resources and appearances in the Hawkeye State in recent weeks."

Here's why America's fast food giants are so focused on chicken sandwiches.",2019-10-25,CNN,"Crispy, spicy and hugely popular: Why chicken sandwiches are taking over America",https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/25/business/mcdonalds-popeyes-chick-fil-a-chicken-sandwich/index.html,"Months after this summer's brief but brutal fried chicken sandwich battle, rivals are diligently plotting to win the longer war.

Popeyes, which sparked the latest fight with its spicy chicken sandwich in August, is scrambling to bring back the viral sensation ""as soon as possible."" Chick-fil-A is steadily growing its reach, outselling chicken chains nearly twice its size. And McDonald's franchise operators, who watched the fight from the sidelines, are pressuring their corporate boss to bring the crispy, breaded prize home.

""JFK called for a man on the moon,"" they wrote in a July letter. ""Our call should be a category leading chicken sandwich.""

Why all the hype over a fried cutlet on a bun? As visits to fast food restaurants stagnate, rivals are eyeing Chick-fil-A's runaway growth. The chain added about 1,000 locations and nearly tripled its sales over the last decade. With more than $10 billion in sales in 2018, the company has surpassed both Wendy's and Burger King to become the fifth largest fast food chain after McDonald's, Starbucks, Subway and Taco Bell.

""If you have the biggest share of a growing category, that is profits galore,"" said Michael Haracz, who until August served as McDonald's manager of culinary innovation. ""That is exponentially more sales, more buzz, more foot traffic to your restaurant.""

McDonald's, which says it is ""synonymous with burgers,"" has reason to worry: Beef consumption has fallen in the United States. Chicken is now the most popular meat by far.

There will be ""clear winners,"" Haracz said, who will dominate the space and scoop up profits — as long as they can keep up with demand.

Thirty-year food fight

Though the fight over fried chicken was especially buzzy this summer, it was part of a dynamic that dates back at least 30 years.

In 1989 McDonald's launched a national ""country-style"" McChicken sandwich and sparked a fight with Hardee's, then one of the largest fast food chains in the country. ""While McDonald`s is touting their new product, it isn't even comparable to our Chicken Fillet Sandwich, which has been on the market since 1979,"" Hardee's president said at the time, according to a 1989 report from the Charlotte Observer. The newspaper published the story with the headline, ""Chicken sandwiches incite fast food war.""

Over the ensuing decades, fast food chains have launched and relaunched new iterations of the sandwich. McDonald's has had multiple versions, including premium and limited-time offerings. Within the last year alone, it's served the Ultimate Chicken Sandwich, the Mighty Chicken Sandwich, a spicy BBQ chicken sandwich and the McChicken.

As companies experimented with chicken sandwiches, they occasionally caused a stir. In 2010, KFC made headlines with the Double Down — a limited-time-only cheese and bacon sandwich with two pieces of fried chicken where the bun should have been. (KFC briefly brought it back in 2014 .)

But even though items like the Double Down have gone viral, there may not have been anything quite like the frenzy that happened this summer, when Popeyes launched its national chicken sandwich.

It wasn't that Popeyes wasn't expecting the sandwich to be a hit. It painstakingly researched what would work with customers, and eventually landed on the right combination — a buttermilk battered and breaded white meat filet, topped with pickles and a choice of mayo or a spicy Cajun spread and served on a toasted brioche bun. Popeyes called the sandwich the ""biggest product launch in the last 30 years."" Felipe Athayde, president of the Americas at Popeyes, told the New York Times that the company had ""very aggressively forecasted"" demand , and expected to have sufficient supply through at least the end of September — about six weeks after its August 12 launch date. But stores throughout the country sold out of the sandwich within about two weeks.

Many point to a Twitter exchange as the instigator. On August 19, one week after Popeyes sandwich hit stores, Chick-fil-A's official Twitter account posted a message: ""Bun + Chicken + Pickles = all the <3 for the original."" Popeyes interpreted the message as a jab, retweeted the post and added "".... y'all good?""

The sassy response struck a nerve. It's racked up nearly 87,000 retweets and 324,000 likes, spawned memes and elicited innumerable cry-laugh emojis from social media users. Chick-fil-A didn't take the bait, but Wendy's stepped in and sparred with Popeyes on Twitter to the delight of onlookers.

It's unlikely that the brand war would have made such a huge impact if Americans weren't already interested in fried chicken sandwiches.

""There had always been fried chicken sandwiches,"" said Kara Nielsen, vice president of trends and marketing for CCD Innovation, a food and beverage consultancy. But she traces the current interest in the item to the 2008 financial crisis.

""One of the things that surged out of that recession moment was an interest in comfort food, as well as a lot of people opening food trucks, creating food stalls,"" she said. ""And so there were definitely a lot of fried chicken sandwiches coming out at that time. And it's never really stopped.""

And as fried chicken sandwiches gained local fans, a small, quirky chain was chugging steadily along.

The rise of Chick-fil-A

Chick-fil-A traces its roots back to founder S. Truett Cathy's original diner, Dwarf Grill, which opened in 1946. Cathy opened the first Chick-fil-A in 1967, in the Greenbriar Shopping Center in Atlanta.

For years, the company expanded primarily in shopping mall food courts. Then, in 1986, it opened its first standalone location in Atlanta. Today the chain operates more than 2,400 restaurants in 47 states and Washington, D.C. Other chicken chains are larger — Popeyes, for example, has more than 2,600 US restaurants and KFC has roughly 4,000. But Chick-fil-A outsells them.

Chick-fil-A's first restaurant in Atlanta's Greenbriar Mall in the late 1960s.

Ranked by annual revenue, Chick-fil-A is the fifth largest US restaurant chain after McDonald's, Starbucks, Subway and Taco Bell — all of which have far more stores.

Chick-fil-A's individual stores are more productive than any of its bigger competitors. They pulled in an average of $4.4 million in 2018, well above unit sales at McDonald's or Starbucks, according to Technomic, a company that specializes in research on the food industry.

The chain is also, according to polls and surveys, beloved.

An Axios Harris Poll published in March found that Chick-fil-A had the best reputation among US adults compared to Starbucks, Yum! Brands (which owns KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell), Chipotle, Papa John's and McDonald's. And for the past four years in a row, US teens surveyed by Piper Jaffray said Chick-fil-A was their favorite restaurant.

Customer service and food quality help explain Chick-fil-A's success. But it also has a commercially important X-factor: authenticity.

R.J. Hottovy, an analyst who covers food for Morningstar, said that in recent years, companies that have specialized in a particular product and appear more authentic tend to do better than those that try to appeal to everyone.

Chick-fil-A scores high on authenticity. It has stuck to Christian roots by keeping stores closed on Sundays, for example. But that conservative tradition has also earned backlash. In 2012 CEO Dan Cathy said he opposed gay marriage on religious grounds . That year the company was also criticized for donations made by the WinShape Foundation , which was started by founder Truett Cathy and financed largely by Chick-fil-A profits, to groups some characterized as anti-gay.

Chick-fil-A says that is has ""no political or social agenda,"" and that ""everyone is welcome in our restaurants."" Still, new stores have been met with protests . Some fans of fried chicken sandwiches may welcome an offering from a purveyor they see as more politically neutral, like Popeyes.

Nevertheless, Chick-fil-A has grown at a steady clip and picked up those devoted followers.

""There's so many people now who have an understanding or a notion of what Chick-fil-A is, even if they never eat there or if they've never seen one,"" Nielsen noted. ""It's become a bit of this mythical thing, and clearly millennials have found it, and found that it fits their bill.""

As Chick-fil-A locations pop up in more cities, more people rush to test out their sandwiches. That's helped boost fried chicken sandwich sales — and gotten other fast food chains to pay attention. ""This fried chicken trend keeps evolving because companies like Chick-fil-A expand their reach,"" Nielsen said.

While Chick-fil-A creeps across the nation, one group in particular is trying to defend its territory. McDonald's franchise operators are calling for reinforcements.

A McMission

On July 10 — a month before Popeyes launched its sandwich — the board of the National Owners Association, a group of McDonald's franchisees that formed in 2018, sent out a strongly-worded letter to its members.

""We are finding ways to drive profitable growth,"" the board wrote. ""Yet, we are still losing guest counts. This continues to be a concern.""

One reason for the loss, the board argued, is that customers craving a delicious fried chicken sandwich aren't going to McDonald's. They're going to Chick-fil-A.

""A favorite, that our customers want, is a chicken sandwich. Unfortunately, they have to go to Chick-fil-A for it,"" the board said. ""Chick-fil-A's results demonstrate the power of chicken. Yes, we have great Chicken McNuggets and our McChicken is a very good product. But we do not compete in the premium chicken sandwich category, either grilled or crispy.""

The letter continued with a warning: ""Our US Southeast markets' results should concern everyone. You may not have Chick-fil-A's in your market or to the degree they have them in the southeast, but they are coming. And they don't discount.""

McDonald's knows how to make chicken into a hit. In the early 1980s, around the time Americans first started losing interest in beef, McDonald's founder Ray Kroc wanted to add a chicken entree to the menu. The company's initial attempts, like a deep fried chicken pot pie, didn't resonate with customers. But eventually, McDonald's landed on a winner: Chicken McNuggets, which launched in 1983, were so successful that by 1985 the chain had become the second-largest chicken seller in the fast food space behind KFC.

""Chicken has been on the radar for quite a while at McDonald's,"" Haracz said. ""There's a variety of chicken sandwiches being tested.""

In the third quarter of 2019, traffic at US McDonald's restaurants was down . During an October call discussing the earnings, one analyst wondered whether McDonald's lost sales because it sat out the great chicken sandwich war.

""I think it's fair to assume with everything going on in the quarter with chicken that we would go a little bit the opposite way on chicken. So I think that's a fair conclusion,"" answered Kevin Ozan, the company's chief financial officer.

For now, McDonald's is keeping its plans close to the vest. The company declined to tell CNN Business when it expects to launch its next chicken sandwich, but noted, ""We are inspired by the customer demand for premium chicken sandwiches, and are working closely with our franchisees to deliver what our customers want. Stay tuned.""

A source close to the conversation between the owners and McDonald's leadership said a premium chicken sandwich may start rolling out as soon as this year.

But while McDonald's tinkers and focuses on other areas of the business, its franchise owners have been getting impatient.

In late August, after Popeyes' massively successful launch, Blake Casper, NOA's director, sent out another somber note.

""It was a busy week, especially if you work at Popeyes,"" he wrote. ""Popeyes came out with a chicken sandwich that rivals Chick-fil-A. It's the first time Chick-fil-A has blinked, or more accurately, was forced to blink. But make no mistake, they blinked. Wendy's got into the action and unfortunately, we're still not in the game.""

But, Casper continued, it's not over yet.

""That is going to change. We are working on a chicken sandwich that will compete. We will be in the game. People will tire of the service at Popeyes and they want an alternative to Chick-fil-A,"" he said.

""They want a chicken sandwich at McDonald's. We are going to give it to them."""

Shares of Twitter plummeted more than 19 percent during trading Thursday. The company posted earnings per share of 17 cents, falling short of the 20 cents that was expected by Wall Street analysts. Revenue for the period was $823.7 million, versus the $874 million expected.

For the third quarter, “we discovered, and took steps to remediate bugs that primarily affected our legacy Mobile Application Promotion (MAP) product, impacting our ability to target ads and share data with measurement and ad partners,” Twitter said in its letter to shareholders.

“We also experienced greater-than-expected seasonality in our advertising business that began in July and continued into August.”

Twitter said these issues negatively impacted year-over-year revenue growth for the period.

Advertising revenue hit $702 million for the third quarter, which was up from the same period last year, but also failed to match analyst expectations.

Twitter also published fourth-quarter guidance that fell short of expectations. The company is forecasting total revenue to be between $940 million and $1.01 billion for the period, which is below the $1.06 billion that Wall Street is expecting.

In recent weeks, Twitter has found itself in the middle of a Democratic skirmish over whether President Donald Trump should be banned from the platform.

Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) has called on Twitter to give President Trump the boot, claiming that he incites “fear” and that he made comments about the so-called White House “whistleblower.”

But rival candidates Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) have both said President Trump should be allowed to remain on Twitter.

Ocasio-Cortez, who formally endorsed Sanders at a rally in Queens last weekend, took Grande’s prompt a step further, channeling the superstar’s hits to promote some of the extreme left-wing proposals of the Democrat Party’s most progressive wing.

While there has been significant fluctuation in national polling data in recent days, Biden’s fall in the Hawkeye State appears to be consistent with the overall trend.

According to the survey, taken October 18-22, 2019, among 598 likely Democratic Caucus attendees, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is leading the pack with 28 percent support – a four-point jump from last month’s results. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) jumped to second place with 20 percent support, marking a seven-point jump for the South Bend mayor. Buttigieg’s spike coincides with the Suffolk University/USA Today poll released Monday, which showed the presidential hopeful rising to third place with 13 percent support among the crowded field of candidates.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) fell to third place, trailing Buttigieg by two points with 18 percent support. Most significantly, perhaps, is Biden’s fourth-place status, garnering just 12 percent support – a four-point drop from September’s results.

The poll shows Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) in a distant fifth place with four percent support, followed by Tom Steyer (D) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) with three percent support each. Harris’s single-digit support follows weeks of pledging to blitz Iowa, telling one colleague that she was going to “f*cking” move there.

The poll’s margin of error is +/- five percentage points:

“If the Democratic Caucuses were held today, which one of the following candidates would be your second choice?” the survey asked.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) would lead the Democrat field if twice-failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton were to jump in the race in place of Joe Biden (D), a McLaughlin & Associates poll released this week found.

According to recent reports from both the New York Times and Washington Post, Clinton has not taken a 2020 run off the table and is, instead, keeping tabs on the growing distress among some members of the Democrat Party, who are unhappy with the current selection of candidates.

“Hillary Clinton, according to two people close to her, has not ruled out jumping in herself, a sign that she is hearing similar dissatisfaction,” the Washington Post reported.

“But put it this way: It ain’t zero. And does she think about it all the time? Absolutely,” a source said, according to the Post.

Billionaire Michael Bloomberg is reportedly conducting himself the same way, telling those close to him that he would consider jumping in the race if Biden falters.

“Bloomberg is in if Biden is out,” a “New York billionaire with ties to Bloomberg,” told CNBC.

While the Times adds that the chances of either jumping in the race are “remote,” it indicates that Democrats close to the potential candidates “believe the only scenario under which they’d consider running is if Mr. Biden drops out or is badly weakened.”

A McLaughlin & Associates October 2019 poll released this week examined that scenario, taking Biden out of the equation and putting both Clinton and Bloomberg in the race.

While Bloomberg’s presence does not appear to make a significant impact, Biden’s absence and Clinton’s addition would cause Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) to rise to the top of the national field with 23 percent support. Under the scenario, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) would maintain her top tier status with 20 percent support, followed by Clinton with ten percent support. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) would also gain a notable boost, coming right behind Clinton with nine percent support.

Andrew Yang (D) would also enjoy a bump, jumping to six percent, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) with five percent support, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with four percent support, and Beto O’Rourke (D) with three percent support. The remaining candidates would garner two percent support or less. That includes Bloomberg, who would only see one percent support:

Elizabeth Warren topping the field with 28 percent of the vote and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) slowly regaining his footing.

The poll, taken October 17-21, 2019, among 713 Democrat voters and Democrat-leaning independents, found Warren in the lead with 28 percent support, followed by Biden, who fell seven points behind with 21 percent support.

One of the most significant takeaways from the poll is Sanders’ slow regain, coming in third place with 15 percent support. The last Quinnipiac University Poll, taken prior to the October 15 debate, showed Sanders polling at 11 percent.

The poll also shows Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) with a notable boost, coming in fourth place with ten percent support, followed by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) with five percent support. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) garnered three percent support, with the remaining candidates seeing two percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.6 percent.

While voters still view Biden as the most viable candidate in a matchup against Trump, that position is slipping.

According to Quinnipiac:

Biden is still viewed as the candidate who has the best chance of winning against Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, but he is not as strong on this question as he once was. In today’s poll, Biden gets 42 percent, but this is down from 48 percent in the October 14 poll and his high of 56 percent in an April 30 poll. Warren comes in second on this electability question with 20 percent, followed by Sanders at 14 percent. Sanders is viewed as the most honest Democratic candidate for president by 28 percent of Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, followed by Biden and Warren who receive 15 percent apiece, and Buttigieg with 11 percent. Sanders and Warren are at the top on the question of which candidate “cares most about people like you,” as Sanders gets 28 percent, Warren receives 24 percent, and Biden gets 14 percent.

The October Quinnipiac University Poll showed Warren with 30 percent to Biden’s 27 percent, indicating that Sanders’ slow regain is affecting the top two candidates in an impactful way.

“Former Vice President Joe Biden slips, Senator Elizabeth Warren steadies, Senator Bernie Sanders gets his groove back, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg breaks back into double digits,” Quinnipiac University polling analyst Mary Snow said of the poll’s results.

Warren’s extended lead over Biden and Sanders’ bump follows a CNN poll released this week, showing the former vice president as the clear frontrunner with 34 percent to Warren’s 19 percent and Sanders’ 16 percent."

CBP Office of Field Operations (OFO) officers assigned to the Laredo Port of Entry on October 24 observed a bus approaching for entry inspection from Mexico. During an initial inspection and interview, officers referred one of the passengers to a secondary inspection station. Officers believed the man matched the description of a suspect with an outstanding warrant, according to information obtained from Laredo Sector CBP officials.

During a secondary inspection, the CBP OFO officer carried out a fingerprint check to match the subject to the national criminal database used to match warrant and criminal history information. The database identified the migrant as 66-year-old Jesus Martinez who is currently wanted by the Harris County Sheriff’s Office in Houston on a warrant for Super Aggravated Sexual Assault. The alleged victim is under the age of six, CBP officials stated.

The officer arrested Martinez and turned him over to the Webb County Sheriff’s Office pending transfer to Harris County.

“Our frontline officers continue to steadfastly uphold our border security mission,” Laredo Port of Entry Port Director Albert Flores said in a written statement. “The processing and identity verification of a man with an outstanding felony warrant for child molestation helps keep our community safe and illustrates our dedication to our mission.”

Court records obtained by Breitbart Texas show that Martinez is wanted in Houston for an April 2018 allegation of sexual assault against a child under the age of six. Houston Police Department officers were unable to affect an arrest of the suspect at that time and a court issued a warrant for Martinez’s arrest.

Martinez has a previous conviction on a 2001 DWI charge. Martinez received one-year of probation for the offense which he successfully completed in December 2002."

“I know I’m the frontrunner. Find me a national poll with a notable – a couple exceptions. The last four that have come out – but look, this is a marathon,” Biden responded. “This is a marathon.”

The former vice president maintained the claim even after pushback by O’Donnell, who noted both Warren and Sanders have significantly more money in their campaign coffers.

“I just flat beat them,” Biden said, before adding, “We’re on a course to do extremely well. I’m not worried about being able to fund this campaign. I really am not, truly.”

Contrary to the former vice president’s assertion, most media outlets on both the left and right have deemed him to no longer be the frontrunner. In particular, outlets like Politico and The Washington Post have pointed to polls showing Biden well behind his rivals in the early caucus and primary states.

Since starting this campaign in late-April, Biden has dropped from leading by as much as double digits in states like Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada. A poll released from Iowa this week showed the former vice president in fourth place, trailing not only Sanders and Warren, but also South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

A similar situation has played out nationally, although to less of a degree. In the weeks after Biden first announced his campaign, he led the field by as much as 32 percentage points. In comparison, a Quinnipiac Poll from this week found the former vice president trailing Warren, 21 percent to 28 percent, respectively. A similar Quinnipiac Poll taken just before the most recent Democrat presidential primary, which most pundits agreed was not Biden’s best performance, had seen Warren leading the former vice president more narrowly, 30 percent to 27 percent.

Other national polls from around the same time, found Biden similarly displaced as the frontrunner:

Biden’s squandered lead in the polls has coincided with a drop-off in fundraising. Even though Biden started the race with a strong funding advantage, due to his connections with high-dollar donors, the former vice president ended the most recent fundraising quarter well behind his competitors. In between July and the end of September, Biden only raised $15.2 million. The sum was dwarfed by that raised by Sanders ($25.3 million), Buttigieg ($19.1 million), and Warren ($24.6 million).

Posing more of a problem for the former vice president, however, is that his campaign has spent heavily since announcing in late-April, depleting his total cash on hand to just $9 million at the end of the third quarter. His rivals, on the other hand, still have campaign coffers brimming with cash, especially Sanders who finished the reporting period with more than $33 million on hand.

All of that has led to even Biden’s former Obama administration colleagues, such as David Axelrod, acknowledging he is no longer the frontrunner."

President of the Cemetery Board, Scott Harris, called the police and told them that the flag holders, which are valued at $40 each, had been taken sometime between Friday and Monday.

“Veteran grave markers have been stolen from area cemeteries in the past. According to previous reports, about 50 grave markers were stolen from the Patton Cemetery in 2015 and about a dozen bronze markers were stolen from Rolling Prairie Cemetery in 2012,” the La Porte County Herald-Argus noted.

Each of the flag holders was unique to a veteran’s grave and was purchased by members of that veteran’s family. The holders also represented the different kinds of service, according to WSBT.

“We just want to try and get these items back for the families, because like I said, you can’t get more disrespectful than actually taking from a grave site from someone that served our country,” said Captain Bill Degnegaard of the La Porte City Police Department.

“And this is something the families like to do to honor our veterans, and we would like to get those items back for them,” he concluded.

Many of the flags that were previously in the holders are now lying on the ground.

Patton Cemetery Board Vice President and Center Township Trustee Lisa Peurzakowski said she is saddened by the recent incident.

“This is sad because these men and women went to war for us so that we could have the freedom that we have now,” she commented. “And for somebody to come and take those emblems that were there, put there by the different organizations, steal them and probably scrap them for money, we have no idea, but it’s really sad that it’s come down to where they have to start doing stuff like that.”

On Wednesday, the La Porte Police Department asked anyone with information about the flag holders to contact the department at 219-362-9446.

However, Peurzakowski said this is not the first time Patton Cemetery has had trouble keeping people off of the property at night. She also noted that someone had dumped trash there before.

“It looks like we’re going to have to work on something else. We don’t have any electricity out here, but there’s got to be a way of maybe putting cameras somehow,” she commented.

Peurzakowski also noted that the theft will be probably be discussed at an upcoming board meeting."

Critics have slammed the new group as ‘Transphobic’.

Leading supporters of Stonewall, a UK based LGBT rights organisation, have left the group, claiming that Stonewall has prioritised transgender issues over the rights of lesbian and gay people, reports The Telegraph.

The new group comprised of “influential lesbians, gay men and bisexuals”, dubbed the LGB Alliance, met earlier this week in Central London to “counteract the confusion between sex and gender which is now widespread in the public sector and elsewhere”.

Simon Fanshawe, a founding member of Stonewall, was among the speakers at the event. In a letter to The Times last month, Fanshawe highlighted how Stonewall’s policies have negatively impacted primary school children.

He wrote: “The most worrying aspect of this is that all primary-school children are now challenged to review their ‘gender identity’ and decide that they may be the opposite sex if they do not embrace outdated gender stereotypes.”

The primary victims of the transgender ideology are teens — including some who would otherwise mature into lesbian women or gay men. But there is no media focus b/c feminists & progressives want more TGs & the L&G groups are steered by transgender donors. https://t.co/bD7c8UNSZe — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) September 23, 2019

Bev Jackson, a co-founder of the Gay Liberation Front, highlighted one of the ways in which trans-politics have negatively impacted young lesbians, saying that “young lesbians, in particular, are suffering; experiencing huge social pressure to transition to male if they do not conform to traditional gender stereotypes”.

A petition with nearly 10,000 signatures detailed the ways in which they believe Stonewall is failing, claiming that:

By uncritically adopting a form of transgender politics which undermines the sex-based rights of women and the concept of homosexuality itself

By refusing to recognise the diversity of viewpoints on these issues, including among LGBT people.

By seeking to prevent public debate of these issues by branding as transphobic anyone who questions Stonewall’s current trans policies.

Critics on Twitter were quick to condemn the LGB Alliance, claiming that the group is ‘transphobic’ and that it is in league with the religious right.

One user wrote: “The #LGBAlliance is a bunch of straight, cis-gendered Christians and idiots stupid enough to fall for their shit running a psyop trying to divide trans people so they can legislate against them and pave the way for them to legislate against the three letters they claim to represent.”

Katie Porter plans to endorse Elizabeth Warren,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/24/politics/katie-porter-elizabeth-warren-endorsement/index.html,"(CNN) Democratic Rep. Katie Porter of California, a first-term lawmaker who has gained wide notice for her forceful grilling of corporate executives in congressional hearings, plans to endorse Sen. Elizabeth Warren for president, two people familiar with the decision told CNN.

Porter, who captured a historically Republican district in 2018, is one of the highest-profile members of the freshman class, and just this week she conducted a scathing interrogation of Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, on Capitol Hill.

Her expected endorsement is a coup for Warren, whose rise in the polls has not yet been matched by support from Democratic elected officials. It would also be a blow to Porter's fellow Californian, Sen. Kamala Harris, who has been counting on her home state's primary to help her mount a comeback in the race.

Spokespeople for Warren and Porter declined to comment.

Both Warren and Harris are personally close with Porter, and both senators endorsed her in a competitive primary election last year. Porter is a former student of Warren's at Harvard Law School and, like Warren, is an expert on bankruptcy law. Porter worked closely with Harris when the senator was the attorney general of California, helping oversee a major legal settlement between the state and mortgage lenders.

The president is receiving the “Bipartisan Justice Award” Friday in Columbia, South Carolina, from “the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center, a group founded by twenty black Republicans and twenty black Democrats in 2015,” the Daily Caller reported.

The award is being presented at the 2019 Second Step Presidential Justice Forum, which is being held at Benedict College, one of roughly 100 historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in the U.S. The annual distinction recognizes a public servant who works with members of the other party to achieve criminal justice reform.

The Daily Caller adds that nearly every Democratic presidential candidate is scheduled to attend the gathering at some point this weekend:

The following Democrats are set to attend the forum: Maryland Rep. John Delaney, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former HUD Secretary Julian Castro, and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard as well as Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

(Not listed was former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX), whose campaign ejected this reporter from an event at Benedict in August.)

Trump signed the First Step Act last year, providing opportunities for certain federal prisoners to reduce their sentences by committing to more intensive rehabilitation programs, including job and skills training.

Some conservatives were skeptical of the legislation, but Trump earned bipartisan praise from within the black community.

Democratic candidates have tended to ignore the new law in making pledges for new criminal justice reforms, as if unwilling to acknowledge Trump’s success.

They will have trouble avoiding it this weekend.

Democratic candidates, in order to qualify for the debate, will now need to receive 4% in at least four national or early state polls that meet the DNC's criteria or 6% in two early state polls. These polls must be released between October 16 and December 12.

Candidates will also have to have received donations from at least 200,000 unique donors, with a minimum of 800 from at least 20 different states. Like the polling threshold, candidate will have until December 12 to meet the fundraising threshold.

PBS NewsHour and Politico will co-host the debate on December 19 in Los Angeles.

These new thresholds are an increase to what candidates had to achieve before the Democratic National Committee's November debate : 3% in at least four DNC-approved polls of Democratic voters nationally (or at least 5% in two polls of the early-voting states) and donations from 165,000 separate donors -- including a minimum of 600 donors each in at least 20 states or territories.

Warren's 'Medicare for All' proposal will test her brand,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/26/politics/elizabeth-warren-medicare-for-all-plan-questions/index.html,"Her centrist primary rivals say that's a few months too late.

For now, though, the Democratic presidential field has been left to wait, and speculate, on what Warren's forthcoming plan to pay for ""Medicare for All"" will look like.

But the arrival of the most hotly anticipated policy document in recent political memory will only mark the beginning of a new chapter in the long progressive push for a federal single-payer health care system -- and this increasingly testy nominating contest.

The debate over Medicare for All, which Sen. Bernie Sanders pushed into the mainstream during his first presidential campaign, has mushroomed into a broader test during the 2020 primary. Sen. Kamala Harris , like Warren a co-sponsor of the legislation Sanders introduced in 2017 and 2019, wavered under pressure early on in the campaign and ultimately dropped her support in favor of a less ambitious -- and expensive -- plan, which she rolled out over the summer.

Warren took a different route from her Senate colleague, doubling down on the bill and famously declaring in June at the first primary debate, ""I'm with Bernie on Medicare for all."" Four months on, Warren is among the frontrunners for the party's nomination and, with the target on her back growing by the day, has come under intense scrutiny for failing to give a simple answer to a complicated question: ""How will you pay for it?""

Her campaign's formal response, which is expected to land some time before the next debate, is unlikely to spare Warren much criticism from her political rivals. The centrists, now headed up by her most vocal critic, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, are a good bet to remain focused on the increased spending required to make any major expansion work.

And the left, even if Sanders himself is unlikely to directly attack Warren, will pick through her plan for any sign of backtracking on that memorable commitment.

To date, Warren has responded to questions about middle class taxes by scrupulously avoiding the word itself, repeatedly guaranteeing only that overall ""costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down,"" while pledging not to ""not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.""

Warren has offered little insight into how her campaign is going about the process of drawing up its financing plan, and though outside economists have told reporters they are being consulted, their actual influence remains unknown.

Meanwhile, progressive lawmakers and policy wonks, some of whom have been turning this same Rubik's Cube for decades, are jockeying to shape the parameters of the next round of debate -- the one that will decide whether Warren's blueprint is viewed as mathematically sound and politically feasible.

There is an irony in Warren's conundrum.

Sanders, as he like to remind voters, ""wrote the damn bill."" But he has never offered a definitive cost estimate or locked himself into a matching ""pay-for"" plan, instead positing a menu of potential options -- like having employees pay a new 4% tax and employers a levy of 7.5%.

Think tanks across the ideological spectrum have filled the gap, meaning Warren not only has to decide on how to raise revenue for Medicare for All, but -- if she hasn't already -- choose from a range of cost estimates.

When asked about that on Monday, Warren stuck to her argument that Medicare for All represented the ""cheapest way to make sure that everyone gets covered."" When pressed on the particulars, she promised for the second time in 24 hours to deliver a plan in the coming weeks.

""The estimates on the cost of Medicare vary by trillions and trillions of dollars. And the different revenue streams for how to pay for it are many,"" Warren told reporters in Des Moines, Iowa.

By picking a lower end figure -- they range from around $14 to $34 trillion -- Warren could potentially argue that by shifting the new tax burden to employers, along with the richest corporations and individuals, she can make the numbers work without directly tapping the middle class. By most calculations, though, that might still not be enough to guarantee everything in the Sanders bill.

Whatever route Warren takes, the details her campaign publicizes are likely to live on well after the primary is over, no matter who wins the presidency in 2020. For now, though, her decision -- and how it is perceived by voters -- could affect her candidacy in conversations that run wider and deeper than the health care debate.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, right up there with or slightly ahead of Warren in most recent polling, has sought to cast Warren -- with the timing of her Medicare for All announcement as evidence -- as dissembling, unprepared, or both.

""It's mystifying that for someone who has put having a plan for everything at the center of her pitch to voters, Sen. Warren has decided to release a health care plan only after enduring immense public pressure for refusing to do so,"" a Biden campaign spokesman said late Sunday, shortly after Warren first teased the plan.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who has also launched a series of sharp salvos at Warren, struck a similar tone when she suggested, on the debate stage last week, that her colleague's refusal to deliver a plainly-worded answer to the tax question is symptomatic of some core mendacity.

""At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up,"" Klobuchar said on the debate stage. ""And I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're going to send the invoice.""

And Buttigieg, when asked at a rally in Nevada this week if taxes would go up to pay for his public option plan, which he calls ""Medicare for all who want it,"" began with yet another shot at Warren.

""Good question, because not everyone has been answering this question,"" he said, before talking about his plans to undo President Donald Trump's corporate tax cuts and pointing to the savings that would come with allowing the federal government to negotiate drug prices.

There has been, however, growing pushback in Democratic circles to the cost narrative that Warren's opponents, both in the primary and the party's policy trenches, are seeking to exploit.

Writing in USA Today earlier this week, Donald Berwick, who served as administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services during the Obama administration, sought to turn the tables on Medicare for All's most vocal critics.

""Some candidates have attempted to sidestep the cost debate by promising to spend less and accomplish the same goals,"" Berwick wrote, without naming Buttigieg, Biden or anyone else by name. ""These proposals, such as relying on a public option or expanding Medicare Advantage, offering private plans within Medicare, provide too few details to allow real cost comparisons. But it is unlikely they will do as much as Medicare for All would to reduce national health care spending or reduce costs for families.""

Still, the reality for Warren is that her rise in the polls, coupled with the always explosive politics surrounding health care, means that her next move -- and plan -- is just as likely to boost her further as undermine the brand she's spent so long building."

Susan Estrich was Michael Dukakis' campaign manager in 1988, but she was an anomaly until 2000, when Dunn and another woman, Gina Glantz, ran the Bill Bradley campaign.

Now, not so much.

Dunn, a senior adviser to former Vice President Joe Biden, appeared at Thursday's CITIZEN by CNN event in New York with four other women in senior positions for leading Democratic presidential campaigns: Nina Turner, national co-chair for Bernie Sanders' campaign; Lis Smith, senior adviser to Pete Buttigieg's campaign; Lily Adams, communications director for Kamala Harris' campaign; and Kristen Orthman, communications director for Elizabeth Warren's campaign.

It is a show of force illustrating that the days of men running campaigns to elect other men are heading to the dustbin of history.

""I mean, all of you bring credibility to the campaigns you work for. All of you are seen as these senior strategists and enormously talented people. You're not the token woman any longer. And I will tell you that there was a time when -- and I think Senator Turner [too], we were the 'women' who were at the table. And it wasn't that long ago, actually,"" Dunn explained.

These women aren't the only ones serving in top positions in Democratic presidential campaigns. Jen O'Malley Dillon is campaign manager for Beto O'Rourke and Maya Rupert holds the same title for Julián Castro. In 2016, on the Republican side, Kellyanne Conway, now senior counselor to President Donald Trump, made history as the first woman to lead a successful presidential campaign.

Working from the ground up

Smith has the unique position of trying to elect the first president who identifies as gay, Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana. She sees this campaign as different from any of the other 20 she's worked on.

""I got in on the ground floor. There wasn't this coterie of high-powered men around him, so I had the ability to really shape the campaign, and shape the direction we were going in, and shape the hiring. To me, it's very important to empower women on campaigns,"" she says.

Smith is particularly proud that 53% of the campaign is female, which she says helps ensure women are in leadership roles.

She argues that she is able to influence her boss is because he is 37 years old and didn't grow up in what she called the ""'Mad Men' generation.""

""He grew up at the same time as I did, where workplaces were changing, and where you did see women in leadership roles,"" Smith said.

Bring who you are to the table

Former Ohio state Sen. Turner started her long political career in the Buckeye State. She was elected to the Cleveland City Council in 2006 and then appointed to the Ohio state Senate in 2008, but it always struck her how differently she was treated from her male colleagues.

""I remember very clearly that my colleagues were always referred to as Senator. Senator this, and Senator that. We could be in the same room ... and I would be Nina. And for me, it is important that my first name is Senator, my last name is Turner, because you earned that title,"" she says.

""Sometimes women are not given the kind of respect that they have earned, and that they deserve,"" she adds.

Turner is now a national co-chair for Sanders' presidential campaign, and while it means a great deal to her to be in her position, she believes the work is not over for her and other women. Her message is that women should bring who they are to the table and not be afraid to do that -- a task she admits has been challenging, even for her.

""Sometimes it's hard, especially if you're an African American woman. You assert yourself, people want to call you angry, that stereotype. I want the world to know I am angry, I am mad as hell about what's going on in the world. And angry black women are taking applications, so y'all can join us and be an angry black woman, too. But angry for good,"" Turner explains.

New normals

Orthman hasn't always worked for women. She is now the communications director for Warren's presidential campaign, but she spent eight years with Majority Leader Harry Reid in his Senate office. The Nevada Democrat has told CNN that one of his proudest accomplishments in the Senate was being an early leader on making it easy for working moms to thrive in his office, which Orthman said had stuck with her.

""I thought it was the norm that a meeting would be scheduled for our foreign policy adviser at 4 so she could go pick up her kid at 5. Realizing that wasn't the norm was pretty eye-opening, particularly on Capitol Hill, which I think is not that welcoming for working moms,"" she explains.

For Orthman, working for someone who is trying to be the first female president is an honor, and with it comes new conversations that would happen only with a female boss.

""We had a week-long discussion about Elizabeth Warren's pregnancy; if I was working for Harry Reid that wouldn't have happened. But they're different people, and I think all of us that have worked for different bosses would say, male or female, you do the best to communicate who this person is, and who and what they're fighting for,"" Orthman says.

Politics up close and personal

Adams has a truly unique perspective on politics, and the pressures that come with running for office as a woman. It's likely because she saw her first campaign up close and personal at 3 years old.

Her grandmother, Ann Richards, ran for Texas governor in 1990 and won, becoming the first woman to capture the position in half a century. She famously held up a T-shirt at the state Capitol during celebrations that read: ""A woman's place is in the dome."" Adams' mother, Cecile Richards, carried on the political torch as the former president of Planned Parenthood. She says she's grateful to both of them for teaching her to be outspoken, funny, and hard-hitting.

""If I had not raised my hand, Ann Richards would have kicked my ass. So I think that I just had a benefit of being surrounded by examples of women who were not afraid to speak up and who were not afraid to shake the status quo and encourage that behavior among any of the kids that were in the family,"" she says.

Adams thinks that for women and girls of her generation, that isn't always the case.

""There's, I think, especially even women and girls of our generation were raised, many of them, not to be funny, not to speak up, not to raise your hand,"" she observes.

She has worked for her fair share of powerful women. In addition to her role now on the Harris campaign, she was Hillary Clinton's 2016 Iowa communications director. She saw firsthand how her boss was treated differently.

""There was extraordinary discussion over what she was wearing, why was she wearing that? Did that convey the right message? Was she being too angry? Was her tone exactly right?"" she explains.

Across the board, Adams still thinks women have a tougher time running for office, but she does believe it's getting better. She hopes more women on campaigns and in office will make the environment better for future generations.

""I also think more women in power, more women in Congress, more women, hopefully, in the White House will make that better. But because they're trying to make people see something that hasn't been before, there's no mold for it,"" she says.

A new world of politics in the MeToo era

Campaigns are, by definition, raw and freewheeling.

But 2020 is the first presidential election cycle since the MeToo era began, and things are changing.

""Campaigns, which used to be like the craziest startup ever, right? ... They're like running a, having a huge amount of money come in with no infrastructure, no HR, no nothing, right, and just a bunch of people running around trying to win,"" Dunn explained.

""I think that there is a much higher degree of sensitivity, and awareness,"" she added.

Smith recalls working on campaigns in 2004 and 2006 and it was not unusual to see senior male staffers going out with interns.

""I think today you wouldn't see that, and you can't do that anymore and there's no tolerance for that on the campaign,"" Smith says.

Presidential campaigns, and these women running them, have had to reconcile how exactly to change a long-standing culture in politics, and the general consensus among the five women on the stage is things are getting better.

""We have trainings. We have rules about this. ... Back then it was just, 'Hey, we're all having fun,' but now it's understood that that's not OK and that that's not how we do our campaigns. ... That culture, really, I got to say, no spin, has come to an end, at least in this campaign and the last couple of campaigns I've worked on,"" Smith says.

Consequences, Turner says, are key to making sure disrupting behaviors do not affect the campaign.

""You just can't assume that everybody comes to the space and the place with the same experiences and/or value. So you have to set the tone. And that's certainly what we have done in the Sanders campaign. And you have to make sure that there are consequences for behaviors that are not becoming of what the campaign reflects. And that's whether you are a man or a woman,"" Turner says.

When women become the majority in the workplace, Dunn points out, things will shift monumentally.

""This is a sea change that you're seeing. The expectation that those policies are going to be in place and that senior management is going to actually take them seriously. So it's not just a book on the shelf,"" Dunn points out.

No longer an old boys' club

The old boys' club of politics is changing, and while a so-called ""new girls' club"" may be growing, Turner warned that it is critical to include men in discussions about empowering women even more.

""That's what got us into the mess that we're in right now,"" Turner says.

""The country is messed up right now because the boys had been having all the fun, and now women are here to make some crooked paths straight, but not at the expense of men. We need some co-conspirators,"" she adds.

Adams gave a real-world example of how important is it to have people with different life experiences on these campaigns.

""A woman who is a part of our debate prep team had her child, gave birth, on debate two that night. And she was on calls with me all the way up until she went into that delivery room. ... And so she has a different experience, a personal experience, when we're rolling out our paid leave policy, when we're talking about, as a campaign, what kind of paid leave should we provide to people on the campaign,"" Adams says.

""So it's not just women only, it's women of color, it's young women, it's older women, it's men, it's LGBT community. So I think we just need to look at these campaigns holistically to think, are they reflecting the people that we want to actually cast the ballot for us?"" she said.

Dunn looked around at the women sitting beside her and marveled.

""There's not a one of you who couldn't get hired on your merits and not because 'We need to have a woman.' It's 'Because we need Lis Smith' or it's, 'We need Lily Adams' because she's going to give us a kind of instant credibility, talent and strategic advice that's going to make our race look like it's a real race. And that's a sea change even from eight years ago,"" Dunn said, beaming."

The 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center was founded in 2015 by 20 Democrats and 20 Republicans and gave an award to Trump for signing the First Step Act. Trump personally attended the award ceremony at the historically black Benedict College in South Carolina on Friday and delivered a lengthy speech on the issue.

“The First Step Act proved that we can achieve amazing breakthroughs when we come together as a nation and we put the interests of our citizens before the interests of any political party,” Trump said after receiving the award.

2020 presidential candidates were invited to a separate forum on the issue on Saturday.

But Harris appeared interested in making a partisan political stand in response to the event as she looks to energize her flagging presidential campaign.

“I cannot in good faith be complicit in papering over his record,” Harris said, accusing the president of “celebrating mass incarceration, pushing the death penalty for innocent Black Americans, rolling back police accountability measures and racist behavior that puts people’s lives at risk.”

The move comes as the senator has stepped up her rhetoric against Trump, amid her campaign’s slumping poll numbers. In particular, Harris has pushed a controversial proposal to ban the president from using Twitter."

Here's why America's fast food giants are so focused on chicken sandwiches.",2019-10-25,CNN,"Crispy, spicy and hugely popular: Why chicken sandwiches are taking over America",https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/25/business/mcdonalds-popeyes-chick-fil-a-chicken-sandwich/index.html,"Months after this summer's brief but brutal fried chicken sandwich battle, rivals are diligently plotting to win the longer war.

Popeyes, which sparked the latest fight with its spicy chicken sandwich in August, is scrambling to bring back the viral sensation ""as soon as possible."" Chick-fil-A is steadily growing its reach, outselling chicken chains nearly twice its size. And McDonald's franchise operators, who watched the fight from the sidelines, are pressuring their corporate boss to bring the crispy, breaded prize home.

""JFK called for a man on the moon,"" they wrote in a July letter. ""Our call should be a category leading chicken sandwich.""

Why all the hype over a fried cutlet on a bun? As visits to fast food restaurants stagnate, rivals are eyeing Chick-fil-A's runaway growth. The chain added about 1,000 locations and nearly tripled its sales over the last decade. With more than $10 billion in sales in 2018, the company has surpassed both Wendy's and Burger King to become the fifth largest fast food chain after McDonald's, Starbucks, Subway and Taco Bell.

""If you have the biggest share of a growing category, that is profits galore,"" said Michael Haracz, who until August served as McDonald's manager of culinary innovation. ""That is exponentially more sales, more buzz, more foot traffic to your restaurant.""

McDonald's, which says it is ""synonymous with burgers,"" has reason to worry: Beef consumption has fallen in the United States. Chicken is now the most popular meat by far.

There will be ""clear winners,"" Haracz said, who will dominate the space and scoop up profits — as long as they can keep up with demand.

Thirty-year food fight

Though the fight over fried chicken was especially buzzy this summer, it was part of a dynamic that dates back at least 30 years.

In 1989 McDonald's launched a national ""country-style"" McChicken sandwich and sparked a fight with Hardee's, then one of the largest fast food chains in the country. ""While McDonald`s is touting their new product, it isn't even comparable to our Chicken Fillet Sandwich, which has been on the market since 1979,"" Hardee's president said at the time, according to a 1989 report from the Charlotte Observer. The newspaper published the story with the headline, ""Chicken sandwiches incite fast food war.""

Over the ensuing decades, fast food chains have launched and relaunched new iterations of the sandwich. McDonald's has had multiple versions, including premium and limited-time offerings. Within the last year alone, it's served the Ultimate Chicken Sandwich, the Mighty Chicken Sandwich, a spicy BBQ chicken sandwich and the McChicken.

As companies experimented with chicken sandwiches, they occasionally caused a stir. In 2010, KFC made headlines with the Double Down — a limited-time-only cheese and bacon sandwich with two pieces of fried chicken where the bun should have been. (KFC briefly brought it back in 2014 .)

But even though items like the Double Down have gone viral, there may not have been anything quite like the frenzy that happened this summer, when Popeyes launched its national chicken sandwich.

It wasn't that Popeyes wasn't expecting the sandwich to be a hit. It painstakingly researched what would work with customers, and eventually landed on the right combination — a buttermilk battered and breaded white meat filet, topped with pickles and a choice of mayo or a spicy Cajun spread and served on a toasted brioche bun. Popeyes called the sandwich the ""biggest product launch in the last 30 years."" Felipe Athayde, president of the Americas at Popeyes, told the New York Times that the company had ""very aggressively forecasted"" demand , and expected to have sufficient supply through at least the end of September — about six weeks after its August 12 launch date. But stores throughout the country sold out of the sandwich within about two weeks.

Many point to a Twitter exchange as the instigator. On August 19, one week after Popeyes sandwich hit stores, Chick-fil-A's official Twitter account posted a message: ""Bun + Chicken + Pickles = all the <3 for the original."" Popeyes interpreted the message as a jab, retweeted the post and added "".... y'all good?""

The sassy response struck a nerve. It's racked up nearly 87,000 retweets and 324,000 likes, spawned memes and elicited innumerable cry-laugh emojis from social media users. Chick-fil-A didn't take the bait, but Wendy's stepped in and sparred with Popeyes on Twitter to the delight of onlookers.

It's unlikely that the brand war would have made such a huge impact if Americans weren't already interested in fried chicken sandwiches.

""There had always been fried chicken sandwiches,"" said Kara Nielsen, vice president of trends and marketing for CCD Innovation, a food and beverage consultancy. But she traces the current interest in the item to the 2008 financial crisis.

""One of the things that surged out of that recession moment was an interest in comfort food, as well as a lot of people opening food trucks, creating food stalls,"" she said. ""And so there were definitely a lot of fried chicken sandwiches coming out at that time. And it's never really stopped.""

And as fried chicken sandwiches gained local fans, a small, quirky chain was chugging steadily along.

The rise of Chick-fil-A

Chick-fil-A traces its roots back to founder S. Truett Cathy's original diner, Dwarf Grill, which opened in 1946. Cathy opened the first Chick-fil-A in 1967, in the Greenbriar Shopping Center in Atlanta.

For years, the company expanded primarily in shopping mall food courts. Then, in 1986, it opened its first standalone location in Atlanta. Today the chain operates more than 2,400 restaurants in 47 states and Washington, D.C. Other chicken chains are larger — Popeyes, for example, has more than 2,600 US restaurants and KFC has roughly 4,000. But Chick-fil-A outsells them.

Chick-fil-A's first restaurant in Atlanta's Greenbriar Mall in the late 1960s.

Ranked by annual revenue, Chick-fil-A is the fifth largest US restaurant chain after McDonald's, Starbucks, Subway and Taco Bell — all of which have far more stores.

Chick-fil-A's individual stores are more productive than any of its bigger competitors. They pulled in an average of $4.4 million in 2018, well above unit sales at McDonald's or Starbucks, according to Technomic, a company that specializes in research on the food industry.

The chain is also, according to polls and surveys, beloved.

An Axios Harris Poll published in March found that Chick-fil-A had the best reputation among US adults compared to Starbucks, Yum! Brands (which owns KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell), Chipotle, Papa John's and McDonald's. And for the past four years in a row, US teens surveyed by Piper Jaffray said Chick-fil-A was their favorite restaurant.

Customer service and food quality help explain Chick-fil-A's success. But it also has a commercially important X-factor: authenticity.

R.J. Hottovy, an analyst who covers food for Morningstar, said that in recent years, companies that have specialized in a particular product and appear more authentic tend to do better than those that try to appeal to everyone.

Chick-fil-A scores high on authenticity. It has stuck to Christian roots by keeping stores closed on Sundays, for example. But that conservative tradition has also earned backlash. In 2012 CEO Dan Cathy said he opposed gay marriage on religious grounds . That year the company was also criticized for donations made by the WinShape Foundation , which was started by founder Truett Cathy and financed largely by Chick-fil-A profits, to groups some characterized as anti-gay.

Chick-fil-A says that is has ""no political or social agenda,"" and that ""everyone is welcome in our restaurants."" Still, new stores have been met with protests . Some fans of fried chicken sandwiches may welcome an offering from a purveyor they see as more politically neutral, like Popeyes.

Nevertheless, Chick-fil-A has grown at a steady clip and picked up those devoted followers.

""There's so many people now who have an understanding or a notion of what Chick-fil-A is, even if they never eat there or if they've never seen one,"" Nielsen noted. ""It's become a bit of this mythical thing, and clearly millennials have found it, and found that it fits their bill.""

As Chick-fil-A locations pop up in more cities, more people rush to test out their sandwiches. That's helped boost fried chicken sandwich sales — and gotten other fast food chains to pay attention. ""This fried chicken trend keeps evolving because companies like Chick-fil-A expand their reach,"" Nielsen said.

While Chick-fil-A creeps across the nation, one group in particular is trying to defend its territory. McDonald's franchise operators are calling for reinforcements.

A McMission

On July 10 — a month before Popeyes launched its sandwich — the board of the National Owners Association, a group of McDonald's franchisees that formed in 2018, sent out a strongly-worded letter to its members.

""We are finding ways to drive profitable growth,"" the board wrote. ""Yet, we are still losing guest counts. This continues to be a concern.""

One reason for the loss, the board argued, is that customers craving a delicious fried chicken sandwich aren't going to McDonald's. They're going to Chick-fil-A.

""A favorite, that our customers want, is a chicken sandwich. Unfortunately, they have to go to Chick-fil-A for it,"" the board said. ""Chick-fil-A's results demonstrate the power of chicken. Yes, we have great Chicken McNuggets and our McChicken is a very good product. But we do not compete in the premium chicken sandwich category, either grilled or crispy.""

The letter continued with a warning: ""Our US Southeast markets' results should concern everyone. You may not have Chick-fil-A's in your market or to the degree they have them in the southeast, but they are coming. And they don't discount.""

McDonald's knows how to make chicken into a hit. In the early 1980s, around the time Americans first started losing interest in beef, McDonald's founder Ray Kroc wanted to add a chicken entree to the menu. The company's initial attempts, like a deep fried chicken pot pie, didn't resonate with customers. But eventually, McDonald's landed on a winner: Chicken McNuggets, which launched in 1983, were so successful that by 1985 the chain had become the second-largest chicken seller in the fast food space behind KFC.

""Chicken has been on the radar for quite a while at McDonald's,"" Haracz said. ""There's a variety of chicken sandwiches being tested.""

In the third quarter of 2019, traffic at US McDonald's restaurants was down . During an October call discussing the earnings, one analyst wondered whether McDonald's lost sales because it sat out the great chicken sandwich war.

""I think it's fair to assume with everything going on in the quarter with chicken that we would go a little bit the opposite way on chicken. So I think that's a fair conclusion,"" answered Kevin Ozan, the company's chief financial officer.

For now, McDonald's is keeping its plans close to the vest. The company declined to tell CNN Business when it expects to launch its next chicken sandwich, but noted, ""We are inspired by the customer demand for premium chicken sandwiches, and are working closely with our franchisees to deliver what our customers want. Stay tuned.""

A source close to the conversation between the owners and McDonald's leadership said a premium chicken sandwich may start rolling out as soon as this year.

But while McDonald's tinkers and focuses on other areas of the business, its franchise owners have been getting impatient.

In late August, after Popeyes' massively successful launch, Blake Casper, NOA's director, sent out another somber note.

""It was a busy week, especially if you work at Popeyes,"" he wrote. ""Popeyes came out with a chicken sandwich that rivals Chick-fil-A. It's the first time Chick-fil-A has blinked, or more accurately, was forced to blink. But make no mistake, they blinked. Wendy's got into the action and unfortunately, we're still not in the game.""

But, Casper continued, it's not over yet.

""That is going to change. We are working on a chicken sandwich that will compete. We will be in the game. People will tire of the service at Popeyes and they want an alternative to Chick-fil-A,"" he said.

""They want a chicken sandwich at McDonald's. We are going to give it to them."""

Ocasio-Cortez, who formally endorsed Sanders at a rally in Queens last weekend, took Grande’s prompt a step further, channeling the superstar’s hits to promote some of the extreme left-wing proposals of the Democrat Party’s most progressive wing.

“Progressive policies as an Ariana dance party:” Ocasio-Cortez began:

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) would lead the Democrat field if twice-failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton were to jump in the race in place of Joe Biden (D), a McLaughlin & Associates poll released this week found.

According to recent reports from both the New York Times and Washington Post, Clinton has not taken a 2020 run off the table and is, instead, keeping tabs on the growing distress among some members of the Democrat Party, who are unhappy with the current selection of candidates.

“Hillary Clinton, according to two people close to her, has not ruled out jumping in herself, a sign that she is hearing similar dissatisfaction,” the Washington Post reported.

“But put it this way: It ain’t zero. And does she think about it all the time? Absolutely,” a source said, according to the Post.

Billionaire Michael Bloomberg is reportedly conducting himself the same way, telling those close to him that he would consider jumping in the race if Biden falters.

“Bloomberg is in if Biden is out,” a “New York billionaire with ties to Bloomberg,” told CNBC.

While the Times adds that the chances of either jumping in the race are “remote,” it indicates that Democrats close to the potential candidates “believe the only scenario under which they’d consider running is if Mr. Biden drops out or is badly weakened.”

A McLaughlin & Associates October 2019 poll released this week examined that scenario, taking Biden out of the equation and putting both Clinton and Bloomberg in the race.

While Bloomberg’s presence does not appear to make a significant impact, Biden’s absence and Clinton’s addition would cause Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) to rise to the top of the national field with 23 percent support. Under the scenario, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) would maintain her top tier status with 20 percent support, followed by Clinton with ten percent support. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) would also gain a notable boost, coming right behind Clinton with nine percent support.

Andrew Yang (D) would also enjoy a bump, jumping to six percent, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) with five percent support, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with four percent support, and Beto O’Rourke (D) with three percent support. The remaining candidates would garner two percent support or less. That includes Bloomberg, who would only see one percent support:

As we all know, both CBS News and Fox News had serious internal issues regarding sexual misconduct. But we also know CBS and Fox did two crucial things NBC refuses to do: 1) They both cleaned house with high-profile firings, and 2) they both hired outside investigators to come in (Fox did this twice) to ensure the public there was oversight and full disclosure by way of an objective third-party.

The following have been credibly accused of sexual misconduct and remain employed at NBC News:

Hardball host Chris Matthews – In December of 2017, we learned that NBC paid out a staffer $40,000 regarding a 1999 harassment claim against Matthews. NBC News claims it was all part of a normal severance package and the payout less than $40,000. But thanks to Ronan Farrow’s reporting, specifically in his must-read Catch and Kill, we know this is how NBC gets rid of sexual misconduct problems: the network disguises sexual harassment payoffs as severance and the alleged victim is then required to sign an iron-clad non-disclosure agreement.

NBC News chief Andrew Lack – Farrow has two sources alleging Lack’s misconduct. Jane Wallace, a former CBS anchor who claims the then-married Lack bullied her out of her job after their affair ended; and a young associate producer named Jennifer Laird who claims Lack turned “hostile” after their affair ended.

Lack denies the allegations.

Then there is the covering up for Lack’s close pal, Matt Lauer.

Even when Lauer was fired in late 2017, NBC tried to protect him (and NBC) by spinning a credible allegation of anal rape into something as innocuous as “sexual misconduct.”

What’s more, the idea NBC did not know about Lauer’s alleged predations prior to his firing is disputed by a number of on-the-record sources who not only claim they knew about Lauer’s behavior, they complained to management about it.

Finally, there is NBC covering up for Harvey Weinstein.

In Catch and Kill, Farrow doesn’t just tell the story of how NBC killed his investigation into Weinstein’s alleged serial predations (including the alleged rape of actress Rose McGowan), Farrow names names. The book is filled with on-the-record comments, filled with Farrow recalling events where he is not afraid to name NBC executives and lawyers who were in these meetings. Using these names and sources, Farrow tells the jaw-dropping story of all the mercenary maneuvers and ridiculous excuses NBC executives contrived to not report a bombshell story that would eventually win Farrow a Pulitzer.

NBC continues to claim Farrow didn’t have the story nailed down, but this is complete bullshit. First off, NBC told Farrow to stop his investigative reporting into Weinstein! Secondly, just weeks after NBC told Farrow to take the story elsewhere, the New Yorker published the story, and Farrow won that Pulitzer.

Yes, you read that correctly: NBC said Farrow didn’t have the story only weeks before that story was published and won a Pulitzer.

And then there’s the audiotape of Weinstein admitting he groped a model; verified audio from a police sting, that NBC News president Noah Oppenheim said wasn’t a story.

But Noah Oppenheim wants to be a screenwriter, you see; and just a few months earlier Oppenheim shared a table with Weinstein at a swanky event, you see; according to Farrow, Weinstein knew about Lauer’s alleged predations, you see; which, if true, (and only a dolt believes otherwise) allowed Weinstein to blackmail NBC into kicking a Pulitzer Prize out the door.

So you have all of this… all these credible allegations of sexual abuse, of serial-cover ups, of non-disclosure agreements, of shielding alleged rapists, of protecting Weinstein; you have NBC refusing to allow a third-party investigation, and yet you still have the full Democrat field — Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, etc., validating NBC’s abuse and cover-ups by agreeing to this debate.

War on women indeed.

“Our frontline officers continue to steadfastly uphold our border security mission,” Laredo Port of Entry Port Director Albert Flores said in a written statement. “The processing and identity verification of a man with an outstanding felony warrant for child molestation helps keep our community safe and illustrates our dedication to our mission.”

Court records obtained by Breitbart Texas show that Martinez is wanted in Houston for an April 2018 allegation of sexual assault against a child under the age of six. Houston Police Department officers were unable to affect an arrest of the suspect at that time and a court issued a warrant for Martinez’s arrest.

Martinez has a previous conviction on a 2001 DWI charge. Martinez received one-year of probation for the offense which he successfully completed in December 2002."

And maybe, if one of them wins next year, they will, in fact, nick the rich a little—but don’t count on it.

After all, the last two Democrat presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, also campaigned on raising taxes on the wealthy, and yet during their time in office, the effective tax rate on top earners actually fell.

Still, the left likes to say that its goal is to “comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.” And yet maybe that’s just a campaign routine. Maybe sometimes the truth is closer to, afflict the afflicted, and comfort the comfortable.

How so? Well, one way of making the comfortable even more comfortable is by legalizing prostitution. That way, for those so inclined, the man—or woman—who has everything can have even more of everything, with no fear of the prudish police.

A case in point is Elizabeth Warren, whom the betting markets consider to be the Democrat most likely to win the 2020 nomination. On October 10, Warren tweeted some news sure to cheer rich johns—and, of course, poor- and middle-income johns, too: “I am open to decriminalizing sex work. Sex workers, like all workers, deserve autonomy and are particularly vulnerable to physical and financial abuse.”

We might translate some of this jargon-y code into simple English: “Sex work” is the politically correct way of saying prostitution, while “decriminalizing” really means legalizing, and “open to” means I’m in favor of it, but, I just can’t say so before the election.

So yes, legalizing prostitution is a part of Warren’s agenda. Indeed, at least four other Democrat presidential hopefuls—Cory Booker, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, and Bernie Sanders—have also declared their support, to some degree or another, for sex-worker “decriminalization.”

Indeed, such decriminalization is on the Democrats’ to-do list in, of all places, the nation’s capital. Here’s a Washington Post headline from October 18: “D.C. leaders hear from public over proposal to decriminalize sex work.” As the article detailed, the Washington, DC, City Council will be voting on the matter in November.

Fortunately, passage of the measure is far from assured; in fact, opponents are vocal and articulate. One opponent, Toni Van Pelt, president of the National Organization for Women, was blunt about what would happen if the bill passes: “Because this demand [for paid sex] cannot be met locally, traffickers will bring prostituted women and girls from other jurisdictions.” And so, Van Pelt continued, “D.C., the capital of our nation, would undoubtedly become a sex tourism destination.”

In the words of another opponent, Yasmin Vafa, executive director of Rights4Girls, “This bill is a sex trafficker’s dream.”

Covering the same story, the New York Times added:

All sides agree that prostitution practiced openly would reverberate well beyond the city’s thriving but shadowy sex industry of street prostitution, massage parlors, strip clubs and high-end call girls. Prostitutes would most likely work openly out of homes in neighborhoods across the city. Certain blocks could become de facto red-light districts.

In other words, D.C. wouldn’t just be the swamp, it would be the sex swamp. Yes, the reader can add any joke he or she might wish about politicians and/or lobbyists having new competition for whoredom, and yet still, it’s not amusing to think that the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial would be joined by the Hooker Hotel.

Yet we can further add a class dimension to the matter. That is, legal prostitution streamlines the process by which the rich buy—or at least rent—the bodies of the non-rich. Not every rich person is a customer, of course; plenty of fat cats are happily, and loyally, married. And yet it’s also true that the rich tend to spend more money on everything.

Let’s ask ourselves: Who has the most money to spend on prostitutes? Who can bid the highest price for flesh? So we see more clearly that the rich have the most to gain from legalizing sex work.

A case in point is Bob Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots football team.

We all remember Kraft and his brush with the vice squad; back in February, the “masseuse” who allegedly serviced him was busted on a prostitution rap. As for Kraft himself, he had better lawyers, of course, and so he wasn’t arrested. Indeed, his pricy attorneys are battling with prosecutors as of this writing; back in May, they persuaded a judge to toss out the video evidence, and so there’s no way to know how Kraft’s case will ultimately be adjudicated.

We just know this much: The optics have been horrible for Kraft. He would have been a lot happier if he could have just gone in and out, with no pesky police paying attention.

Of course, prostitution is not just for billionaires; it’s for any horndog with excess cash. And when it comes to disposable income, Democrats are way ahead. In fact, the ten richest congressional districts in the U.S. are represented by Democrats, as are 41 of the richest 50 districts. So with President Warren—or with any of the other pro-decriminalization Democrats–in the White House it seems likely that the laissez-faire approach to sex will become federal policy. And as we know, laissez-faire always works best for the rich.

Thus naughty Democrats, even non-plutocrats, would have a new category of pleasure on which to spend their money, legally.

To be sure, a pro-prostitution Department of Justice might not be able to override state and local laws (although, of course, we should never underestimate the power of liberal lawyers, working with liberal judges and the American Civil Liberties Union to think of tricky end-runs around traditional morality).

In any case, without a doubt, a Warren-ized DOJ would take some of the pressure off interstate and international and sex-trafficking. And that’s good news for Bob Kraft-types, both in America and coming from around the world.

Moreover, such a hands-off approach would be even better news for the next Jeffrey Epstein. We can recall that the late (we presume) Epstein had an international racket going, bringing in women and girls from Eastern Europe, and sending them on the “Lolita Express”—to the Caribbean, New Mexico, even Thailand—for pimpy purposes.

So while Warren and the other Democrats have said nothing about changing age-of-consent laws—sex with minors being the peculiar predilection of Epstein and, apparently, of other of his rich associates—it’s obvious that if prosecutors have fewer points of leverage on the sex trade, then Epstein-type abuses are more likely to emerge.

Thus we can see: Legalizing prostitution would be a great comfort to many among the comfortable.

Yet at the same time, Warren’s plan would further afflict the afflicted. Few, if any, women truly want to be prostitutes, and yet if the global magnet of money—complete with marketing and hyping—is turned on and allowed to operate at full power, well, a lot of women, and girls, will be pulled, and pushed, into prostitution. We can observe: This is not liberation, it’s degradation. It’s not empowerment, it’s a kind of slavery—indeed, it used to be called white slavery.

But wait—there’s more! More, that is, to the Democrats’ plan to comfort the comfortable. You see, not only does Warren want to decriminalize prostitution, she also wants to decriminalize crossing the U.S. border. In other words, every trans-national pimp and procurer will have an easier time bringing nubile bodies across the border—no nosy border guards asking questions and getting in the way.

Fittingly, on October 8, Breitbart News’s John Binder analyzed Warren’s overall immigration plan, dubbing it a “donor class immigration plan.” Notably, Warren’s plan doesn’t include mandatory E-Verify for employers and employees, and so once again, it will be all the easier for sex workers to work—having come from anywhere in the world, regardless of their legal status.

To sum up, Warren offers a trifecta for comforting the comfortable: First, legalize sex work; second, legalize anyone crossing the border; and third, do little if anything about hiring non-citizens.

So yes, if she wins, Warren may raise rich people’s taxes. And yet for the randier of the rich, it’s a sweet tradeoff; they’ll pay more in taxes, but her policy platform offers them a happy ending."

Biden, who has fallen behind rivals like Sens. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in both fundraising and polling, was asked by CBS News’s Norah O’Donnell if he still considered himself the candidate to beat in the field of 2020 Democrats.

“I know I’m the frontrunner. Find me a national poll with a notable – a couple exceptions. The last four that have come out – but look, this is a marathon,” Biden responded. “This is a marathon.”

The former vice president maintained the claim even after pushback by O’Donnell, who noted both Warren and Sanders have significantly more money in their campaign coffers.

“I just flat beat them,” Biden said, before adding, “We’re on a course to do extremely well. I’m not worried about being able to fund this campaign. I really am not, truly.”

Contrary to the former vice president’s assertion, most media outlets on both the left and right have deemed him to no longer be the frontrunner. In particular, outlets like Politico and The Washington Post have pointed to polls showing Biden well behind his rivals in the early caucus and primary states.

Since starting this campaign in late-April, Biden has dropped from leading by as much as double digits in states like Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada. A poll released from Iowa this week showed the former vice president in fourth place, trailing not only Sanders and Warren, but also South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

A similar situation has played out nationally, although to less of a degree. In the weeks after Biden first announced his campaign, he led the field by as much as 32 percentage points. In comparison, a Quinnipiac Poll from this week found the former vice president trailing Warren, 21 percent to 28 percent, respectively. A similar Quinnipiac Poll taken just before the most recent Democrat presidential primary, which most pundits agreed was not Biden’s best performance, had seen Warren leading the former vice president more narrowly, 30 percent to 27 percent.

Other national polls from around the same time, found Biden similarly displaced as the frontrunner:

Biden’s squandered lead in the polls has coincided with a drop-off in fundraising. Even though Biden started the race with a strong funding advantage, due to his connections with high-dollar donors, the former vice president ended the most recent fundraising quarter well behind his competitors. In between July and the end of September, Biden only raised $15.2 million. The sum was dwarfed by that raised by Sanders ($25.3 million), Buttigieg ($19.1 million), and Warren ($24.6 million).

Posing more of a problem for the former vice president, however, is that his campaign has spent heavily since announcing in late-April, depleting his total cash on hand to just $9 million at the end of the third quarter. His rivals, on the other hand, still have campaign coffers brimming with cash, especially Sanders who finished the reporting period with more than $33 million on hand.

All of that has led to even Biden’s former Obama administration colleagues, such as David Axelrod, acknowledging he is no longer the frontrunner."

President of the Cemetery Board, Scott Harris, called the police and told them that the flag holders, which are valued at $40 each, had been taken sometime between Friday and Monday.

“Veteran grave markers have been stolen from area cemeteries in the past. According to previous reports, about 50 grave markers were stolen from the Patton Cemetery in 2015 and about a dozen bronze markers were stolen from Rolling Prairie Cemetery in 2012,” the La Porte County Herald-Argus noted.

Each of the flag holders was unique to a veteran’s grave and was purchased by members of that veteran’s family. The holders also represented the different kinds of service, according to WSBT.

“We just want to try and get these items back for the families, because like I said, you can’t get more disrespectful than actually taking from a grave site from someone that served our country,” said Captain Bill Degnegaard of the La Porte City Police Department.

“And this is something the families like to do to honor our veterans, and we would like to get those items back for them,” he concluded.

Many of the flags that were previously in the holders are now lying on the ground.

Patton Cemetery Board Vice President and Center Township Trustee Lisa Peurzakowski said she is saddened by the recent incident.

“This is sad because these men and women went to war for us so that we could have the freedom that we have now,” she commented. “And for somebody to come and take those emblems that were there, put there by the different organizations, steal them and probably scrap them for money, we have no idea, but it’s really sad that it’s come down to where they have to start doing stuff like that.”

On Wednesday, the La Porte Police Department asked anyone with information about the flag holders to contact the department at 219-362-9446.

However, Peurzakowski said this is not the first time Patton Cemetery has had trouble keeping people off of the property at night. She also noted that someone had dumped trash there before.

“It looks like we’re going to have to work on something else. We don’t have any electricity out here, but there’s got to be a way of maybe putting cameras somehow,” she commented.

Peurzakowski also noted that the theft will be probably be discussed at an upcoming board meeting."

Walker is featured on the Des Moines Register’s “50 Most Wanted Democrats” list, which describes him as a “dynamic and charismatic speaker” who is continuing to “gain prominence on the Linn County Board of Supervisors”:

A Cedar Rapids native, Walker is active in the local community and Iowa politics. National Democrats like California U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander and Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, a possible 2020 candidate, campaigned with him in 2018.

While Walker said there are many qualified candidates in the race, Sanders is by far “the most progressive and best positioned to defeat Donald Trump in the general election.”

Walker added that Sanders “goes to the furthest” in terms of his sweeping progressive plans and added that the Vermont senator has been “talking about these issues for decades.”

He told the local CBS station:

When you add on top of the fact that he has brought together one of the most diverse coalition of supporters I think any presidential campaign has ever seen, what that means is we actually have a shot at achieving this ambitious policy program, because we’re going to have folks mobilize to put pressure on members of Congress to make sure we can pass this legislation.

Walker also told Politico that he is backing Sanders because the country needs someone with a “bold” vision in order to “course-correct from the disaster that Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have become.”

“That is what America needs to course-correct from the disaster that Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have become,” he said.

“We need a leader with a bold vision, and as a black man living in America, I’ve had enough of politicians telling me we have to scale back our dreams and ambitions,” he added.

Sanders is currently battling for the heart of Iowa, edging out Joe Biden (D) but falling behind Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) in the latest Civiqs survey released this week.

Leading supporters of Stonewall, a UK based LGBT rights organisation, have left the group, claiming that Stonewall has prioritised transgender issues over the rights of lesbian and gay people, reports The Telegraph.

The new group comprised of “influential lesbians, gay men and bisexuals”, dubbed the LGB Alliance, met earlier this week in Central London to “counteract the confusion between sex and gender which is now widespread in the public sector and elsewhere”.

Simon Fanshawe, a founding member of Stonewall, was among the speakers at the event. In a letter to The Times last month, Fanshawe highlighted how Stonewall’s policies have negatively impacted primary school children.

He wrote: “The most worrying aspect of this is that all primary-school children are now challenged to review their ‘gender identity’ and decide that they may be the opposite sex if they do not embrace outdated gender stereotypes.”

Bev Jackson, a co-founder of the Gay Liberation Front, highlighted one of the ways in which trans-politics have negatively impacted young lesbians, saying that “young lesbians, in particular, are suffering; experiencing huge social pressure to transition to male if they do not conform to traditional gender stereotypes”.

A petition with nearly 10,000 signatures detailed the ways in which they believe Stonewall is failing, claiming that:

By uncritically adopting a form of transgender politics which undermines the sex-based rights of women and the concept of homosexuality itself

By refusing to recognise the diversity of viewpoints on these issues, including among LGBT people.

By seeking to prevent public debate of these issues by branding as transphobic anyone who questions Stonewall’s current trans policies.

Critics on Twitter were quick to condemn the LGB Alliance, claiming that the group is ‘transphobic’ and that it is in league with the religious right.

One user wrote: “The #LGBAlliance is a bunch of straight, cis-gendered Christians and idiots stupid enough to fall for their shit running a psyop trying to divide trans people so they can legislate against them and pave the way for them to legislate against the three letters they claim to represent.”

In a statement, former Vice President Joe Biden congratulated ""our special forces, our intelligence community, and all our brave military professionals on delivering justice"" to Baghdadi. Author Marianne Williamson offered in a tweet ""Praise and thanks for the military bravery and brilliance that carried out the mission,"" and former Maryland Rep. John Delaney wrote on Twitter that he's ""grateful for the brave patriots who risked their lives to advance our safety and security.""

With Trump and Republicans likely to characterize the mission as a defining moment of his presidency ahead of next year's election, the lack of attention placed on his role in the operation could provide insight into how the field of candidates plan to discuss the news in the coming weeks and months.

Trump announced at the White House earlier Sunday that Baghdadi killed himself on Saturday during a US special operations forces mission that went after the ISIS leader. The President told reporters Baghdadi was under surveillance for a couple of weeks and that two to three planned missions were scrapped before the successful one was launched. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Sunday that Trump approved the raid ""late last week"" after being presented with different options.

In a Sunday tweet, entrepreneur Andrew Yang congratulated ""the special ops team that executed the mission and everyone in the chain of command,"" though there was no mention of Trump, who as commander-in-chief is at the top of the Pentagon's chain of command. Similarly, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, told CNN that ""everybody involved deserves credit, but those who were at the tip of the spear deserve the most credit."" Buttigieg also did not refer to Trump's involvement.

Warren's 'Medicare for All' proposal will test her brand,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/26/politics/elizabeth-warren-medicare-for-all-plan-questions/index.html,"Her centrist primary rivals say that's a few months too late.

For now, though, the Democratic presidential field has been left to wait, and speculate, on what Warren's forthcoming plan to pay for ""Medicare for All"" will look like.

But the arrival of the most hotly anticipated policy document in recent political memory will only mark the beginning of a new chapter in the long progressive push for a federal single-payer health care system -- and this increasingly testy nominating contest.

The debate over Medicare for All, which Sen. Bernie Sanders pushed into the mainstream during his first presidential campaign, has mushroomed into a broader test during the 2020 primary. Sen. Kamala Harris , like Warren a co-sponsor of the legislation Sanders introduced in 2017 and 2019, wavered under pressure early on in the campaign and ultimately dropped her support in favor of a less ambitious -- and expensive -- plan, which she rolled out over the summer.

Warren took a different route from her Senate colleague, doubling down on the bill and famously declaring in June at the first primary debate, ""I'm with Bernie on Medicare for all."" Four months on, Warren is among the frontrunners for the party's nomination and, with the target on her back growing by the day, has come under intense scrutiny for failing to give a simple answer to a complicated question: ""How will you pay for it?""

Her campaign's formal response, which is expected to land some time before the next debate, is unlikely to spare Warren much criticism from her political rivals. The centrists, now headed up by her most vocal critic, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, are a good bet to remain focused on the increased spending required to make any major expansion work.

And the left, even if Sanders himself is unlikely to directly attack Warren, will pick through her plan for any sign of backtracking on that memorable commitment.

To date, Warren has responded to questions about middle class taxes by scrupulously avoiding the word itself, repeatedly guaranteeing only that overall ""costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down,"" while pledging not to ""not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.""

Warren has offered little insight into how her campaign is going about the process of drawing up its financing plan, and though outside economists have told reporters they are being consulted, their actual influence remains unknown.

Meanwhile, progressive lawmakers and policy wonks, some of whom have been turning this same Rubik's Cube for decades, are jockeying to shape the parameters of the next round of debate -- the one that will decide whether Warren's blueprint is viewed as mathematically sound and politically feasible.

There is an irony in Warren's conundrum.

Sanders, as he like to remind voters, ""wrote the damn bill."" But he has never offered a definitive cost estimate or locked himself into a matching ""pay-for"" plan, instead positing a menu of potential options -- like having employees pay a new 4% tax and employers a levy of 7.5%.

Think tanks across the ideological spectrum have filled the gap, meaning Warren not only has to decide on how to raise revenue for Medicare for All, but -- if she hasn't already -- choose from a range of cost estimates.

When asked about that on Monday, Warren stuck to her argument that Medicare for All represented the ""cheapest way to make sure that everyone gets covered."" When pressed on the particulars, she promised for the second time in 24 hours to deliver a plan in the coming weeks.

""The estimates on the cost of Medicare vary by trillions and trillions of dollars. And the different revenue streams for how to pay for it are many,"" Warren told reporters in Des Moines, Iowa.

By picking a lower end figure -- they range from around $14 to $34 trillion -- Warren could potentially argue that by shifting the new tax burden to employers, along with the richest corporations and individuals, she can make the numbers work without directly tapping the middle class. By most calculations, though, that might still not be enough to guarantee everything in the Sanders bill.

Whatever route Warren takes, the details her campaign publicizes are likely to live on well after the primary is over, no matter who wins the presidency in 2020. For now, though, her decision -- and how it is perceived by voters -- could affect her candidacy in conversations that run wider and deeper than the health care debate.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, right up there with or slightly ahead of Warren in most recent polling, has sought to cast Warren -- with the timing of her Medicare for All announcement as evidence -- as dissembling, unprepared, or both.

""It's mystifying that for someone who has put having a plan for everything at the center of her pitch to voters, Sen. Warren has decided to release a health care plan only after enduring immense public pressure for refusing to do so,"" a Biden campaign spokesman said late Sunday, shortly after Warren first teased the plan.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who has also launched a series of sharp salvos at Warren, struck a similar tone when she suggested, on the debate stage last week, that her colleague's refusal to deliver a plainly-worded answer to the tax question is symptomatic of some core mendacity.

""At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up,"" Klobuchar said on the debate stage. ""And I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're going to send the invoice.""

And Buttigieg, when asked at a rally in Nevada this week if taxes would go up to pay for his public option plan, which he calls ""Medicare for all who want it,"" began with yet another shot at Warren.

""Good question, because not everyone has been answering this question,"" he said, before talking about his plans to undo President Donald Trump's corporate tax cuts and pointing to the savings that would come with allowing the federal government to negotiate drug prices.

There has been, however, growing pushback in Democratic circles to the cost narrative that Warren's opponents, both in the primary and the party's policy trenches, are seeking to exploit.

Writing in USA Today earlier this week, Donald Berwick, who served as administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services during the Obama administration, sought to turn the tables on Medicare for All's most vocal critics.

""Some candidates have attempted to sidestep the cost debate by promising to spend less and accomplish the same goals,"" Berwick wrote, without naming Buttigieg, Biden or anyone else by name. ""These proposals, such as relying on a public option or expanding Medicare Advantage, offering private plans within Medicare, provide too few details to allow real cost comparisons. But it is unlikely they will do as much as Medicare for All would to reduce national health care spending or reduce costs for families.""

Still, the reality for Warren is that her rise in the polls, coupled with the always explosive politics surrounding health care, means that her next move -- and plan -- is just as likely to boost her further as undermine the brand she's spent so long building."

Susan Estrich was Michael Dukakis' campaign manager in 1988, but she was an anomaly until 2000, when Dunn and another woman, Gina Glantz, ran the Bill Bradley campaign.

Now, not so much.

Dunn, a senior adviser to former Vice President Joe Biden, appeared at Thursday's CITIZEN by CNN event in New York with four other women in senior positions for leading Democratic presidential campaigns: Nina Turner, national co-chair for Bernie Sanders' campaign; Lis Smith, senior adviser to Pete Buttigieg's campaign; Lily Adams, communications director for Kamala Harris' campaign; and Kristen Orthman, communications director for Elizabeth Warren's campaign.

It is a show of force illustrating that the days of men running campaigns to elect other men are heading to the dustbin of history.

""I mean, all of you bring credibility to the campaigns you work for. All of you are seen as these senior strategists and enormously talented people. You're not the token woman any longer. And I will tell you that there was a time when -- and I think Senator Turner [too], we were the 'women' who were at the table. And it wasn't that long ago, actually,"" Dunn explained.

These women aren't the only ones serving in top positions in Democratic presidential campaigns. Jen O'Malley Dillon is campaign manager for Beto O'Rourke and Maya Rupert holds the same title for Julián Castro. In 2016, on the Republican side, Kellyanne Conway, now senior counselor to President Donald Trump, made history as the first woman to lead a successful presidential campaign.

Working from the ground up

Smith has the unique position of trying to elect the first president who identifies as gay, Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana. She sees this campaign as different from any of the other 20 she's worked on.

""I got in on the ground floor. There wasn't this coterie of high-powered men around him, so I had the ability to really shape the campaign, and shape the direction we were going in, and shape the hiring. To me, it's very important to empower women on campaigns,"" she says.

Smith is particularly proud that 53% of the campaign is female, which she says helps ensure women are in leadership roles.

She argues that she is able to influence her boss is because he is 37 years old and didn't grow up in what she called the ""'Mad Men' generation.""

""He grew up at the same time as I did, where workplaces were changing, and where you did see women in leadership roles,"" Smith said.

Bring who you are to the table

Former Ohio state Sen. Turner started her long political career in the Buckeye State. She was elected to the Cleveland City Council in 2006 and then appointed to the Ohio state Senate in 2008, but it always struck her how differently she was treated from her male colleagues.

""I remember very clearly that my colleagues were always referred to as Senator. Senator this, and Senator that. We could be in the same room ... and I would be Nina. And for me, it is important that my first name is Senator, my last name is Turner, because you earned that title,"" she says.

""Sometimes women are not given the kind of respect that they have earned, and that they deserve,"" she adds.

Turner is now a national co-chair for Sanders' presidential campaign, and while it means a great deal to her to be in her position, she believes the work is not over for her and other women. Her message is that women should bring who they are to the table and not be afraid to do that -- a task she admits has been challenging, even for her.

""Sometimes it's hard, especially if you're an African American woman. You assert yourself, people want to call you angry, that stereotype. I want the world to know I am angry, I am mad as hell about what's going on in the world. And angry black women are taking applications, so y'all can join us and be an angry black woman, too. But angry for good,"" Turner explains.

New normals

Orthman hasn't always worked for women. She is now the communications director for Warren's presidential campaign, but she spent eight years with Majority Leader Harry Reid in his Senate office. The Nevada Democrat has told CNN that one of his proudest accomplishments in the Senate was being an early leader on making it easy for working moms to thrive in his office, which Orthman said had stuck with her.

""I thought it was the norm that a meeting would be scheduled for our foreign policy adviser at 4 so she could go pick up her kid at 5. Realizing that wasn't the norm was pretty eye-opening, particularly on Capitol Hill, which I think is not that welcoming for working moms,"" she explains.

For Orthman, working for someone who is trying to be the first female president is an honor, and with it comes new conversations that would happen only with a female boss.

""We had a week-long discussion about Elizabeth Warren's pregnancy; if I was working for Harry Reid that wouldn't have happened. But they're different people, and I think all of us that have worked for different bosses would say, male or female, you do the best to communicate who this person is, and who and what they're fighting for,"" Orthman says.

Politics up close and personal

Adams has a truly unique perspective on politics, and the pressures that come with running for office as a woman. It's likely because she saw her first campaign up close and personal at 3 years old.

Her grandmother, Ann Richards, ran for Texas governor in 1990 and won, becoming the first woman to capture the position in half a century. She famously held up a T-shirt at the state Capitol during celebrations that read: ""A woman's place is in the dome."" Adams' mother, Cecile Richards, carried on the political torch as the former president of Planned Parenthood. She says she's grateful to both of them for teaching her to be outspoken, funny, and hard-hitting.

""If I had not raised my hand, Ann Richards would have kicked my ass. So I think that I just had a benefit of being surrounded by examples of women who were not afraid to speak up and who were not afraid to shake the status quo and encourage that behavior among any of the kids that were in the family,"" she says.

Adams thinks that for women and girls of her generation, that isn't always the case.

""There's, I think, especially even women and girls of our generation were raised, many of them, not to be funny, not to speak up, not to raise your hand,"" she observes.

She has worked for her fair share of powerful women. In addition to her role now on the Harris campaign, she was Hillary Clinton's 2016 Iowa communications director. She saw firsthand how her boss was treated differently.

""There was extraordinary discussion over what she was wearing, why was she wearing that? Did that convey the right message? Was she being too angry? Was her tone exactly right?"" she explains.

Across the board, Adams still thinks women have a tougher time running for office, but she does believe it's getting better. She hopes more women on campaigns and in office will make the environment better for future generations.

""I also think more women in power, more women in Congress, more women, hopefully, in the White House will make that better. But because they're trying to make people see something that hasn't been before, there's no mold for it,"" she says.

A new world of politics in the MeToo era

Campaigns are, by definition, raw and freewheeling.

But 2020 is the first presidential election cycle since the MeToo era began, and things are changing.

""Campaigns, which used to be like the craziest startup ever, right? ... They're like running a, having a huge amount of money come in with no infrastructure, no HR, no nothing, right, and just a bunch of people running around trying to win,"" Dunn explained.

""I think that there is a much higher degree of sensitivity, and awareness,"" she added.

Smith recalls working on campaigns in 2004 and 2006 and it was not unusual to see senior male staffers going out with interns.

""I think today you wouldn't see that, and you can't do that anymore and there's no tolerance for that on the campaign,"" Smith says.

Presidential campaigns, and these women running them, have had to reconcile how exactly to change a long-standing culture in politics, and the general consensus among the five women on the stage is things are getting better.

""We have trainings. We have rules about this. ... Back then it was just, 'Hey, we're all having fun,' but now it's understood that that's not OK and that that's not how we do our campaigns. ... That culture, really, I got to say, no spin, has come to an end, at least in this campaign and the last couple of campaigns I've worked on,"" Smith says.

Consequences, Turner says, are key to making sure disrupting behaviors do not affect the campaign.

""You just can't assume that everybody comes to the space and the place with the same experiences and/or value. So you have to set the tone. And that's certainly what we have done in the Sanders campaign. And you have to make sure that there are consequences for behaviors that are not becoming of what the campaign reflects. And that's whether you are a man or a woman,"" Turner says.

When women become the majority in the workplace, Dunn points out, things will shift monumentally.

""This is a sea change that you're seeing. The expectation that those policies are going to be in place and that senior management is going to actually take them seriously. So it's not just a book on the shelf,"" Dunn points out.

No longer an old boys' club

The old boys' club of politics is changing, and while a so-called ""new girls' club"" may be growing, Turner warned that it is critical to include men in discussions about empowering women even more.

""That's what got us into the mess that we're in right now,"" Turner says.

""The country is messed up right now because the boys had been having all the fun, and now women are here to make some crooked paths straight, but not at the expense of men. We need some co-conspirators,"" she adds.

Adams gave a real-world example of how important is it to have people with different life experiences on these campaigns.

""A woman who is a part of our debate prep team had her child, gave birth, on debate two that night. And she was on calls with me all the way up until she went into that delivery room. ... And so she has a different experience, a personal experience, when we're rolling out our paid leave policy, when we're talking about, as a campaign, what kind of paid leave should we provide to people on the campaign,"" Adams says.

""So it's not just women only, it's women of color, it's young women, it's older women, it's men, it's LGBT community. So I think we just need to look at these campaigns holistically to think, are they reflecting the people that we want to actually cast the ballot for us?"" she said.

Dunn looked around at the women sitting beside her and marveled.

""There's not a one of you who couldn't get hired on your merits and not because 'We need to have a woman.' It's 'Because we need Lis Smith' or it's, 'We need Lily Adams' because she's going to give us a kind of instant credibility, talent and strategic advice that's going to make our race look like it's a real race. And that's a sea change even from eight years ago,"" Dunn said, beaming."

This and best unemployment numbers EVER is more than Kamala will EVER be able to do for African Americans!

The 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center was founded in 2015 by 20 Democrats and 20 Republicans and gave an award to Trump for signing the First Step Act. Trump personally attended the award ceremony at the historically black Benedict College in South Carolina on Friday and delivered a lengthy speech on the issue.

“The First Step Act proved that we can achieve amazing breakthroughs when we come together as a nation and we put the interests of our citizens before the interests of any political party,” Trump said after receiving the award.

2020 presidential candidates were invited to a separate forum on the issue on Saturday.

But Harris appeared interested in making a partisan political stand in response to the event as she looks to energize her flagging presidential campaign.

“I cannot in good faith be complicit in papering over his record,” Harris said, accusing the president of “celebrating mass incarceration, pushing the death penalty for innocent Black Americans, rolling back police accountability measures and racist behavior that puts people’s lives at risk.”

Trump on Friday delivered a speech at the Second Step Presidential Justice forum at Benedict College and suggested that the ongoing impeachment probe, which Democrats have largely shrouded with secrecy, has given him a deeper sense of the justice system.

“You know I have my own experience, you know that,” Trump said. “You see what’s going on with the witch hunt. It’s a terrible thing that’s going on in our country — no crimes — it’s an investigation in search of a crime.”

Omar, a far-left lawmaker who supports the impeachment inquiry, proclaimed that Trump is finally “being held accountable.”

“The criminal justice system is designed to unjustly incarcerate black and brown people — and give people like you a pass. For once in your life, you’re being held accountable,” she wrote:

However, Democrats have failed to pinpoint a legitimate impeachable offense and have not taken the inquiry to a full House vote.

Omar’s remark comes days after fellow “Squad” member Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) warned that impeachment due process would essentially “help potential criminals line up their testimony.”

“Hey @AOC I thought you supported Open and Transparent government,” Rep. Alex Mooney (R-WV) wrote in response to Ocasio-Cortez dismissing the GOP lawmakers’ attempts to demand transparency by confronting House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) in his secret impeachment chamber. She called the attempt a “little flash mob.”

“Truth is for @AOC the ends justify the means and she gladly reverts to Soviet style secret hearings in the Capitol basement,” he added.

As we all know, both CBS News and Fox News had serious internal issues regarding sexual misconduct. But we also know CBS and Fox did two crucial things NBC refuses to do: 1) They both cleaned house with high-profile firings, and 2) they both hired outside investigators to come in (Fox did this twice) to ensure the public there was oversight and full disclosure by way of an objective third-party.

The following have been credibly accused of sexual misconduct and remain employed at NBC News:

Hardball host Chris Matthews – In December of 2017, we learned that NBC paid out a staffer $40,000 regarding a 1999 harassment claim against Matthews. NBC News claims it was all part of a normal severance package and the payout less than $40,000. But thanks to Ronan Farrow’s reporting, specifically in his must-read Catch and Kill, we know this is how NBC gets rid of sexual misconduct problems: the network disguises sexual harassment payoffs as severance and the alleged victim is then required to sign an iron-clad non-disclosure agreement.

NBC News chief Andrew Lack – Farrow has two sources alleging Lack’s misconduct. Jane Wallace, a former CBS anchor who claims the then-married Lack bullied her out of her job after their affair ended; and a young associate producer named Jennifer Laird who claims Lack turned “hostile” after their affair ended.

Lack denies the allegations.

Then there is the covering up for Lack’s close pal, Matt Lauer.

Even when Lauer was fired in late 2017, NBC tried to protect him (and NBC) by spinning a credible allegation of anal rape into something as innocuous as “sexual misconduct.”

What’s more, the idea NBC did not know about Lauer’s alleged predations prior to his firing is disputed by a number of on-the-record sources who not only claim they knew about Lauer’s behavior, they complained to management about it.

Finally, there is NBC covering up for Harvey Weinstein.

In Catch and Kill, Farrow doesn’t just tell the story of how NBC killed his investigation into Weinstein’s alleged serial predations (including the alleged rape of actress Rose McGowan), Farrow names names. The book is filled with on-the-record comments, filled with Farrow recalling events where he is not afraid to name NBC executives and lawyers who were in these meetings. Using these names and sources, Farrow tells the jaw-dropping story of all the mercenary maneuvers and ridiculous excuses NBC executives contrived to not report a bombshell story that would eventually win Farrow a Pulitzer.

NBC continues to claim Farrow didn’t have the story nailed down, but this is complete bullshit. First off, NBC told Farrow to stop his investigative reporting into Weinstein! Secondly, just weeks after NBC told Farrow to take the story elsewhere, the New Yorker published the story, and Farrow won that Pulitzer.

Yes, you read that correctly: NBC said Farrow didn’t have the story only weeks before that story was published and won a Pulitzer.

And then there’s the audiotape of Weinstein admitting he groped a model; verified audio from a police sting, that NBC News president Noah Oppenheim said wasn’t a story.

But Noah Oppenheim wants to be a screenwriter, you see; and just a few months earlier Oppenheim shared a table with Weinstein at a swanky event, you see; according to Farrow, Weinstein knew about Lauer’s alleged predations, you see; which, if true, (and only a dolt believes otherwise) allowed Weinstein to blackmail NBC into kicking a Pulitzer Prize out the door.

So you have all of this… all these credible allegations of sexual abuse, of serial-cover ups, of non-disclosure agreements, of shielding alleged rapists, of protecting Weinstein; you have NBC refusing to allow a third-party investigation, and yet you still have the full Democrat field — Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, etc., validating NBC’s abuse and cover-ups by agreeing to this debate.

War on women indeed.

And maybe, if one of them wins next year, they will, in fact, nick the rich a little—but don’t count on it.

After all, the last two Democrat presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, also campaigned on raising taxes on the wealthy, and yet during their time in office, the effective tax rate on top earners actually fell.

Still, the left likes to say that its goal is to “comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.” And yet maybe that’s just a campaign routine. Maybe sometimes the truth is closer to, afflict the afflicted, and comfort the comfortable.

How so? Well, one way of making the comfortable even more comfortable is by legalizing prostitution. That way, for those so inclined, the man—or woman—who has everything can have even more of everything, with no fear of the prudish police.

A case in point is Elizabeth Warren, whom the betting markets consider to be the Democrat most likely to win the 2020 nomination. On October 10, Warren tweeted some news sure to cheer rich johns—and, of course, poor- and middle-income johns, too: “I am open to decriminalizing sex work. Sex workers, like all workers, deserve autonomy and are particularly vulnerable to physical and financial abuse.”

We might translate some of this jargon-y code into simple English: “Sex work” is the politically correct way of saying prostitution, while “decriminalizing” really means legalizing, and “open to” means I’m in favor of it, but, I just can’t say so before the election.

So yes, legalizing prostitution is a part of Warren’s agenda. Indeed, at least four other Democrat presidential hopefuls—Cory Booker, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, and Bernie Sanders—have also declared their support, to some degree or another, for sex-worker “decriminalization.”

Indeed, such decriminalization is on the Democrats’ to-do list in, of all places, the nation’s capital. Here’s a Washington Post headline from October 18: “D.C. leaders hear from public over proposal to decriminalize sex work.” As the article detailed, the Washington, DC, City Council will be voting on the matter in November.

Fortunately, passage of the measure is far from assured; in fact, opponents are vocal and articulate. One opponent, Toni Van Pelt, president of the National Organization for Women, was blunt about what would happen if the bill passes: “Because this demand [for paid sex] cannot be met locally, traffickers will bring prostituted women and girls from other jurisdictions.” And so, Van Pelt continued, “D.C., the capital of our nation, would undoubtedly become a sex tourism destination.”

In the words of another opponent, Yasmin Vafa, executive director of Rights4Girls, “This bill is a sex trafficker’s dream.”

Covering the same story, the New York Times added:

All sides agree that prostitution practiced openly would reverberate well beyond the city’s thriving but shadowy sex industry of street prostitution, massage parlors, strip clubs and high-end call girls. Prostitutes would most likely work openly out of homes in neighborhoods across the city. Certain blocks could become de facto red-light districts.

In other words, D.C. wouldn’t just be the swamp, it would be the sex swamp. Yes, the reader can add any joke he or she might wish about politicians and/or lobbyists having new competition for whoredom, and yet still, it’s not amusing to think that the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial would be joined by the Hooker Hotel.

Yet we can further add a class dimension to the matter. That is, legal prostitution streamlines the process by which the rich buy—or at least rent—the bodies of the non-rich. Not every rich person is a customer, of course; plenty of fat cats are happily, and loyally, married. And yet it’s also true that the rich tend to spend more money on everything.

Let’s ask ourselves: Who has the most money to spend on prostitutes? Who can bid the highest price for flesh? So we see more clearly that the rich have the most to gain from legalizing sex work.

A case in point is Bob Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots football team.

We all remember Kraft and his brush with the vice squad; back in February, the “masseuse” who allegedly serviced him was busted on a prostitution rap. As for Kraft himself, he had better lawyers, of course, and so he wasn’t arrested. Indeed, his pricy attorneys are battling with prosecutors as of this writing; back in May, they persuaded a judge to toss out the video evidence, and so there’s no way to know how Kraft’s case will ultimately be adjudicated.

We just know this much: The optics have been horrible for Kraft. He would have been a lot happier if he could have just gone in and out, with no pesky police paying attention.

Of course, prostitution is not just for billionaires; it’s for any horndog with excess cash. And when it comes to disposable income, Democrats are way ahead. In fact, the ten richest congressional districts in the U.S. are represented by Democrats, as are 41 of the richest 50 districts. So with President Warren—or with any of the other pro-decriminalization Democrats–in the White House it seems likely that the laissez-faire approach to sex will become federal policy. And as we know, laissez-faire always works best for the rich.

Thus naughty Democrats, even non-plutocrats, would have a new category of pleasure on which to spend their money, legally.

To be sure, a pro-prostitution Department of Justice might not be able to override state and local laws (although, of course, we should never underestimate the power of liberal lawyers, working with liberal judges and the American Civil Liberties Union to think of tricky end-runs around traditional morality).

In any case, without a doubt, a Warren-ized DOJ would take some of the pressure off interstate and international and sex-trafficking. And that’s good news for Bob Kraft-types, both in America and coming from around the world.

Moreover, such a hands-off approach would be even better news for the next Jeffrey Epstein. We can recall that the late (we presume) Epstein had an international racket going, bringing in women and girls from Eastern Europe, and sending them on the “Lolita Express”—to the Caribbean, New Mexico, even Thailand—for pimpy purposes.

So while Warren and the other Democrats have said nothing about changing age-of-consent laws—sex with minors being the peculiar predilection of Epstein and, apparently, of other of his rich associates—it’s obvious that if prosecutors have fewer points of leverage on the sex trade, then Epstein-type abuses are more likely to emerge.

Thus we can see: Legalizing prostitution would be a great comfort to many among the comfortable.

Yet at the same time, Warren’s plan would further afflict the afflicted. Few, if any, women truly want to be prostitutes, and yet if the global magnet of money—complete with marketing and hyping—is turned on and allowed to operate at full power, well, a lot of women, and girls, will be pulled, and pushed, into prostitution. We can observe: This is not liberation, it’s degradation. It’s not empowerment, it’s a kind of slavery—indeed, it used to be called white slavery.

But wait—there’s more! More, that is, to the Democrats’ plan to comfort the comfortable. You see, not only does Warren want to decriminalize prostitution, she also wants to decriminalize crossing the U.S. border. In other words, every trans-national pimp and procurer will have an easier time bringing nubile bodies across the border—no nosy border guards asking questions and getting in the way.

Fittingly, on October 8, Breitbart News’s John Binder analyzed Warren’s overall immigration plan, dubbing it a “donor class immigration plan.” Notably, Warren’s plan doesn’t include mandatory E-Verify for employers and employees, and so once again, it will be all the easier for sex workers to work—having come from anywhere in the world, regardless of their legal status.

To sum up, Warren offers a trifecta for comforting the comfortable: First, legalize sex work; second, legalize anyone crossing the border; and third, do little if anything about hiring non-citizens.

So yes, if she wins, Warren may raise rich people’s taxes. And yet for the randier of the rich, it’s a sweet tradeoff; they’ll pay more in taxes, but her policy platform offers them a happy ending."

Sanders, who visited the Hawkeye State this week, officially picked up the endorsement of Linn County Board of Supervisors’ Stacey Walker. Walker is featured on the Des Moines Register’s “50 Most Wanted Democrats” list, which describes him as a “dynamic and charismatic speaker” who is continuing to “gain prominence on the Linn County Board of Supervisors”:

A Cedar Rapids native, Walker is active in the local community and Iowa politics. National Democrats like California U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander and Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, a possible 2020 candidate, campaigned with him in 2018.

While Walker said there are many qualified candidates in the race, Sanders is by far “the most progressive and best positioned to defeat Donald Trump in the general election.”

Walker added that Sanders “goes to the furthest” in terms of his sweeping progressive plans and added that the Vermont senator has been “talking about these issues for decades.”

He told the local CBS station:

When you add on top of the fact that he has brought together one of the most diverse coalition of supporters I think any presidential campaign has ever seen, what that means is we actually have a shot at achieving this ambitious policy program, because we’re going to have folks mobilize to put pressure on members of Congress to make sure we can pass this legislation.

Walker also told Politico that he is backing Sanders because the country needs someone with a “bold” vision in order to “course-correct from the disaster that Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have become.”

“That is what America needs to course-correct from the disaster that Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have become,” he said.

“We need a leader with a bold vision, and as a black man living in America, I’ve had enough of politicians telling me we have to scale back our dreams and ambitions,” he added.

Sanders is currently battling for the heart of Iowa, edging out Joe Biden (D) but falling behind Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) in the latest Civiqs survey released this week.

The poll shows Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) leading in the Hawkeye State with 28 percent support, followed by Buttigieg, Sanders, and Biden with 20 percent, 18 percent, and 12 percent, respectively:"

In a statement, former Vice President Joe Biden congratulated ""our special forces, our intelligence community, and all our brave military professionals on delivering justice"" to Baghdadi. Author Marianne Williamson offered in a tweet ""Praise and thanks for the military bravery and brilliance that carried out the mission,"" and former Maryland Rep. John Delaney wrote on Twitter that he's ""grateful for the brave patriots who risked their lives to advance our safety and security.""

With Trump and Republicans likely to characterize the mission as a defining moment of his presidency ahead of next year's election, the lack of attention placed on his role in the operation could provide insight into how the field of candidates plan to discuss the news in the coming weeks and months.

Trump announced at the White House earlier Sunday that Baghdadi killed himself on Saturday during a US special operations forces mission that went after the ISIS leader. The President told reporters Baghdadi was under surveillance for a couple of weeks and that two to three planned missions were scrapped before the successful one was launched. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Sunday that Trump approved the raid ""late last week"" after being presented with different options.

In a Sunday tweet, entrepreneur Andrew Yang congratulated ""the special ops team that executed the mission and everyone in the chain of command,"" though there was no mention of Trump, who as commander-in-chief is at the top of the Pentagon's chain of command. Similarly, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, told CNN that ""everybody involved deserves credit, but those who were at the tip of the spear deserve the most credit."" Buttigieg also did not refer to Trump's involvement.

Kamala Harris (D-CA) is backing Virginia state lawmaker Kathy Tran, who proposed the legislation that would have allowed abortion in the state even as a woman is about to give birth.

“She has endured, she has persevered, and, all the while, with courage, she has been one of the strongest leaders that we have,” Harris said about Tran, reported the Washington Examiner.

“She is somebody who never puts up her finger and says, ‘Oh, is this going to be popular or not?’ You know that,” Harris added. “You know she’s taken on huge fights, in particular for the women of Virginia and the families that love them, saying it’s not about what’s popular at the moment. It’s about what’s right. And these are the kinds of leaders we need in our statehouses.”

Tran, who turned her seat in the Virginia House of Delegates from red to blue, proposed an abortion measure in January that set off a firestorm around the country and led to a national controversy over “infanticide” for Democrat Gov. Ralph Northam, who backed her legislation.

The state lawmaker’s bill would not only have allowed abortion throughout all nine months of pregnancy in the state, but would have also permitted a woman to decide whether she wants to “abort” her baby as she is dilating and about to give birth.

Tran proposed the Repeal Act as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) signed into law the Reproductive Health Act, which eliminated recognition of “personhood” in the unborn and defined a “person” as a “human being who has been born and is alive.” Pro-life groups referred to the New York law as permitting “infanticide.”

The Virginia measure, which was ultimately tabled, would have eliminated the requirement that abortions in the second trimester of pregnancy be performed in a hospital, as well as the requirement of an ultrasound prior to an abortion. It also would have ended the requirement that two other physicians certify the necessity of a third-trimester abortion.

Northam’s comments during an appearance on WTOP-FM heightened the controversy over the bill when he commented on an “infant” delivered when the mother chose abortion while she is dilating:

If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.

After those comments, a spokesperson for the governor attempted to clarify his remarks by saying, “The governor’s comments were limited to the actions physicians would take in the event that a woman [facing nonviable pregnancy or severe fetal abnormalities] went into labor.”

Abortion rights activists immediately went into defense mode with the narrative that abortions performed at the point of birth are only carried out due to severe risks to the mother’s health or serious fetal anomalies.

However, a study the pro-abortion rights Guttmacher Institute released in 2013 found women seeking both first-trimester and late-term abortions provided the same reasons for delaying their abortions, including “not knowing about the pregnancy,” “trouble deciding about the abortion,” and “disagreeing about the abortion with the man involved.”

The study found that “most women seeking later terminations are not doing so for reasons of fetal anomaly or life endangerment.”

In response to Tran’s proposed legislation, Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) said at the time, “I don’t care what party you’re from — if you can’t say that it’s wrong to leave babies to die after birth, get the hell out of public office.”

In January, a Marist poll found 75 percent of Americans want substantial restrictions on abortion, including 60 percent of Democrats and 61 percent of those who identify as “pro-choice.”"

“My favorite — I’m going to say it, we’ll break news today — is Elizabeth Warren,” Legend said in a wide-ranging interview with Vanity Fair published Monday morning.

“She’s the best candidate running today and she comes at it with joy and with sincerity and with a wealth of knowledge and experience,” the All of Me crooner said of the senator.

“Honestly, I don’t comprehend why guys hate women so much sometimes,” he went on. “You see someone as transparently competent and eloquent and on fire as Elizabeth Warren and then you hear some guys just are not into voting for a woman. Why do guys feel so threatened by the idea of a woman president?”

Vanity Fair reports that Legend’s wife, model-turned-left-wing activist Chrissy Teigen, also expressed “love” for Warren, but said she also thinks highly about 2020 White House contender Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA).

“I also love Kamala Harris,” Teigen said.

As part of their sit-down with Vanity Fair, Legend and Teigen, both outspoken critics of President Trump, called the president, “sad, and petty, and narcissistic and immature.”

“I think there needs to be jail time for him, for the whole family,” Teigen told the magazine on the topic of the House Democrats’ secret impeachment inquiry into the president.

“I feel like he still gets away with everything if he gets out of his office,” she added. “I know that his first tweet after he’s impeached will be, ‘I didn’t want to be there anyway.’ ”

Of course, Legend and Teigen’s criticisms of the president has not gone way one.

Last month, President Trump took aim at the Hollywood couple for failing to credit his administration on enacting criminal justice reform.

“When all of the people pushing so hard for Criminal Justice Reform were unable to come even close to getting it done, they came to me as a group and asked for my help,” the president tweeted. “I got it done with a group of Senators & others who would never have gone for it. Obama couldn’t come close.”

The couple, who are major Democratic Party supporters and progressive activists and campaigned for Hillary Clinton in 2016, also used the interview to announce their preferred presidential candidates, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Teigen also expressed her admiration for Kamala Harris.

Sanders participated in the Second Step Presidential Justice Forum at the historically black college on Saturday and took a question from an audience member, who asked, “If I was your son, what advice would you give me the next time I would be pulled over by a police officer?”

The presidential hopeful told the student that he would suggest politely asking for the officer’s name and stressed respecting what the officer is doing “so that you don’t get shot in the back of the head.”

“I would do my best to identify who that police officer is in a polite way, ask him or her for their name,” Sanders began.

“I would respect what they are doing so that you don’t get shot in the back of the head, but I would also be very mindful of the fact that, as a nation, we have got to hold police officers accountable for the actions that they commit,” he continued, urging his hypothetical son to exercise caution.

“So, to answer your question, I would be very cautious if you were my son in terms of dealing with our police officers, but I would also defend my rights and know my rights and make sure, if possible, that police officer’s [body] camera is on,” he added:

Todd Phillip’s R-rated comic-book hit regained the top spot at the weekend box office in its fourth week of release, narrowly besting “Maleficent: Mistress of Evil.” The Warner Bros.′ sensation, starring Joaquin Phoenix, took in $18.9 million in ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.

That came in just above the $18.6 million haul for the Walt Disney Co.’s “Maleficent” sequel, which slid to second after a disappointing No. 1 debut last weekend of $36 million. “Mistress of Evil,” starring Angelina Jolie, is performing better overseas, where it grossed $64.3 million over the weekend.

With such a close race at the top between “Joker” and “Mistress of Evil,” the order could switch when final figures are released Monday.

But ticket sales have continued to surge well past expectations for “Joker.” With a modest budget of $60 million, it’s been extraordinarily profitable for Warner Bros. — although the studio, to mitigate risk, shared costs with Bron Studios and Village Roadshow Pictures.

This week, “Joker” became the most successful R-rated moved ever, not accounting for inflation, in worldwide release. It’s made $849 million globally, including $47.8 million internationally over the weekend. (Mel Gibson’s “The Passion of the Christ” remains the R-rated domestic leader, with $370.8 million.)

Despite mixed reviews, “Joker” — a “Taxi Driver”-styled spin on a comic-book origin story — has already amassed a box-office total exceeding that of more mainstream superhero movies such as “Thor: Ragnarok” and “Wonder Woman.”

No new releases mustered any competition with the holdovers. The best-performing newcomer was the STX Entertainment horror thriller “Countdown.” It grossed $9 million. Sony Screen Gems’ “Black and Blue,” a police thriller starring Naomie Harris, opened with $8.3 million.

Holding especially well was “The Addams Family,” United Artists and MGM’s Halloween-timed animated reboot of the macabre family. It slid just 28% in its second weekend with $11.7 million, good for third place

Much of the weekend’s action was in limited or expanding releases for acclaimed Oscar contenders.

Robert Eggers’ “The Lighthouse,” a black-and-white psychological drama starring Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson as 19th century lighthouse keepers, made $3 million on just 586 screens for A24.

Taika Waititi’s “Jojo Rabbit,” about a 10-year-old boy growing up in Nazi Germany, expanded into 55 theaters, earning a strong $1 million. In September, the Fox Searchlight release won the Toronto Film Festival’s highly predictive audience award , setting it up as a potential Academy Awards favorite. Its initial expansion suggests it will be a hit with audiences, too.

Less successful was the Bruce Springsteen concert film “Western Stars” ($560,000 in 537 theaters).

Alfonso Gomez-Rejon’s “The Current War” also finally landed in theaters more than two years after it first premiered. Gomez-Rejon recut his film after Harvey Weinstein, shortly before his downfall, pushed out a critically panned version of the Thomas Edison (Benedict Cumberbatch) and George Westinghouse (Michael Shannon) tale. Gomez-Rejon’s “director’s cut,” which 101 Studios acquired from the now-defunct Weinstein Co., opened with $2.7 million from about 1,000 theaters.

“Terminator: Dark Fate,” which is expected to lead the box office next weekend, got off to a $12.8 million start in a handful of international markets before its stateside debut.

Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included. Final domestic figures will be released Monday."

(CNN) Blame the fog of war, the Pentagon's secrecy or the President whose tall tales often can't be trusted, but Washington is still puzzling over the fuzzy details of the raid that killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi — and what comes next.

What are the remaining US troops in Syria actually doing now?

Officially, they are guarding oil fields. But Washington whispers suggest that the mission was devised to convince President Donald Trump to keep some troops within easy reach of ISIS targets. On Monday, Defense Secretary Mark Esper stressed the need to avoid Middle Eastern entanglements -- but also spoke of a ""repositioning"" of troops, rather than withdrawal.

Who are the Americans protecting the oil fields from?

The Pentagon says US forces will keep ISIS from enriching itself with oil revenues, and secure the fields for the Syrian Kurds instead. But Esper also raised the prospect of an alarming escalation when CNN's Barbara Starr asked if securing Syria's oil also meant keeping Syrian and Russian hands off the black gold. ""The short answer is yes, it presently does,"" he said.

Did Baghdadi really ""whimper"" before he died?

Trump mocked the last moments of America's most wanted terrorist in graphic detail. But how did he know? It's not clear that video feeds of the raid included such detail or audio. Gen. Mark Milley, who ought to know, said he didn't ""know the source of that"" and wondered publicly if Trump had heard it from returning soldiers.

Why can't Trump just pocket his win?

Few days go by without Trump indulging his Barack Obama obsession. Soon after the raid, he made the dubious claim that Baghdadi was a bigger target than Osama bin Laden, who died in a raid ordered by his predecessor. Trump later said that Obama should have got Baghdadi, too.

The current President can't help himself -- his political method is based on satisfying grudges and widening divisions. But his lack of magnanimity might be one reason he doesn't get his due credit after victories like the Baghdadi raid.

""Isn't it time for there to be a leader in this protest movement?""

Lebanon's mass demonstrations show no signs of going away, to the consternation of the country's sectarian leaders. ""Isn't it time for there to be a leader in this protest movement?"" asked Hezbollah party head Hassan Nasrallah in a televised speech last week. But as CNN's Tamara Qiblawi, Ben Wedeman and Ghazi Balkiz write from Beirut, activists see the movement's shapelessness as ""proof of its authenticity, as well as of the depths of people's frustration"" across social and religious divides.

'Afghanistan is a safe place by comparison'

Addressing police chiefs in Chicago, Trump took aim at his host city after being snubbed by local police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who skipped the do. First the President praised Chicago's police officers, then continued by criticizing the city as ""embarrassing"" to America. ""All over the world they're talking about Chicago,"" he said. ""Afghanistan is a safe place by comparison.""

'I call it a dog'

President Trump tweeted this declassified photo of a military dog that participated in the raid on Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's compound.

Trump on Sunday announced that a furry member of the special forces team that helped entrap the ISIS leader had been wounded. ""Our canine, I call it a dog, a beautiful dog -- a talented dog -- was injured and brought back,"" he said.

On Monday, the military announced the dog had recovered and was back on duty. But Gen. Milley refused to divulge any more details about the four-legged operative, citing operation security. ""The dog is still in theater,"" he said.

All the same, Trump couldn't resist tweeting out a declassified picture.

Anonymous

Anonymous sources are often the only way to find out what's really going on in politics -- which is one reason Washington is salivating over the release of the book by an anonymous author who purports to be a White House insider. But in the UK, political journalists are under fire for reporting anonymous briefings by government sources.

Critics say unnamed sources are misleading the British public, as Brexit drama turns into an election fever. They've sparked a debate that has raged for weeks, inspiring fiery columns and TV segments, with UK reporters retorting that the argument has edged into hysteria -- and that it would be condescending to readers not to share information from senior sources.

Readers on both sides of the Atlantic learned the peril of blind quotes when claims by unnamed sources on weapons of mass destruction turned out to be exaggerated or untrue. But these days in Washington, anonymous leaks have also proven accurate, with later reporting confirming details of White House chaos and an unchained President on topics like Ukraine, Syria and the Russia investigation.

by CNN's Hadas Gold Yes, anonymity can be abused. But on the other hand, putting a name on a lie doesn't make it any more true, as Trump's own record of whoppers can tell you. --

Wildfires

Smoke from a wildfire called the Kincade Fire hangs over Healdsburg, Calif., as farm animals graze in a pasture on Monday, Oct. 28, 2019.

Massive fires are scorching tens of thousands of acres in southern California, and no amount of money or fame will protect the celebrity homeowners in their path -- Democratic presidential contender Kamala Harris and basketball star LeBron James are among the Californians in the evacuation zone. The Golden State is suffering from drought and rising temperatures -- the annual burned area from wildfires has grown 500% since the early 1970s.

But the activist is launching a campaign to call out Facebook's policy of allowing politicians to run false ads -- a practice that Democratic presidential candidates warn could reward Trump's reign of deliberate error."

The paradox is that the candidates' focus on Iowa is increasing even as the state's odds of predicting the nomination's winner may be shrinking.

In every contested Democratic nomination race in this century, the winner of the Iowa caucuses has eventually won the nomination. That's a measure of how much momentum candidates can earn, especially in this era of pervasive news coverage, from winning that kickoff contest. Conscious of that history, the leading 2020 candidates have courted Iowa more aggressively than any other state on the primary calendar, whether measured by time, money or staff.

But the increasing diversity of the Democratic electorate -- compounded by the unique racial dynamics of this race -- raises the prospect that the 2020 contest could end Iowa's winning streak in predicting the eventual nominee. The reason is that while it's eminently possible to win Iowa, a virtually all-white state, without appealing to black or other minority voters, it's almost impossible to win the nomination without cross-racial appeal.

For that reason, some Democrats are looking to South Carolina, a heavily African American state that votes fourth on the primary calendar, as a better gauge of how the race will ultimately unfold than either Iowa, which votes February 3, or New Hampshire, which follows with the first primary eight days later.

""While I think Iowa is a good place to get your feet wet, New Hampshire is a good place to get your feet wet, South Carolina is a place where you dive in the political pool and really start to swim,"" says Antjuan Seawright, a South Carolina-based Democratic strategist who is uncommitted in the race. ""It is the state that will ultimately decide who the next nominee will be.""

The predominant role that Iowa and New Hampshire play in the nomination process has generated internal party tension for years because the Democratic electorate in each state remains about 90% white, in a party where as much as 40% of the primary voters across all the states may be nonwhite.

But the impact of that racial contrast has been muted in the party's four contested nomination races since 2000 for one big reason: The winners of the Iowa caucuses all performed well with black voters in subsequent states, particularly Al Gore in 2000, Barack Obama in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. (John Kerry, the 2004 Iowa winner, ran well, but not as dominantly, among African American voters.)

This year, though, polls point toward a heightened possibility of a divergence between the mostly white Iowa electorate and the more diverse states that follow.

Support among African Americans

Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has established a significant advantage in almost all state and national polls among white voters with college degrees, and in some surveys she's turned in very competitive showings among white voters without college degrees as well. That pattern of support has pushed her into the lead in some recent Iowa surveys . Given the strength of the organization she's built in the state, some local observers now consider her a clear favorite.

""Today I would say it is going to be really hard to displace Elizabeth Warren,"" says Jeff Link, an Iowa-based Democratic consultant who is unaffiliated in the race. ""She has not had a meteoric rise, she has had a slow and steady rise. She's got a big organization and they are smart and they are doing stuff all over.""

But Warren has seen little support in polls among black voters, who cast about one-fourth of all the 2016 Democratic primary votes, according to a cumulative CNN analysis . That's not a problem for her in Iowa -- or New Hampshire -- but it looms as a critical hurdle in the more diverse states that vote later, starting with Nevada and especially South Carolina. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who appear positioned along with Warren to perform well in Iowa, also have registered little support with black voters -- in Buttigieg's case virtually none ). Among the top tier of current Iowa contenders only former Vice President Joe Biden has displayed a consistent appeal for African American voters in polls.

That pattern heightens the possibility that Iowa's streak of picking the party winners might end next year. The biggest question remaining in the 2020 race, in fact, may be whether a disappointing showing for Biden in Iowa -- and possibly New Hampshire, too -- will cause large numbers of black voters in later states, especially South Carolina, to move away from him.

""I don't think it's going to have any impact on the decisive vote in South Carolina, which is African American voters,"" says Seawright. Iowa's ultimate effect on the nomination fight could turn on whether he's right.

Iowa and New Hampshire's impact only grew in 21st century

Historically, the impact of Iowa and New Hampshire over the Democratic nomination process can hardly be overstated. Since the modern primary process began in 1972, Democrats have picked only two presidential nominees who had not carried one of the two states: George McGovern in 1972 and Bill Clinton in 1992. Even the Clinton example comes with an asterisk: The Democratic contenders that year conceded Iowa to home state candidate Sen. Tom Harkin, and Clinton staged a dramatic revival in New Hampshire, successfully anointing himself as ""the comeback kid,"" after recovering from scandal to finish second to another regional favorite, Sen. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts.

If anything, the two states' influence appears to have deepened in this century. Not only have they picked the ultimate winner each time, but candidates who did not break through in one of them have been almost completely shut out everywhere else.

Democrats have had four contested 21st-century nomination fights: in 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2016. Over those four races, with about 200 total state contests among them, the number of primaries and caucuses won by a candidate who did not first win Iowa or New Hampshire is just five. All of those exceptions came in 2004, when John Kerry won both of the first two states and captured the nomination convincingly, but lost five contests along the way to his rivals, Howard Dean, John Edwards and Wesley Clark.

Iowa has seemed to eclipse even New Hampshire in the most recent Democratic contests: When the two states diverged in their choices in 2008 and 2016, the Iowa winner (Obama and then Hillary Clinton) beat the New Hampshire victor (Clinton and then Sanders) both times. And certainly in 2020, every tangible measure of campaign commitment signals that the candidates are prioritizing Iowa over New Hampshire and the other earliest states on the calendar Nevada and South Carolina.

Iowa is getting campaign cash and face time

Data collected by the CNN political unit from Kantar/CMAG, an ad-monitoring firm, shows that Iowa is receiving far more spending on television advertising than any other state.

Apart from billionaire investor Tom Steyer, a long-shot candidate who has spent enormous sums in all four of the early states, the candidate ad buys are heavily tilted toward Iowa. Biden, for instance, has already spent about $700,000 in Iowa, compared with about $5,000 combined in the other three states. Buttigieg has spent almost $2 million in Iowa television without spending anything in the other three states.

Three other candidates are devoting almost all of their television spending so far to Iowa: Sanders ($1.7 million in Iowa, about $1,000 in South Carolina) and Sens. Michael Bennet of Colorado (about $1.1 million in Iowa, nothing anywhere else) and Kamala Harris of California (nearly $600,000 in Iowa, nothing anywhere else). Though Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota is pitching herself in Iowa as a neighboring Midwesterner, she may be the biggest exception to this pattern so far: She's spent roughly even sums in Iowa and New Hampshire, nearly $500,000 in each case.

Warren hasn't yet aired any television ads, but the Kantar/CMAG data show that she's booked more television advertising in Iowa than anywhere else. Warren, however, has also booked million-dollar-plus commitments in the other three states; apart from Steyer, only Biden -- in South Carolina -- has made bookings in a future state anywhere near that large.

Campaign visits tell the same story. A tracker of campaign appearances maintained by the Ballotpedia website show that through October 1, almost all of the major Democratic candidates -- including Biden, Buttigieg, Sanders, Harris and Klobuchar -- had made about twice as many trips to Iowa as New Hampshire; only Warren has kept a closer balance between them. Harris has virtually moved to Iowa, and Buttigieg, who is launching another bus tour there this weekend after the Friday event, is close behind. The leading contenders have also blanketed the state with campaign offices and organizing staff.

""I think there are 650 campaign staffers currently in Iowa for presidential candidates,"" says Link, the Democratic consultant. ""That's got to be close to a high-water mark"" in the state's history, he adds.

In New Hampshire, 'a slow fall'

It's all been enough to leave New Hampshire feeling more than a little neglected. ""It's been a slow fall,"" says Dante Scala, a political scientist at the University of New Hampshire and author of ""Stormy Weather,"" a history of the New Hampshire primary. Scala says New Hampshire is receiving the least attention from the Democratic candidates probably since the 2004 race, when most of the field also burrowed into Iowa and largely ceded the first-in-the-nation primary to the two regional candidates, Kerry and Dean.

This year several factors appear to driving the campaigns to prioritize Iowa over the other early states even more than usual.

The first is the sheer size of the field. In polling this year, Democratic voters have already shown a clear reluctance to seriously focus on more than a few candidates, and the campaigns believe that narrowing tendency will significantly intensify once states begin voting.

The historic axiom has been that there are ""three tickets out of Iowa,"" meaning that only the top three finishers there remain viable in later states. Given the amount of money and media attention candidates can now command, few campaign strategists are sure that rule still applies, but no one wants to be the fourth- or fifth-place finisher who proves it does. Scala, in a view echoed by many campaign insiders, says the candidates seem to have concluded the race ""is like a 100-yard dash but there's not enough place on the track for everybody. If you lose that first step you might be done, and Iowa is that first step.""

Another factor tilting the candidates toward Iowa, especially relative to New Hampshire, is the belief that it will be very difficult for anyone -- even Biden -- to dislodge one of the two senators from neighboring states, Warren and Sanders. When New Hampshire voters have had the opportunity to pick a New England candidate, such as Tsongas, Kerry or Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, they have almost always done so. The high cost of competing in New Hampshire --because of the need to buy expensive television in Boston that reaches the Granite State -- adds to the reluctance of most candidates to launch full-scale New Hampshire efforts. For everyone except Biden, Warren and Sanders, the dominant assumption may be that the best way to run competitively in New Hampshire is to ride the momentum from a good showing in Iowa.

The concern about the cost of Boston television points toward the third reason Iowa has emerged as first among equals. With so many candidates running, the Democratic fundraising base has splintered to a point where no one commands the level of financial resources that say, Obama and Hillary Clinton did in 2008. Compared with the past few races, that means candidates can't afford to blanket all of the early states with resources.

The new dynamic

Yet despite all these factors steering the candidates toward Iowa, the prominent racial divergence emerging in the Democratic race increases the possibility that Iowa this year could send out a false positive, picking a favorite who does not ultimately win.

Even Biden's own advisers privately acknowledge that failing to win Iowa or New Hampshire would threaten his campaign. But whatever happens in Iowa, New Hampshire and even Nevada, the campaign believes that if Biden can retain enough support from black voters to win South Carolina, he could restore his viability. The calendar at that point would benefit him because so many of the states that vote in the next few weeks after South Carolina -- beginning with the Super Tuesday cluster of primaries just three days later -- have large populations of African Americans, Hispanics or both. That means it will be harder for Warren or any other remaining contender to win most of those states -- from Alabama and Arizona to Florida, Texas and California -- while depending primarily on white voters, especially those with college degrees.

Seawright, in fact, says it will be ""mathematically impossible"" for any candidate to run strongly on Super Tuesday without first receiving, in effect, a stamp of approval from African American voters in South Carolina. Biden ""can use South Carolina as a place of political rehabilitation and come out well,"" he says. Although it now looks less likely, South Carolina could also serve as a springboard for either of the two African American candidates in the race -- Harris or Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey -- if they first demonstrate strength in one of the three states that vote before it. Obama followed that model to eclipse Clinton in 2008.

Despite its public bravado, Biden's camp doesn't want to find out whether it's possible to win the nomination without carrying either of the first two, or even any of the first three, states that vote before South Carolina. But until one of Biden's rivals shows more appeal for African American voters, it's not unreasonable for his advisers to hope that it's South Carolina this year that will predict the nominee -- no matter how much time and money the field is lavishing on Iowa.

Welcome to the sinister side of space, where ""no one can hear you scream,"" as the original ""Alien"" movie poster warned.

Just in time for Halloween, NASA released two new posters on Tuesday showcasing exoplanets HD 189733 b and PSR B1257+12 c, existing in ""a place only sophisticated telescopes"" could reach in a "" galaxy of horrors .""

The release of the colorful posters sheds light on dangerous worlds in the universe. Previous posters have highlighted the wonders of our own solar system as well as potentially habitable exoplanets, or planets outside of our solar system, where they imagine how humans might one day visit these faraway places.

The two new posters imagine a darker journey where travelers would have to fight to stay alive. The scientists and artists involved wanted to consider tropes from famous horror movie posters and pair them p with extreme exoplanets, said Tiffany Kataria, an exoplanet scientist who consulted on some of the posters.

In one poster, potential travelers are advised to prepare for ""rains of terror"" on the ""nightmare world"" of HD 189733 b, dubbed ""the killer you never see coming."" Discovered in 2005, this gas giant is 65 light-years from Earth and completes an orbit around its star every 2.2 Earth days.

It's bright blue color is a ruse easily mistaken for the inviting color of our own planet when seen from space. But the weather will slice and dice you.

Winds can reach 5,400 mph -- seven times the speed of sound -- on this exoplanet, according to NASA. Travelers would be whipped all around ""in a sickening spiral around the planet,"" according to NASA. But the rain cuts just as deep. Exoplanet scientists believe its possible that glass-like silicate particles could rain sideways from its high clouds, cutting and piercing anyone that dares to visit.

Kataria was pleased to see the planet finally get its due. It was one of the first exoplanets to be characterized in great detail and since it's been imaged in visible light, scientists know the planet is blue.

""This planet set the stage for our understanding of a lot of planets like it,"" Kataria said.

The second poster warns of zombie worlds, where nothing could live, like Poltergeist (or PSR B1257+12 c) and its planetary companions Draugr and Phobetor. One is an undead creature from Norse mythology and the latter is the Greek god for nightmares. They're 1,957 light-years from Earth and were discovered in 1994.

The system is populated by three cores of dead planets trapped in the magnetic fields of the collapsed core of a star, nicknamed Lich, that exploded. And while it sounds like there isn't much to Lich, it's the deadliest part of the system.

The dead star sends out twin beams of blasting radiation, called a pulsar, which would destroy any spacecraft that tried to reach one of the planets. And that radiation falls onto the planets, creating auroras that appear more sickly than brilliant.

The posters differ stylistically from previous releases by the Studio at NASA, which was a conscious decision by the artists. They want each planet, and the unique science that accompanies them, to stand out. Details like color form around what's going on scientifically, said Joby Harris, visual strategist at the Studio and artist on the new posters.

Harris had to use his imagination to determine how to draw frightening physics at work.

""It's a shift from inspiring and fascinating awe to the sublime and fear, and feeling very small,"" Harris said.

Exoplanet travel bureau

The posters created by the Studio at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena combine imaginative artistic renderings with intriguing science. Teams of artists and scientists have been collaborating on them since 2014. But the posters weren't initially designed to be shared with the public.

It started with a dark hallway in a new building that housed the exoplanet office at JPL, a blank canvas with spots waiting to be filled by poster-sized objects. Currently, there are no detailed photographic images of exoplanets. They're too distant and faint.

But the exoplanet office was filled with scientists processing a wealth of data from NASA's planet hunting mission, Kepler, at the time. They were learning about the location and size of these planets beyond our solar system. But any ideas as to the appearance of the planets lay locked up in data.

NASA wanted to fill the empty hallways at JPLwith exoplanet imagery. Artists in The Studio who assisted with media releases were asked to come up with ideas to represent the diversity of planets found outside of our solar system.

Visual strategist David Delgado took up the task. ""Imagining forward has always been a creative landscape I love to play in,"" he said. ""And it's begging to be thought of when you're talking about different planets out in the galaxy. It sounds so sci-fi. The fact that they're real is mind boggling.""

They focused on what it would be like to visit these planets and then collaborated with scientists in the exoplanet office to learn as much as they could. The artists wanted to keep it simple in each poster. To suss out the most interesting characteristic of each planet, they asked the scientists what aspect captured their imagination the most.

The artists were attracted to the travel poster format, drawing inspiration from vintage posters like the Works Progress Administration posters of the late 1930s and early 1940s that encouraged people to visit national parks. The posters had a classic style but also showed something attractive about each park.

In turn, the scientists shared the science that should be included with the posters to keep them accurate. While the artists had certain color schemes in mind, the scientists would also offer notes on size, potential colors, the direction of light and even what the sky might look like from the surface.

The collaborative effort produced beautiful, colorful exoplanet posters that were too exciting to remain confined to the hallway.

In 2016, they released a series of posters. The Studio's "" Visions of the Future "" posters portrayed places in our solar system being visited by missions, as well as envisioning exoplanets. The posters went viral and the site crashed.

Imagining worlds

Harris said the posters have been motivated by the question ""Why would you want to go there?"" as well as ""Why wouldn't you want to go there?"" It's about the beauty and horror of physics, at the end of the day. And the whole process is a dance that the scientists lead, Harris said.

Posters focusing on potentially habitable exoplanets, like TRAPPIST-1e, as well as the comfort of our own solar system in a series promoting a ""grand tour"" of it, showed all of the ways humans might one day visit these planets, acting as a planetary travel bureau

Eric Mamajek, an exoplanet scientist who collaborated on two of the previous posters, said the designs are a balance of achieving scientific basics for the planet along with ""a bit of sci-fi.""

Mamajek helped with the TRAPPIST-1e poster and provided calculations for the size the other planets in the system would appear in the sky, as well as the position of the stars as seen from the planet's surface.

""You want to fly to these worlds and see what they're like,"" Mamajek said of the posters. ""It's translating science to art and conveying the wonder of discovering these new worlds. We're finding new worlds that are beyond what people can imagine. These posters can convey some of the excitement of those discoveries.""

But the universe is full of more dangerous, extreme worlds than hospitable ones. Depicting a lava world like 55 Cancri e presented a challenge for the artists because they still wanted to show the planet from a human traveler perspective while showcasing the dangerous side of exoplanets.

""There was an objective that this poster could extend beyond that and explore worlds that aren't friendly to life,"" Kataria said.

Harris began working on a concept with an '80s neon color scheme and envisioned a train driving past blue and purple waterfalls. He was 75% done when Kataria shared that there was no solid ground on this lava world. Harris tossed out the train idea and asked Kataria for more details.

Kataria shared that the planet had an average sizzling temperature of 2,000 Kelvin and had clouds made of silicate grains, likely creating glittery particles in the air.

That sparked Harris' imagination. ""When a scientist tries to reach for an analogy for the first time, that's when the magic happens,"" he said.

In the finished poster, a protective bubble surrounds the human travelers. If you look closely, the viscosity of the lava is slightly different on one side than the other. That's because the planet is tidally locked, meaning one side always faces its star while the other is in shadow. Scientists are still trying to determine if that means the lava might be cooler on one side than the other. So on one side, it's flowing more rapidly.

They also created a VR experience for the planet that includes those dangerously glittering skies.

Kataria said even given all of her research concerning the exoplanet, she had never envisioned what it might look like.

The exoplanet posters usually provide a key scientific takeaway while providing resources for people to research more about it if their interest is sparked. The posters emphasize the strange reality of different worlds in our galaxy and imagine the technology that could take us there.

""One of my favorite things to do, is play in a world of imagination and plausible reality,"" Delgado said."

Kamala Harris (D-CA) is backing Virginia state lawmaker Kathy Tran, who proposed the legislation that would have allowed abortion in the state even as a woman is about to give birth.

“She has endured, she has persevered, and, all the while, with courage, she has been one of the strongest leaders that we have,” Harris said about Tran, reported the Washington Examiner.

“She is somebody who never puts up her finger and says, ‘Oh, is this going to be popular or not?’ You know that,” Harris added. “You know she’s taken on huge fights, in particular for the women of Virginia and the families that love them, saying it’s not about what’s popular at the moment. It’s about what’s right. And these are the kinds of leaders we need in our statehouses.”

Tran, who turned her seat in the Virginia House of Delegates from red to blue, proposed an abortion measure in January that set off a firestorm around the country and led to a national controversy over “infanticide” for Democrat Gov. Ralph Northam, who backed her legislation.

The state lawmaker’s bill would not only have allowed abortion throughout all nine months of pregnancy in the state, but would have also permitted a woman to decide whether she wants to “abort” her baby as she is dilating and about to give birth.

Tran proposed the Repeal Act as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) signed into law the Reproductive Health Act, which eliminated recognition of “personhood” in the unborn and defined a “person” as a “human being who has been born and is alive.” Pro-life groups referred to the New York law as permitting “infanticide.”

The Virginia measure, which was ultimately tabled, would have eliminated the requirement that abortions in the second trimester of pregnancy be performed in a hospital, as well as the requirement of an ultrasound prior to an abortion. It also would have ended the requirement that two other physicians certify the necessity of a third-trimester abortion.

Northam’s comments during an appearance on WTOP-FM heightened the controversy over the bill when he commented on an “infant” delivered when the mother chose abortion while she is dilating:

If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.

After those comments, a spokesperson for the governor attempted to clarify his remarks by saying, “The governor’s comments were limited to the actions physicians would take in the event that a woman [facing nonviable pregnancy or severe fetal abnormalities] went into labor.”

Abortion rights activists immediately went into defense mode with the narrative that abortions performed at the point of birth are only carried out due to severe risks to the mother’s health or serious fetal anomalies.

However, a study the pro-abortion rights Guttmacher Institute released in 2013 found women seeking both first-trimester and late-term abortions provided the same reasons for delaying their abortions, including “not knowing about the pregnancy,” “trouble deciding about the abortion,” and “disagreeing about the abortion with the man involved.”

The study found that “most women seeking later terminations are not doing so for reasons of fetal anomaly or life endangerment.”

In response to Tran’s proposed legislation, Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) said at the time, “I don’t care what party you’re from — if you can’t say that it’s wrong to leave babies to die after birth, get the hell out of public office.”

Senator @BenSasse did not mince words in response to comments from @GovernorVA today on #HB2491 pic.twitter.com/wRLyemuMxg — The Daily Signal (@DailySignal) January 30, 2019

In January, a Marist poll found 75 percent of Americans want substantial restrictions on abortion, including 60 percent of Democrats and 61 percent of those who identify as “pro-choice.”"

Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) White House bid, calling her the “best candidate” running for president in 2020.

“My favorite — I’m going to say it, we’ll break news today — is Elizabeth Warren,” Legend said in a wide-ranging interview with Vanity Fair published Monday morning.

“She’s the best candidate running today and she comes at it with joy and with sincerity and with a wealth of knowledge and experience,” the All of Me crooner said of the senator.

“Honestly, I don’t comprehend why guys hate women so much sometimes,” he went on. “You see someone as transparently competent and eloquent and on fire as Elizabeth Warren and then you hear some guys just are not into voting for a woman. Why do guys feel so threatened by the idea of a woman president?”

Vanity Fair reports that Legend’s wife, model-turned-left-wing activist Chrissy Teigen, also expressed “love” for Warren, but said she also thinks highly about 2020 White House contender Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA).

“I also love Kamala Harris,” Teigen said.

As part of their sit-down with Vanity Fair, Legend and Teigen, both outspoken critics of President Trump, called the president, “sad, and petty, and narcissistic and immature.”

“I think there needs to be jail time for him, for the whole family,” Teigen told the magazine on the topic of the House Democrats’ secret impeachment inquiry into the president.

“I feel like he still gets away with everything if he gets out of his office,” she added. “I know that his first tweet after he’s impeached will be, ‘I didn’t want to be there anyway.’ ”

Of course, Legend and Teigen’s criticisms of the president has not gone way one.

Last month, President Trump took aim at the Hollywood couple for failing to credit his administration on enacting criminal justice reform.

“When all of the people pushing so hard for Criminal Justice Reform were unable to come even close to getting it done, they came to me as a group and asked for my help,” the president tweeted. “I got it done with a group of Senators & others who would never have gone for it. Obama couldn’t come close.”

In a lengthy profile in Vanity Fair with her husband John Legend, the 33-year-old reacted to news that Democrats were proceeding with impeachment proceedings against the president over a phone call between him and Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

“I think there needs to be jail time for him, for the whole family,” says Chrissy Teigen, without specifying what crimes the likes of Melania, Barron, Tiffany, Eric, Donald Jr., and Ivanka Trump would be charged with. “I feel like he still gets away with everything if he gets out of his office. I know that his first tweet after he’s impeached will be, ‘I didn’t want to be there anyway.’”

The couple, who are major Democratic Party supporters and progressive activists and campaigned for Hillary Clinton in 2016, also used the interview to announce their preferred presidential candidates, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Teigen also expressed her admiration for Kamala Harris.

“My favorite — I’m going to say it, we’ll break news today — is Elizabeth Warren,” said Legend. “She’s the best candidate running today and she comes at it with joy and with sincerity and with a wealth of knowledge and experience.”

“I love Elizabeth Warren,” Teigen added. “I also love Kamala Harris.”

Teigen is known for her vicious Twitter rants against Donald Trump, with the pair even getting into a Twitter spat after he referred to her as John Legend’s “filthy-mouthed wife,” to which Teigen responded by calling him a “pussy ass bitch”

Such is her dislike for Trump that she has even blamed him for her declining mental state, arguing that his presidency gives her crippling anxiety.

“So fucking tired of this manically insane, incompetent president and this dumpster fire administration I’m gonna have to go on another med,” she wrote in 2017. “I think I need to either up my dosage or talk to my doctor to ‘see what works for me’ when the world explodes.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is pulling out of his late-summer, early fall slump, catching up to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) nationally and edging her out in early primary states, according to a Morning Consult poll released Monday.

Morning Consult has consistently shown Joe Biden (D) as the frontrunner, despite numerous national polls suggesting otherwise. The George Washington University Politics Poll released ahead of the fourth Democrat debate, for example, showed Biden falling to third place nationally, behind both Warren and Sanders.

Morning Consult’s latest poll, taken October 21-27, 2019, among 15,431 registered voters likely to vote in the Democrat primary or caucus in their state, showed Biden leading the pack with 32 percent. Warren, who has bested Sanders in a number of polls in recent weeks, tied with the Vermont socialist for second place with 20 percent support each.

The divide between the top tier of candidates and the remainder of the field has become more drastic, with Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) coming in a distant fourth place with just seven percent support, followed by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) with six percent support, and Andrew Yang (D) with three percent support. The remaining candidates garnered two percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 1 percent:

New Democratic primary tracking: Biden: 32% (+2)

Warren: 20% (-1)

Sanders: 20% (+2)

Buttigieg: 7% (+1)

Harris: 6%

Yang: 3%

Booker: 2% (-1)

Klobuchar: 2%

O'Rourke: 2% (-1)https://t.co/hYloTERQnA — Morning Consult (@MorningConsult) October 28, 2019

Sanders also made advances with voters in early primary states, which includes Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. While Biden leads with 29 percent support from voters in early primary states, Sanders surpassed Warren with 18 percent support to the Massachusetts senator’s 17 percent support.

Once again, Buttigieg came in fourth with eight percent support, followed by Harris and Tom Steyer (D) with seven percent and six percent, respectively. The early primary state results came from 611 voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. The margin of error was +/- 4 percent.

Voters were also asked to choose a second choice candidate. According to the survey, 28 percent of Biden supporters chose Warren, 28 percent of Warren supporters selected Sanders, and 30 percent of Sanders supporters picked Biden.

Sanders’ bump in the polls may be indicative of the power behind his recent endorsements from far-left members of the “Squad”– Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).

Tlaib was the latest to endorse “Amo Bernie,” praising him as someone who is “not going to sell us out.”"

Sanders participated in the Second Step Presidential Justice Forum at the historically black college on Saturday and took a question from an audience member, who asked, “If I was your son, what advice would you give me the next time I would be pulled over by a police officer?”

The presidential hopeful told the student that he would suggest politely asking for the officer’s name and stressed respecting what the officer is doing “so that you don’t get shot in the back of the head.”

“I would do my best to identify who that police officer is in a polite way, ask him or her for their name,” Sanders began.

“I would respect what they are doing so that you don’t get shot in the back of the head, but I would also be very mindful of the fact that, as a nation, we have got to hold police officers accountable for the actions that they commit,” he continued, urging his hypothetical son to exercise caution.

“So, to answer your question, I would be very cautious if you were my son in terms of dealing with our police officers, but I would also defend my rights and know my rights and make sure, if possible, that police officer’s [body] camera is on,” he added:

Many on social media were not pleased by Sanders’ answer.

“Lord, @TheDemocrats are in real trouble. They NEED the Black vote in both elections,” one user wrote.

“Showing an officer ‘respect’ still regularly gets Black people killed because racism,” another tweeted.

“Oooohhhhh, so all those victims of police shootings were… just asking for it… Gotcha,” another added.

Former Vice President Joe Biden (D) was presented with a similar question.

“If I were your daughter, what advice would you give me the next time I am stopped by police?” a young black woman asked.

“If you were my daughter, you would be a Caucasian girl and you wouldn’t be pulled over,” Biden said to applause.

“Here’s the deal. What I would tell you is that’s what’s wrong. That is what’s wrong. There is institutional racism that still exists,” he added:

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) also attended the event, despite pledging to skip it the day prior due to the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center’s recognition of President Trump.

Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin (D) assured candidates that the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center had nothing to do with the event, which prompted Harris’s reversal.

“I am excited to welcome presidential candidates to a criminal justice forum dialogue which will allow Benedict College students and the wider community to have full participation,” Benjamin said.

“I want to be clear that the Candidate Forums are hosted by myself and Benedict College. This portion of the weekend is not a 20/20 Presidential Justice Center event,” he added.

Despite that, the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center “maintained a presence there throughout the day,” the Washington Post reported, even tweeting images from Harris’s discussion:"

Meanwhile, a blaze in Northern California wine country exploded in size.

The flames that roared up a steep hillside near the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles’ Brentwood section illustrated the danger the state faces as high winds batter both ends of California and threaten to turn any spark into a devastating inferno.

No deaths from either blaze were reported, but a firefighter was seriously injured in the fire in Sonoma County wine country.

Some 2.2 million people lacked electricity after California’s biggest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, shut it off over the weekend in the northern part of the state to prevent its equipment from sparking blazes during windy weather. More deliberate blackouts are possible in the coming days because another round of strong winds is expected.

The company, which was driven into bankruptcy after its equipment ignited several deadly wildfires in recent years, admitted Monday that despite the outages, its power lines may have started two smaller fires over the weekend in the San Francisco Bay Area.

PG&E also has said its transmission lines may have been responsible for the Sonoma County fire.

That blaze, which broke out last week amid the vineyards and wineries north of San Francisco, doubled in a day to at least 103 square miles (267 square kilometers), destroying 96 buildings, including at least 40 homes, and threatening 80,000 more structures, authorities said.

About 156,000 people were under evacuation orders because of the fire, mostly from the city of Santa Rosa.

The flames didn’t discriminate. In wine country, farmworkers who toil in the vineyards were among those displaced. In Los Angeles, James and former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger were driven from their homes.

“Man these LA (fires) are no joke,” the Los Angeles Lakers star tweeted, using an emoji for the word “fires.” ″Crazy night.”

The Hollywood premiere of Schwarzenegger’s “Terminator: Dark Fate” was canceled Monday night.

Others who own homes in the evacuation zone include Sen. Kamala Harris, a Democrat running for president, who was not home at the time; Walt Disney Co. CEO Bob Iger; and rapper and producer Dr. Dre.

Anxious residents made their way down steep hillsides in the middle of the night in Range Rovers, Teslas and Maseratis. They left behind homes decorated for Halloween — skeletons hanging from homes, goblins sitting on front steps, cobwebs draped over bushes — as a plume of smoke glowed like a giant pumpkin.

David Boyle, 78, awoke at 3 a.m. to his doorbell ringing and police officers pounding on the front door. They warned him the wildfire was advancing toward his house near the Getty complex.

“They said, ‘You need to evacuate.’ I’m like, ‘When?’ They said, ‘Now,’” Doyle said.

He grabbed dog food and his wife’s jewelry and hustled his dogs out the door. They went to a recreation center.

“It’s a fact of life when you live in this area,” he said. “Every place has some problem with disasters. People talk about earthquakes here, but I don’t think it’s as bad as hurricane season.”

Tens of thousands of people were ordered to clear out as the fire spread to more than 600 acres and burned at least five homes, authorities said.

The evacuation area extended west into Pacific Palisades, encompassing some of the most exclusive real estate in California, where celebrities and wealthy professionals live in estates nestled in canyons or on ridgetop retreats that cost tens of millions of dollars but are surrounded by tinder-dry vegetation.

Hours after homes had burned, some of the 1,000-plus firefighters battling the flames were hosing down smoldering ruins. Others attacked flare-ups in the brush-covered wilderness around neighborhoods.

Helicopters beat the air, and the buzz of chain saws echoed from the canyons. Hills were charred black, and in some places, white ash was all that remained.

The fire shut down southbound lanes of Interstate 405, a major commuting corridor and the route to Los Angeles International Airport from the San Fernando Valley.

The Getty, with its collection of priceless art, was not threatened, fire officials said. The museum gave assurances that its artworks are protected by state-of-the-art technology.

But Mount St. Mary’s University evacuated 450 students from its nearby campus. And the University of California, Los Angeles, canceled classes — not because of any direct threat from the flames but because of disruptions caused by the fire.

Similarly in Northern California, some 40 school districts in Sonoma County canceled classes, as did the University of California, Berkeley, which had no power because of the outages.

With no rain and more wind in the forecast, the coming days could be grim.

“This is when we have the most potential for large and damaging fires,” said Thom Porter, chief of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. “All of California is in play right now.”

Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency over the weekend.

The biggest evacuation was in Sonoma County, where some people who packed up and fled had done so two years ago, when devastating wildfires swept through the region, killing 44 people.

At an evacuation center at Napa Valley College, 15-year-old Francisco Alvarado said he, two younger brothers and his parents decided to leave their Calistoga home ahead of evacuation orders. Two years ago, the family had to flee in the middle of the night.

“I’m pretty mad that we have to keep evacuating,” he said. “I just want to be home. I’m trying to leave here tomorrow. I want to sleep in my bed.”"

Sanders, who faced an end-of-summer slump that intensified following the news of his heart attack, is regaining the ground he lost in recent weeks. The news follows a flurry of high profile endorsements from key members of the “Squad” – Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) – and notable Hollywood figures, like notorious anti-Trump filmmaker Michael Moore.

New Hampshire, the first primary state to vote, is one of the most desirable states for the presidential hopefuls, and a survey conducted by the University of New Hampshire indicates that Sanders is back on top.

The University of New Hampshire Survey Center conducted the survey on October 21 – 27, 2019 among 1,266 adults, including “574 likely 2020 Democratic Primary voters and 461 likely 2020 Republican primary voters.”

According to the survey, Sanders leads the pack with 21 percent support, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who falls three points behind with 18 percent support.

Joe Biden (D) comes in third with 15 percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) with ten percent support.

Andrew Yang (D), Sen Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) followed with five percent support each. The remaining candidates garnered three percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.1 percent:

The results coincide with the Morning Consult poll results released this week, which show Sanders tying with Warren nationally and edging her out in early primary states.

The UNHSurveyCenter/CNN poll illustrates a rapidly changing landscape for the top tier of the race.

Sanders has made a noticeable effort to combat concerns over his age and health in recent days.

“I’ve been criticized for being old. I plead guilty. I am old,” Sanders said during a campaign stop in Iowa last week, adding, “But there are advantages to being old.”

Sanders argued that his age proves that the “ideas that I am fighting for now didn’t come to me yesterday.”

“I’ve been on more picket lines, I expect, than all my opponents combined over the last 30 years,” Sanders said.

“Having a long record gives people the understanding that these ideas that I am talking about — they are in my guts. They are in my heart,” he added. “This is who I am as a human being, and it ain’t gonna change.”

Moore, who spoke at a Sanders rally in Queens this month, also defended Sanders’ age and health.

“It’s actually a gift that we have a 78-year-old American running for president of the United States,” Moore said, arguing that the Electoral College – not Sanders – is “too old.”

The Fahrenheit 11/9 director also dismissed concerns surrounding Sanders’ health.

“How about we talk about the health of this planet that’s dying. That’s the health I care about,” Moore added."

Todd Phillip’s R-rated comic-book hit regained the top spot at the weekend box office in its fourth week of release, narrowly besting “Maleficent: Mistress of Evil.” The Warner Bros.′ sensation, starring Joaquin Phoenix, took in $18.9 million in ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.

That came in just above the $18.6 million haul for the Walt Disney Co.’s “Maleficent” sequel, which slid to second after a disappointing No. 1 debut last weekend of $36 million. “Mistress of Evil,” starring Angelina Jolie, is performing better overseas, where it grossed $64.3 million over the weekend.

With such a close race at the top between “Joker” and “Mistress of Evil,” the order could switch when final figures are released Monday.

But ticket sales have continued to surge well past expectations for “Joker.” With a modest budget of $60 million, it’s been extraordinarily profitable for Warner Bros. — although the studio, to mitigate risk, shared costs with Bron Studios and Village Roadshow Pictures.

This week, “Joker” became the most successful R-rated moved ever, not accounting for inflation, in worldwide release. It’s made $849 million globally, including $47.8 million internationally over the weekend. (Mel Gibson’s “The Passion of the Christ” remains the R-rated domestic leader, with $370.8 million.)

Despite mixed reviews, “Joker” — a “Taxi Driver”-styled spin on a comic-book origin story — has already amassed a box-office total exceeding that of more mainstream superhero movies such as “Thor: Ragnarok” and “Wonder Woman.”

No new releases mustered any competition with the holdovers. The best-performing newcomer was the STX Entertainment horror thriller “Countdown.” It grossed $9 million. Sony Screen Gems’ “Black and Blue,” a police thriller starring Naomie Harris, opened with $8.3 million.

Holding especially well was “The Addams Family,” United Artists and MGM’s Halloween-timed animated reboot of the macabre family. It slid just 28% in its second weekend with $11.7 million, good for third place

Much of the weekend’s action was in limited or expanding releases for acclaimed Oscar contenders.

Robert Eggers’ “The Lighthouse,” a black-and-white psychological drama starring Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson as 19th century lighthouse keepers, made $3 million on just 586 screens for A24.

Taika Waititi’s “Jojo Rabbit,” about a 10-year-old boy growing up in Nazi Germany, expanded into 55 theaters, earning a strong $1 million. In September, the Fox Searchlight release won the Toronto Film Festival’s highly predictive audience award , setting it up as a potential Academy Awards favorite. Its initial expansion suggests it will be a hit with audiences, too.

Less successful was the Bruce Springsteen concert film “Western Stars” ($560,000 in 537 theaters).

Alfonso Gomez-Rejon’s “The Current War” also finally landed in theaters more than two years after it first premiered. Gomez-Rejon recut his film after Harvey Weinstein, shortly before his downfall, pushed out a critically panned version of the Thomas Edison (Benedict Cumberbatch) and George Westinghouse (Michael Shannon) tale. Gomez-Rejon’s “director’s cut,” which 101 Studios acquired from the now-defunct Weinstein Co., opened with $2.7 million from about 1,000 theaters.

“Terminator: Dark Fate,” which is expected to lead the box office next weekend, got off to a $12.8 million start in a handful of international markets before its stateside debut.

Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included. Final domestic figures will be released Monday."
