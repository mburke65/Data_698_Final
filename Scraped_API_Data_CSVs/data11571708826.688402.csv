His audience sizes often number just in the double-digits, which could be viewed as a comedown compared to the thousands that were thronging Mr. O’Rourke during his Senate race last year — including one September rally in Austin featuring Willie Nelson that drew upward of 50,000 people. Did he find this contrast deflating, a reporter asked Mr. O’Rourke after a low-key rally at Keene State College in New Hampshire?

“Oh, I’m really grateful to anyone who would forgo a perfectly fine movie or dinner date to spend some time on a Friday night with a candidate for the presidency,” Mr. O’Rourke replied, offering perhaps the only possible answer a politician could give (what candidate would admit to being “deflated?”).

Mr. O’Rourke still manages to project earnestness with his entire body. He keeps casually dropping in his now-signature profanity because, he explained, being polite and restrained “doesn’t always express the anger o r the urgency that I feel.”

His zigzagging trajectory over the last year can be ordered into pronounced phases. Last fall — the peak of his Beto-Mania Phase — ended in a narrow loss to Mr. Cruz. Nevertheless, the hype persisted. “We did not see that coming,” Mr. O’Rourke said of the continued attention, which ushered in a new phase.

Late on election night, a couple of supporters wandered into Mr. O’Rourke’s El Paso home to commiserate. “They were just these drunk dudes in their teens who were bummed out and decided to come to Beto’s house,” Mr. O’Rourke recalled. “They just walked in and were like ‘Hey dude, we’re just so sorry you lost, can I get a selfie with you?’”

“And I was like, ‘Sure, but you can’t just walk into someone’s house like this.’ And they were like ‘Oh, I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry.’”

Mr. O’Rourke nursed his defeat, set out on a road trip and went to the dentist, live-streaming as he went. He decided to run for president. From the outset, the enterprise seemed to lack definition. He was outshone and overtaken in a crowded field of movement progressives (Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren), an established elder (Joe Biden) and new faces (Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris) who seemed brighter than last year’s meteor. He came off shaky and overwhelmed in the first two debates. Beto-mania 2018 seemed far away."

“My first year, I said, ‘This is what I should be doing,’” Bochy said last Wednesday on the bench before his 2,000th career victory that night. “I loved it. Not that I thought I was any good at it, but I wanted to get better at it.”

Bochy was born in Landes de Bussac , France; his father , Gus, was a sergeant major in the United States Army. The family — with three boys and a girl — moved often, including spending about three years in the Panama Canal Zone. Bochy would play sports with his brother Joe, older by three and a half years, and Joe’s friends.

“Our father believed that listening was a great leadership skill, and you didn’t want to be a follower growing up,” said Joe Bochy, who is also retiring this year from a scouting job with the Giants. “You wanted to hang around people smarter than you so you could learn.”

Gus Bochy grew up as a switch-hitting shortstop and filled the home with baseball broadcasts on Armed Forces Radio. He made his sons catchers because they were slow; he would joke that they inherited their lack of speed from their mother, Rose, who once filled in as coach for the Little League team and ran drills when Joe was gone.

Bochy reached the majors with Houston in 1978 , then played briefly for the Mets in 1982 before five seasons with the Padres. He played in two postseason games : in the 1980 National League Championship Series, when the Phillies’ Pete Rose knocked him over with a forearm to the face at the Astrodome (Bochy got right up), and in the 1984 World Series at Tiger Stadium, when Bochy singled in his only at-bat.

That appearance came in the last inning of the series, a sentimental gesture from the Padres’ gruff manager, Dick Williams. Bochy had a gentler personality, and General Manager Jack McKeon — who was also a longtime manager — kept him in the organization after his final season in the minors in 1988."

For the first time in The Register’s poll this year, Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, at 22 percent support, led Mr. Biden, who the survey found was the first choice of 20 percent of would-be caucusgoers. Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, placed third, at 11 percent, with Mr. Buttigieg at 9 percent and Ms. Harris at 6 percent.

“This is the first major shake-up” of the race, The Register’s pollster, Ann Selzer, told the paper.

The poll found that just one in five likely caucusgoers said they had made up their minds, and 63 percent could still be persuaded to shift their support to someone else.

Ms. Klobuchar, of Minnesota, who was tied for sixth in the poll, said after presiding over the opening of a new campaign office on Friday in Cedar Rapids that there might be more than twice as many tickets out of Iowa as usual.

“You could be No. 6,” Ms. Klobuchar said before the poll results were announced. “I’m really serious, in a 20-person field and people will go, ‘Not bad.’ They’re going to look at who is in the top eight.”

Mr. Buttigieg predicted a smaller number of candidates would survive Iowa.

“I don’t know how many people can emerge, I think that comes down to how many people voters can keep track of,” he said. “I’d be shocked if it’s more than five.”"

In Wilmington, Del., Tuesday, Mr. Biden called the president’s actions an “abuse of power’’ that undermined national security, and said he would support impeachment if Mr. Trump did not provide information related to congressional investigations.

In some respects, Mr. Trump’s conduct has reinforced the central message of Mr. Biden’s appeal to Democratic voters: that the country is threatened by an out-of-control presidency, and that ousting Mr. Trump is more important than any other policy goal Democrats might share.

At fund-raisers and other events, Democrats who have spoken with Mr. Biden in recent days say he has largely appeared measured, greeting old friends in his typical effusive style and keeping the focus on his concerns with Mr. Trump’s foreign policy, rather than dwelling on the challenges the moment raises for his family.

Still unclear in this moment of crisis is what conclusions Democratic voters might make about Mr. Biden as an opponent for Mr. Trump, and how a drive for impeachment in Congress might shape the Democratic primary campaign.

To the Editor:

I find it interesting that someone like Imani Perry, who is considered a scholar, would describe Jane Austen’s novels as literature for “parlor people” (By the Book, Sept. 15). In academic circles, Austen is considered a classic, along with Dickens, Hardy and others. She also has quite a lot to say to modern society about manners, behavior toward others, empathy, ethics and other civilized subjects that seem to have fallen out of favor.

Unfortunately, many of today’s writers have more in common with psychiatrists, preferring, it seems, to publish depressing, despairing downers in the name of literature. They appear to be more concerned with mental anguish than with telling a good story with good characters.

Jane Austen wrote about more than her own time; her books remain popular because she describes human beings for all time.

I couldn’t agree more with Professor Perry. I have enjoyed pull quotes from Henry James and Jane Austen, but reading their prose — forget about it! Perry’s description of it as “parlor” literature is so apt. Her remarks confirmed my instincts."

To the Editor:

I find it interesting that someone like Imani Perry, who is considered a scholar, would describe Jane Austen’s novels as literature for “parlor people” (By the Book, Sept. 15). In academic circles, Austen is considered a classic, along with Dickens, Hardy and others. She also has quite a lot to say to modern society about manners, behavior toward others, empathy, ethics and other civilized subjects that seem to have fallen out of favor.

Unfortunately, many of today’s writers have more in common with psychiatrists, preferring, it seems, to publish depressing, despairing downers in the name of literature. They appear to be more concerned with mental anguish than with telling a good story with good characters.

Jane Austen wrote about more than her own time; her books remain popular because she describes human beings for all time.

I couldn’t agree more with Professor Perry. I have enjoyed pull quotes from Henry James and Jane Austen, but reading their prose — forget about it! Perry’s description of it as “parlor” literature is so apt. Her remarks confirmed my instincts."

The mandate: Find out whether he was trying to recruit colleagues to his new employer, UBS Group AG.

On Sept. 17, Mr. Khan spotted the investigator, people briefed on the events said, triggering a scandal that followed months of tensions between the banker and his former mentor, Credit Suisse Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam.

The clash has captivated Zurich’s buttoned-up banking community, dominated Swiss tabloids and embarrassed Credit Suisse, a global bank and wealth manager. It is also unsettling employees, some who say they are spooked by the idea the bank is tailing executives, a practice lawyers say is rare.

The episode comes four years into Mr. Thiam’s tenure, during which the bank’s share price has roughly halved as he streamlines the investment bank and battles to manage more money for the world’s wealthy. Investors and analysts have largely welcomed these efforts.

Mr. Thiam and Credit Suisse’s board now face pressure to justify the botched monitoring of Mr. Khan.

Findings of a bank-commissioned review of its surveillance are expected early next week and could lead to departures depending on how the monitoring unfolded, according to people familiar with the probe.

In a staff memo Monday, Mr. Thiam and Chairman Urs Rohner said they are confident “the truth will emerge.”

A spokesman for Mr. Khan said it is “totally absurd” to suggest he was trying to poach staff. Other details are also in dispute, including whether Credit Suisse misled Mr. Khan about its surveillance when he reported it. That is one focus of the bank’s probe, according to people briefed on the process.

“It’s quite a soap opera, and a distraction,” said David Herro, international chief investment officer of Chicago-based Harris Associates LP. Harris is Credit Suisse’s biggest shareholder, with a holding of 8.1%.

However, Mr. Herro said as long as Credit Suisse acted lawfully for valid reasons, he supports its management. “A company we invest in has a responsibility to us and all stakeholders to protect the company’s assets.”

Mr. Thiam, a former McKinsey & Co. consultant and government minister in his native Ivory Coast, joined Credit Suisse in 2015 after a strong run heading U.K. insurer Prudential PLC.

Mr. Khan, also a former management consultant, and auditor, joined Credit Suisse in 2013 as wealth-management finance chief. In 2015, Mr. Thiam promoted him to run the expanded international wealth-management unit, and praised his results.

Over time, the warm relationship turned frosty as Mr. Khan’s ambitions grew, the people familiar with the matter said. Those tensions rose when Mr. Khan and his family redeveloped a house next to Mr. Thiam’s in an exclusive neighborhood near Lake Zurich, they said.

At a party in January at Mr. Thiam’s home, Mr. Khan spoke with Mr. Thiam’s girlfriend about some trees on the Thiam property. The discussion got heated. Mr. Thiam scolded Mr. Khan for what he perceived as rude behavior, according to the people familiar with the matter.

In March, Reuters reported Mr. Khan was being considered for the top job at a smaller rival, Julius Baer Group Ltd. Mr. Khan didn’t publicly deny he was a candidate. This stoked perceptions internally that he was seeking more power or could be poised to leave. He went on to have informal discussions about potential roles at other banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., according to people familiar with the matter.

Without Mr. Thiam’s involvement, Mr. Khan was negotiating an exit with Mr. Rohner, the chairman, on terms that would let him jump to a competitor after just three months, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Khan’s stated notice period had been six months, with up to a year-long noncompete agreement, according to the bank’s annual report.

On July 1, Credit Suisse announced Mr. Khan’s departure. Mr. Thiam wished him well. In late August, UBS said it was hiring him to co-head its wealth management arm, sparking speculation that he could be in contention eventually to succeed CEO Sergio Ermotti. He starts Oct. 1.

UBS Chairman Axel Weber told Bloomberg TV this week the dust-up was a matter between Mr. Khan and Credit Suisse.

After UBS made the hire, Credit Suisse executives worried staff might follow Mr. Khan to its larger rival. The bank’s probe is looking into whether it had evidence of such discussions between Mr. Khan and his former colleagues before it decided to tail him.

A close lieutenant of Mr. Thiam, chief operating officer Pierre-Olivier Bouée, hired a Zurich security agency, Investigo GmbH, according to a person familiar with the mandate. Investigo’s brief was to follow Mr. Khan and take photos of anyone he met, while keeping his distance and operating lawfully, according to a statement Investigo gave to Credit Suisse and Swiss authorities.

The investigator followed Mr. Khan for roughly a week before his cover was blown.

SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS If Credit Suisse had reason to believe a departing executive was planning to poach employees, do you think it was appropriate for the bank to spy on him? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.

A person answering the phone at Investigo referred questions to a lawyer. That lawyer and Mr. Bouée didn’t respond to requests for comment.

On Sept. 17, Mr. Khan, while out shopping with his wife, realized his car was being followed, a person briefed on the events said. He parked, and took out his phone to take photos of the other car and its driver, according to the person and the Investigo statement. Shaken, Mr. Khan called Credit Suisse security. That conversation is a subject of the inquiry, according to people familiar with the matter.

In a twist, Mr. Khan then had Credit Suisse security personnel stationed at his home, a service the bank provides if employees feel threatened, the people said. It is unclear how long the security was there.

The executive also contacted the police and made a complaint, leading to “temporary arrests,” a spokesman for the Zurich public prosecutor’s office said. The spokesman declined to provide further details, citing a continuing investigation.

Criminals are increasingly “going dark” to hide their tracks. They are using virtual private networks to mask their locations; deploying encryption techniques to obscure their messages and make their hard drives impenetrable; and posting on the so-called dark web, the vast underbelly of the internet, which is inaccessible to conventional browsers.

As the technologies lower people’s inhibitions, online groups are sharing images of younger children and more extreme forms of abuse.

“Historically, you would never have gone to a black market shop and asked, ‘I want real hard-core with 3-year-olds,’” said Yolanda Lippert, a prosecutor in Illinois who leads a team investigating online child abuse. “But now you can sit seemingly secure on your device searching for this stuff, trading for it.”

Lawmakers foresaw the crisis years ago, but enforcement has fallen short

Congress passed a landmark law in 2008 that foresaw many of today’s problems, but The Times found that the federal government had not fulfilled major aspects of the legislation. Annual funding for state and regional investigations was authorized at $60 million, but only about half of that is regularly approved.

Senator Richard Blumenthal, a sponsor of the law’s reauthorization, said there was “no adequate or logical explanation and no excuse” for why more money was not allocated. Even $60 million a year, he said, would now be “vastly inadequate.”

Another cornerstone of the law, biennial strategy reports by the Justice Department, was mostly ignored. And although a senior executive-level official was to oversee the federal response at the Justice Department, that has not happened.

The Justice Department’s coordinator for child exploitation prevention, Stacie B. Harris, said she could not explain the poor record. A spokeswoman for the department, citing limited resources, said the reports would now be written every four years beginning in 2020.

Law enforcement agencies are struggling to keep up

With so many reports of the images coming their way, police departments across the country are besieged. Some have managed their workload by focusing efforts on imagery depicting the youngest, most vulnerable victims.

“We go home and think, ‘Good grief, the fact that we have to prioritize by age is just really disturbing,’” said Detective Paula Meares, who has investigated child sex crimes for more than 10 years at the Los Angeles Police Department.

About one of every 10 agents in Homeland Security’s investigative section is assigned to child sexual exploitation cases, officials said, a clear indication of how big the problem is.

“We could double our numbers and still be getting crushed,” said Jonathan Hendrix, a Homeland Security agent who investigates cases in Nashville."

Last year, tech companies reported over 45 million online photos and videos of children being sexually abused — more than double what they found the previous year.

Online predators create and share the illegal material, which is increasingly cloaked by technology. Tech companies, the government and the authorities are no match.

The images are horrific. Children, some just 3 or 4 years old, being sexually abused and in some cases tortured.

Pictures of child sexual abuse have long been produced and shared to satisfy twisted adult obsessions. But it has never been like this: Technology companies reported a record 45 million online photos and videos of the abuse last year.

More than a decade ago, when the reported number was less than a million, the proliferation of the explicit imagery had already reached a crisis point. Tech companies, law enforcement agencies and legislators in Washington responded, committing to new measures meant to rein in the scourge. Landmark legislation passed in 2008.

Yet the explosion in detected content kept growing — exponentially.

Exploited Articles in this series examine the explosion in online photos and videos of children being sexually abused. They include graphic descriptions of some instances of the abuse.

An investigation by The New York Times found an insatiable criminal underworld that had exploited the flawed and insufficient efforts to contain it. As with hate speech and terrorist propaganda, many tech companies failed to adequately police sexual abuse imagery on their platforms, or failed to cooperate sufficiently with the authorities when they found it.

Law enforcement agencies devoted to the problem were left understaffed and underfunded, even as they were asked to handle far larger caseloads.

The Justice Department, given a major role by Congress, neglected even to write mandatory monitoring reports, nor did it appoint a senior executive-level official to lead a crackdown. And the group tasked with serving as a federal clearinghouse for the imagery — the go-between for the tech companies and the authorities — was ill equipped for the expanding demands.

A paper recently published in conjunction with that group, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, described a system at “a breaking point,” with reports of abusive images “exceeding the capabilities of independent clearinghouses and law enforcement to take action.” It suggested that future advancements in machine learning might be the only way to catch up with the criminals.

In 1998, there were over 3,000 reports of child sexual abuse imagery. Just over a decade later, yearly reports soared past 100,000. In 2014, that number surpassed 1 million for the first time. Last year, there were 18.4 million, more than one-third of the total ever reported. Those reports included over 45 million images and videos flagged as child sexual abuse. By Rich Harris | Source: The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children

The Times reviewed over 10,000 pages of police and court documents; conducted software tests to assess the availability of the imagery through search engines; accompanied detectives on raids; and spoke with investigators, lawmakers, tech executives and government officials. The reporting included conversations with an admitted pedophile who concealed his identity using encryption software and who runs a site that has hosted as many as 17,000 such images.

In interviews, victims across the United States described in heart-wrenching detail how their lives had been upended by the abuse. Children, raped by relatives and strangers alike, being told it was normal. Adults, now years removed from their abuse, still living in fear of being recognized from photos and videos on the internet. And parents of the abused, struggling to cope with the guilt of not having prevented it and their powerlessness over stopping its online spread.

Many of the survivors and their families said their view of humanity had been inextricably changed by the crimes themselves and the online demand for images of them.

“I don’t really know how to deal with it,” said one woman who, at age 11, had been filmed being sexually assaulted by her father. “You’re just trying to feel O.K. and not let something like this define your whole life. But the thing with the pictures is — that’s the thing that keeps this alive.”

The Times’s reporting revealed a problem global in scope — most of the images found last year were traced to other countries — but one firmly rooted in the United States because of the central role Silicon Valley has played in facilitating the imagery’s spread and in reporting it to the authorities.

While the material, commonly known as child pornography, predates the digital era, smartphone cameras, social media and cloud storage have allowed the images to multiply at an alarming rate. Both recirculated and new images occupy all corners of the internet, including a range of platforms as diverse as Facebook Messenger, Microsoft’s Bing search engine and the storage service Dropbox.

In a particularly disturbing trend, online groups are devoting themselves to sharing images of younger children and more extreme forms of abuse. The groups use encrypted technologies and the dark web, the vast underbelly of the internet, to teach pedophiles how to carry out the crimes and how to record and share images of the abuse worldwide. In some online forums, children are forced to hold up signs with the name of the group or other identifying information to prove the images are fresh.

To report online child sexual abuse, contact the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children at 1-800-843-5678.

With so many reports of the abuse coming their way, law enforcement agencies across the country said they were often besieged. Some have managed their online workload by focusing on imagery depicting the youngest victims.

“We go home and think, ‘Good grief, the fact that we have to prioritize by age is just really disturbing,’” said Detective Paula Meares, who has investigated child sex crimes for more than 10 years at the Los Angeles Police Department.

In some sense, increased detection of the spiraling problem is a sign of progress. Tech companies are legally required to report images of child abuse only when they discover them; they are not required to look for them.

After years of uneven monitoring of the material, several major tech companies, including Facebook and Google, stepped up surveillance of their platforms. In interviews, executives with some companies pointed to the voluntary monitoring and the spike in reports as indications of their commitment to addressing the problem.

But police records and emails, as well as interviews with nearly three dozen local, state and federal law enforcement officials, show that some tech companies still fall short. It can take weeks or months for them to respond to questions from the authorities, if they respond at all. Sometimes they respond only to say they have no records, even for reports they initiated.

And when tech companies cooperate fully, encryption and anonymization can create digital hiding places for perpetrators. Facebook announced in March plans to encrypt Messenger, which last year was responsible for nearly 12 million of the 18.4 million worldwide reports of child sexual abuse material, according to people familiar with the reports. Reports to the authorities typically contain more than one image, and last year encompassed the record 45 million photos and videos, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

All the while, criminals continue to trade and stockpile caches of the material.

The law Congress passed in 2008 foresaw many of today’s problems, but The Times found that the federal government had not fulfilled major aspects of the legislation.

The Justice Department has produced just two of six required reports that are meant to compile data about internet crimes against children and set goals to eliminate them, and there has been a constant churn of short-term appointees leading the department’s efforts. The first person to hold the position, Francey Hakes, said it was clear from the outset that no one “felt like the position was as important as it was written by Congress to be.”

The federal government has also not lived up to the law’s funding goals, severely crippling efforts to stamp out the activity.

Congress has regularly allocated about half of the $60 million in yearly funding for state and local law enforcement efforts. Separately, the Department of Homeland Security this year diverted nearly $6 million from its cybercrimes units to immigration enforcement — depleting 40 percent of the units’ discretionary budget until the final month of the fiscal year.

Alicia Kozakiewicz, who was abducted by a man she had met on the internet when she was 13, said the lack of follow-through was disheartening. Now an advocate for laws preventing crimes against children, she had testified in support of the 2008 legislation.

“I remember looking around the room, and there wasn’t a dry eye,” said Ms. Kozakiewicz, 31, who had told of being chained, raped and beaten while her kidnapper live-streamed the abuse on the internet. “The federal bill passed, but it wasn’t funded. So it didn’t mean anything.”

Further impairing the federal response are shortcomings at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which reviews reports it receives and then distributes them to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, as well as international partners.

The nonprofit center has relied in large measure on 20-year-old technology, has difficulty keeping experienced engineers on staff and, by its own reckoning, regards stopping the online distribution of photos and videos secondary to rescuing children.

“To be honest, it’s a resource and volume issue,” said John Shehan, a vice president at the center, which was established 35 years ago to track missing children. “First priority is making sure we’re assessing the risk of the children. We’re getting this information into the hands of law enforcement.”

Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat from Florida who was an author of the 2008 law, said in an interview that she was unaware of the extent of the federal government’s failures. After being briefed on The Times’s findings, she sent a letter to Attorney General William Barr requesting an accounting.

Stacie B. Harris, the Justice Department’s coordinator over the past year for combating child exploitation, said the problem was systemic, extending well beyond the department and her tenure there. “We are trying to play catch-up because we know that this is a huge, huge problem,” said Ms. Harris, an associate deputy attorney general.

The fallout for law enforcement, in some instances, has been crushing.

When reviewing tips from the national center, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has narrowed its focus to images of infants and toddlers. And about one of every 10 agents in Homeland Security’s investigative section — which deals with all kinds of threats, including terrorism — is now assigned to child sexual exploitation cases.

“We could double our numbers and still be getting crushed,” said Jonathan Hendrix, a Homeland Security agent who investigates cases in Nashville.

The Cutting Edge

The videos found on the computer of an Ohio man were described by investigators as among “the most gruesome and violent images of child pornography.”

One showed a woman orally forcing herself on a girl who was then held upside down by the ankles in a bathroom while “another child urinates” on her face, according to court documents.

Another showed a woman “inserting an ice cube into the vagina” of a young girl, the documents said, before tying her ankles together, taping her mouth shut and suspending her upside down. As the video continued, the girl was beaten, slapped and burned with a match or candle.

“The predominant sound is the child screaming and crying,” according to a federal agent quoted in the documents.

The videos were stored in a hidden computer file and had also been encrypted, one common way abusive imagery has been able to race across the internet with impunity.

Increasingly, criminals are using advanced technologies like encryption to stay ahead of the police. In this case, the Ohio man, who helped run a website on the dark web known as the Love Zone, had over 3 million photos and videos on his computers.

The site, now shuttered, had nearly 30,000 members and required them to share images of abuse to maintain good standing, according to the court documents. A private section of the forum was available only to members who shared imagery of children they abused themselves. They were known as “producers.”

Multiple police investigations over the past few years have broken up enormous dark web forums, including one known as Child’s Play that was reported to have had over a million user accounts.

The highly skilled perpetrators often taunt the authorities with their technical skills, acting boldly because they feel protected by the cover of darkness.

“People who traffic in child exploitation materials are on the cutting edge of technology,” said Susan Hennessey, a former lawyer at the National Security Agency who researches cybersecurity at the Brookings Institution.

Offenders can cover their tracks by connecting to virtual private networks, which mask their locations; deploying encryption techniques, which can hide their messages and make their hard drives impenetrable; and posting on the dark web, which is inaccessible to conventional browsers.

The anonymity offered by the sites emboldens members to post images of very young children being sexually abused, and in increasingly extreme and violent forms.

“Historically, you would never have gone to a black market shop and asked, ‘I want real hard-core with 3-year-olds,’” said Yolanda Lippert, a prosecutor in Cook County, Ill., who leads a team investigating online child abuse. “But now you can sit seemingly secure on your device searching for this stuff, trading for it.”

Exhibits in the case of the Love Zone, sealed by the court but released by a judge after a request by The Times, include screenshots showing the forum had dedicated areas where users discussed ways to remain “safe” while posting and downloading the imagery. Tips included tutorials on how to encrypt and share material without being detected by the authorities.

The offender in Ohio, a site administrator named Jason Gmoser, “went to great lengths to hide” his conduct, according to the documents. Testimony in his criminal case revealed that it would have taken the authorities “trillions of years” to crack the 41-character password he had used to encrypt the site. He eventually turned it over to investigators, and was sentenced to life in prison in 2016.

The site was run by a number of men, including Brian Davis, a worker at a child day care center in Illinois who admitted to documenting abuse of his own godson and more than a dozen other children — aged 3 months to 8 years — and sharing images of the assaults with other members. Mr. Davis made over 400 posts on the site. One image showed him orally raping a 2-year-old; another depicted a man raping an infant’s anus.

Mr. Davis, who was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2016, said that “capturing the abuse on video was part of the excitement,” according to court records.

Some of his victims attended the court proceedings and submitted statements about their continuing struggles with the abuse.

‘Truly Terrible Things’

The surge in criminal activity on the dark web accounted for only a fraction of the 18.4 million reports of abuse last year. That number originates almost entirely with tech companies based in the United States.

The companies have known for years that their platforms were being co-opted by predators, but many of them essentially looked the other way, according to interviews and emails detailing the companies’ activities. And while many companies have made recent progress in identifying the material, they were slow to respond.

Hemanshu Nigam, a former federal prosecutor in cybercrime and child exploitation cases, said it was clear more than two decades ago that new technologies had created the biggest boon for pedophiles since the Polaroid camera.

The recent surge by tech companies in filing reports of online abuse “wouldn’t exist if they did their job then,” said Mr. Nigam, who now runs a cybersecurity consulting firm and previously held top security roles at Microsoft, Myspace and News Corporation.

Hany Farid, who worked with Microsoft to develop technology in 2009 for detecting child sexual abuse material, said tech companies had been reluctant for years to dig too deeply.

“The companies knew the house was full of roaches, and they were scared to turn the lights on,” he said. “And then when they did turn the lights on, it was worse than they thought.”

Federal law requires companies to preserve material about their reports of abuse imagery for 90 days. But given the overwhelming number of reports, it is not uncommon for requests from the authorities to reach companies too late.

“That’s a huge issue for us,” said Capt. Mike Edwards, a Seattle police commander who oversees a cybercrimes unit for the State of Washington. “You’ve got a short period of time to be able to get the data if it was preserved.”

Most tech companies have been quick to respond to urgent inquiries, but responses in other cases vary significantly. In interviews, law enforcement officials pointed to Tumblr, a blogging and social networking site with 470 million users, as one of the most problematic companies.

Police officers in Missouri, New Jersey, Texas and Wisconsin lamented Tumblr’s poor response to requests, with one officer describing the issues as “long-term and ongoing” in an internal document.

A recent investigation in Polk County, Wis., that included an image of a man orally raping a young child stalled for over a year. The investigator retired before Tumblr responded to numerous emails requesting information.

In a 2016 Wisconsin case, Tumblr alerted a person who had uploaded explicit images that the account had been referred to the authorities, a practice that a former employee told The Times had been common for years. The tip allowed the man to destroy evidence on his electronic devices, the police said.

A spokeswoman for Verizon said that Tumblr prioritized time-sensitive cases, which delayed other responses. Since Verizon acquired the company in 2017, the spokeswoman said, its practice was not to alert users of police requests for data. Verizon recently sold Tumblr to the web development company Automattic.

The law enforcement officials also pointed to problems with Microsoft’s Bing search engine, and Snap, the parent company of the social network Snapchat.

Bing was said to regularly submit reports that lacked essential information, making investigations difficult, if not impossible. Snapchat, a platform especially popular with young people, is engineered to delete most of its content within a short period of time. According to law enforcement, when requests are made to the company, Snap often replies that it has no additional information.

A Microsoft spokesman said that the company had only limited information about offenders using the search engine, and that it was cooperating as best as it could. A Snap spokesman said the company preserved data in compliance with the law.

Data obtained through a public records request suggests Facebook’s plans to encrypt Messenger in the coming years will lead to vast numbers of images of child abuse going undetected. The data shows that WhatsApp, the company’s encrypted messaging app, submits only a small fraction of the reports Messenger does.

Facebook has long known about abusive images on its platforms, including a video of a man sexually assaulting a 6-year-old that went viral last year on Messenger. When Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, announced in March that Messenger would move to encryption, he acknowledged the risk it presented for “truly terrible things like child exploitation.”

“Encryption is a powerful tool for privacy,” he said, “but that includes the privacy of people doing bad things.”

‘Vastly Inadequate’

“In a recent case, an offender filmed himself drugging the juice boxes of neighborhood children before tricking them into drinking the mix,” said Special Agent Flint Waters, a criminal investigator for the State of Wyoming. “He then filmed himself as he sexually abused unconscious children.”

Mr. Waters, appearing before Congress in Washington, was describing what he said “we see every day.”

He went on to present a map of the United States covered with red dots, each representing a computer used to share images of child sex abuse. Fewer than two percent of the crimes would be investigated, he predicted. “We are overwhelmed, we are underfunded and we are drowning in the tidal wave of tragedy,” he said.

Mr. Waters’s testimony was delivered 12 years ago — in 2007.

The following year, Congress passed legislation that acknowledged the severity of the crisis. But then the federal government largely moved on. Some of the strongest provisions of the law were not fulfilled, and many problems went unfixed, according to interviews and government documents.

Today, Mr. Waters’s testimony offers a haunting reminder of time lost.

Annual funding for state and regional investigations was authorized at $60 million, but only about half of that is regularly approved. It has increased only slightly from 10 years ago when accounting for inflation. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat of Connecticut who was a sponsor of the law’s reauthorization, said there was “no adequate or logical explanation and no excuse” for why more money was not allocated. Even $60 million a year, he said, would now be “vastly inadequate.”

Another cornerstone of the law, the biennial strategy reports by the Justice Department, was mostly ignored. Even the most recent of the two reports that were published, in 2010 and 2016, did not include data about some of the most pressing concerns, such as the trade in illicit imagery.

The Justice Department’s coordinator for child exploitation prevention, Ms. Harris, said she could not explain the poor record. A spokeswoman for the department, citing limited resources, said the reports would now be written every four years beginning in 2020.

When the law was reauthorized in 2012, the coordinator role was supposed to be elevated to a senior executive position with broad authority. That has not happened. “This is supposed to be the quarterback,” said Ms. Wasserman Schultz, one of the provision’s authors.

Even when the Justice Department has been publicly called out for ignoring provisions of the law, there has been little change.

In 2011, the Government Accountability Office reported that no steps had been taken to research which online offenders posed a high risk to children, and that the Justice Department had not submitted a progress assessment to Congress, both requirements of the law.

At the time, the department said it did not have enough funding to undertake the research and had no “time frame” for submitting a report. Today, the provisions remain largely unfulfilled.

The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which testified in favor of the 2008 law, has also struggled with demands to contain the spread of the imagery.

Founded in 1984 after the well-publicized kidnapping and murder of a 6-year-old Florida boy, Adam Walsh, the center has been closely affiliated with the federal government since the Reagan administration.

But as child exploitation has grown on the internet, the center has not kept up. The technology it uses for receiving and reviewing reports of the material was created in 1998, nearly a decade before the first iPhone was released. To perform key upgrades and help modernize the system, the group has relied on donations from tech companies like Palantir and Google.

The center has said it intends to make significant improvements to its technology starting in 2020, but the problems don’t stop there. The police complain that the most urgent reports are not prioritized, or are sent to the wrong department completely.

“We’re spending a tremendous amount of time having to go through those and reanalyze them ourselves,” said Captain Edwards, the Seattle police official.

In a statement, the national center said it did its best to route reports to the correct jurisdiction.

Despite its mandate by Congress, the center is not subject to public records laws and operates with little transparency. It repeatedly denied requests from The Times for quarterly and annual reports submitted to the Justice Department, as well as for tallies of imagery reports submitted by individual tech companies.

Mr. Shehan, the vice president, said such disclosures might discourage tech companies from cooperating with the center. He said the numbers could be misinterpreted.

The Times found that there was a close relationship between the center and Silicon Valley that raised questions about good governance practices. For example, the center receives both money and in-kind donations from tech companies, while employees of the same companies are sometimes members of its board. Google alone has donated nearly $4 million in the past decade, according to public testimony.

A spokeswoman for the center said it was common to expect corporations to provide financial assistance to charities. But the practice, others working in the area of child protection say, could elevate the interests of the tech companies above the children’s.

“There’s an inherent conflict in accepting money from these companies when they also sit on your board,” said Signy Arnason, who is a top executive at the equivalent organization in Canada, known as the Canadian Center for Child Protection.

This close relationship with tech companies may ultimately be in jeopardy. In 2016, a federal court held that the national center, though private, qualified legally as a government entity because it performed a number of essential government functions.

If that view gains traction, Fourth Amendment challenges about searches and seizures by the government could change how the center operates and how tech companies find and remove illegal imagery on their platforms. Under those circumstances, if they were to collaborate too closely with the center, the companies fear, they could also be viewed as government actors, not private entities, subjecting them to new legal requirements and court challenges when they police their own sites.

An Ugly Mirror

It was a sunny afternoon in July, and an unmarked police van in Salt Lake City was parked outside a pink stucco house. Garden gnomes and a heart-shaped “Welcome Friends” sign decorated the front yard.

At the back of the van, a man who lived in the house was seated in a cramped interrogation area, while officers cataloged hard drives and sifted through web histories from his computers.

The man had shared sexually explicit videos online, the police said, including one of a 10-year-old boy being “orally sodomized” by a man, and another of a man forcing two young boys to engage in anal intercourse.

“The sad thing is that’s pretty tame compared to what we’ve seen,” said Chief Jessica Farnsworth, an official with the Utah attorney general’s office who led a raid of the house. The victims have not been identified or rescued.

The year was barely half over, and Chief Farnsworth’s team had already conducted about 150 such raids across Utah. The specially trained group, one of 61 nationwide, coordinates state and regional responses to internet crimes against children.

The Utah group expects to arrest nearly twice as many people this year as last year for crimes related to child sexual abuse material, but federal funding has not kept pace with the surge. Funding for the 61 task forces from 2010 to 2018 remained relatively flat, federal data shows, while the number of leads referred to them increased by more than 400 percent.

Much of the federal money goes toward training new staff members because the cases take a heavy emotional and psychological toll on investigators, resulting in constant turnover.

“I thought that I was in the underbelly of society — until I came here,” said Ms. Lippert, the prosecutor with the task force in Illinois, who had worked for years at a busy Chicago courthouse.

While any child at imminent risk remains a priority, the volume of work has also forced the task forces to make difficult choices. Some have focused on the youngest and most vulnerable victims, while others have cut back on undercover operations, including infiltrating chat rooms and online forums.

“I think some of the bigger fish who are out there are staying out there,” Ms. Lippert said.

The internet is well known as a haven for hate speech, terrorism-related content and criminal activity, all of which have raised alarms and spurred public debate and action.

But the problem of child sexual abuse imagery faces a particular hurdle: It gets scant attention because few people want to confront the enormity and horror of the content, or they wrongly dismiss it as primarily teenagers sending inappropriate selfies.

Some state lawmakers, judges and members of Congress have refused to discuss the problem in detail, or have avoided attending meetings and hearings when it was on the agenda, according to interviews with law enforcement officials and victims.

Steven J. Grocki, who leads a group of policy experts and lawyers at the child exploitation section of the Justice Department, said the reluctance to address the issue went beyond elected officials and was a societal problem. “They turn away from it because it’s too ugly of a mirror,” he said.

Yet the material is everywhere, and ever more available.

“I think that people were always there, but the access is so easy,” said Lt. John Pizzuro, a task force commander in New Jersey. “You got nine million people in the state of New Jersey. Based upon statistics, we can probably arrest 400,000 people.”

Common language about the abuse can also minimize the harm in people’s minds. While the imagery is often defined as “child pornography” in state and federal laws, experts prefer terms like child sexual abuse imagery or child exploitation material to underscore the seriousness of the crimes and to avoid conflating it with adult pornography, which is legal for people over 18.

“Each and every image is a depiction of a crime in progress,” said Sgt. Jeff Swanson, a task force commander in Kansas. “The violence inflicted on these kids is unimaginable.”"

Criminals are increasingly “going dark” to hide their tracks. They are using virtual private networks to mask their locations; deploying encryption techniques to obscure their messages and make their hard drives impenetrable; and posting on the so-called dark web, the vast underbelly of the internet, which is inaccessible to conventional browsers.

As the technologies lower people’s inhibitions, online groups are sharing images of younger children and more extreme forms of abuse.

“Historically, you would never have gone to a black market shop and asked, ‘I want real hard-core with 3-year-olds,’” said Yolanda Lippert, a prosecutor in Illinois who leads a team investigating online child abuse. “But now you can sit seemingly secure on your device searching for this stuff, trading for it.”

With so many reports of the images coming their way, police departments across the country are besieged. Some have managed their workload by focusing efforts on imagery depicting the youngest, most vulnerable victims.

“We go home and think, ‘Good grief, the fact that we have to prioritize by age is just really disturbing,’” said Detective Paula Meares, who has investigated child sex crimes for more than 10 years at the Los Angeles Police Department.

About one of every 10 agents in Homeland Security’s investigative section is assigned to child sexual exploitation cases, officials said, a clear indication of how big the problem is.

Pictures of child sexual abuse have long been produced and shared to satisfy twisted adult obsessions. But it has never been like this: Technology companies reported a record 45 million online photos and videos of the abuse last year.

More than a decade ago, when the reported number was less than a million, the proliferation of the explicit imagery had already reached a crisis point. Tech companies, law enforcement agencies and legislators in Washington responded, committing to new measures meant to rein in the scourge. Landmark legislation passed in 2008.

Yet the explosion in detected content kept growing — exponentially.

Exploited Articles in this series examine the explosion in online photos and videos of children being sexually abused. They include graphic descriptions of some instances of the abuse.

An investigation by The New York Times found an insatiable criminal underworld that had exploited the flawed and insufficient efforts to contain it. As with hate speech and terrorist propaganda, many tech companies failed to adequately police sexual abuse imagery on their platforms, or failed to cooperate sufficiently with the authorities when they found it.

Law enforcement agencies devoted to the problem were left understaffed and underfunded, even as they were asked to handle far larger caseloads.

The Justice Department, given a major role by Congress, neglected even to write mandatory monitoring reports, nor did it appoint a senior executive-level official to lead a crackdown. And the group tasked with serving as a federal clearinghouse for the imagery — the go-between for the tech companies and the authorities — was ill equipped for the expanding demands.

A paper recently published in conjunction with that group, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, described a system at “a breaking point,” with reports of abusive images “exceeding the capabilities of independent clearinghouses and law enforcement to take action.” It suggested that future advancements in machine learning might be the only way to catch up with the criminals.

In 1998, there were over 3,000 reports of child sexual abuse imagery. Just over a decade later, yearly reports soared past 100,000. In 2014, that number surpassed 1 million for the first time. Last year, there were 18.4 million, more than one-third of the total ever reported. Those reports included over 45 million images and videos flagged as child sexual abuse. By Rich Harris | Source: The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children

The Times reviewed over 10,000 pages of police and court documents; conducted software tests to assess the availability of the imagery through search engines; accompanied detectives on raids; and spoke with investigators, lawmakers, tech executives and government officials. The reporting included conversations with an admitted pedophile who concealed his identity using encryption software and who runs a site that has hosted as many as 17,000 such images.

In interviews, victims across the United States described in heart-wrenching detail how their lives had been upended by the abuse. Children, raped by relatives and strangers alike, being told it was normal. Adults, now years removed from their abuse, still living in fear of being recognized from photos and videos on the internet. And parents of the abused, struggling to cope with the guilt of not having prevented it and their powerlessness over stopping its online spread.

Many of the survivors and their families said their view of humanity had been inextricably changed by the crimes themselves and the online demand for images of them.

“I don’t really know how to deal with it,” said one woman who, at age 11, had been filmed being sexually assaulted by her father. “You’re just trying to feel O.K. and not let something like this define your whole life. But the thing with the pictures is — that’s the thing that keeps this alive.”

The Times’s reporting revealed a problem global in scope — most of the images found last year were traced to other countries — but one firmly rooted in the United States because of the central role Silicon Valley has played in facilitating the imagery’s spread and in reporting it to the authorities.

While the material, commonly known as child pornography, predates the digital era, smartphone cameras, social media and cloud storage have allowed the images to multiply at an alarming rate. Both recirculated and new images occupy all corners of the internet, including a range of platforms as diverse as Facebook Messenger, Microsoft’s Bing search engine and the storage service Dropbox.

In a particularly disturbing trend, online groups are devoting themselves to sharing images of younger children and more extreme forms of abuse. The groups use encrypted technologies and the dark web, the vast underbelly of the internet, to teach pedophiles how to carry out the crimes and how to record and share images of the abuse worldwide. In some online forums, children are forced to hold up signs with the name of the group or other identifying information to prove the images are fresh.

To report online child sexual abuse, contact the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children at 1-800-843-5678.

With so many reports of the abuse coming their way, law enforcement agencies across the country said they were often besieged. Some have managed their online workload by focusing on imagery depicting the youngest victims.

“We go home and think, ‘Good grief, the fact that we have to prioritize by age is just really disturbing,’” said Detective Paula Meares, who has investigated child sex crimes for more than 10 years at the Los Angeles Police Department.

In some sense, increased detection of the spiraling problem is a sign of progress. Tech companies are legally required to report images of child abuse only when they discover them; they are not required to look for them.

After years of uneven monitoring of the material, several major tech companies, including Facebook and Google, stepped up surveillance of their platforms. In interviews, executives with some companies pointed to the voluntary monitoring and the spike in reports as indications of their commitment to addressing the problem.

But police records and emails, as well as interviews with nearly three dozen local, state and federal law enforcement officials, show that some tech companies still fall short. It can take weeks or months for them to respond to questions from the authorities, if they respond at all. Sometimes they respond only to say they have no records, even for reports they initiated.

And when tech companies cooperate fully, encryption and anonymization can create digital hiding places for perpetrators. Facebook announced in March plans to encrypt Messenger, which last year was responsible for nearly 12 million of the 18.4 million worldwide reports of child sexual abuse material, according to people familiar with the reports. Reports to the authorities typically contain more than one image, and last year encompassed the record 45 million photos and videos, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

All the while, criminals continue to trade and stockpile caches of the material.

The law Congress passed in 2008 foresaw many of today’s problems, but The Times found that the federal government had not fulfilled major aspects of the legislation.

The Justice Department has produced just two of six required reports that are meant to compile data about internet crimes against children and set goals to eliminate them, and there has been a constant churn of short-term appointees leading the department’s efforts. The first person to hold the position, Francey Hakes, said it was clear from the outset that no one “felt like the position was as important as it was written by Congress to be.”

The federal government has also not lived up to the law’s funding goals, severely crippling efforts to stamp out the activity.

Congress has regularly allocated about half of the $60 million in yearly funding for state and local law enforcement efforts. Separately, the Department of Homeland Security this year diverted nearly $6 million from its cybercrimes units to immigration enforcement — depleting 40 percent of the units’ discretionary budget until the final month of the fiscal year.

Alicia Kozakiewicz, who was abducted by a man she had met on the internet when she was 13, said the lack of follow-through was disheartening. Now an advocate for laws preventing crimes against children, she had testified in support of the 2008 legislation.

“I remember looking around the room, and there wasn’t a dry eye,” said Ms. Kozakiewicz, 31, who had told of being chained, raped and beaten while her kidnapper live-streamed the abuse on the internet. “The federal bill passed, but it wasn’t funded. So it didn’t mean anything.”

Further impairing the federal response are shortcomings at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which reviews reports it receives and then distributes them to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, as well as international partners.

The nonprofit center has relied in large measure on 20-year-old technology, has difficulty keeping experienced engineers on staff and, by its own reckoning, regards stopping the online distribution of photos and videos secondary to rescuing children.

“To be honest, it’s a resource and volume issue,” said John Shehan, a vice president at the center, which was established 35 years ago to track missing children. “First priority is making sure we’re assessing the risk of the children. We’re getting this information into the hands of law enforcement.”

Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat from Florida who was an author of the 2008 law, said in an interview that she was unaware of the extent of the federal government’s failures. After being briefed on The Times’s findings, she sent a letter to Attorney General William Barr requesting an accounting.

Stacie B. Harris, the Justice Department’s coordinator over the past year for combating child exploitation, said the problem was systemic, extending well beyond the department and her tenure there. “We are trying to play catch-up because we know that this is a huge, huge problem,” said Ms. Harris, an associate deputy attorney general.

The fallout for law enforcement, in some instances, has been crushing.

When reviewing tips from the national center, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has narrowed its focus to images of infants and toddlers. And about one of every 10 agents in Homeland Security’s investigative section — which deals with all kinds of threats, including terrorism — is now assigned to child sexual exploitation cases.

“We could double our numbers and still be getting crushed,” said Jonathan Hendrix, a Homeland Security agent who investigates cases in Nashville.

The Cutting Edge

The videos found on the computer of an Ohio man were described by investigators as among “the most gruesome and violent images of child pornography.”

One showed a woman orally forcing herself on a girl who was then held upside down by the ankles in a bathroom while “another child urinates” on her face, according to court documents.

Another showed a woman “inserting an ice cube into the vagina” of a young girl, the documents said, before tying her ankles together, taping her mouth shut and suspending her upside down. As the video continued, the girl was beaten, slapped and burned with a match or candle.

“The predominant sound is the child screaming and crying,” according to a federal agent quoted in the documents.

The videos were stored in a hidden computer file and had also been encrypted, one common way abusive imagery has been able to race across the internet with impunity.

Increasingly, criminals are using advanced technologies like encryption to stay ahead of the police. In this case, the Ohio man, who helped run a website on the dark web known as the Love Zone, had over 3 million photos and videos on his computers.

The site, now shuttered, had nearly 30,000 members and required them to share images of abuse to maintain good standing, according to the court documents. A private section of the forum was available only to members who shared imagery of children they abused themselves. They were known as “producers.”

Multiple police investigations over the past few years have broken up enormous dark web forums, including one known as Child’s Play that was reported to have had over a million user accounts.

The highly skilled perpetrators often taunt the authorities with their technical skills, acting boldly because they feel protected by the cover of darkness.

“People who traffic in child exploitation materials are on the cutting edge of technology,” said Susan Hennessey, a former lawyer at the National Security Agency who researches cybersecurity at the Brookings Institution.

Offenders can cover their tracks by connecting to virtual private networks, which mask their locations; deploying encryption techniques, which can hide their messages and make their hard drives impenetrable; and posting on the dark web, which is inaccessible to conventional browsers.

The anonymity offered by the sites emboldens members to post images of very young children being sexually abused, and in increasingly extreme and violent forms.

“Historically, you would never have gone to a black market shop and asked, ‘I want real hard-core with 3-year-olds,’” said Yolanda Lippert, a prosecutor in Cook County, Ill., who leads a team investigating online child abuse. “But now you can sit seemingly secure on your device searching for this stuff, trading for it.”

Exhibits in the case of the Love Zone, sealed by the court but released by a judge after a request by The Times, include screenshots showing the forum had dedicated areas where users discussed ways to remain “safe” while posting and downloading the imagery. Tips included tutorials on how to encrypt and share material without being detected by the authorities.

The offender in Ohio, a site administrator named Jason Gmoser, “went to great lengths to hide” his conduct, according to the documents. Testimony in his criminal case revealed that it would have taken the authorities “trillions of years” to crack the 41-character password he had used to encrypt the site. He eventually turned it over to investigators, and was sentenced to life in prison in 2016.

The site was run by a number of men, including Brian Davis, a worker at a child day care center in Illinois who admitted to documenting abuse of his own godson and more than a dozen other children — aged 3 months to 8 years — and sharing images of the assaults with other members. Mr. Davis made over 400 posts on the site. One image showed him orally raping a 2-year-old; another depicted a man raping an infant’s anus.

Mr. Davis, who was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2016, said that “capturing the abuse on video was part of the excitement,” according to court records.

Some of his victims attended the court proceedings and submitted statements about their continuing struggles with the abuse.

‘Truly Terrible Things’

The surge in criminal activity on the dark web accounted for only a fraction of the 18.4 million reports of abuse last year. That number originates almost entirely with tech companies based in the United States.

The companies have known for years that their platforms were being co-opted by predators, but many of them essentially looked the other way, according to interviews and emails detailing the companies’ activities. And while many companies have made recent progress in identifying the material, they were slow to respond.

Hemanshu Nigam, a former federal prosecutor in cybercrime and child exploitation cases, said it was clear more than two decades ago that new technologies had created the biggest boon for pedophiles since the Polaroid camera.

The recent surge by tech companies in filing reports of online abuse “wouldn’t exist if they did their job then,” said Mr. Nigam, who now runs a cybersecurity consulting firm and previously held top security roles at Microsoft, Myspace and News Corporation.

Hany Farid, who worked with Microsoft to develop technology in 2009 for detecting child sexual abuse material, said tech companies had been reluctant for years to dig too deeply.

“The companies knew the house was full of roaches, and they were scared to turn the lights on,” he said. “And then when they did turn the lights on, it was worse than they thought.”

Federal law requires companies to preserve material about their reports of abuse imagery for 90 days. But given the overwhelming number of reports, it is not uncommon for requests from the authorities to reach companies too late.

“That’s a huge issue for us,” said Capt. Mike Edwards, a Seattle police commander who oversees a cybercrimes unit for the State of Washington. “You’ve got a short period of time to be able to get the data if it was preserved.”

Most tech companies have been quick to respond to urgent inquiries, but responses in other cases vary significantly. In interviews, law enforcement officials pointed to Tumblr, a blogging and social networking site with 470 million users, as one of the most problematic companies.

Police officers in Missouri, New Jersey, Texas and Wisconsin lamented Tumblr’s poor response to requests, with one officer describing the issues as “long-term and ongoing” in an internal document.

A recent investigation in Polk County, Wis., that included an image of a man orally raping a young child stalled for over a year. The investigator retired before Tumblr responded to numerous emails requesting information.

In a 2016 Wisconsin case, Tumblr alerted a person who had uploaded explicit images that the account had been referred to the authorities, a practice that a former employee told The Times had been common for years. The tip allowed the man to destroy evidence on his electronic devices, the police said.

A spokeswoman for Verizon said that Tumblr prioritized time-sensitive cases, which delayed other responses. Since Verizon acquired the company in 2017, the spokeswoman said, its practice was not to alert users of police requests for data. Verizon recently sold Tumblr to the web development company Automattic.

The law enforcement officials also pointed to problems with Microsoft’s Bing search engine, and Snap, the parent company of the social network Snapchat.

Bing was said to regularly submit reports that lacked essential information, making investigations difficult, if not impossible. Snapchat, a platform especially popular with young people, is engineered to delete most of its content within a short period of time. According to law enforcement, when requests are made to the company, Snap often replies that it has no additional information.

A Microsoft spokesman said that the company had only limited information about offenders using the search engine, and that it was cooperating as best as it could. A Snap spokesman said the company preserved data in compliance with the law.

Data obtained through a public records request suggests Facebook’s plans to encrypt Messenger in the coming years will lead to vast numbers of images of child abuse going undetected. The data shows that WhatsApp, the company’s encrypted messaging app, submits only a small fraction of the reports Messenger does.

Facebook has long known about abusive images on its platforms, including a video of a man sexually assaulting a 6-year-old that went viral last year on Messenger. When Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, announced in March that Messenger would move to encryption, he acknowledged the risk it presented for “truly terrible things like child exploitation.”

“Encryption is a powerful tool for privacy,” he said, “but that includes the privacy of people doing bad things.”

‘Vastly Inadequate’

“In a recent case, an offender filmed himself drugging the juice boxes of neighborhood children before tricking them into drinking the mix,” said Special Agent Flint Waters, a criminal investigator for the State of Wyoming. “He then filmed himself as he sexually abused unconscious children.”

Mr. Waters, appearing before Congress in Washington, was describing what he said “we see every day.”

He went on to present a map of the United States covered with red dots, each representing a computer used to share images of child sex abuse. Fewer than two percent of the crimes would be investigated, he predicted. “We are overwhelmed, we are underfunded and we are drowning in the tidal wave of tragedy,” he said.

Mr. Waters’s testimony was delivered 12 years ago — in 2007.

The following year, Congress passed legislation that acknowledged the severity of the crisis. But then the federal government largely moved on. Some of the strongest provisions of the law were not fulfilled, and many problems went unfixed, according to interviews and government documents.

Today, Mr. Waters’s testimony offers a haunting reminder of time lost.

Annual funding for state and regional investigations was authorized at $60 million, but only about half of that is regularly approved. It has increased only slightly from 10 years ago when accounting for inflation. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat of Connecticut who was a sponsor of the law’s reauthorization, said there was “no adequate or logical explanation and no excuse” for why more money was not allocated. Even $60 million a year, he said, would now be “vastly inadequate.”

Another cornerstone of the law, the biennial strategy reports by the Justice Department, was mostly ignored. Even the most recent of the two reports that were published, in 2010 and 2016, did not include data about some of the most pressing concerns, such as the trade in illicit imagery.

The Justice Department’s coordinator for child exploitation prevention, Ms. Harris, said she could not explain the poor record. A spokeswoman for the department, citing limited resources, said the reports would now be written every four years beginning in 2020.

When the law was reauthorized in 2012, the coordinator role was supposed to be elevated to a senior executive position with broad authority. That has not happened. “This is supposed to be the quarterback,” said Ms. Wasserman Schultz, one of the provision’s authors.

Even when the Justice Department has been publicly called out for ignoring provisions of the law, there has been little change.

In 2011, the Government Accountability Office reported that no steps had been taken to research which online offenders posed a high risk to children, and that the Justice Department had not submitted a progress assessment to Congress, both requirements of the law.

At the time, the department said it did not have enough funding to undertake the research and had no “time frame” for submitting a report. Today, the provisions remain largely unfulfilled.

The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which testified in favor of the 2008 law, has also struggled with demands to contain the spread of the imagery.

Founded in 1984 after the well-publicized kidnapping and murder of a 6-year-old Florida boy, Adam Walsh, the center has been closely affiliated with the federal government since the Reagan administration.

But as child exploitation has grown on the internet, the center has not kept up. The technology it uses for receiving and reviewing reports of the material was created in 1998, nearly a decade before the first iPhone was released. To perform key upgrades and help modernize the system, the group has relied on donations from tech companies like Palantir and Google.

The center has said it intends to make significant improvements to its technology starting in 2020, but the problems don’t stop there. The police complain that the most urgent reports are not prioritized, or are sent to the wrong department completely.

“We’re spending a tremendous amount of time having to go through those and reanalyze them ourselves,” said Captain Edwards, the Seattle police official.

In a statement, the national center said it did its best to route reports to the correct jurisdiction.

Despite its mandate by Congress, the center is not subject to public records laws and operates with little transparency. It repeatedly denied requests from The Times for quarterly and annual reports submitted to the Justice Department, as well as for tallies of imagery reports submitted by individual tech companies.

Mr. Shehan, the vice president, said such disclosures might discourage tech companies from cooperating with the center. He said the numbers could be misinterpreted.

The Times found that there was a close relationship between the center and Silicon Valley that raised questions about good governance practices. For example, the center receives both money and in-kind donations from tech companies, while employees of the same companies are sometimes members of its board. Google alone has donated nearly $4 million in the past decade, according to public testimony.

A spokeswoman for the center said it was common to expect corporations to provide financial assistance to charities. But the practice, others working in the area of child protection say, could elevate the interests of the tech companies above the children’s.

“There’s an inherent conflict in accepting money from these companies when they also sit on your board,” said Signy Arnason, who is a top executive at the equivalent organization in Canada, known as the Canadian Center for Child Protection.

This close relationship with tech companies may ultimately be in jeopardy. In 2016, a federal court held that the national center, though private, qualified legally as a government entity because it performed a number of essential government functions.

If that view gains traction, Fourth Amendment challenges about searches and seizures by the government could change how the center operates and how tech companies find and remove illegal imagery on their platforms. Under those circumstances, if they were to collaborate too closely with the center, the companies fear, they could also be viewed as government actors, not private entities, subjecting them to new legal requirements and court challenges when they police their own sites.

An Ugly Mirror

It was a sunny afternoon in July, and an unmarked police van in Salt Lake City was parked outside a pink stucco house. Garden gnomes and a heart-shaped “Welcome Friends” sign decorated the front yard.

At the back of the van, a man who lived in the house was seated in a cramped interrogation area, while officers cataloged hard drives and sifted through web histories from his computers.

The man had shared sexually explicit videos online, the police said, including one of a 10-year-old boy being “orally sodomized” by a man, and another of a man forcing two young boys to engage in anal intercourse.

“The sad thing is that’s pretty tame compared to what we’ve seen,” said Chief Jessica Farnsworth, an official with the Utah attorney general’s office who led a raid of the house. The victims have not been identified or rescued.

The year was barely half over, and Chief Farnsworth’s team had already conducted about 150 such raids across Utah. The specially trained group, one of 61 nationwide, coordinates state and regional responses to internet crimes against children.

The Utah group expects to arrest nearly twice as many people this year as last year for crimes related to child sexual abuse material, but federal funding has not kept pace with the surge. Funding for the 61 task forces from 2010 to 2018 remained relatively flat, federal data shows, while the number of leads referred to them increased by more than 400 percent.

Much of the federal money goes toward training new staff members because the cases take a heavy emotional and psychological toll on investigators, resulting in constant turnover.

“I thought that I was in the underbelly of society — until I came here,” said Ms. Lippert, the prosecutor with the task force in Illinois, who had worked for years at a busy Chicago courthouse.

While any child at imminent risk remains a priority, the volume of work has also forced the task forces to make difficult choices. Some have focused on the youngest and most vulnerable victims, while others have cut back on undercover operations, including infiltrating chat rooms and online forums.

“I think some of the bigger fish who are out there are staying out there,” Ms. Lippert said.

The internet is well known as a haven for hate speech, terrorism-related content and criminal activity, all of which have raised alarms and spurred public debate and action.

But the problem of child sexual abuse imagery faces a particular hurdle: It gets scant attention because few people want to confront the enormity and horror of the content, or they wrongly dismiss it as primarily teenagers sending inappropriate selfies.

Some state lawmakers, judges and members of Congress have refused to discuss the problem in detail, or have avoided attending meetings and hearings when it was on the agenda, according to interviews with law enforcement officials and victims.

Steven J. Grocki, who leads a group of policy experts and lawyers at the child exploitation section of the Justice Department, said the reluctance to address the issue went beyond elected officials and was a societal problem. “They turn away from it because it’s too ugly of a mirror,” he said.

Yet the material is everywhere, and ever more available.

“I think that people were always there, but the access is so easy,” said Lt. John Pizzuro, a task force commander in New Jersey. “You got nine million people in the state of New Jersey. Based upon statistics, we can probably arrest 400,000 people.”

Common language about the abuse can also minimize the harm in people’s minds. While the imagery is often defined as “child pornography” in state and federal laws, experts prefer terms like child sexual abuse imagery or child exploitation material to underscore the seriousness of the crimes and to avoid conflating it with adult pornography, which is legal for people over 18.

“Each and every image is a depiction of a crime in progress,” said Sgt. Jeff Swanson, a task force commander in Kansas. “The violence inflicted on these kids is unimaginable.”"
26,"By Perri Klass, M.D","The experts who study parenting are interested in how we spend those moments. If you really look in time diary data, on average parents are not spending hours a day doing these kinds of developmentally stimulating things with their kids, said Ariel Kalil, a p… [+2450 chars]","Parents can feel inadequate if they fall short of the idealized view of intensive parenting, in which they act directly and decisively in the child’s life.",2019-09-30,The New York Times,Intensive Care: What Makes a ‘Good’ Parent?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/well/family/intensive-parenting.html,"The experts who study parenting are interested in how we spend those moments. “If you really look in time diary data, on average parents are not spending hours a day doing these kinds of developmentally stimulating things with their kids,” said Ariel Kalil, a professor at the Harris School of Public Policy Studies at the University of Chicago, and the first author on an influential study of parent time use which showed that differences across the socioeconomic spectrum have increased over time.

Rebecca Ryan, a professor of psychology at Georgetown, who was a co-author on that study, said that with children 3 to 5 years old, college-educated mothers spent on average 14 minutes a day in teaching activities, whereas mothers with a high school degree or less spend about five minutes a day. So the individual amounts are relatively small, but when you multiply those differences out across the endless (or all-too-short) days of child rearing, they can be profound.

“Whatever the myth of hyperparenting is, there is basically no parent who spends two hours a day reading or doing puzzles,” Dr. Kalil said. “The average amount of time parents spend a day is between 20 and 30 minutes.”

And the biggest difference is between parents who don’t do any of those developmentally stimulating activities and parents who do something, she said, which is why the focus of parenting programs and interventions should be to get parents to put in some minutes — not hours — on a regular basis. “What I believe is that what really matters is regular steady habits of modest investment,” she said.

And yes, the parents in the zero-minutes-a-day group are disproportionately low-income and less well educated, though there are certainly plenty of low-income families where lots of reading and talking and involvement goes on. For those at zero, “to shift the needle on moving them closer to what middle class or rich parents do does not mean asking them to read an hour a night,” Dr. Kalil said. “It means reducing the number of days when nothing happens.”

Dr. Kalil directs the center for human potential and public policy, where she studies low-income families. “We’ve interviewed thousands of low-income parents in Chicago,” she said. “They know reading is important, they have books in their house, but for a variety of reasons, because life in low-income circumstances is more stressful and more unpredictable, low-income families have a harder time following through on these aspirations.”

By working with text message reminders, she said, parents can set goals for what they want to do with their children. In another study, these behavioral tools more than doubled the amount of time parents spent engaging with their children."

“Let’s have some real talk,” Ms. Harris said in Reno. “This is not a new conversation for me. This is a conversation that I’ve heard every time I’ve ran a campaign and — here’s the operative word — won.”

In strategic terms, her campaign’s choice to pivot to Iowa is a concession that its initial theory of the presidential race was at least partially incorrect. From the start, her longtime advisers mapped out a national strategy that highlighted primaries with more diverse electorates — such as South Carolina, Nevada and California, her home state — while conserving resources often used in early states for television advertisements in later ones.

It was a risky bet made with California confidence, that they would not only boost a candidate with the potential to make history but also do so without prioritizing Iowa and New Hampshire, a strategy that is unproven on the national stage and a break from Barack Obama’s successful playbook in 2008.

But after the fleeting high of Ms. Harris’s much-talked-about exchange with Mr. Biden over segregation and school busing in the first Democratic debate, it became clear that several assumptions underpinning that national strategy were not in line with the current moment.

Mr. Biden’s support soon bounced back, fueled by perceptions that he was best suited to defeat Mr. Trump, which remains the obsessive top priority for most Democratic voters. Mr. Biden’s strength with black voters has been particularly difficult for Ms. Harris to match, and some of her own supporters from within the Congressional Black Caucus told her privately they felt the debate moment had crossed a line.

Mr. Biden’s campaign has said he scored his best week of fund-raising since the second week of the campaign as Democrats initiated an impeachment inquiry of Mr. Trump over a whistle-blower complaint claiming that Mr. Trump prodded the president of Ukraine to investigate the business dealings there of Mr. Biden’s son Hunter Biden.

Still, some Biden supporters are nervous about how the impeachment process, and any added scrutiny of Hunter Biden’s business affairs, will play out. Some have even discussed creating a super PAC, which the campaign quickly disavowed. Others see in Ms. Warren’s rise as a top rival, with Mr. Sanders in third, an opportunity for Mr. Biden to truly consolidate a donor class that has remained fractured.

Mr. Biden’s ability to attract small donors will be closely scrutinized. In the last 90 days, his campaign ranked 10th among the Democratic presidential candidates for advertising dollars on Facebook, where campaigns often prospect for new contributors. He spent less than one-quarter of what Mr. Buttigieg had spent on the platform in that time, and well less than half of what Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders had spent, according to Facebook data.

Mr. Biden told donors at a sushi restaurant in Los Angeles last week that he had nearly 670,000 donations overall with an average donation of $46, which would translate to only about $10.8 million this quarter. A Biden campaign official said the former vice president had not presented the “full picture” but declined to elaborate.

A Biden campaign official said Tuesday that the former vice president had “unequivocally’’ raised enough money to be competitive in the primary race, and that details would be released soon.

In this race’s early stages, Ms. Harris showed all the signs of a possible coalition candidate, merging liberals and more moderate minority voters behind the strength of her historic bid to become the country’s first woman of color elected president. On the race’s first day, she raised $1.5 million, and she soon held a kickoff rally in Oakland, Calif., that remains one of the largest events for any candidate, with more than 20,000 people in attendance.

However, as the race has matured, Ms. Harris has been outflanked in money and ideology. Mr. Buttigieg has become the favorite of big money donors, and advisers for Mr. Biden, the race’s most prominent moderate candidate, are now considering a super PAC to supplement his coffers.

On the grass-roots side, progressives have centralized behind their two preferred candidates: Mr. Sanders, who retains many supporters from his previous presidential run, and Ms. Warren, who has grown her fund-raising base as her poll numbers have risen. She has outpaced Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders in recent polls, both nationally and in a few early-voting states.

Ms. Harris’s team is adamant that she remains well-positioned — and adequately funded — to mount a vigorous operation in Iowa. As Mr. Biden’s poll numbers fade, Ms. Harris’s advisers believe her campaign is likely to gain from this and can use a strong initial showing to centralize black voters in later states. Recently, Ms. Harris shook up her senior staff, in a move that was first reported by Politico, and was taken as an acknowledgment of the campaign’s tough road ahead."

There were two Californians onstage, Senator Kamala Harris and the billionaire Tom Steyer, who lives in San Francisco. How did they do?

This was Mr. Steyer’s first time on a presidential debate stage, and he spent much of his seven minutes and 13 seconds of speaking time introducing himself and his ideas.

Yes, he acknowledged, he is a very rich guy. But as a longtime Democratic donor who has pushed for impeachment for years, he sought to position himself as the best person to expose what he described as the president’s failures.

And asked whether billionaires should be taxed out of existence, he answered yes without hesitation. He also railed against a government that he said has been bought by big corporations."

In Iowa, the most important state to Mr. Booker’s campaign , it’s a little different: More than 80 family members live in the Des Moines area.

“I’ve got a very intimidating front row here,” Mr. Booker said on Tuesday at a rally in West Des Moines. About a dozen cousins sat a few feet from him, clad in campaign gear. One of them, Marv Allen, rose to ask a question, though he didn’t quite hold his cousin’s feet to the fire.

Republicans are attacking Warren

Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts often tells voters that after she became “visibly pregnant” at the end of her first year as a public-school teacher, the principal wished her luck and hired someone else to replace her.

This week, a conservative news site and other outlets challenged her account, citing a 2007 interview with Ms. Warren and minutes from a school board meeting — and Ms. Warren pushed back in a unique way. Rather than just restating the truth of her account (though she has done that as well), she called on women to share their own stories of pregnancy discrimination, which remains widespread.

The candidates talked L.G.B.T.Q. rights

CNN and the Human Rights Campaign hosted the latest subject-based forum of the presidential race on Thursday, focused on gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender issues. Protesters interrupted the event at several points to call attention to the murders of black transgender women, and the candidates seemed to welcome the reminder.

The 2020 Democratic presidential campaign stops are crawling with children, some of whom spend most of the stump speeches crawling away from their parents. While all of the candidates seek to portray a family-friendly image, it takes work to bring a youngster to a campaign event: They often start late and run well into the evening, with a policy discussion not exactly accessible on the elementary-school level; bigger rallies often take place outdoors, regardless of weather.

Kissing babies and tousling children’s hair has long been a staple of retail campaigning, but in 2020 it is about more than a photo op, even the cutest of photo ops . In a historically crowded field, in an era of uncertain polling, these campaign stops are something of a past-their-bedtimes straw poll, revealing which candidates young parents deem viable or famous enough to risk a tantrum or a sleep-deprived meltdown over the next morning."

In a moment marked by fractured politics, Ms. Gabbard’s nontraditional positions are a major part of her appeal for voters seeking to break out of polarized partisan divisions. Joe Rogan, the popular podcast host, said he planned to vote for her. Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter, donated to her campaign.

But it’s also an argument that reminds some Democrats of the narrative pushed by Russian actors during the 2016 presidential contest, when an operation by internet trolls worked to manipulate American public opinion: that the electoral system is broken and cannot be trusted.

Some of those who have worked with Ms. Gabbard say that, as an Iraq war veteran whose chief message is that America should stop trying to police the world, she is representing viewpoints that draw support from an array of people in the United States as well as abroad .

“In reality, Tulsi is really running on an antiwar message that’s consistent with where a lot of veterans are,” said Jon Soltz, chairman of the liberal veterans organization VoteVets.org, which worked closely with Ms. Gabbard during her first congressional campaign. “I know everyone thinks there’s a conspiracy theory here but that’s really what she’s doing.”

Still, Democrats are on high alert about foreign interference in the next election and the D.N.C. is well aware of the frequent mentions of Ms. Gabbard in the Russian state news media.

An independent analysis of the Russian news media found that RT, the Kremlin-backed news agency, mentioned Ms. Gabbard frequently for a candidate polling in single digits, according to data collected by the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a group that seeks to track and expose efforts by authoritarian regimes to undermine democratic elections."

But when Ms. Warren looked out at the audience, she saw mostly white faces. The view reflected perhaps her biggest political challenge as she seeks the Democratic presidential nomination: adding black voters to her base of support.

African-Americans were critical to Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton winning competitive primary contests and capturing the nomination. Like those earlier candidates, Ms. Warren faces multiple rivals who may splinter the electorate this winter, and running up the vote margin in predominantly black areas could once again deliver troves of delegates needed for the nomination.

The deep middle of the field beckoned. The Dolphins showed five players at the line but rushed three, dropping eight into coverage. Brown zoomed past defenders on a post route, then toward a vast expanse of green. Jackson flicked his wrist and lofted the ball 45 yards. Brown caught it in stride and dashed into the end zone.

From the Ravens’ perspective, how the play happened was more exciting than the score itself.

“We just hadn’t seen anything like that from him,” the Ravens’ offensive coordinator, Greg Roman, said, referring to Jackson. “It was the coverage read, but it was also just great downfield accuracy.”

That play differed dramatically from those Jackson piloted last season. When he was elevated to the starter midway through the season, coaches thrust him into a rush-heavy offense, the better to optimize his supersonic speed and cheat-code jukes, his most salient qualities. Jackson ended up throwing for one more touchdown than he ran in himself (five). That style helped power the team to a division title, but it wasn’t the long-term plan for the Ravens — or Jackson."

Most of the Democratic candidates have proposed some form of subsidized child care or public preschool, and some say that a corresponding subsidy for at-home caregivers would allow parents to choose who cares for their children. (President Trump made a similar proposal when he was running for president, but did not include it in his tax plan.)

But they’re also acknowledging something else: Often, staying home is not really a choice at all. If parents’ jobs are too inflexible to accommodate children’s needs, or pay too little to afford child care, taking care of their child has to come first.

As long as people have debated the idea, there has been disagreement over whether paying women for unpaid labor is liberating or oppressive.

In the United States in the late 1800s, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, the writer and social reformer, wrote that unpaid labor took away women’s independence and ought to be done by paid experts. Around the same time, the United States for a period paid single mothers a pension, on the belief that it was best for children if mothers did not work outside the home (though black women were largely excluded).

The idea resurfaced during the feminist movement of the 1970s. That period is well known for the rush of women into the work force. But there was a parallel movement, which began in Europe and spread to the United States: wages for housework. The argument was that women should be paid for the work they were already doing, and that men’s paid work depended on it, as Louise Toupin described in a history of the movement last year.

Similar debates continue today in countries that pay a child allowance. In Finland, for example, the policy is seen as giving women “freedom to choose,” while in Sweden, it has been called a “trap for women.” (The policies are usually gender-neutral, but it’s mostly women who use them.)"

Charles Barone, the group’s chief policy officer, said that while he welcomed big new investments in education, including in teacher pay, he was disappointed that the primary contenders had not tackled specific problems such as weaknesses in how educators are trained to teach children to read.

“There is a political tension between spreading the money around and trying to make strategic investments in certain areas,” he said. “There’s a lot of meat and potatoes, but not a lot of spinach-eating getting proposed.”

Before she entered politics, Ms. Warren suggested a program allowing parents to choose any public school for their children, regardless of where the family lived.

That vision aligned with many in the charter school movement, who see their schools as lifelines for families who cannot afford private school tuition or a home in a coveted school zone.

But in 2016, Ms. Warren, then in her first term as a senator from Massachusetts, spoke out against a ballot referendum that would have raised the cap on the number of charters that could open each year in her home state. She acknowledged that many Massachusetts charter schools were high-performing, but said that opening too many additional charters could reduce funding for traditional public schools.

Ms. Warren and her Democratic rivals are vying for endorsements from teachers’ unions, which generally oppose the expansion of the charter sector. “The focus is on making sure every single neighborhood public school is a great school,” said Bharat Ramamurti, an economic policy adviser to Ms. Warren."

For years, prospective Democratic nominees came to Iowa to talk ethanol and pork subsidies and saved any rhetoric about the injustice of racial profiling for crowds in South Carolina and Nevada — the only early voting states where black and Latino voters made up a significant portion of the Democratic electorate.

But in the era of Mr. Trump, and after social movements such as Black Lives Matter pushed racial inequality to the forefront of national politics, it’s white Democrats in Iowa and New Hampshire — not black ones in South Carolina — who, to this point, are embracing the candidates who promise to upend society in the name of racial equity.

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has held a commanding lead in national polls with nonwhite Democrats, but surveys show that white liberals in Iowa and New Hampshire are less inclined to support him. At events for Mr. Biden , some white voters cite his confounding September debate answer on the legacy of slavery and previous Senate work with segregationists as reasons to support other candidates.

At events for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind. — two white candidates who have particularly excelled with college-educated liberals — supporters pointed to policies addressing racial inequalities as part of the candidates’ appeal.

These policies may give cover to those seeking to support a white candidate in a historically diverse Democratic field, which includes Ms. Harris, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, and former cabinet secretary Julián Castro — candidates who are themselves racial minorities and who are struggling to gain traction in the polls.

It’s much needed. It’s hard to miss the rising dissatisfaction and frustration with Facebook.

People sometimes ask how I stay optimistic when I cover war, genocide and poverty. The answer is simple: Side by side with the worst of humanity, you encounter the best. I’ve made repeated trips to the rebel-held Nuba Mountains of Sudan, where the government dropped bombs and starved villagers, and there I met an extraordinary human being, Dr. Tom Catena, who has devoted his life to providing medical care as the bombs fall around him. A Muslim paramount chief told me that “Dr. Tom,” as he is known, heals the sick and lets the lame walk — and thus “He’s Jesus Christ.” On one trip to the Nuba Mountains, I was sickened to visit an extended family that had lost six children to a bomb but also moved that Dr. Tom had managed to save three others. So I return from a war zone like that scarred by the pain I’ve witnessed, but also uplifted by the goodness, strength and decency shown by people like Dr. Tom — and actually feeling better about humanity.

5 Minutes, $25 and a New Life

Another reason for optimism: I have seen immense progress in my 35 years of covering the world. On my first travels to poor countries, as a law student, I was pained by the number of blind people I saw led around by their children or grandchildren. Many were blind from cataracts, and in 2015 I met a remarkable Nepali doctor, Sanduk Ruit, who has pioneered a way to perform five-minute cataract surgery without electricity or advanced facilities for only $25 a patient. He has personally performed more than 120,000 cataract surgeries. You cannot watch Dr. Ruit’s patients take off their bandages and smile giddily as they see clearly for the first time in many years without feeling a rush of warmth about our world.

An Innocent Man Facing Death?

Beginning in 2010, I wrote a number of times about a black man named Kevin Cooper who I believe was framed for murder by the San Bernardino County sheriff’s office in California, where he is now on death row. The articles didn’t get much traction or readership, but the more I reported on the subject the more aware I became that there are many people on death row after dubious convictions. So last year, with the help of Times colleagues who are experts in visual journalism, I conducted a thorough investigation of the Cooper case and published the results. We called on the authorities to allow advanced DNA testing in the case (Kamala Harris and Jerry Brown had previously refused to allow the testing). It may have been the longest opinion column The Times ever published. The upshot is that advanced DNA testing is now finally underway, and I’m praying that after 36 years in prison Cooper may finally get justice — along with those who framed him. Here’s the investigation.

The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips. And here’s our email: letters@nytimes.com."

Part of that, he said, is the impossibility of a deeply substantive debate among 10 people, which is how many were onstage for each of the June, July and September debates. The coming debate will have 12 people onstage.

And timidity won’t do. “Trump will be well funded and ferocious,” Kerrey told me. “If a Democratic candidate wilts under the warm attention and criticism of another Democrat, they will not be able to stand up to Trump.” And if that criticism goes too far, bleeding into gratuitous nastiness, “the audience will discipline them,” he said. He mentioned Julián Castro’s obvious insinuation in the debate last month that Biden was in serious cognitive decline.

That went too far. It was counterproductive, because it didn’t bring to light something about a candidate that wasn’t accessible to voters. That was true as well of Eric Swalwell’s “pass the torch” hectoring of Biden, in a June debate, as a politician who was overstaying his welcome. Voters know that Biden is 76 and has spent more than four decades of his life in public office. Swalwell wasn’t exposing some secret that had been swept under the rug; he was just stamping his feet.

Many anxious, Trump-horrified Democrats take the view that the candidates should tread lightly on one another. “When we know that President Trump will be spending his money to discourage Democratic turnout more explicitly and underhandedly than in any other modern campaign, why would we want any candidate to spend time persuading Democrats of how bad other Democrats are?” asked Jack Markell, the former governor of Delaware. “The difference between all of the Democratic candidates is dwarfed by the difference between the Democratic candidates collectively and President Trump.”

Many of the readers who write to me agree with him or go even further: They want to see, hear and revel in nothing but loving encomiums about Democrats vying for the White House. Some of them believe that Hillary Clinton was badly hurt by her battle with Sanders in the last Democratic primary, and that we’re where we are as a result.

But her wounds would have mattered less if Sanders had rallied more enthusiastically to her side once she’d won the nomination. I urge the losers this time around to get in line pronto. And I think it’s extremely risky to spare the next nominee the sort of tough examination that will let us know if we’ve elevated the most broadly appealing, durable, fearsome Trump slayer.

The stakes could hardly be higher. Every day, new revelations about the Ukraine sordidness come to light. Every day, the president acts in impulsive, imprudent, unhinged ways. Maybe that means that any Democrat can beat him. But I’m a bit of a pessimist and cautious to a fault. I think it means that we cannot afford to pick the wrong person."

It’s mild because Jeremy O. Harris’s play, which opened at the Golden Theater on Sunday, is one of the best and most provocative new works to show up on Broadway in years.

It’s a paradox because what could be happy in a play about pain? A play so serious, so furious and so deeply engaged in the most intractable conflicts of American life that it became both a cause célèbre and a scandal before it opened?

And it’s a bit prurient because when we talk about the provocations of “Slave Play” — and the people who saw it downtown last year at New York Theater Workshop have been talking about it almost nonstop since — what we usually mean is sex: the whip, the dildo, the nudity, the boots, the bondage, the orgasms both achieved and aborted.

But it can give us the perspectives of some of the people with expertise on primary races: veteran campaign strategists and consultants from both parties.

Here is a sampling of their reactions.

Warren took fire from all sides

The strategists agreed on one thing: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s new front-runner status was clear, because she was everyone else’s biggest target. But they were divided on how well she handled the attacks.

“Warren took almost everyone’s best punch there & came away basically unscathed.” — Jesse Lehrich, former foreign policy spokesman for Hillary Clinton “Heading into this debate as a frontrunner, she did not seem ready for the incoming.” — Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and former Democratic National Committee spokesman “This is the @ewarren debate. You might be happy or sad about it, but she’s the one who is setting the tone and she’s the reference point for most of the other candidates. That happens to the frontrunner.” — Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics

Buttigieg stood out …

Several consultants said Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., had successfully set himself up as an alternative for moderate Democrats uneasy with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. They particularly liked his responses on foreign policy, which he framed in terms of his own experience in the military.

“Very strong, passionate and compelling condemnation of @realDonaldTrump betrayal of Kurds from Northern Syria by @PeteButtigieg. Owning this discussion.” — David Axelrod, former chief strategist for Barack Obama “I am impressed with Buttigieg on foreign policy. Like Biden, he really shines and opens up when he talks about FP.” — Jess Morales Rocketto, political director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance “This has been @PeteButtigieg’s best #DemDebate performance so far. While other candidates tried to out-left and anti-Trump each other, Mayor Pete came across as reasonable and rational.” — Frank Luntz, Republican consultant and pollster

… and so did Klobuchar

Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota received similarly positive reviews, with strategists arguing that she and Mr. Buttigieg in the middle against Ms. Warren on the left was the biggest dynamic of the night.

“@amyklobuchar performance tonight will resonate with moderate Democrats who are tired of being told that they are sellouts if they don’t subscribe to most left views. It’s a theme that’s cut across all her answers tonight & why she is having a good night.” — Jennifer Palmieri, former spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama “With 11 other people on stage, you don’t get a lot of opportunities to make an impression. But she’s finding them, using each one to stand out and draw a contrast.” — Mo Elleithee “Every time Amy Klobuchar speaks she says something sensible. Not sure that makes her electable, but it’s nice to hear.” — Joe Lockhart, former spokesman for President Bill Clinton

Sanders was reassuring

After his heart attack two weeks ago, Senator Bernie Sanders badly needed to project strength and stamina, and on the whole, the consensus was that he succeeded.

“What heart attack?! @BernieSanders is giving a strong performance and not missing a step.” — Patti Solis Doyle, senior adviser to the 2008 Obama campaign “Bernie Sanders making a damn important point here — stuff in our county was bad before Trump was elected, and this election has to be about more than defeating Trump.” — Sally Kohn, progressive commentator and former campaign strategist “This was @BernieSanders’ best debate by far, but I still don’t hear him making a pitch to people who don’t already support him.” — Laura Belin, Iowa political commentator

Biden had an uneven performance

Mr. Biden won praise for his responses on foreign policy — frequently a strong area for him — but was criticized for seeming to claim credit for Ms. Warren’s work establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

“Biden needs to have a clear and compelling response to the Trump charge against him and his son, and I assumed he would have prepared one, but his answer is not sharp. When asked ‘did you make a mistake?’ he snaps back with a much sharper line.” — Robert Reich, professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and former labor secretary No one more experienced on foreign policy on this debate stage than @JoeBiden. This is where his experience shines and reminds voters that experience does matter.” — Adrienne Elrod, former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton “Biden yelling ‘I GOT you votes’ at Warren is not the best look.” — Kelly Dittmar, scholar at Rutgers University’s Center for American Women and Politics

Other standout moments

Several other candidates got good reviews for specific answers: Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker on reproductive rights, and the former housing secretary Julián Castro for the statement, “Police violence is also gun violence.”

“Such a smart move by @KamalaHarris to refocus the conversation on women’s reproductive rights. She listened to women since the last debate and will gain attention and praise for it.” — Kelly Dittmar “@CoryBooker brings a lot to this primary, but perhaps his greatest debate contribution is his continuance to be the moral compass, reminding candidates and the audience what this campaign is really all about: defeating Trump and helping people live better lives.” — Adrienne Elrod “Castro was really strong on police violence there and brought in an angle on seizing guns that other candidates missed.” — Seth Masket, political scientist at the University of Denver

But she should not have been surprised.

For months, Ms. Warren had moved largely unimpeded in her brisk jog to the front of the 2020 Democratic pack, coasting through debates without incident as her calls for “big structural change” took hold and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. absorbed the unforgiving glare afforded the favorite. Time and again this year, moderators had invited Ms. Warren’s top competitors to attack her. Time and again, they had done so gently, if at all.

This time, Mr. O’Rourke went after her. Pete Buttigieg, the millennial mayor of South Bend, Ind., did the same early in the evening in a slashing exchange on health care. Andrew Yang said she was wrong on the wealth tax. Senator Kamala Harris smiled as she and Ms. Warren sparred over whether to regulate President Trump’s tweets. Mr. Biden initiated his most direct debate-stage confrontation with Ms. Warren to date, saying she was “being vague” in campaign proposals.

This was Ms. Warren’s reward for achieving co-front-runner (and maybe outright front-runner) status: persistent sniping from fellow Democrats who see her surge as the most urgent threat to their own paths to the nomination. Ms. Warren greeted the deluge with mixed success, never wobbling too precariously but retreating at times to the safe harbor of stump-speech platitudes. On occasion, she appeared so eager to avoid the fray that she could give the impression that she was not engaging with the substance. “A yes-or-no question that didn’t get a yes-or-no answer,” Mr. Buttigieg observed at one point."

Triathlon has become the first national governing body of an American sport to make a sponsorship deal with a company that sells products containing cannabidiol, or CBD.

CBD is a nonintoxicating compound that, like the intoxicating compound THC, is found in varying amounts in hemp, a legal cannabis plant. In 2018, the World Anti-Doping Agency removed CBD from its list of banned substances. THC and scores of other cannabinoids remain on the banned list, but by removing CBD, WADA opened the door for elite athletes to use and endorse CBD products.

CBD’s benefits are said to include preventing pain and inflammation, relieving stress and anxiety and even aiding digestion. CBD products are available in several forms, including oils and lotions .

The financial terms of the four-year deal between U.S.A. Triathlon and Pure Spectrum, which is based in Colorado, were not disclosed. It came less than a year after Congress passed the Farm Bill , which legalized hemp . Growing the plant had been against federal law for many years.

Tonight, 12 Democratic candidates will be debating near Columbus, Ohio. Here’s what I’ll be looking for from the seven candidates with the best chances of winning the nomination:

Elizabeth Warren. Swing voters exist, and they are likely to decide the 2020 election, much as they played a decisive role in 2016 and 2018. So far, Warren has not worried much about appealing to them. Now that she’s the front-runner, can she begin to signal to Democrats that she wants to be ruthless about beating President Trump?

Joe Biden. He has yet to seem sharp for an entire debate. Can he break that streak and alleviate concerns about his ability to withstand a long, vicious campaign? I’m more interested in that than the narrow questions of how he responds to Trump’s false smears against his family.

Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. They are the best-positioned candidates to benefit from Biden’s uneven campaign and win over more moderate Democrats. Can any of the three make an explicit case: I’m stronger than Biden and more electable than Warren?"

Voters Who Want to Like Them?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/opinion/democrats-debate-republicans.html,"The best example of how candidates botch their approach is on the issue of abortion. A majority of Americans want to uphold Roe v. Wade, but a longstanding 80 percent of them support restrictions of some kind (according to 2019 Gallup polling), most notably in the third trimester (as of 2018 Gallup polling, 65 percent support restrictions in second trimester as well). Only Senator Amy Klobuchar and Ms. Gabbard have admitted to supporting third-trimester restrictions. The rest, including the current front-runners Senator Elizabeth Warren and the former vice president Joe Biden, have offered rare consideration for restrictions or conversation around why such large portions of the country support them.

Abortion and reproductive rights may not be a “deal breaker” vote for swing voters, as a recent Fox News poll revealed, but it is an issue that matters deeply to them, especially those who hold faith in high regard. More to the point, it’s curious that so many Democratic candidates hold a view consistent with so few voters. No one should swap genuine beliefs about abortion to appease polling numbers, but if these candidates represent the American people, they are statistically divergent from them in a dramatic way. This may mean a few of them are hiding their authentic beliefs about abortion for political safety — but that’s to their detriment.

The answer for candidates isn’t necessarily changing policy positions but offering room for conversation with those who support restrictions and respect for an alternative position that is rooted in genuine beliefs about the origins of life.

Even Mr. Biden, viewed as a moderate, has disappointed on the issue, reversing his long-held position on banning federal funds for abortion. This has damaged his “moderate” brand slightly. He has also given into relentless badgering from progressives, endorsing the Green New Deal and bowing to liberal sexual politics with his recent announcement that he would support men who identify as women being housed with females in prison.

All of this leftward marching, for Mr. Biden and others, moves candidates further from potential voters it’s necessary to win over. These folks may not vote for Mr. Trump (or vote at all), but Democrats stand to lose this opening with them for good. Now is the time to put formerly Republican voters on notice, as Ms. Gabbard has done with her distinctive approach.

They crave the anti-Trump, not a hypocritical Kamala Harris and her indefensible record on criminal justice. Ms. Harris describes herself as a “progressive prosecutor,” but infamously upheld multiple wrongful conviction cases and failed to support a ballot initiative that would reduce penalties for nonviolent crimes. These voters also have little interest in an opportunistic Mayor Pete Buttigieg: For years in Indiana politics, he worked “cordially” with Mike Pence, then the governor, but only since becoming a rising star in the Democratic Party has the mayor chosen to demean Mr. Pence’s religious beliefs.

Ms. Gabbard and Ms. Klobuchar — who also tends to focus on winnable, bipartisan issues like lowering the price of prescription drugs — appear to be the only two candidates to understand this opportunity for new votes."

But recent detentions of Americans have raised concerns. In June, a Koch Industries executive was held in southern China and interrogated for several days before being allowed to leave the country. Last month, a FedEx pilot was detained on charges of weapons smuggling. Though he was quickly released on bail, he remains under investigation and has not been allowed to leave the country.

In January, the State Department issued a travel advisory for China, warning Americans, particularly those with dual Chinese-American citizenship, that they may be prevented from leaving China if they go there.

The large network of English teachers in China, long a mainstay of the expatriate scene, appears to have come under particular scrutiny. For years, many education companies operating in China were known to have dabbled in a legal gray area, as the authorities often looked the other way.

Reports were widespread of foreign teachers working in China without proper visas. According to official estimates, while China had around 400,000 foreign citizens working in its education industry in 2017, only one-third had a valid work permit. Some schools, in turn, exploited that vulnerability, in some instances by withholding wages."

During the Q & A following a screening of “Blindspotting” — a movie that engages with police brutality against black people, systemic racial inequalities and gentrification — an older white woman in the audience asked the director if he was “afraid” while they were filming on location in Oakland, Calif. Instantly and jarringly, I was reminded of my other-ness within the room.

At a press screening of Steve McQueen’s “12 Years a Slave” several years ago, I sat through the dramatized depiction of the life of the slave Solomon Northup, in all of its austere, made-for-the-Oscars glory. After sitting through the subjugation of several black characters, especially Lupita Nyong’o’s Patsy, who is raped onscreen by her master and later suffers an excruciatingly unflinching whipping, I was emotionally drained by the weight of the horrors that had been depicted onscreen.

As the mostly white audience trickled out of the theater at the end, I overheard a man expressing relief to his companion: “I couldn’t last 12 minutes of all that, never mind 12 years!”

During the Black Out performance of “Slave Play,” I was shielded from having to endure such gross remarks for a couple of hours. Sure, it was awkward to see Kaneisha twerk to a Rihanna song in Mammy-ish garb for her white husband, who was dressed as a plantation overseer. Watching the researchers conducting the retreat (an interracial lesbian couple) lead the black participants in unpacking their resentment, anger and irritation toward their white partners was discomforting. (It also resurfaced many emotions based on my own past experiences with white romantic partners.) And it was difficult to sit with the play’s final moments, which involve a sexually violent and emotional catharsis.

But that night there seemed to be a fellowship among everyone, as people collectively gasped, provided audible ad-libs (“She’s crazy!” someone exclaimed, referring to the extremely oblivious and frequent interrupter Alana) and erupted into laughter or applause at some of the more outlandish or scabrous moments. If we all interpreted and felt about it differently, it still meant something to have the relief of freedom from judgment to express those responses.

There were fewer of us the second time I saw “Slave Play,” during one of the final preview showings last week. The audience was mostly white, and, unsurprisingly, that sense of community didn’t have quite the same power as it did during the Black Out. The audience was much more muted, though some of the show’s most pivotal moments and biggest comedic beats garnered similarly audible reactions.

It probably helped that I already knew what I was in for, but the experience wasn’t as uncomfortable as I thought it might be. It also doesn’t hurt that Harris’s script is clear in its intentions: The entire point of the therapy, and the reason the black characters desire to role-play antebellum fantasies, is because they want their partners to acknowledge their whiteness and the role racism plays in their every day lives."

Ms. Warren responded that she wanted to push Mr. Trump “out of the White House,” not just off Twitter. But she did not weigh in on whether the president’s favorite platform should suspend him.

Instead, she turned the discussion back toward antitrust and campaign finance laws, repeating that she had vowed not to take money from many corporate interests.

Here is a transcript of the exchange:

HARRIS: Senator Warren, I just want to say that I was surprised to hear that you did not agree with me that on this subject of what should be the rules around corporate responsibility for these big tech companies, when I called on Twitter to suspend Donald Trump’s account, that you did not agree. And I would urge you to join me because here we have Donald Trump, who has 65 million Twitter followers and is using that platform as the president of the United States to openly intimidate witnesses, to threaten witnesses, to obstruct justice. And he and his account should be taken down. We saw in El Paso that that shooter in his manifesto was informed by how Donald Trump uses that platform, and this is a matter of corporate responsibility. Twitter should be held accountable and shut down that site. It is a matter of safety and corporate accountability."

In addition to providing a ratings boon, an emphasis on politics wins accolades. HBO’s “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver,” a show that is as much journalism as it is comedy, has won the Emmy for outstanding variety talk series four years in a row. And with the 2020 campaign heating up, the presidential candidates Joseph R. Biden Jr., Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Beto O’Rourke, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker have all made the late-night rounds.

“If you’re a candidate now and you’re not on one of these shows or discussed by one of these hosts, you are not alive,” said Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran Democratic political consultant.

Hollywood stars are still staples of late night. “If I could have Tom Hanks every night, I would get him,” Mr. Licht said. Will Smith scored 3.9 million viewers for his recent appearance on Mr. Colbert’s show, and James Corden, the host of CBS’s “The Late Late Show,” has lately led the 12:30 a.m. time slot in total viewers with a program that often has the feel of a celebrity clubhouse.

But Mr. Corden’s rival Seth Meyers, the host of NBC’s “Late Night With Seth Meyers, ” drew more total viewers in the 2018-19 season thanks to a formula that had him devoting the first 20 minutes of his show to the latest on Mr. Trump. Mr. Meyers also led among adult viewers under 50 last season, and he remains the leader among that segment of the audience.

In this supercharged news environment, anchors like Bret Baier and Chris Wallace, both of Fox News, have been late-night guests, as have the CBS News stalwarts Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell. When Ms. King and Ms. O’Donnell were the lead guests on Mr. Colbert’s live show after the State of the Union address in February, they drew an audience of 4.6 million.

Jay Sures, a co-president of the United Talent Agency, which represents many news anchors, said he had noticed a spike in bookings for his clients. “They’ve unintentionally become celebrities based on how the news business has become part of our daily routine in a way it never has before,” he said. “The Trump era has elevated news.”"

This is a political process. And they’re leaning heavily into that idea with the eight-page letter the White House counsel sent tonight. We also see that in the polls: How people view Trump’s actions and the actions of House Democrats is split by party.

We also already know how this story almost certainly ends : Mr. Trump is not going to be convicted by the Senate. Does it matter for him whether there are one or two charges? His, and the White House’s, calculation is: no.

But isn’t that kind of resistance just going to harden Democrats’ belief that there’s some kind of cover-up?

Some witnesses could be really bad for the president, so the White House wants to have a broad position that they’re not going to play along. There were differing opinions internally about the case of Sondland, who some people thought would have had a story to tell that would have been helpful to Trump. But they ultimately decided — really late at night — that their position was about something broader.

Remember when they decided to release the transcript of Trump’s call with Ukraine’s president? In that case, they clearly made the opposite calculation: Looking like we’re hiding something is worse than the facts in the transcript, which were pretty bad. Now, they’ve basically decided that looking like they’re hiding something is better than looking like they’re cooperating with what they’re calling an illegitimate investigation. House Democrats have only had one witness so far, Kurt Volker, and look how much House Democrats got! They have in writing that there could have been a quid pro quo. What else could they find with even just one more?"

Rebecca Ryan, a professor of psychology at Georgetown, who was a co-author on that study, said that with children 3 to 5 years old, college-educated mothers spent on average 14 minutes a day in teaching activities, whereas mothers with a high school degree or less spend about five minutes a day. So the individual amounts are relatively small, but when you multiply those differences out across the endless (or all-too-short) days of child rearing, they can be profound.

“Whatever the myth of hyperparenting is, there is basically no parent who spends two hours a day reading or doing puzzles,” Dr. Kalil said. “The average amount of time parents spend a day is between 20 and 30 minutes.”

And the biggest difference is between parents who don’t do any of those developmentally stimulating activities and parents who do something, she said, which is why the focus of parenting programs and interventions should be to get parents to put in some minutes — not hours — on a regular basis. “What I believe is that what really matters is regular steady habits of modest investment,” she said.

And yes, the parents in the zero-minutes-a-day group are disproportionately low-income and less well educated, though there are certainly plenty of low-income families where lots of reading and talking and involvement goes on. For those at zero, “to shift the needle on moving them closer to what middle class or rich parents do does not mean asking them to read an hour a night,” Dr. Kalil said. “It means reducing the number of days when nothing happens.”

Dr. Kalil directs the center for human potential and public policy, where she studies low-income families. “We’ve interviewed thousands of low-income parents in Chicago,” she said. “They know reading is important, they have books in their house, but for a variety of reasons, because life in low-income circumstances is more stressful and more unpredictable, low-income families have a harder time following through on these aspirations.”

By working with text message reminders, she said, parents can set goals for what they want to do with their children. In another study, these behavioral tools more than doubled the amount of time parents spent engaging with their children."

Note: Facebook ad spending data from March 24 to Oct. 5. | Sources: Bully Pulpit Interactive; Facebook

When it comes to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s Facebook ads, the odds are overwhelming that people seeing them were born before 1975. For Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the opposite is true: People born in 1975 or after are more than twice as likely to see his Facebook ads than those born earlier. A gender split is clear, too: About half of Mr. Sanders’s audience are men, while about two-thirds of Mr. Biden’s are women.

Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, more or less, splits the difference between them. She has targeted a Facebook audience that more closely mirrors the projected universe of likely Democratic primary voters in 2020: more women than men (though not by as much as Mr. Biden), leaning older more than younger (but again, not by as much as Mr. Biden).

Collectively, the 19 current Democratic candidates for president have poured nearly $32 million into Facebook ads this year — more money than they have spent so far on television ads, a striking measure of the social network's ever-rising influence in politics. The heavy spending on Facebook comes even as leading party officials have raised alarms about the site’s role in American democracy.

Ms. Warren sparred with Facebook in recent days over the company’s willingness to run false ads. She has been a heavy spender nonetheless, pouring $172,000 into the site over the seven most recent days records are available.

The advertising decisions that each campaign makes on one of the Internet’s biggest platforms offer an almost unparalleled window into their political priorities and strategies, illuminating their core supporters and providing a glimpse into their potential coalitions. The spending patterns reveal not just who the campaigns are targeting but where.

The 2020 race marks the first presidential campaign where Facebook is publicly publishing who is buying ads — and whom they are targeting. This story is based on Facebook data compiled and analyzed by Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic consultancy. Its database includes estimates of which gender and age group every candidate has targeted since March but not does not include race or ethnicity, which Facebook does not explicitly allow campaigns to use for targeted ads.

Because campaigns receive so much real-time feedback from Facebook, they are able to precisely hone their audiences.

“You can prioritize toward people taking the action you want them to take,” said Alex Kellner, a Democratic strategist at Bully Pulpit. “Facebook helps you optimize toward the outcome you want.”

Aside from Mr. Sanders and Mr. Yang, candidates are mostly reaching out to older voters.

Note: Includes only spending where gender is identified.

Among the leading candidates, Mr. Sanders targets a younger and more male audience on Facebook. That mirrors his support in polls, which regularly show him strongest among young voters, and performing better among men than women.

“There’s a reason why they’re called ‘Bernie Bros,’” said Jefrey Pollock, a Democratic pollster who formerly advised Senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s campaign. “Nothing about him targeting younger men is surprising to me.”

One of the most striking findings of the Facebook advertising data is just how little Mr. Biden is spending to reach the youngest generation of voters. Less than one half of 1 percent of Mr. Biden’s Facebook ad buys have targeted users born in 1995 or later. That was the smallest share — and smallest dollar amount — that any of the 11 other candidates who will be on the debate stage Tuesday spent for any age segment.

Mr. Biden spent less than $12,000 targeting voters younger than 25 through the beginning of October. Mr. Sanders spent nearly half a million dollars targeting the same age group, according to Bully Pulpit.

Emily Williams, a Democratic digital strategist who worked on Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign, said Mr. Biden’s lack of spending on young voters was a cause for concern. “It says to me that they’re struggling to break through with younger voters,” she said, “and I hope it doesn’t mean they’ve given up on younger voters.”

Mr. Biden’s bread and butter was older women: Fifty-five percent of his entire Facebook ad budget was devoted to women 45 or older, including some ads last month about Medicare.

The targeted audience for this Biden ad on Medicare was overwhelmingly women 65 or older. Source: Facebook

It makes sense that the demographic groups targeted by the leading candidates look a lot like their existing supporters, digital strategists said, because much of the advertising so far has been seeking out new donors. A campaign’s best bet is serving ads to its base.

Still, the degree to which Facebook advertising aligns with polling can be almost eerie.

In a Quinnipiac poll last week, Mr. Biden led the field by a wide margin among voters who were at least 65 years old — the same segment he tops in Facebook ad spending. In the same survey, Mr. Sanders dominated among those 18 to 34 years old — where Mr. Sanders dominates in spending. Ms. Warren came in second in the poll among both extreme ends of the age spectrum, while she led among voters 35 to 65 years old.

On Facebook, Ms. Warren’s share of spending fell in between Mr. Sanders’s and Mr. Biden’s for every age segment.

Her spending splits were closely aligned with those of Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., whose spending skewed slightly younger and more male. The age and gender groups targeted by the billionaire Tom Steyer, who entered the race in July and has quickly outspent all his rivals, was similar to Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren.

“A new generation of leadership” ad from Mr. Buttigieg’s campaign targets older women. Source: Facebook

A majority of Mr. Buttigieg’s Facebook spending has gone to those aged 45 years and above, despite running as a candidate for a “new generation,” a phrase featured in some of his ads. (Mr. Buttigieg wrote in his autobiography that back in his first run for mayor as a 29-year-old, older voters were more likely to see his youth as a positive.)

Candidates’ ad spending largely skews female.

Almost all of the candidates in the debate on Tuesday are advertising to a majority-female audience on Facebook. But the campaign most lopsidedly targeting women on Facebook is not one of the four female candidates at the debate, but Julián Castro, the former federal housing secretary. Jennifer Fiore, a senior adviser to Mr. Castro, was not surprised by that fact.

She noted that Mr. Castro’s campaign manager and other top strategists are women and that Mr. Castro has made his mother a big part of his pitch, featuring her in video ads on Facebook earlier this year. (Of late, the campaign has also run Facebook ads with pictures of puppies, touting that Mr. Castro would “make animal abuse a federal crime.”)

An ad about Julian Castro’s pet euthanasia policy was shown mostly to women. Source: Facebook

“We’re targeting women because women are responding,” Ms. Fiore said.

That self-reinforcing truism is a feature across the platform: Operatives said that Facebook’s formulas encourage advertisers to double-down on whatever demographic groups are already clicking, driving those candidates with older bases to target ever older audiences, and vice versa.

That, for instance, is how Andrew Yang, the former tech executive, is targeting an overwhelmingly male and young audience. (Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii skews slightly more male but she is spending a fraction of what Mr. Yang is.)

An ad with Ms. Gabbard describing her foreign policy while standing in front of an American flag was disproportionately shown to men. Source: Facebook

“The Facebook algorithm optimizes for people who are taking action,” said Eric Ming, the director of paid media for the Yang campaign, explaining that Mr. Yang’s demographics are younger and more male because that is where his message is resonating. The ads also often feature cartoon character versions of the candidate.

Digital strategists describe three phases to online advertising in campaigns. The first is acquiring new donors and supporters. The second is persuading undecided voters. The third is getting people out to vote.

For the most part, campaigns have been focused on the first phase. But some have begun to invest in persuasion — and it’s visible in their geographic splits.

Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Steyer are dominant in the first four voting states.

Note: Data from Sept. 1 to Oct. 5. | Source: Bully Pulpit Interactive

For Senator Kamala Harris of California, her biggest states for advertising in the spring were those with the biggest populations: California, New York, Texas and Florida. But in July, she shifted. Her biggest state for Facebook advertising in each of the last three months has been Iowa, a shift made in spending priorities long before she publicly announced her “pivot” to focus on that state’s leadoff caucuses.

In September, for the first time, South Carolina jumped up to one of her biggest spending states. That month, she spent $52,000 there on Facebook, second to Mr. Steyer.

Mr. Buttigieg has been the biggest spender on Facebook nationally, besides Mr. Steyer and his virtually unlimited budget. Mr. Buttigieg’s dominance is particularly apparent in the opening states of Iowa and New Hampshire. In September, Mr. Buttigieg was the top spender in both states by a wide margin. In fact, he spent more than all his rivals, other than Mr. Steyer, combined.

As the Democrats have focused on the critical primary contests, President Trump has flooded Facebook with messaging aimed at the general election. In the last month, he spent more than $700,000 on Facebook ads just in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida — four swing states he narrowly carried in 2016.

“Danger, danger, danger!” said Betsy Hoover, who was the director of digital organizing for Mr. Obama’s re-election campaign and is unaligned in the 2020 primary.

Ms. Hoover said she worries that Democrats are “focusing on the coasts or early states — none of which matter in the general,” while Mr. Trump is delivering his message to key voters.

“We are running a primary strategy and Trump is running a general election strategy,” she said, “And that’s terrifying.”"

I used to think calling cars “death machines” was kind of extreme. Then my niece was hit by one.

She was only 9 years old, out with her family in Los Angeles and running toward an ice cream truck. She was hit with such force that most of her front teeth were knocked out. She is lucky to be alive.

Thinking about my niece made me recall all the other times members of my family had been injured by cars. My husband’s grandmother was killed. My aunt and uncle were seriously injured. I was even involved in a hit-and-run in a crosswalk in front of my school when I was a kid and broke my leg.

Most of us have stories like this — a car coming into our lives and unleashing horrendous damage on our loved ones, friends, family and even ourselves.

Cars are death machines. Pedestrian fatalities in the United States have increased 41 percent since 2008; more than 6,000 pedestrians were killed in 2018 alone. More than 4,000 American kids are killed in car crashes every year – I am thankful every day my niece wasn’t one of them.

Here’s the thing: Statistics clearly don’t seem to persuade anyone of the magnitude of this problem. Not policy makers or automakers, technologists or drivers.

If numbers don’t change minds, can personal experiences?

I conducted an experiment on Twitter this summer, asking people to share my tweet if a car had hit them, or anyone they knew. It was shared thousands of times and more than 500 people shared stories of being hit, losing family and friends, and sustaining injuries that impact their daily lives.

A driver bolted toward traffic without stopping at the stop sign. He hit me broadside, sending me into traffic that was thankfully empty at the moment. The next thing I remember was being helped onto the grass with my bent-up bike and someone asking me where I lived. I was in 5th grade at the time. That's only one of three stories I have. Alexandra Watson, Boulder, CO Nick Cote for The New York Times I was hit by a car when I was 15. Riding a bike down a street near my house, a car turned left in front of me. I survived only because the hood was low and broad enough that I catapulted over it rather than impacting the side. Skip Pile A truck pulled up alongside me at a red light. When the light turned green, I started going, but was whacked on the back of my head by a side mirror (I think), was sent into the right lane, bounced off the side, and, still fighting to keep upright, finally fell — under the moving gravel truck. I ended up with a broken pelvis and an education in how judges assign liability. Dan Turner, Oakland, CA Max Whittaker for The New York Times I was “doored” by a car twice and hit in a crosswalk — all on bikes. Don’t tell my mom. Molly Cohen I was hit by cars while on a bike three times in two years in L.A. Two right-hooks, one road-raged me into a row of parked cars. Hit once on San Pablo in Oakland: a thrown-open door that I bent all the way back and flipped over the top. He demanded I pay to repair his car door and threatened to get his gun before he ran. Christopher Kidd, Oakland, CA Max Whittaker for The New York Times

There are many who say that autonomous or smart cars will solve this. So far, I’m unpersuaded. Since 2014, over $80 billion dollars has been spent on “smart” or connected cars (more on these in a minute) and autonomous vehicles, arguably to make cars safer. But investing in the car of the future is investing in the wrong problem. We need to be thinking about how we can create a world with fewer cars.

Among the safety measures proposed by car companies are encouraging pedestrians and bicyclists to use R.F.I.D. tags, which emit signals that cars can detect. This means it’s becoming the pedestrian’s responsibility to avoid getting hit. But if keeping people safe means putting the responsibility on them (or worse, criminalizing walking and biking), we need to think twice about the technology we’re developing.

This may be the worst outcome of the automobile-centered 20th century: the assumption that it’s people who need to get out of the way of these lethal machines, instead of the other way around.

I was biking in the street after work when a car pulled out of a parking garage without looking and clipped my back tire. I went down, but fortunately only did some deep tissue damage that healed in a week. My bike tires were pretty bent and had to be replaced; I was a lucky one. J. R. Raith I was hit by a car in July 2017 in San Francisco. I was getting out of an Uber and the driver, who just dropped me off, backed over me as I waited to cross the street. Danny Harris, Upper East Side, Manhattan, New York Joshua Bright for The New York Times Two years ago, a drunk driver ran over me with his pickup truck. He kept going — hit and run. No one on the scene thought I'd make it. The doctors didn't believe I'd make it. I had skull fractures, a broken jaw in three places and wired shut, a punched lung with added tracheotomy. I was in a coma for a week, and woke up alone. Ryan Cary Wear I was hit by a car when I was 11, in Queens. I was knocked to the ground, but otherwise unhurt because the car was moving slowly. The driver got out and made sure I was O.K. before leaving. Three of my friends (one pedestrian and two cyclists, all adults) were killed by cars. Lauren Weinberg, Waterloo, Ontario Tara Walton for The New York Times

Many so-called advances in car design may, thus far, be making things much worse. The internet-equipped “connected car,” for example, initially introduced by Cadillac in 1996 as a luxury safety feature known as OnStar, has morphed into something else entirely. Increasingly large and complicated dashboard screens take cognitive resources away from the task at hand, which is driving, and have the potential to be as dangerous as texting while driving.

Just as all these interested parties scramble to make cars more technologically complex, they’ve gone all-in on making them bigger, much bigger. Americans are buying — and car manufacturers are producing — more S.U.V.s than ever before, a shift that has led to a 69 percent increase in pedestrian fatalities, according to the Governors Highway Safety Association.

Because the front end of an S.U.V. is higher than the average car’s front end, it is far more likely to hit a pedestrian in the chest or head and twice as likely to kill walkers, runners, cyclists and children, compared to regular cars. And yet, S.U.V. sales account for 60 percent of new vehicle sales.

One of the easiest ways to make cars safer would be to make them smaller. Another way? Figuring out how to get people to drive less by providing safer, more sustainable alternatives to the car.

I was hit by a car when a lady had a seizure and ran headlong into me. It’s been over nine years now. I had one cervical spine surgery and need another. I have headaches every day and terrible neurological symptoms. I used public transit for years when I was more able-bodied, and fewer cars isn't the answer when you have disabilities. Erin Gilmer Once as a cyclist in the ’burbs. Once as a pedestrian in Brooklyn. And another time as a cyclist in Brooklyn, I was forced off the road into a parked car Ronald Marans, Upper East Side, Manhattan, New York Joshua Bright for The New York Times I've been hit by cars twice in San Francisco. Both in the Mission District. Both drivers were making illegal left turns into me. Both drivers were irate that my body impact damaged their car. Jeff Tumlin I was hit while cycling by a left-turning truck driver who said I ""came out of nowhere."" I was airlifted to the hospital and had seven broken bones, five surgeries, spent three months in hospital, one year in a wheelchair. The driver went to jail ... Just kidding, of course he only got a ticket. No real consequences. Lou Savastani, Narberth, PA Mark Makela for The New York Times I got knocked down by a taxi that sped off outside Jemaa el-Fnaa in Marrakech, Morocco. A lovely rug merchant rushed over, insisted I drink his tonic water for the “quinine.” I said “Shukran! But I don’t think I got malaria.” Yet I was revived and appreciate his kindness. Lila Kerns My 12-year-old son was killed in a crash in front of our home on Oct. 8, 2013. Sammy kissed me goodbye and said, “I love you Mommy.” I never imagined those would be his last words. Sammy was bright, kind, athletic and had a huge heart. We miss him every day. After his death, I joined with others and helped found Families for Safe Streets in N.Y.C. Amy Cohen, New York City Demetrius Freeman for The New York Times

I’m not so naïve to think we can get rid of cars altogether, but we have so many tools to eliminate traffic-related injuries and fatalities right now. Banning all passenger auto-driving vehicles above a certain weight and front grill height would be a great start. Other solutions run the gamut from the quick and easy fixes — like reducing speed limits, eliminating right turns on red, building protected bike lanes and instituting congestion pricing — to major and necessary commitments like funding new transit projects (upgrading, maintaining and expanding existing transit systems) and rethinking land use to encourage walkable development rather than sprawl.

We can all commit to driving less, which reduces both CO2 emissions and the potential for crashes. We need to be as defensive about crosswalks and bike lanes as drivers are about their cars (and where we believe we are entitled to park them).

Until then, the streets will belong to the death machines."

On Thursday, the City of San Antonio approved a $205,000 payout to Ms. Simms, 40, after she said in the suit that the city had violated her constitutional rights and that the officer had conducted a vaginal cavity examination in public with male officers nearby. She also sued the police officer who conducted the 2016 search, Mara Wilson.

“No amount of money will replace what’s been taken away from Natalie, which is her dignity,” Dean Malone, a lawyer for Ms. Simms, said in a phone interview. The two parties negotiated the amount in August, he added. “What matters to Natalie is at least an acknowledgment that she was harmed.”

Andy Segovia, the city attorney for San Antonio, said in a statement, “We were able to resolve this matter with this proposed settlement and believe it to be in the best interest of all involved.”"
