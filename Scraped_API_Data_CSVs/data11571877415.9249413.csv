With the proposal, Mr. Sanders is embracing an idea that has been a centerpiece of the campaign of his top progressive rival, Senator Elizabeth Warren. But while Ms. Warren came first, Mr. Sanders is going bigger. His wealth tax would apply to a larger number of households, impose a higher top rate and raise more money.

Mr. Sanders’s plan to tax accumulated wealth, not just income, is particularly aggressive in how it would erode the fortunes of billionaires. His tax would cut in half the wealth of the typical billionaire after 15 years, according to two economists who worked with the Sanders campaign on the plan. Mr. Sanders would use the money generated by his wealth tax to fund the housing plan he released last week and a forthcoming plan for universal child care, as well as to help pay for “Medicare for all.”

“Let me be very clear: As president of the United States, I will reduce the outrageous and grotesque and immoral level of income and wealth inequality,” Mr. Sanders said in an interview. “What we are trying to do is demand and implement a policy which significantly reduces income and wealth inequality in America by telling the wealthiest families in this country they cannot have so much wealth.”"

Here's How Those Plans Would Work (or Not). - The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/24/business/economy/wealth-tax-rich.html,"Among Democratic presidential candidates, it’s the rallying cry of the moment — tax the rich. The idea is a centerpiece of the campaigns of Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders. A former candidate, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, went so far as to say the government ought to “tax the hell out of the wealthy.”

The new taxes would fund a laundry list of liberal proposals — “Medicare for all,” free college, combating global warming and rebuilding roads and bridges.

But these measures will face fierce opposition, including from wealthy donors. Republicans in Congress are sure to oppose new taxes, making passage impossible unless Democrats take both houses of Congress in 2020. Whatever their political fate, these proposals represent the broadest rethinking of tax policy in decades.

“We seem to go back and forth between Democrats and Republicans on taxing the rich, depending on who is in power,” said Eric Toder, co-director of the Tax Policy Center. “But the Democrats now are a good deal more aggressive than they’ve been in the past.”

Four ideas have gained the most traction: a tax on wealth, raising marginal tax rates, expanding the estate tax and changing how the government taxes capital gains.

Creating a Wealth Tax

How many people would pay? Relatively few. Would it reduce inequality? Almost certainly. How much money could it raise for the government? A lot. Would the rich find ways to avoid or evade this tax? Probably.

In January, Ms. Warren took a bold new approach by proposing to tax wealth, not just income. Her proposal would impose a 2 percent tax on assets above $50 million, or the top 70,000 families by wealth, in a nation of nearly 330 million people. Someone with $100 million in assets would pay $1 million a year. Fortunes over $1 billion would be subject to an additional 1 percent surcharge.

The tax, akin to how property taxes work, would be aimed at a group that controls a growing portion of the nation’s wealth. The 400 richest Americans own 3.5 percent of the country’s assets, according to Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, economists at the University of California, Berkeley, who have advised Ms. Warren. Over time, her tax would reduce that to 2 percent, according to Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman. If it had been in place since 1982, the fortune of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, would now be $87 billion, rather than $160 billion, they estimate, using figures from before his divorce.

Ms. Warren’s proposal would bring in $2.6 trillion over 10 years, according to Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman. At $260 billion a year, that is a small share of total annual federal spending of $4.4 trillion. Lawrence Summers, a former Treasury secretary, and Natasha Sarin, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, have disputed earlier estimates by the two economists as overly optimistic.

On Tuesday Mr. Sanders is proposing his own wealth tax, one that goes after mega-wealth even more aggressively than Ms. Warren’s proposal. His graduated tax would start at 1 percent for assets of more than $32 million, climbing to 8 percent for wealth exceeding $10 billion. The tax would raise an estimated $4.35 trillion over a decade.

As appealing as a wealth tax might sound for the party’s liberal base, enacting it would pose major challenges. Anyone lucky enough to be in its sights has access to top tax lawyers and accountants who can sift through the tax code for a way out, or at least a means of minimizing the hit.

European countries have had mixed success with wealth taxes. Weak enforcement and offshore havens have enabled many individuals to greatly reduce what they owe. The Internal Revenue Service would need detailed reports from banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions to make the tax effective.

“It could raise a lot of money but probably less than Elizabeth Warren thinks,” Mr. Toder said.

Raising top income tax rates

How many people would pay? Not many. Would it reduce inequality? Probably. How much money could it raise for the government? A modest amount. Would the rich find ways to avoid or evade this tax? Yes.

Raising the top income tax rate is one of the most straightforward ways to tax the rich and some prominent Democrats have embraced it. For example, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York City has said that the government should impose a 70 percent tax on earnings above $10 million.

While that might sound radical, it would actually represent a return to tax policies that prevailed for decades. The top income tax rate stood at 70 percent as recently as 1980, and was even higher before then, topping 90 percent in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Highest marginal tax rate 100 percent 80 1940 81% 60 40 2018 37% 20 0 ’18 1940 ’50 ’60 ’70 ’80 ’90 ’00 ’10 100 percent 80 1940 81% 60 40 2018 37% 20 0 1940 ’50 ’60 ’70 ’80 ’90 ’00 ’10 ’18 100 percent 80 1940 81% 60 40 2018 37% 20 0 1940 ’50 ’60 ’70 ’80 ’90 ’00 ’10 ’18 Source: Tax Policy Center

In terms of inequality, it would effectively reduce some of the extremes in pay that have developed in recent decades. The vast fortunes accumulated by a few dozen billionaires have also made new taxes more politically palatable. For example, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s 70 percent tax would be paid by about 21,000 taxpayers.

Over 10 years, her proposal would raise up to $382 billion, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model. That is about half as much as the government will spend on the Defense Department this fiscal year.

With the help of accountants and lawyers, the wealthy would no doubt try to find ways to convert earned income into capital gains or business income, which are currently taxed at lower rates.

Raising the estate tax

How many people would pay? Not many. Would it reduce inequality? A lot. How much money could it raise for the government? A modest amount. Would the rich find ways to avoid or evade this tax? Most likely.

Experts say inherited wealth is an important driver of inequality. The estate tax is meant to combat that, but in recent decades lawmakers have made it easier for taxpayers to avoid it. Mr. Sanders wants to change that.

Under his proposal, the estate tax rate would begin at 45 percent for assets worth more than $3.5 million and rise to 77 percent for those with more than $1 billion. The proposal would apply to just 0.2 percent of the population, according to Mr. Sanders.

The senator’s plan would raise $315 billion over 10 years, or less than half of military spending this year. But the higher tax on estates worth more than $1 billion could raise $2.2 trillion over the long term. Mr. Sanders has said he wants the money to pay for his ambitious agenda of social programs.

Ms. Warren has also proposed expanding the estate tax as part of a housing bill. The estate tax would start at 55 percent and rise to 75 percent. She has said that the tax would affect 14,000 wealthy families a year.

Lawyers and accountants have devised many strategies for avoiding the estate tax, said Kyle Pomerleau, chief economist at the Tax Foundation. Of course, if Congress were to adopt Mr. Sanders’s proposal, lawmakers could also try to close some of those loopholes.

Raising capital gains tax rates

How many people would pay? Relatively few taxpayers. Would it reduce inequality? Most likely. How much money could it raise for the government? A lot. Would the rich find ways to avoid or evade this tax? Possibly.

Several Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden, want to end the discrepancy between how different kinds of income are taxed. To wit, long-term capital gains are taxed at a top rate of 20 percent, but the top rate for salary and wage income is 37 percent.

Lower taxes on investment income skew the system in favor of wealthier households and raising capital gains tax rates would change that.

As of 2016, about 80 percent of the income of households that earn less than $198,000 a year comes in the form of wages and salaries, according to a paper by Lily Batchelder and David Kamin of the New York University School of Law. By contrast, capital gains and dividends account for 70 percent of the income of the families that earn $53 million or more a year.

“The way that the very top of earners in our country make money is very different from the rest,” Mr. Kamin said.

The top 10 percent of households by income own 84 percent of all stocks. Mr. Biden’s plan is aimed at this group and would raise the capital gains rate to 39.6 percent for top earners.

Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, who is not running for president, would go further still by fundamentally changing how capital gains are taxed, at least for the wealthiest Americans. He recently proposed taxing the appreciation of stocks held by the richest 0.3 percent of households, even if those gains haven’t been realized. Mr. Wyden also favors equalizing the rate at which earned income and capital gains are taxed.

The senator’s proposal would have the effect of trimming the wings of billionaires who have watched their fortunes soar but haven’t sold their shares.

The proposal from Mr. Wyden would raise an estimated $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion over 10 years, which would be earmarked for Social Security. Mr. Biden would allocate money raised in part from hiking capital gains taxes to pay the $750 billion cost of expanding coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

Simply raising capital gains taxes without other reforms is tricky as taxpayers could choose not to sell stocks to avoid owing money. Based on research it has analyzed, the Tax Policy Center estimates that raising the capital gains rate above 30 percent would reduce revenues, Mr. Toder said. Taxing appreciation as Mr. Wyden has proposed would help address this."

Associates say Mr. Biden is infuriated by Mr. Trump’s conduct and astonished by the president’s willingness to dismiss some of the most basic ethical lines in American politics.

In Wilmington, Del., Tuesday, Mr. Biden called the president’s actions an “abuse of power’’ that undermined national security, and said he would support impeachment if Mr. Trump did not provide information related to congressional investigations.

In some respects, Mr. Trump’s conduct has reinforced the central message of Mr. Biden’s appeal to Democratic voters: that the country is threatened by an out-of-control presidency, and that ousting Mr. Trump is more important than any other policy goal Democrats might share.

At fund-raisers and other events, Democrats who have spoken with Mr. Biden in recent days say he has largely appeared measured, greeting old friends in his typical effusive style and keeping the focus on his concerns with Mr. Trump’s foreign policy, rather than dwelling on the challenges the moment raises for his family.

Still unclear in this moment of crisis is what conclusions Democratic voters might make about Mr. Biden as an opponent for Mr. Trump, and how a drive for impeachment in Congress might shape the Democratic primary campaign.

Capitalism needs a wealth tax

The idea of a wealth tax is not new, but it gained mainstream popularity with the publication in 2013 of the French economist Thomas Piketty’s “Capital in the Twenty-First Century,” the book that launched a thousand think pieces. Mr. Piketty, who has expressed support for both Ms. Warren’s and Mr. Sanders’s campaigns, argued that a capitalist economy inevitably produces wealth inequality that is self-perpetuating and, if left unchecked, “potentially terrifying.” He wrote:

When the rate of return on capital exceeds the rate of growth of output and income, as it did in the nineteenth century and seems quite likely to do again in the twenty-first, capitalism automatically generates arbitrary and unsustainable inequalities that radically undermine the meritocratic values on which democratic societies are based.

To avert what he calls “patrimonial capitalism,” where rich people get ever richer only by virtue of being rich in the first place, Mr. Piketty prescribed a global wealth tax, progressing from 1 percent on assets of one million euros to 5 to 10 percent on assets above a billion euros (as well as an “optimal” top marginal income tax in developed countries around 80 percent).

“Short of that, many may turn against globalization,” he wrote with prescience in The Financial Times in 2014. “If, one day, they found a common voice, it would speak the disremembered mantras of nationalism and economic isolation.”

A wealth tax may not work

Even those sympathetic to the spirit of a wealth tax acknowledge that there are considerable pragmatic obstacles to its implementation. Even if there were sufficient political will to pass it, it could face a constitutional challenge. Megan McArdle , a libertarian Washington Post columnist, writes:

The big problem is Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution, which forbids “direct taxes” on people or property unless they’re “apportioned” — doled out among the states by population. Instituting an income tax required a constitutional amendment to override that clause, and Warren’s plan might well require another.

Both Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have cited numerous legal experts who say a wealth tax would be constitutional. But with the Supreme Court’s composition being what it is, the question is far from settled.

There’s also the matter of enforcement. As Paul Krugman notes, the wealthy are quite good at avoiding taxes and evading them illegally. And because many assets owned by the ultra-wealthy — like artwork and diamonds — aren’t always traded on the market, Ms. McArdle writes, taxing them would mean “creating a lot of administrative capacity to track and price the assets, with the wealthy and their lawyers fighting every step of the way.”

“If these difficulties prove insurmountable,” writes Noah Smith, a left-leaning economist, in Bloomberg, “Warren and other egalitarian tax crusaders might consider an alternative — an inheritance tax, which would close many of the loopholes that now riddle the U.S. estate tax.” He adds:

Taxing all income from inheritances — including trusts, foundations, gifts, estates, and any other kind of family transfers — at a very high rate would yield a result similar to a small annual wealth tax, only its constitutionality would be less in doubt. And it would focus the tax on the rich people whose fortunes Americans are most likely to think of as being undeserved.

A wealth tax is a bad idea

Skeptics of the idea of a wealth tax argue that it has a bumpy track record. While 12 European countries had a wealth tax in 1990, Greg Rosalsky writes in NPR, only three (Norway, Spain and Switzerland) still do. He writes:

According to reports by the OECD and others, there were some clear themes with the policy: it was expensive to administer, it was hard on people with lots of assets but little cash, it distorted saving and investment decisions, it pushed the rich and their money out of the taxing countries — and, perhaps worst of all, it didn’t raise much revenue.

An economist and leading inequality scholar who has advised Ms. Warren, Gabriel Zucman of the University of California, Berkeley, says that her wealth tax is designed with those failures in mind, since it applies only to the ultra-wealthy, taxes citizens wherever they live and imposes a 40 percent “exit tax” on Americans worth more than $50 million who renounce their citizenship.

Still others oppose the idea on principle, for the very reasons many support it. Michael R. Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, writes in Bloomberg:

Warren’s wealth tax would be an abuse of government power. It is the tax-code equivalent of looting mansions. What is wrong with the way these 75,000 families made their money? Paying taxes is not a punishment, and the tax code should not be used to penalize any group of citizens. Not even the very rich.

A wealth tax is only a start

A wealth tax could close the country’s wealth gap from the top, and the universal social programs it helps fund could go some way to closing the wealth gap at the bottom. But more targeted redistributive measures, like reparations, may be needed to completely close the gap between blacks and whites, argues William Darity Jr., a professor of public policy at Duke University. He told The Times:

That’s an objective that is not achieved by any of the existing policies on the table now. Ultimately, you need a person-based program if you’re really concerned about the racial wealth gap. And it not only has to be person-based, but it has to be race-specific.

Some on the left have also criticized the idea of a wealth tax as utopian in its belief that those at capitalism’s helm would steer the system in a direction it by nature does not want to go. To fix the problem at the root, writes Benjamin Kunkel in The London Review of Books, imagine a market socialist revolution through which the shares of all corporations are transferred into public hands. With ownership of the means of production more evenly distributed, inequality wouldn’t deepen automatically as Mr. Piketty says it does under capitalism. Mr. Kunkel writes:

The notion of such a revolution — first in one country, then gatheringly international but not yet universal — is fanciful right now. But is it more so than a global capital tax requiring the coordination of virtually all nations? … Socialist revolution frankly seems more likely. … Capitalism can dispense with democracy more easily than with profits.

THE TAKEAWAY

In “Capital,” Mr. Piketty himself wrote that his idea of a progressive global wealth tax was indeed “utopian.” Yet he also said that the United States, producing as it does a quarter of global G.D.P., wouldn’t need to “ask permission” from other countries to pioneer the policy."

Capitalism needs a wealth tax

The idea of a wealth tax is not new, but it gained mainstream popularity with the publication in 2013 of the French economist Thomas Piketty’s “Capital in the Twenty-First Century,” the book that launched a thousand think pieces. Mr. Piketty, who has expressed support for both Ms. Warren’s and Mr. Sanders’s campaigns, argued that a capitalist economy inevitably produces wealth inequality that is self-perpetuating and, if left unchecked, “potentially terrifying.” He wrote:

When the rate of return on capital exceeds the rate of growth of output and income, as it did in the nineteenth century and seems quite likely to do again in the twenty-first, capitalism automatically generates arbitrary and unsustainable inequalities that radically undermine the meritocratic values on which democratic societies are based.

To avert what he calls “patrimonial capitalism,” where rich people get ever richer only by virtue of being rich in the first place, Mr. Piketty prescribed a global wealth tax, progressing from 1 percent on assets of one million euros to 5 to 10 percent on assets above a billion euros (as well as an “optimal” top marginal income tax in developed countries around 80 percent).

“Short of that, many may turn against globalization,” he wrote with prescience in The Financial Times in 2014. “If, one day, they found a common voice, it would speak the disremembered mantras of nationalism and economic isolation.”

A wealth tax may not work

Even those sympathetic to the spirit of a wealth tax acknowledge that there are considerable pragmatic obstacles to its implementation. Even if there were sufficient political will to pass it, it could face a constitutional challenge. Megan McArdle , a libertarian Washington Post columnist, writes:

The big problem is Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution, which forbids “direct taxes” on people or property unless they’re “apportioned” — doled out among the states by population. Instituting an income tax required a constitutional amendment to override that clause, and Warren’s plan might well require another.

Both Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have cited numerous legal experts who say a wealth tax would be constitutional. But with the Supreme Court’s composition being what it is, the question is far from settled.

There’s also the matter of enforcement. As Paul Krugman notes, the wealthy are quite good at avoiding taxes and evading them illegally. And because many assets owned by the ultra-wealthy — like artwork and diamonds — aren’t always traded on the market, Ms. McArdle writes, taxing them would mean “creating a lot of administrative capacity to track and price the assets, with the wealthy and their lawyers fighting every step of the way.”

“If these difficulties prove insurmountable,” writes Noah Smith, a left-leaning economist, in Bloomberg, “Warren and other egalitarian tax crusaders might consider an alternative — an inheritance tax, which would close many of the loopholes that now riddle the U.S. estate tax.” He adds:

Taxing all income from inheritances — including trusts, foundations, gifts, estates, and any other kind of family transfers — at a very high rate would yield a result similar to a small annual wealth tax, only its constitutionality would be less in doubt. And it would focus the tax on the rich people whose fortunes Americans are most likely to think of as being undeserved.

A wealth tax is a bad idea

Skeptics of the idea of a wealth tax argue that it has a bumpy track record. While 12 European countries had a wealth tax in 1990, Greg Rosalsky writes in NPR, only three (Norway, Spain and Switzerland) still do. He writes:

According to reports by the OECD and others, there were some clear themes with the policy: it was expensive to administer, it was hard on people with lots of assets but little cash, it distorted saving and investment decisions, it pushed the rich and their money out of the taxing countries — and, perhaps worst of all, it didn’t raise much revenue.

An economist and leading inequality scholar who has advised Ms. Warren, Gabriel Zucman of the University of California, Berkeley, says that her wealth tax is designed with those failures in mind, since it applies only to the ultra-wealthy, taxes citizens wherever they live and imposes a 40 percent “exit tax” on Americans worth more than $50 million who renounce their citizenship.

Still others oppose the idea on principle, for the very reasons many support it. Michael R. Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, writes in Bloomberg:

Warren’s wealth tax would be an abuse of government power. It is the tax-code equivalent of looting mansions. What is wrong with the way these 75,000 families made their money? Paying taxes is not a punishment, and the tax code should not be used to penalize any group of citizens. Not even the very rich.

A wealth tax is only a start

A wealth tax could close the country’s wealth gap from the top, and the universal social programs it helps fund could go some way to closing the wealth gap at the bottom. But more targeted redistributive measures, like reparations, may be needed to completely close the gap between blacks and whites, argues William Darity Jr., a professor of public policy at Duke University. He told The Times:

That’s an objective that is not achieved by any of the existing policies on the table now. Ultimately, you need a person-based program if you’re really concerned about the racial wealth gap. And it not only has to be person-based, but it has to be race-specific.

Some on the left have also criticized the idea of a wealth tax as utopian in its belief that those at capitalism’s helm would steer the system in a direction it by nature does not want to go. To fix the problem at the root, writes Benjamin Kunkel in The London Review of Books, imagine a market socialist revolution through which the shares of all corporations are transferred into public hands. With ownership of the means of production more evenly distributed, inequality wouldn’t deepen automatically as Mr. Piketty says it does under capitalism. Mr. Kunkel writes:

The notion of such a revolution — first in one country, then gatheringly international but not yet universal — is fanciful right now. But is it more so than a global capital tax requiring the coordination of virtually all nations? … Socialist revolution frankly seems more likely. … Capitalism can dispense with democracy more easily than with profits.

THE TAKEAWAY

In “Capital,” Mr. Piketty himself wrote that his idea of a progressive global wealth tax was indeed “utopian.” Yet he also said that the United States, producing as it does a quarter of global G.D.P., wouldn’t need to “ask permission” from other countries to pioneer the policy."

There is, I’d argue, an important clue in the “Obama rage” that swept Wall Street circa 2010. Objectively, the Obama administration was very good to the financial industry, even though that industry had just led us into the worst economic crisis since the 1930s. Major financial players were bailed out on lenient terms, and while bankers were subjected to a long-overdue increase in regulation, the new regulations have proved fairly easy for reputable firms to deal with.

Yet financial tycoons were furious with President Barack Obama because they felt disrespected. In truth, Obama’s rhetoric was very mild; all he ever did was suggest that some bankers had behaved badly, which no reasonable person could deny. But with great wealth comes great pettiness; Obama’s gentle rebukes provoked fury — and a huge swing in financial industry political contributions toward Republicans.

The point is that many of the superrich aren’t satisfied with living like kings, which they will continue to do no matter who wins next year’s election. They also expect to be treated like kings, lionized as job creators and heroes of prosperity, and consider any criticism an unforgivable act of lèse-majesté.

And for such people, the prospect of a Warren presidency is a nightmarish threat — not to their wallets, but to their egos. They can try to brush off someone like Bernie Sanders as a rabble-rouser. But when Warren criticizes malefactors of great wealth and proposes reining in their excesses, her evident policy sophistication — has any previous candidate managed to turn wonkiness into a form of charisma? — makes her critique much harder to dismiss.

If Warren is the nominee, then, a significant number of tycoons will indeed go for Trump; better to put democracy at risk than to countenance a challenge to their imperial self-esteem. But will it matter?

Maybe not. These days American presidential elections are so awash in money that both sides can count on having enough resources to saturate the airwaves.

Indeed, over-the-top attacks from the wealthy can sometimes be a political plus. That was certainly the case for F.D.R., who reveled in his plutocratic opposition: “They are unanimous in their hate for me — and I welcome their hatred.”"

He also said, “I’m feeling great.”

Mr. Sanders’s campaign is billing the New York rally as his official return to the campaign trail. It had toyed with holding the rally in Prospect Park in Brooklyn, according to an aide, but settled on a park in Queens, with a backdrop of the Manhattan skyline.

Presidential endorsements from the congresswomen, both members of the group of first-term Democratic women of color known as “the squad,” were highly coveted. In addition to being among the country’s most prominent progressives, the members of the group — Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Omar, Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Representative Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts — have also become some of President Trump’s favorite foils.

Assorted news reports said that Ms. Tlaib planned to endorse Mr. Sanders as well, and early Wednesday Ms. Omar tweeted that Ms. Tlaib was backing him.

Ms. Tlaib’s team did not respond to requests for comment, and Mr. Sanders’s aides did not confirm that Ms. Tlaib had endorsed him.

In a statement, an aide to Ms. Pressley said: “Ayanna has tremendous respect for her sisters-in-service. Ultimately, these political decisions are made as individuals.

Ms. Simpson, who did not respond to requests from The Times for comment, told Patch that the Sanders campaign reached out only on Friday, and that the time of the rally conflicted with a tenants association meeting.

Drawing loud cheers from a large, enthusiastic and diverse crowd that had packed into a park in Queens next to a public housing complex, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez offered resounding words of support, for both Mr. Sanders and his influence in shaping the Democratic primary.

“No one wanted to question the system, and in 2016, he fundamentally changed politics in America,” she said, minutes before Mr. Sanders joined her on the stage. “We right now have one of the best Democratic presidential primary fields in a generation and much of that is thanks to the work that Bernie Sanders has done in his entire life.”

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., one of the race’s leading candidates, also once faced questions about his ability to serve in public office because of a serious medical problem. In 1988, as a 45-year-old senator from Delaware , he experienced a near fatal rupture of an aneurysm in an artery in his brain . Shortly after his emergency surgery for the aneurysm, he had a second one removed before it could burst. Because new cerebral aneurysms can develop years later in a tiny percentage of individuals, some experts suggested that Mr. Biden be examined for any new aneurysms when Barack Obama selected him as his running mate. At the time, Mr. Biden’s doctor said that he did not need further testing because he had recovered fully and done well for 20 years.

Mr. Sanders is certainly not the first candidate whose presidential campaign was disrupted by a medical emergency. In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley made an unexpected visit to a hospital in the San Francisco Bay Area for atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm abnormality, which he did not disclose until after the incident. After canceling a few events, Mr. Bradley, now 76, resumed his campaign, but he eventually dropped out of the race after losing the New Hampshire primary. A poll of New Hampshire voters revealed concern about how he had handled the disclosure of his health iss ue .

Still, M r. Sanders’s case is unusual in many respects: He is a leading candidate recovering from a heart attack at age 78 who must compete in an intensely competitive primary while also holding down a demanding job as senator . Indeed, Mr. Sanders’s disruption comes amid increased pressure to bolster voter support with strong challenges from Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, and it is unclear at what pace Mr. Sanders will carry on his campaign.

“Bernie will be scrutinized very carefully in the next month or two for his ability to come back and campaign as vigorously as he has done in the 2016 and current presidential campaigns,” said Ed Rollins, a former adviser to President Ronald Reagan. “He’ll be looked at a little differently” for things like being tired at the end of the day or stumbling in his delivery onstage, Mr. Rollins added.

“I have never known a politician or big moneyed guy or anyone who has had a first heart attack” not consider his mortality, Mr. Rollins added. Also, Mr. Sanders “surely will think about a running mate.”"

Their tax proposals are helping to galvanize those on the left, but their ideas will also provide fodder for Republicans eager to paint them in a general election as tax-happy and too liberal.

Polls have found widespread support for the idea of taxing wealth. A poll conducted for The New York Times by the internet research firm SurveyMonkey this summer found that two-thirds of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, backed a 2 percent tax on households worth over $50 million, which is the heart of Ms. Warren’s plan.

The proposals for a wealth tax are among a variety of ideas for collecting more tax revenue that Democratic presidential candidates have put forward. On Monday, Mr. Sanders proposed a new tax on corporations that have a huge gap between what they pay their chief executive and their median worker. Jared Bernstein, who was chief economist for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. from 2009 to 2011, said he has discussed with the Biden campaign a proposal to tax financial transactions.

On the campaign trail, Ms. Warren explains the concept of a wealth tax by putting it in familiar terms, likening it to the property taxes that many Americans pay on their homes. For the superrich, she said in South Carolina on Saturday, “how about we include in yours not only your real estate, but also your stock portfolio, the diamonds, the Rembrandt and the yacht?”

Mr. Sanders is blunt about his desire to reduce the size of America’s biggest fortunes, even highlighting how much individual billionaires would have to pay in taxes under his proposal. He said last week that he did not believe billionaires should exist in the United States.

Mr. Sanders’s heart issue could prove to be a political problem for him, and it has the potential to change the dynamic of a still-fluid Democratic race. Mr. Sanders has largely avoided scrutiny of his age and his health. But he and his rivals will now be under increasing pressure to release detailed medical records as Democratic voters try to settle on the best candidate to take on President Trump, who is himself 73.

Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is 70, have all said they would release their records before the first voting starts in February.

When Mr. Sanders returns to the campaign, he may find what was already his biggest challenge — finding new converts to his mission — to be even more difficult.

“I do think this makes it harder for him to persuade new supporters to come into his column because this will at least be in the back of people’s minds,” said Erik Smith, a longtime Democratic strategist.



The setback with his health also comes amid something of a political slump for Mr. Sanders in his second run for the presidency. He has continued to raise substantial amounts of money from his dedicated supporters — on Tuesday, his campaign celebrated an impressive third-quarter fund-raising haul of $25.3 million — and has remained among the top three contenders in the primary. But he has been unable to expand his base beyond those enthusiasts. In recent weeks, he shook up his staff in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two nominating states, in an effort to jump-start his candidacy as Ms. Warren passed him in some polls."

Ms. Sanders did not specify whether Mr. Sanders, 78, would be discharged sooner than the weekend and would remain in Las Vegas before returning home.

Dr. Brahmajee Nallamothu, an interventional cardiologist at the University of Michigan, said it is hard to read too much into Mr. Sanders’s apparently prolonged hospital stay. If a blood vessel’s anatomy is complex, he said, cardiologists might keep a patient for an extra day. But a stay of several days, he said, “is not typical unless there is an additional issue.”

Dr. Nallamothu said he had watched a video of Mr. Sanders’s event at a Las Vegas restaurant Tuesday night when the senator, looking distressed, removed his jacket and asked for a chair so he could sit down. The symptoms, Dr. Nallamothu said, suggest that Mr. Sanders might have had a small heart attack — defined as a blockage that results in some damage to the heart muscle — or almost had a small heart attack. But he does not seem to have had a major one.

With a smaller heart attack, a blood vessel is mostly blocked but a trickle of blood can still get through. If the person is sitting still, that can be enough blood to relieve symptoms. But if the person is standing and moving around — as Mr. Sanders was originally— the paucity of blood can cause chest pain and discomfort.

The senator and his campaign have not allowed reporters to interview his doctors, though advisers have said that Mr. Sanders would be able to appear in the next Democratic debate on Oct. 15.

With respect to release of health information, President Trump has not had a medical emergency while running for or serving in office, but he disclosed few specific laboratory test results initially in his 2016 campaign. He issued a four-paragraph letter from his personal physician stating that Mr. Trump would be “the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” Closer to the 2016 election date, Mr. Trump’s doctor offered a more conventional letter that still omitted a number of details that would be part of a customary summary of a patient’s health.

In 2018, the doctor, Harold N. Bornstein, said that Trump aides had raided his office a year earlier and taken the president’s medical files after The Times reported that the president had taken a drug for hair growth. And this year, the White House physician pronounced Mr. Trump in “very good health” although the president had gained weight and is now officially obese.

The health questions hang over Mr. Sanders in part because he would become the nation’s oldest president by far if elected. Also, given that implanting two stents in one coronary artery is a very common procedure in American hospitals, it was puzzling that for several days he did not release more details. Mr. Sanders is a private person, no doubt, but most modern-day presidents and serious candidates for the presidency have put forward details to inform the electorate after emergency health issues."

Mr. Biden’s campaign has said he scored his best week of fund-raising since the second week of the campaign as Democrats initiated an impeachment inquiry of Mr. Trump over a whistle-blower complaint claiming that Mr. Trump prodded the president of Ukraine to investigate the business dealings there of Mr. Biden’s son Hunter Biden.

Still, some Biden supporters are nervous about how the impeachment process, and any added scrutiny of Hunter Biden’s business affairs, will play out. Some have even discussed creating a super PAC, which the campaign quickly disavowed. Others see in Ms. Warren’s rise as a top rival, with Mr. Sanders in third, an opportunity for Mr. Biden to truly consolidate a donor class that has remained fractured.

Mr. Biden’s ability to attract small donors will be closely scrutinized. In the last 90 days, his campaign ranked 10th among the Democratic presidential candidates for advertising dollars on Facebook, where campaigns often prospect for new contributors. He spent less than one-quarter of what Mr. Buttigieg had spent on the platform in that time, and well less than half of what Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders had spent, according to Facebook data.

Mr. Biden told donors at a sushi restaurant in Los Angeles last week that he had nearly 670,000 donations overall with an average donation of $46, which would translate to only about $10.8 million this quarter. A Biden campaign official said the former vice president had not presented the “full picture” but declined to elaborate.

A Biden campaign official said Tuesday that the former vice president had “unequivocally’’ raised enough money to be competitive in the primary race, and that details would be released soon.

In an interview with NBC News, Mr. Sanders said a doctor at an urgent care facility in Las Vegas, where he went last Tuesday night after experiencing chest pain, had informed him that he was having a “heart event.” The interviewer then asked if the doctor had said he was having a heart attack, to which Mr. Sanders said, “Yeah.”

Ms. Warren’s campaign said on Friday that it had received 943,000 donations in the third quarter from 509,000 donors, and more than 300,000 of those donors gave to her presidential campaign for the first time. The average donation was $26, and Ms. Warren ended the quarter with $25.7 million in cash on hand, according to her campaign.

“Please take a moment to be proud of the movement you’re helping build ,” Roger Lau, Ms. Warren’s campaign manager, wrote in an email to supporters. “Close your eyes and picture Wall Street bankers scowling into their catered breakfast,” he suggested.

Collecting small contributions from a vast group of donors comes with a huge long-term advantage: Those donors can keep giving again and again as the campaign goes on. That is not the case for wealthy donors writing $2,800 checks to candidates — the maximum an individual can give to a campaign for the primary race.

Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders “are breaking these old political models in which rich donors can capture and control political parties,” said Stephanie Taylor, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is supporting Ms. Warren. “This is just a really revolutionary, seismic shift in American politics.”

Beating Mr. Sanders’s total for the past three months would have given another jolt of momentum to Ms. Warren’s campaign. Instead, Mr. Sanders’s status as the top fund-raiser for the quarter provides a reminder of his sizable base of support, even as other indicators like polling are less favorable.

In the long run, Mr. Sanders’s slight financial edge over Ms. Warren in the quarter is unlikely to make a major difference in the perceptions of their candidacies. Mr. Sanders entered the race having already established an enormous network of donors during his 2016 presidential campaign, and he raised slightly less in the third quarter of 2019 than he did during the same time period in 2015."

This year, the White House physician pronounced Mr. Trump in “very good health,” although the president had gained weight and is now officially obese.

Other presidents and presidential candidates have had heart trouble, though not all of it was known to the public at the time. Experts believe that President Warren G. Harding died of a heart attack that his doctor did not detect. Toward the end of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s third term and until his death in his fourth term, his White House doctor withheld the fact that he had serious heart failure. President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a heart attack near the end of his first term, and might have had a heart attack before he ran for president.

In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley damaged his presidential campaign by not disclosing that he had had a number of episodes of atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm abnormality, before he experienced one while campaigning and had to be rushed to a hospital with reporters trailing him.

Before his heart attack pulled him from the campaign trail, Mr. Sanders was polling in the top tier of the Democratic primary race with Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, and his staff has been trying to project optimism about his candidacy. But the episode has cast a shadow over his campaign just as he was attempting to reinvigorate it after a summer slump that saw his standing in some polls slip.

Hoping to reverse course, he had recently begun to focus more on his electability, arguing that he is the candidate best positioned to beat Mr. Trump in the general election.

The Sanders campaign announced this week that it had raised $25.3 million in the third quarter, placing him ahead of Ms. Warren, his chief ideological rival, by a hair and at the top of the field in fund-raising.

In a show of force, the campaign announced a $1.3 million ad buy in Iowa that it then postponed as it waited to assess the situation; the ad will now begin airing next Tuesday, and will run for two weeks as planned."

Some candidates have more maneuvering room than others to challenge the two leaders: Whereas Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders are flush with cash, Ms. Klobuchar is in a far more tenuous financial position and has yet to qualify for the debate in November. At least a few other candidates who took an assertive approach Tuesday are in similar straits, straining to raise money or meet the debate threshold or both.

What could prove decisive in Iowa, and beyond, is if centrist voters coalesce behind a single candidate or fracture among the group of hopefuls presenting themselves as pragmatists. If Mr. Biden cannot recover a measure of momentum, but holds on to enough support to block other candidates from building a coalition of more moderate Democrats, it could allow Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders to roll through the earliest primaries and caucuses with relatively weak opposition.

This scenario, of a sort of zombie Biden candidacy, is what most alarms supporters of other center-left Democrats in the race.

Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio, a close ally of Mr. Buttigieg, predicted the South Bend mayor would now “dig down deep in Iowa and New Hampshire,” carrying his message from the debate — a combination of uplifting rhetoric about the future and blunt criticism of certain progressive policies — into the early states where he’s polling in fourth place.

Ms. Whaley said she expected Mr. Buttigieg, 37, to make a determined effort to displace Mr. Biden as the candidate seen as most capable of speaking to Midwesterners."

WARREN: Well, I say I will outwork, out-organize and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with. Look, the way I see this, the way we’re going to win is by addressing head-on what millions of Americans know in their bones, and that is that the wealthy and the well-connected have captured our democracy, and they’re making it work for themselves and leaving everyone else behind. And political pundits and Washington insiders and, shoot, people in our own party don’t want to admit that. They think that running some kind of vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of big problems in this country is a winning strategy. They are wrong. If all Democrats can promise is after Donald Trump, it will be business as usual, then we will lose. Democrats win when we call out what’s broken and we show how to fix it.

Ms. Warren has become known for her towering stack of policy plans, having offered dozens of proposals on a wide variety of subjects. But on health care, she has not been similarly forthcoming, and her repeated refusal to say whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to help finance Medicare for all has drawn sharp criticism from some of her Democratic presidential rivals.

Given her increasing status as a front-runner in the primary race, Ms. Warren was ce rtain to continue facing challenges on the issue. For weeks, she has sidestepped questions about raising taxes, no matter who was asking and when. But it had been an open question whether it would remain politically tenable for her to continue simply aligning herself with Senator Bernie Sanders’s health care plan while declining to provide any detailed explanation of how she would pay for it.

Pollsters said on Tuesday that it was too soon to determine or measure the impact of Mr. Sanders’s health issues on voter preferences in the race, but they noted that his admission about his health would create a new challenge for Mr. Sanders, who, at 78, would be the oldest president ever elected by far.

​“This will just raise the issue of his age​, which to me has always been the Achilles’ heel of the Sanders campaign,” said Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which polls public opinion in the key primary state. “When Sanders ran for president in 2016, he was the not-Hillary Clinton candidate and no one paid attention to how old he is. Now, there will be a lot of attention to how old he is, and how old Joe Biden is.”

“It’s not lost on people that many of these candidates were actually on the record supporting impeachment before anyone was even talking about Ukraine,” said Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist and former Trump White House official.

The debate, held outside Columbus, Ohio, allowed Republicans to try to make their case in a state that Mr. Trump won by eight percentage points in 2016 and has many of the middle-class, blue-collar voters that he hopes to turn out again in next year’s election. To underscore the point, the Trump campaign took out a full-page ad in the Columbus Dispatch on Tuesday that blared, “Democrats Will Kill Ohio Jobs … President Trump’s Fighting for the Economy.”

The president remains historically unpopular, however. The Gallup presidential approval poll has measured public support for his job performance at below 50 percent for his entire presidency. To overcome this skepticism, Republicans have attempted to define the Democrats as out of touch and too far to the left of where most Americans’ views are. Some of the Democratic candidates, like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., hold moderate and liberal views, while Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont are generally more progressive.

Senator Marco Rubio of Florida on Wednesday expressed the kind of binary argument that Republicans hope prevails on voters. “Last night’s debate was a reminder that while you may not always agree with everything Trump says or does, the leading alternatives to Trump mock people with traditional beliefs & support socialism, gun confiscation & free government funded health care for unlawful immigrants,” he wrote on Twitter.

With Ms. Warren the target of sustained attacks from the other Democrats onstage, Mr. Trump and his Republican allies moved to frame the race around the question of whether voters want a strongly liberal president and government in 2021.

On Tuesday night, after Mr. Sanders picked up the support of two high-profile liberals in the House Democratic caucus — Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar — Republicans jumped at the chance to make them a focal point in the morning-after debate analysis.

Now, several Democratic presidential candidates are proposing that parents who stay home to care for children be paid, too. It’s a twist on typical family policies — like paid leave, subsidized child care or the right to work part-time — all of which make it easier for parents to have jobs outside the home. Instead, this proposal would make it easier for them not to.

It’s an idea that blurs partisan lines. On the left, there have long been calls to recognize the economic value of unpaid domestic labor by paying for it. At the same time, many on the left fear that paying at-home parents — who are most often women — would reinforce unequal gender roles and set women back in the labor force.

On the right, proponents appreciate that the proposal supports traditional families and allows young children to be home with a parent. Yet many on the right resist the expansion of government benefits, especially without work requirements."

Ten of them went rogue.

A swing by that number of electors would have been enough to change the outcomes in five of the previous 58 presidential elections, according to a petition filed last week in the Supreme Court. In the 2000 election, after an assist from the Supreme Court, George W. Bush beat Al Gore by just five electoral votes.

The petition asked the justices to decide whether “faithless electors” were free to disregard pledges they made to vote for their own parties’ candidates. It urged the court to act quickly. “This case permits the court to issue a decision outside of the white-hot scrutiny of a contested presidential election,” the petition said.

Deciding the issue in the context of an actual election could do lasting damage to the Supreme Court, said Lawrence Lessig, a law professor at Harvard who filed the petition on behalf of three Democratic electors from Washington State who were fined $1,000 each for casting their electoral votes for Colin L. Powell rather than for Hillary Clinton."

In a moment marked by fractured politics, Ms. Gabbard’s nontraditional positions are a major part of her appeal for voters seeking to break out of polarized partisan divisions. Joe Rogan, the popular podcast host, said he planned to vote for her. Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter, donated to her campaign.

But it’s also an argument that reminds some Democrats of the narrative pushed by Russian actors during the 2016 presidential contest, when an operation by internet trolls worked to manipulate American public opinion: that the electoral system is broken and cannot be trusted.

Some of those who have worked with Ms. Gabbard say that, as an Iraq war veteran whose chief message is that America should stop trying to police the world, she is representing viewpoints that draw support from an array of people in the United States as well as abroad .

“In reality, Tulsi is really running on an antiwar message that’s consistent with where a lot of veterans are,” said Jon Soltz, chairman of the liberal veterans organization VoteVets.org, which worked closely with Ms. Gabbard during her first congressional campaign. “I know everyone thinks there’s a conspiracy theory here but that’s really what she’s doing.”

Still, Democrats are on high alert about foreign interference in the next election and the D.N.C. is well aware of the frequent mentions of Ms. Gabbard in the Russian state news media.

An independent analysis of the Russian news media found that RT, the Kremlin-backed news agency, mentioned Ms. Gabbard frequently for a candidate polling in single digits, according to data collected by the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a group that seeks to track and expose efforts by authoritarian regimes to undermine democratic elections."

She then dwelled on a description of how she would pull back differently, and more skillfully, than Mr. Trump’s rapid and chaotic retreat in the past week.

Mr. Biden, the only one of the candidates with a long record in foreign issues, declined — twice — to answer a question about whether he would reinsert the American troops that have been withdrawn from northern Syria. Instead, he talked about protecting the forces still in the country, saying he would give them air cover and “make it clear they’re not going anywhere.”

He then turned to Mr. Trump’s abandonment of the Kurds, America’s longtime ally in fighting ISIS, shouting: “This is shameful! Shameful what this man has done.”

Only Mayor Pete Buttigieg of Indiana, who served in Afghanistan, made the distinction between ending large combat operations and keeping “a small number of specialized, special operations forces and intelligence capabilities” on the ground, especially in Syria.

Those forces, he argued, “were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria” and “the beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS.” It is a distinction Mr. Trump, and many of those seeking to run against him on the Democratic ticket, have passed by.

The exchanges on Syria, followed by a parallel discussion of how to contain Russia’s increasing aggressiveness, underscored one of the oddities of the 2020 election season: Faced with a Republican president who has envisioned a far more isolationist approach to American power, the Democrats are sounding like interventionist Republicans of just a few years ago.

When Mitt Romney ran against President Barack Obama in 2012, he called Russia the “No. 1 geopolitical foe” facing the United States and argued that containing Mr. Putin would be his top priority. That led Mr. Obama, with a laugh, to respond: “The 1980s, they’re now calling to ask for their foreign policy back,” an effort to paint Mr. Romney as a cold warrior who did not realize that era had passed."

But it can give us the perspectives of some of the people with expertise on primary races: veteran campaign strategists and consultants from both parties.

Here is a sampling of their reactions.

Warren took fire from all sides

The strategists agreed on one thing: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s new front-runner status was clear, because she was everyone else’s biggest target. But they were divided on how well she handled the attacks.

“Warren took almost everyone’s best punch there & came away basically unscathed.” — Jesse Lehrich, former foreign policy spokesman for Hillary Clinton “Heading into this debate as a frontrunner, she did not seem ready for the incoming.” — Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and former Democratic National Committee spokesman “This is the @ewarren debate. You might be happy or sad about it, but she’s the one who is setting the tone and she’s the reference point for most of the other candidates. That happens to the frontrunner.” — Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics

Buttigieg stood out …

Several consultants said Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., had successfully set himself up as an alternative for moderate Democrats uneasy with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. They particularly liked his responses on foreign policy, which he framed in terms of his own experience in the military.

“Very strong, passionate and compelling condemnation of @realDonaldTrump betrayal of Kurds from Northern Syria by @PeteButtigieg. Owning this discussion.” — David Axelrod, former chief strategist for Barack Obama “I am impressed with Buttigieg on foreign policy. Like Biden, he really shines and opens up when he talks about FP.” — Jess Morales Rocketto, political director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance “This has been @PeteButtigieg’s best #DemDebate performance so far. While other candidates tried to out-left and anti-Trump each other, Mayor Pete came across as reasonable and rational.” — Frank Luntz, Republican consultant and pollster

… and so did Klobuchar

Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota received similarly positive reviews, with strategists arguing that she and Mr. Buttigieg in the middle against Ms. Warren on the left was the biggest dynamic of the night.

“@amyklobuchar performance tonight will resonate with moderate Democrats who are tired of being told that they are sellouts if they don’t subscribe to most left views. It’s a theme that’s cut across all her answers tonight & why she is having a good night.” — Jennifer Palmieri, former spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama “With 11 other people on stage, you don’t get a lot of opportunities to make an impression. But she’s finding them, using each one to stand out and draw a contrast.” — Mo Elleithee “Every time Amy Klobuchar speaks she says something sensible. Not sure that makes her electable, but it’s nice to hear.” — Joe Lockhart, former spokesman for President Bill Clinton

Sanders was reassuring

After his heart attack two weeks ago, Senator Bernie Sanders badly needed to project strength and stamina, and on the whole, the consensus was that he succeeded.

“What heart attack?! @BernieSanders is giving a strong performance and not missing a step.” — Patti Solis Doyle, senior adviser to the 2008 Obama campaign “Bernie Sanders making a damn important point here — stuff in our county was bad before Trump was elected, and this election has to be about more than defeating Trump.” — Sally Kohn, progressive commentator and former campaign strategist “This was @BernieSanders’ best debate by far, but I still don’t hear him making a pitch to people who don’t already support him.” — Laura Belin, Iowa political commentator

Biden had an uneven performance

Mr. Biden won praise for his responses on foreign policy — frequently a strong area for him — but was criticized for seeming to claim credit for Ms. Warren’s work establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

“Biden needs to have a clear and compelling response to the Trump charge against him and his son, and I assumed he would have prepared one, but his answer is not sharp. When asked ‘did you make a mistake?’ he snaps back with a much sharper line.” — Robert Reich, professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and former labor secretary No one more experienced on foreign policy on this debate stage than @JoeBiden. This is where his experience shines and reminds voters that experience does matter.” — Adrienne Elrod, former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton “Biden yelling ‘I GOT you votes’ at Warren is not the best look.” — Kelly Dittmar, scholar at Rutgers University’s Center for American Women and Politics

Other standout moments

Several other candidates got good reviews for specific answers: Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker on reproductive rights, and the former housing secretary Julián Castro for the statement, “Police violence is also gun violence.”

“Such a smart move by @KamalaHarris to refocus the conversation on women’s reproductive rights. She listened to women since the last debate and will gain attention and praise for it.” — Kelly Dittmar “@CoryBooker brings a lot to this primary, but perhaps his greatest debate contribution is his continuance to be the moral compass, reminding candidates and the audience what this campaign is really all about: defeating Trump and helping people live better lives.” — Adrienne Elrod “Castro was really strong on police violence there and brought in an angle on seizing guns that other candidates missed.” — Seth Masket, political scientist at the University of Denver

It’s: Are we going to bring out what is better in us versus what is worse in us?”

He constantly plies this theme, which deserves constant plying. For him it’s clearly more than cant, and has roots in his stint in the military, which throws diverse Americans together, endowing them with a shared purpose.

He routinely steers clear of extremes — on health care, on guns, on environmental issues — not because he lacks conviction or courage, at least not from where I’m sitting, but because extremes aren’t where the most progress is usually made or where healing is likeliest to happen. He’s a champion of the sensible. In that way, he seems much older than his age.

But, ugh, that age. My wish for a young candidate didn’t mean a 37-year-old one. There’s much wisdom in this life that’s accrued only with the passage of years, and he’d be better off — and significantly less vulnerable in a general election — if he had even five more of them.

In 2016, I visited and spent many hours with him in South Bend, then wrote a column with the headline “The First Gay President?” I was looking at least a decade into the future, after he’d extended his résumé beyond South Bend, which has only about 100,000 people.

I’d be a lot more comfortable if there were an additional zero in that population figure, if he had a better record on race, and if there weren’t quite so many elitist mile markers on his journey to this point.

And that’s where my depression sets in. He’s so very strong but so crucially weak — which is the story of the Democratic primary, whose leading candidates are all agonizingly unsafe bets. Without a nanosecond’s pause, I’d vote for any of them over Trump. But will enough other Americans? The stakes are enormous and reassurance is elusive."

Biden Jr., whose policy positions are generally more moderate. Ms. Warren has risen steadily in many polls while both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have lost some ground, particularly in surveys of Iowa voters, who will hold the first nominating contest in February.

Pollsters said on Tuesday that it was too soon to determine or measure the impact of Mr. Sanders’s health issues on voter preferences in the race, but they noted that his admission about his health would create a new challenge for Mr. Sanders, who, at 78, would be the oldest president ever elected by far.

​“This will just raise the issue of his age​, which to me has always been the Achilles’ heel of the Sanders campaign,” said Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which polls public opinion in the key primary state. “When Sanders ran for president in 2016, he was the not-Hillary Clinton candidate and no one paid attention to how old he is. Now, there will be a lot of attention to how old he is, and how old Joe Biden is.”

Mr. Biden is 76, while Ms. Warren is 70. President Trump is 73.

Speaking to reporters outside his home in Burlington Tuesday, Mr. Sanders gave no indication that he was planning to drop out of the race and said he would continue to campaign actively. Indeed, Mr. Sanders remains formidable: He reported a third-quarter fund-raising total of $25.3 million, the largest in the Democratic field, and he has helped steer many in the party to embrace ideas like “Medicare for all” and tuition-free public colleges.

Mr. Sanders has been campaigning almost nonstop when not carrying out his Senate duties in Washington, D.C., a pace that he pointedly noted on Tuesday."
61,Katie Glueck,"Last quarter, Mr. Biden pulled in$22 million, one of the biggest hauls in the field for that time period, though he still fell behind Mr. Buttigieg for that quarter.

Even before the $15 million figure was released, the Biden campaign and allies were playing down the significance of the quarterly total. One close Biden supporter pointed out the lack of traction that Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg have had among the broader electorate, as reflected in polling, and said that if money were all that mattered then Democrats would be nominating the billionaire financier Tom Steyer.

Also Thursday, Mr. Biden was asked for his thoughts on selecting a running mate.

“Look, if I could just manufacture someone out of the blue, I would very much think it’s important to have a woman, and even a woman of color, or someone of color as vice president,” he said. “But I’ve learned something different. Not different. Something else. The single most important thing you have to have as a president is someone you know is ideologically compatible with you, that you in fact share the same fundamental concerns and values.”

The Thursday fund-raiser, and the end of the fund-raising quarter, arrived at an uncertain time for Mr. Biden: The House of Representatives is pursuing an impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump amid revelations that he asked the president of Ukraine to “look into” Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden. There is no evidence that as vice president, Mr. Biden intentionally acted to aid his son’s business dealings there, and the news of Mr. Trump’s actions has outraged Democrats and signaled, to some, that the president is concerned about Mr. Biden’s candidacy.

While Mr. Biden is fiercely protective of his family, the moment has thrust the delicate subject into the national spotlight — even as the question of how voters will respond remains fluid, and some of Mr. Biden’s advisers and allies privately acknowledge the risks associated with Mr. Trump’s focus on the Bidens.

That dynamic did not stop his team from fund-raising off the developments involving Mr. Trump. The day after details of the president’s conversation came to light, the campaign tripled its daily online fund-raising average, Mr. Biden’s team said, though an adviser did not respond when asked last week whether that pace had continued.

During the final days of the fund-raising quarter, Mr. Biden spent much of his time at high-dollar fund-raisers, often attending two or even three in one day as he visited wealthy enclaves like Bel Air, Calif., and Park City, Utah. Mr. Biden has been more reliant on high-dollar donors than some of his rivals in the Democratic primary: Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have sworn off big-money fund-raisers."

Ms. Warren’s surge in the polls has finally reached the point where it has become problematic for Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders. Both men have signaled that attacks could be coming, with Mr. Sanders drawing a pretty sharp contrast over the weekend.

It’s likely that some of those attacks will focus on her health care plan: how she would pay for it, whether she would raise taxes on the middle class, whether she would end private insurance plans and how she would accommodate union health plans.

Will Ms. Warren be ready with more polished answers than she has given in the past?

Whither Mayor Pete?

Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has the most field offices in the early states (tied with Ms. Warren) and a generous campaign bank account (only Mr. Sanders has raised more among Democrats). What he lacks is actual traction in the polls.

So far, most of his debate performances have been characterized by “West Wing”-style monologues. But there are signs he may pivot to a more aggressive tack Tuesday night in hopes of expanding his support. In recent weeks, he has nudged Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders on health care and has been in something of a sniper fight with former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas.

There have been plenty of signs that the two young guns in the race may be headed for a shootout at the Otterbein University Corral. The question is whether that will be enough for either to make a mark.

Does anyone else break out of the pack?

Four candidates on the stage haven’t qualified for the next debate in November: the former housing secretary Julián Castro, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Mr. O’Rourke. Tuesday night is a now-or-never moment for them."

Your political operation takes over the D.N.C. You cannot divorce in any way fund-raising for the presidential campaign and the Democratic Party.”

The donation limits for the D.N.C. are actually far higher than those for direct contributions to campaigns. The D.N.C. can raise money in increments of $355,000; direct donations to a potential Warren general election committee would be limited to $2,800.

Ms. Orthman said Ms. Warren would attend D.N.C. events that are open to the press to “make sure the Democratic National Committee, state and local parties, and Democratic candidates everywhere have the resources” they need. She also said Ms. Warren was “not going to change a thing in how she runs her campaign,” including “no special access or call time with rich donors or big-dollar fund-raisers.”

Ms. Warren headlined a D.N.C. event in August, but she did not meet privately with large donors who attended. She is scheduled for another D.N.C. event next week.

The Warren campaign declined to say whether it would create a joint fund-raising committee with the D.N.C., which is traditionally a big lure for contributors who want to support candidates up and down the ballot. Mr. Trump and his shared committees with the Republican National Committee raised $125 million in the last three months.

Henry R. Munoz III, who stepped down as finance chair of the D.N.C. earlier this year and has co-hosted a fund-raiser for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said Ms. Warren’s proposed arrangement left him confused.

“I don’t even know how that would work,” Mr. Munoz said. Democrats, he added, “have to do everything in their power to work together to create an infrastructure to do battle with the almost unlimited resources that this administration and that party will use to destroy what we believe in.”"

The plan would have nearly doubled the size of the state’s budget. For both political and economic reasons, the cost was deemed too high.

There were other complications: Public outreach was weak. And in 2013, the state started an online insurance exchange under the Affordable Care Act that was plagued by technical failures, which the state struggled to fix. As the Cornell Policy Review noted in a 2017 post-mortem, the mix of higher-than-expected costs and administrative problems “fostered an atmosphere of uncertainty and distrust in the state government, turning a politically steep climb into a politically insurmountable one.”

And so, at the end of 2014, Mr. Shumlin admitted defeat. “I have learned that the limitations of state-based financing, the limitations of federal law, the limitations of our tax capacity and the sensitivity of our economy” make single-payer “unwise and untenable at this time,” he said. “The risk of economic shock is too high.”

The Vermont plan was done in by high taxes, distrust of government and lack of political support. Any effort by a Sanders administration to enact a single-payer system at a national level would probably be doomed by similar problems.

Like Mr. Shumlin, Mr. Sanders is a devout single-payer supporter who has campaigned aggressively on the idea. And like Mr. Shumlin, Mr. Sanders has so far declined to lay out a plan for fully financing his Medicare for All system.

But while some polls show majority public support for single-payer, that support declines substantially when faced with trade-offs like the elimination of most private coverage or higher taxes — two components of Mr. Sanders’s plan.

Similarly, Medicare for All supporters argue that single-payer would reduce the nation’s overall health spending. But savings are heavily predicated on the assumption that the new government-run system could pay Medicare rates, which are typically lower than those of private insurance, to providers across the board."

In this race’s early stages, Ms. Harris showed all the signs of a possible coalition candidate, merging liberals and more moderate minority voters behind the strength of her historic bid to become the country’s first woman of color elected president. On the race’s first day, she raised $1.5 million, and she soon held a kickoff rally in Oakland, Calif., that remains one of the largest events for any candidate, with more than 20,000 people in attendance.

However, as the race has matured, Ms. Harris has been outflanked in money and ideology. Mr. Buttigieg has become the favorite of big money donors, and advisers for Mr. Biden, the race’s most prominent moderate candidate, are now considering a super PAC to supplement his coffers.

On the grass-roots side, progressives have centralized behind their two preferred candidates: Mr. Sanders, who retains many supporters from his previous presidential run, and Ms. Warren, who has grown her fund-raising base as her poll numbers have risen. She has outpaced Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders in recent polls, both nationally and in a few early-voting states.

Ms. Harris’s team is adamant that she remains well-positioned — and adequately funded — to mount a vigorous operation in Iowa. As Mr. Biden’s poll numbers fade, Ms. Harris’s advisers believe her campaign is likely to gain from this and can use a strong initial showing to centralize black voters in later states. Recently, Ms. Harris shook up her senior staff, in a move that was first reported by Politico, and was taken as an acknowledgment of the campaign’s tough road ahead."

Oct. 11, 2019

With a crucial debate looming next week in the Democratic presidential primary, the party’s populist wing appears increasingly in control of the race — rising in the polls, stocked with cash and with only a wounded leading candidate, Joseph R. Biden Jr., standing in its way.

Several slow-building trends have converged to upend the race over the last few weeks: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s steady ascent in the polls has accelerated. Both she and Senator Bernie Sanders, a fellow progressive, have raised immense sums of money from small donors online, dominating the Democratic field and each collecting about $10 million more than Mr. Biden in the last quarter. And Mr. Biden’s numbers have gradually slipped in a way that has alarmed his supporters.

The race is far from over: All three of the top candidates — Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders — have a path to victory, and there is still time for longer-shot candidates to make a real run at the nomination. The CNN/New York Times debate in Ohio on Tuesday is likely to test Ms. Warren’s status as an emerging front-runner, subjecting her to new criticism from her fellow Democrats on matters ranging from health care policy to trade and the role of the government in overseeing the economy. Above all, she may need to allay lingering reservations about her appeal to swing voters in the general election."

Here is our quick rundown of what happened in the 2020 race.

A health scare for Sanders

Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont had a heart attack this week, and doctors inserted two stents to open a blocked artery.

Mr. Sanders, 78, was taken to a Las Vegas hospital on Wednesday after he experienced “some chest discomfort” at an event Tuesday night. His wife, Jane Sanders, later said that he was resting comfortably and that he would participate in the next Democratic debate, on Oct. 15. The news that he’d had a heart attack was not revealed until he was discharged from the hospital on Friday.

Stents are common, Dr. Lawrence K. Altman wrote. But the news of Mr. Sanders’s heart attack raised more serious questions. You can read more about that here.

Sanders and Warren raised the most this summer

The end of the third fiscal quarter was Monday, and candidates have started announcing their fund-raising totals for July, August and September. We’re tracking the numbers here."

It Was the Worst of Warren.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/opinion/democratic-debate-ohio.html,"All of this was to be expected. All of it was, in fact, a great compliment to Warren. During both the opening stretch of the debate and subsequent ones, her prescriptions were the point of reference, her priorities set the terms of the discussion, and she was the candidate to whom the debate’s moderators kept returning so that she could respond to her rivals’ invocations of her.

And she stayed cool and confident under fire, sounding more grateful for the spotlight than fearful of the microscope. It was, for the most part, a fine performance.

But it was also, at first, an exasperating one. That unwillingness to talk candidly about middle-class taxes, though she was pressed by both a moderator and by other candidates to do so, bordered on perverse.

She kept saying, as if it were a tic or a stutter, that “costs will go down” for middle-class families, the translation of which is that taxes might well go up but that those families would be economically ahead of the game in the end.

If that’s the case, why not be explicit about the arithmetic and own it? If there’s nothing to hide from, why hide from it? Warren has campaigned as a truth teller but came across, in this instance, as a classically evasive Washington operator, scared to treat voters as grown-ups who can process information in a sophisticated manner."

Seven in 10 Democratic voters support mandatory buybacks, according to an August Quinnipiac poll, although less than half of all voters do.

There is a similar lack of consensus among the Democratic candidates on whether to force all gun owners to register their weapons in a national database. Democratic politicians long dismissed the idea of a gun registry as a fear-mongering tactic from the National Rifle Association, but it now enjoys broad support from the public: 62 percent of Americans back the idea, including 85 percent of Democrats.

Most candidates now favor establishing a registry, though some — including Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. — do not. Others, like Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, say it should apply only to owners of assault weapons.

Climate Change









Democratic voters widely believe that climate change represents an international emergency — 84 percent said so in the August Quinnipiac poll — and roughly nine in 10 think the United States is not doing enough to address global warming.

All the major Democratic candidates have expressed support for the Green New Deal, though some have been more guarded than others. All five senators who will debate Tuesday night co-sponsored the bill. Mr. Buttigieg has simply called it “the right beginning,” while Mr. Biden’s campaign website endorses it as a “crucial framework.”

But the Green New Deal enjoys broad support from the American public, with 63 percent of respondents to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll in July saying they like the idea of investing government money to fund sustainable infrastructure projects and green jobs. Among Democrats, it’s a particularly winning concept; 86 percent of Democrats nationwide back the Green New Deal, the poll found."

But others worry that an older commander-in-chief would share the declines they have experienced in their own physical and mental abilities over the years.

Discussions of aging have been all-but-inescapable on the campaign trail. Since he entered the race, Mr. Biden has been dogged by questions about his physical fitness and condition — concerns he has tried to alleviate by bounding through parade routes and shaking dozens of hands in steamy summer weather. Mr. Sanders keeps a blistering campaign schedule that often includes multiple events in multiple cities each day. And supporters of Ms. Warren gush about her vitality, bragging about the hundreds of selfies she takes with supporters after each appearance.

“I was just amazed that when you first came out here, Senator Warren, that you ran up those steps the way that you did, and all this energy and stamina that you have,” Nikita L. Jackson, a Rock Hill, S.C., city councilwoman , said as she praised Ms. Warren to a crowd at a town hall event on Saturday.

None of the Democratic candidates have been particularly eager to delve into the details of their health. Aides to Mr. Sanders released a brief statement noting that he “was found to have a blockage in one artery and two stents were successfully inserted,” a fairly common procedure in the United States. Like his rivals, Mr. Sanders has not yet released his medical records, though all three have vowed to do so before the Iowa caucuses in February.

With little actual medical information, even minor irregularities in how candidates appear have prompted a flurry of age-related speculation. When Mr. Sanders hit his head on the edge of a glass shower door, his campaign explained that he had received a cut requiring stitches but stressed that he did not fall. Mr. Biden appeared to be moving his mouth in a strange fashion during the last debate, which led to questions about whether he wore dentures. At Mr. Biden’s campaign events, voters question whether his verbal missteps can be attributed to his age.

Jason Witten, back from retirement this season, had four catches in the Cowboys’ 12-10 loss to New Orleans, and is second to Fitzgerald among active players with 1,166 receptions for his career.

In another milestone, Frank Gore, the ageless running back of the Buffalo Bills, had 109 yards on the ground in Sunday’s loss to New England, which pushed him past the 15,000-yard mark for his career. He is at 15,021, which has him 248 yards short of Barry Sanders for third-place on the career rushing list.

Ms. Warren said she opposed Mr. Trump’s handling of the situation but believed the United States should “get out of the Middle East.” (Aides to Ms. Warren said she was referring to the withdrawal of troops from combat.)

Throughout the debate, which was sponsored by CNN and The New York Times, Mr. Biden played a far less central role than he did in the past, stepping to the foreground for exchanges over foreign policy but otherwise taking a more passive approach. His most important moment of the night may have come early on, when he was pressed by a moderator to explain why his son had not crossed any ethical lines by doing business in Ukraine while his father was overseeing diplomacy there for the Obama administration.

Mr. Biden said several times that he and his son had done “nothing wrong,” and alluded repeatedly to an interview Hunter Biden gave to ABC News, in which he said it had been an error in judgment to sit on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while the elder Mr. Biden was vice president. Mr. Trump has accused the Bidens of corruption, often in false or exaggerated terms, and his efforts to enlist the government of Ukraine in tarring Mr. Biden instigated an impeachment inquiry.

Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator, said that while his “Medicare for all” health care plan would require tax increases on middle-class families, their overall spending would go down.

What Mr. Sanders said:

“I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up significantly for the wealthy and for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.”

This lacks evidence. Mr. Sanders’s health care plan would substantially increase the amount that the federal government spends. Estimates of its precise cost vary, but according to an estimate from the conservative Mercatus Center, which Mr. Sanders has mentioned approvingly, federal spending would need to increase by about 10 percent of the country’s gross domestic product, triple what the government spends on the military. But under Medicare for all, Americans who currently pay health insurance premiums or pay directly when they go to the doctor or pharmacy would be relieved of those costs. For most American families, that would be a substantial savings.

But that does not mean that “virtually everybody” would end up paying less over all. Mr. Sanders has suggested various possible tax increases that could pay for this expansion, including a payroll tax that would affect workers across the economic spectrum. He has not provided enough details about the mix and magnitude of taxes for economists to measure what sorts of families would be better or worse off under Medicare for all. An Urban Institute analysis of Mr. Sanders’s 2016 health care proposal, which included more tax details, found that the proposed taxes would only pay for about half of the cost of the plan.

What they’re talking about

Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, repeatedly avoided answering a question about whether financing her health care plan would require middle-class tax increases, saying instead that their “costs” would not go up.

What Ms. Warren said:

“I have made clear what my principles are here. And that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down.”

Ms. Warren has indeed proposed a number of large tax increases on the wealthy and corporations, including a new wealth tax, a corporate profits tax and an expansion of Social Security taxes up the income spectrum. But she has also earmarked close to all of the revenue raised by those taxes to pay for other domestic spending priorities, including free public college tuition and child care subsidies.

A Medicare for all health care program, like the one from Mr. Sanders that Ms. Warren has co-sponsored, would require substantial additional government spending. Ms. Warren would not say who would pay tax increases necessary to fund it. But it may be hard to squeeze that much more money out of the rich and corporations alone, beyond the new taxes she has already suggested. Her language about “costs” does provide the possibility that she would raise middle-class taxes, but ensure that middle-class families would save enough on health care spending to come out ahead."

Thanks to a nearly $25 million fund-raising bounty in the spring, which he topped up with a respectable $19.1 million over the summer, as reported Tuesday, Mr. Buttigieg has been able to invest in a gold-plated ground game in Iowa as he seeks to challenge two candidates who have been organizing for longer here, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders .

“We’re entering the stage where the rubber meets the road,” Mr. Buttigieg said in an interview as his four-day trip wrapped up last week. “ In order to settle the question of electability , the best thing you can do is perform well in an actual election. Iowa’s of course the first. And so that’s where a lot of our focus is going to go.”

Grass-roots organizing is essential to a strong caucus finish. Word of mouth about a candidate is often what turns people out on a cold February night. The Buttigieg campaign, which opened its bus tour to live-tweeting journalists in an effort to set itself apart, is also road-testing a somewhat novel approach to organizing. Its Iowa volunteers first contact friends and family members rather than cold-calling lists of registered voters, who are now so bombarded they ignore unknown numbers."

Part of that, he said, is the impossibility of a deeply substantive debate among 10 people, which is how many were onstage for each of the June, July and September debates. The coming debate will have 12 people onstage.

And timidity won’t do. “Trump will be well funded and ferocious,” Kerrey told me. “If a Democratic candidate wilts under the warm attention and criticism of another Democrat, they will not be able to stand up to Trump.” And if that criticism goes too far, bleeding into gratuitous nastiness, “the audience will discipline them,” he said. He mentioned Julián Castro’s obvious insinuation in the debate last month that Biden was in serious cognitive decline.

That went too far. It was counterproductive, because it didn’t bring to light something about a candidate that wasn’t accessible to voters. That was true as well of Eric Swalwell’s “pass the torch” hectoring of Biden, in a June debate, as a politician who was overstaying his welcome. Voters know that Biden is 76 and has spent more than four decades of his life in public office. Swalwell wasn’t exposing some secret that had been swept under the rug; he was just stamping his feet.

Many anxious, Trump-horrified Democrats take the view that the candidates should tread lightly on one another. “When we know that President Trump will be spending his money to discourage Democratic turnout more explicitly and underhandedly than in any other modern campaign, why would we want any candidate to spend time persuading Democrats of how bad other Democrats are?” asked Jack Markell, the former governor of Delaware. “The difference between all of the Democratic candidates is dwarfed by the difference between the Democratic candidates collectively and President Trump.”

Many of the readers who write to me agree with him or go even further: They want to see, hear and revel in nothing but loving encomiums about Democrats vying for the White House. Some of them believe that Hillary Clinton was badly hurt by her battle with Sanders in the last Democratic primary, and that we’re where we are as a result.

But her wounds would have mattered less if Sanders had rallied more enthusiastically to her side once she’d won the nomination. I urge the losers this time around to get in line pronto. And I think it’s extremely risky to spare the next nominee the sort of tough examination that will let us know if we’ve elevated the most broadly appealing, durable, fearsome Trump slayer.

The stakes could hardly be higher. Every day, new revelations about the Ukraine sordidness come to light. Every day, the president acts in impulsive, imprudent, unhinged ways. Maybe that means that any Democrat can beat him. But I’m a bit of a pessimist and cautious to a fault. I think it means that we cannot afford to pick the wrong person."

At the same time, others like Ms. Gabbard, have been careful to endorse only the impeachment inquiry and not necessarily impeachment itself.

Below is a partial transcript of the exchange on impeachment at Tuesday night’s Democratic debate:

WARREN: Sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics. I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry. When I made the decision to run for president, I certainly didn’t think it was going to be about impeachment. But when the Mueller report came out, I read it, all 442 pages. And when I got to the end, I realized that Mueller had shown ... that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly. And so at that moment, I called for opening an impeachment inquiry. Now, that didn’t happen and look what happened as a result. Donald Trump broke the law again in the summer, broke it again this fall.

You know, we took a constitutional oath, and that is that no one is above the law, and that includes the President of the United States. Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences. This is about Donald Trump. But understand, it’s about the next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country. The impeachment must go forward.

ANDERSON COOPER: Thank you, Senator Warren. You’re all going to get in on this, by the way. Senator Sanders, do Democrats have any choice but to impeach? Please respond."

If his family intends to shun foreign business in the event that he becomes president — as Hunter Biden said he would on Sunday — voters may wonder why they didn’t do it far sooner, when Mr. Biden was conducting foreign diplomacy as vice president.

Perhaps most of all, anxious Democratic leaders are looking to the former vice president for a sign on the debate stage that all of this is not coming too late in this campaign to make a difference — to quash the undercurrent of doubt among some Democratic strategists, activists, donors a nd voters that Mr. Biden is really ready for a general-election fight against a president prepared to scorch and smear his way to a second term.

“I’m a little worried about how Joe’s going to do if he were to get on a debate stage with the president, a little worried he’d be able to get him rattled,” said Tom Courtney, t he co-chairman of the Des Moines County Democrats in Iowa, a state where the Biden campaign has made substantial investments. “I would like to see him quit getting bogged down in little things.

Tad Devine, a veteran Democratic strategist who advised Mr. Sanders’s 2016 campaign but is not working for anyone in the 2020 race, said the lack of cash would limit Mr. Biden’s political options. He pointed to the variety of areas where campaigns might want to invest money: airing television ads, deploying staff on the ground, staging splashy but expensive events and running a robust digital program.

“Your strategic options are limited,” Mr. Devine said, adding that the options available to Mr. Biden’s better-funded rivals were “much bigger.”

“He’s going to have to place the right bet,” Mr. Devine said. “It’s going to have to be a winner. It’s almost like you’re playing roulette, and one guy gets five numbers and the other guy gets one number. Who’s going to win?”

Over the summer, Mr. Biden had already begun to slash his digital spending budget, which was also clear in the new fillings. He spent about $1 million in the first half of the quarter and about $311,000 in the second half, records show.

During the quarter, Mr. Biden also spent $924,000 on a charter jet company, Advanced Aviation Team, as he raced across the country not only for rallies and speeches but also for dozens of fund-raisers on both coasts. Mr. Biden’s campaign said the costs included paying for carbon offsets.

Mr. Biden’s biggest expense is his payroll, which cost about $6.8 million in the past three months, records show. Mr. Biden had roughly 440 people on his payroll — about as many as Mr. Buttigieg — while Ms. Warren had more than 600 and Mr. Sanders had about 550."

There is, I’d argue, an important clue in the “Obama rage” that swept Wall Street circa 2010. Objectively, the Obama administration was very good to the financial industry, even though that industry had just led us into the worst economic crisis since the 1930s. Major financial players were bailed out on lenient terms, and while bankers were subjected to a long-overdue increase in regulation, the new regulations have proved fairly easy for reputable firms to deal with.

Yet financial tycoons were furious with President Barack Obama because they felt disrespected. In truth, Obama’s rhetoric was very mild; all he ever did was suggest that some bankers had behaved badly, which no reasonable person could deny. But with great wealth comes great pettiness; Obama’s gentle rebukes provoked fury — and a huge swing in financial industry political contributions toward Republicans.

The point is that many of the superrich aren’t satisfied with living like kings, which they will continue to do no matter who wins next year’s election. They also expect to be treated like kings, lionized as job creators and heroes of prosperity, and consider any criticism an unforgivable act of lèse-majesté.

And for such people, the prospect of a Warren presidency is a nightmarish threat — not to their wallets, but to their egos. They can try to brush off someone like Bernie Sanders as a rabble-rouser. But when Warren criticizes malefactors of great wealth and proposes reining in their excesses, her evident policy sophistication — has any previous candidate managed to turn wonkiness into a form of charisma? — makes her critique much harder to dismiss.

If Warren is the nominee, then, a significant number of tycoons will indeed go for Trump; better to put democracy at risk than to countenance a challenge to their imperial self-esteem. But will it matter?

Maybe not. These days American presidential elections are so awash in money that both sides can count on having enough resources to saturate the airwaves.

Indeed, over-the-top attacks from the wealthy can sometimes be a political plus. That was certainly the case for F.D.R., who reveled in his plutocratic opposition: “They are unanimous in their hate for me — and I welcome their hatred.”"

Some of the new projects will preserve many or all of the units for below-market-rate renters and buyers, but critics argue there is still a mismatch with the needs of longtime residents, and competition for land is growing.

To analyze the least-accessible pockets of the five boroughs, we asked Localize.city, a housing data and listings portal, to map all the areas located at least a 15-minute walk, or roughly three-quarters of a mile, from a subway or rail station. Then they identified all of the new residential permits for buildings with at least four units that were issued in those areas, and filtered out stalled projects. Remote is a relative term, because most of these areas have some bus service, but the analysis focused on subway and rail options like the Long Island Rail Road, which often have a larger influence on property values.

There were 6,006 new apartments in the planning stages or under construction in these transit deserts through late September, according to Localize.city. That represented just 6 percent of the 97,553 new units expected in the city over the next several years, suggesting there is still plenty of underdeveloped land near train stops, in part because of recent rezoning that permits higher density building in some areas.

The neighborhoods with the most new construction at least 15 minutes away from the train were East New York in Brooklyn with 1,464 units, Astoria in Queens (1,105), Coney Island in Brooklyn (625), Forest Hills in Queens (442), and Rochdale in Queens (159). Neighborhoods in the Bronx and Staten Island also made the list.

But in seven of the 10 neighborhoods with the most new units rising in remote locations, the rate of growth in the faraway corners was as fast or faster than in more commuter-friendly parts of the neighborhood. In rapidly developing Astoria, where 44 percent of new units were in a transit desert, construction in those remote areas was growing six times faster than in the neighborhood overall."

Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts often tells voters that after she became “visibly pregnant” at the end of her first year as a public-school teacher, the principal wished her luck and hired someone else to replace her.

This week, a conservative news site and other outlets challenged her account, citing a 2007 interview with Ms. Warren and minutes from a school board meeting — and Ms. Warren pushed back in a unique way. Rather than just restating the truth of her account (though she has done that as well), she called on women to share their own stories of pregnancy discrimination, which remains widespread.

The candidates talked L.G.B.T.Q. rights

CNN and the Human Rights Campaign hosted the latest subject-based forum of the presidential race on Thursday, focused on gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender issues. Protesters interrupted the event at several points to call attention to the murders of black transgender women, and the candidates seemed to welcome the reminder.

A month later he dismissed criticisms of raising middle class taxes to pay for expanded health care, calling it “a distinction without a difference.”

By October, however, Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., had moved toward the center on all three issues . He has a climate-focused TV ad in which he says, “I believe that we need to have a plan that works for all of us.” The border crossings issue, he told CNN last week, is “the kind of stuff that gets us trapped.” And he’s a month into an attack on Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts for not explaining how she’d pay for an overhaul of health care.

For most of his political career, Mr. Buttigieg presented himself as more of a centrist technocrat than a liberal ideologue. But striving for attention in a crowded field, he spent the early part of the 2020 Democratic primary touting an array of aspirational progressive ideas, delivering speeches that could have been ripped from an Aaron Sorkin script.

Now a serious candidate with a policy staff stocked with Washington insiders and a war chest boasting millions from big donors, Mr. Buttigieg has gradually reinvented himself as more of a moderate. While he hasn’t pivoted 180 degrees on policy proposals, he is modulating his positions and drawing explicit and implicit contrasts with his progressive rivals."

Jones has grabbed the spotlight, and the reins of a championship series that was not supposed to go this way. It was — and may still be — Elena Delle Donne’s year, with her leading Washington to the W.N.B.A.’s best record and claiming her second league Most Valuable Player Award. But with Delle Donne ailing and the Sun looking at two straight home games, what seemed to many like a coronation for Delle Donne entering the series could well turn out to be the moment of ascension for Jones instead.

All that’s stood in her way to date has been an unselfishness that sometimes limits her in ways that opponents never could.

“One of the things that we’ve been very vocal about with our team, and a concerted effort down the stretch of the season and now into the playoffs, is getting J.J. touches,” Miller said. “Sometimes, we will get hung up on what that shot total looks like, but as long as we’re getting touches and playing through her, we know that adjustments are going to be made.”

Over the four seasons Jones has played in the W.N.B.A., her efficiency has not been in dispute. She is not merely tall, but a muscular presence inside, while her 3-point shooting is free and easy, a slingshot of a release that’s impossible to block, given her stature, and effectiveness — 38.5 percent from deep in her career. It all adds up to a career true shooting percentage of 61.1 percent, the fourth-highest in W.N.B.A. history.

And yet, for all this dominance, the Sun are built around sharing the ball and allowing different players to carry them offensively on different nights. This often manifests in unconventional ways, from Alyssa Thomas’s possessions that start with defensive rebounds and end with sleight of hand around the basket to the midrange stylings of the 5-foot-8 Courtney Williams, who makes up for her lack of height with a seemingly limitless vertical leap."

Quid Pro Quo or No?

Also Thursday, the acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney undercut Trump at a televised briefing, saying (and later denying) that the president had indeed held back aid to Ukraine to get it to carry out investigations that would help him politically. “Get over it,” Mulvaney said. “There’s going to be political influence in foreign policy.”

“And then Sarah Huckabee Sanders burst through the wall like Kool-Aid and took the podium back.” — JIMMY KIMMEL “O.K., hold up, hold up.

As tie choices go, it was notably more controversial than the fact that Andrew Yang , the candidate and entrepreneur, never wears one at all — and that is saying something. Mr. Yang’s tielessness, after all, is a widely understood signifier of his tech success status; Mr. Steyer’s penchant for tartan is — well, what in the world is it?

Ties in general are increasingly seen as relics of the former establishment, but in the theater of politics, they are a nod to the formality of the office and indicator of respect for the past.

When male candidates want to prove their hard working bona fides and everyday-guy-ness, they tend to lose their ties and roll up their sleeves (except for Mr. Buttigieg, who loses his jacket). When they want to appear presidential, which in a debate context is what all their costume designers — sorry, “strategic consultants” — are aiming for, the default is almost always red or blue. Those colors have all the implicit references to flag-waving patriotism, especially when placed against a white shirt, and party loyalty. When they want to push some boundaries, sometimes stripes come into play, or very occasionally, purple (a red and blue combination that suggests compromise). Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington , in his brief candidacy, favored green because, you know: climate.

Tartan, with all its connotations of Christmas, school uniforms and marching across the moor to bagpipes, may speak to a certain tradition, but it’s not a stereotypical American one, which makes it uncomfortably close to the novelty tie for many viewers."

Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage. What’s your plan for closing the income gap?

STEYER: First of all, let me say this. Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor. And the results are as shameful as Senator Sanders says, both in terms of assets and in terms of income. It’s absolutely wrong. It’s absolutely undemocratic and unfair. I was one of the first people on this stage to propose a wealth tax. I would undo every Republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations. But there’s something else going on here that is absolutely shameful, and that’s the way the money gets split up in terms of earnings. As a result of taking away the rights of working people and organized labor, people haven’t had a raise — 90 percent of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years.

If you took the minimum wage from 1980 and just adjusted it for inflation, you get 11 bucks. It’s seven and a quarter. If you included productivity gains of American workers, it would be over 20 bucks. There’s something wrong here. And that is that the corporations have bought our government. Our government has failed. That’s why I’m running for president. Because we’re not going to get any of the policies that everybody on this stage wants — health care, education, Green New Deal or a living wage — unless we break the power of these corporations.

BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Vice President Biden, you have warned against demonizing rich people. Do you believe that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren’s wealth tax plans do that?

BIDEN: No, look. Demonizing wealth — what I talked about is how you get things done. And the way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now. The idea — we have to start rewarding work, not just wealth. I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate of 39.5 percent. I would double it. Because guess what? Why in God’s name should someone who is clipping coupons in the stock market pay a lower tax rate than someone who in fact is, like I said — a schoolteacher and a firefighter? It’s ridiculous, and they pay a lower tax. Secondly, the idea that we, in fact, engage in this notion that there are — there’s $1.64 trillion in tax loopholes. You can’t justify at minimum $600 billion of that. We could eliminate it all. I could go into detail had I the time. Secondly — thirdly — what we need to do is we need to go out and make it clear to the American people that we are going to raise taxes on the wealthy. We are going to reduce tax burdens on those who are not. This is one of the reasons why these debates are kind of crazy. Because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given. The fact is, everybody is right about the fact that the fourth industrial revolution is costing jobs. It is. The fact is also corporate greed, if they’re going back and not investing in their employees, they’re reinvesting in buying back their stock."

Tonight, 12 Democratic candidates will be debating near Columbus, Ohio. Here’s what I’ll be looking for from the seven candidates with the best chances of winning the nomination:

Elizabeth Warren. Swing voters exist, and they are likely to decide the 2020 election, much as they played a decisive role in 2016 and 2018. So far, Warren has not worried much about appealing to them. Now that she’s the front-runner, can she begin to signal to Democrats that she wants to be ruthless about beating President Trump?

Joe Biden. He has yet to seem sharp for an entire debate. Can he break that streak and alleviate concerns about his ability to withstand a long, vicious campaign? I’m more interested in that than the narrow questions of how he responds to Trump’s false smears against his family.

Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. They are the best-positioned candidates to benefit from Biden’s uneven campaign and win over more moderate Democrats. Can any of the three make an explicit case: I’m stronger than Biden and more electable than Warren?"

Before Sanders, Debs was the most successful socialist candidate in American history, winning hundreds of thousands of votes in the final four of his five campaigns for president. He won 6 percent of the national popular vote in 1912, the equivalent, in 2016 numbers, of more than eight million votes

Debs was best known for his thundering attacks on industrial capitalism. A tireless campaigner, he crisscrossed the country denouncing the inhumane conditions of factory labor and berating the capitalist class for its destructive obsession with profit. “In the wage system you and your children, and your children’s children, if capitalism shall prevail until they are born, are condemned to slavery and there is no possible hope unless by throwing over the capitalists and voting for socialism,” Debs declared in a speech delivered at an Independence Day celebration in Chicago in 1901.

But Debs didn’t just condemn his class enemies. He also called on his audiences to imagine a better world — to realize the democratic and egalitarian promise of the American Revolution through collective action. “We live in the most favored land beneath the unbending sky,” he said in a speech in 1900. “We have all the raw materials and the most marvelous machinery, millions of eager inhabitants seeking employment. Nothing is so easily produced as wealth, and no man should suffer for the need of it.” Debs’s appeal, noted the historian Nick Salvatore in his 1982 biography, “Eugene V. Debs: Citizen and Socialist,” was “frequently described by contemporaries as evangelical, and transcended at that moment factional disagreements and led each in the audience to glimpse a different social order.”

Or, as one self-described “hard-bitten socialist” said to the journalist Heywood Broun at the time: “That old man with the burning eyes actually believes that there can be such a thing as the brotherhood of man. And that’s not the funniest part of it. As long as he’s around, I believe it myself.”"

Re “Race Takes Turn as Warren Faces Barrage Onstage” (front page, Oct. 16):

After watching all the Democratic debates, I am left with the following sentiments that I believe are shared by many Democrats:

My heart is with Bernie Sanders because what he says about America and what needs to be done is absolutely true. My head is with Elizabeth Warren because she is Bernie lite, a progressive who is more electable than Bernie since she is less scary to suburban Republicans and independents. And my fear puts me with Uncle Joe, because he may be most likely to beat President Trump in the swing Rust Belt states, and the thought of four more years of Trumpism is unspeakable.

But I felt the same way about Hillary Clinton and look how that turned out.

The others do nothing for this 65-year-old longtime Democrat. So how do I vote? I don’t know.

I watched the debate in a venue sponsored by supporters of Pete Buttigieg. He had some good moments. Then I wondered how he would stack up against Mr. Trump one on one: Would Americans appreciate Pete’s depth and calm or rally to re-elect the pompous bully Trump?"

And she’s certainly stirring up a lot of drama while doing it. The two-time Democratic presidential candidate continues to loom large in the psyche of her party — both as heroine and villain.

Some Democrats celebrate seeing Mrs. Clinton giving zero, uh, cares. Others, like Ms. Gabbard, see her criticism as a different kind of badge of honor.

Paul Krugman is right that a single option version of “Medicare for all” that abolishes existing private health care plans would be politically hazardous. Many of the more than half of the population that is covered by some kind of private health insurance will reflexively not like being told that they will be forced to drop their coverage. Remember how much blowback President Barack Obama received when the media reported that his vow that “ i f you like your health care plan, you can keep it” was not actually true.

Just imagine how many will feel if they are told that they won’t be permitted to keep their health insurance coverage even if they like it. If Senator Elizabeth Warren is indeed so worried about protecting her left flank from Senator Bernie Sanders that she won’t support a less absolutist “public option” plan, then the Democratic Party should choose a different candidate.

The media have done a disservice by focusing on raising of taxes to pay for a single-payer health care system rather than focusing on total costs. Currently people pay large sums for health insurance premiums, co-pays, deductibles and prescription drugs. Worse, under the present system, it is estimated that abou t 30 percent of health care costs are for administration, which is double the percentage in Canada.

Under Medicare for all, premiums, co-pays and deductibles would be eliminated. Additionally, the federal government would be able to negotiate drug prices, leading to substantial cost reductions.

That is, nearly all health care costs will be included in taxes, with minimal other costs for health care."

He did so again on Friday when he was asked whether his son’s work in Ukraine represented a conflict of interest. Pointing a finger at the questioner he said: “Let’s focus on the problem. Focus on this man, what he’s doing, that no president has ever done. No president!” The Trump campaign was soon circulating a clip of the episode.

For his allies, it is both poignant and painful that Mr. Biden’s family is again at the heart of his public identity. He lost his first wife and daughter, and nearly lost his two sons, in a car accident in the weeks after he was elected to the Senate in 1972. His final years as vice president, as well as his hopes to run for president in 2016, were overwhelmed by his elder son Beau’s death from brain cancer.

Jim Mowrer, a former Democratic congressional candidate from Iowa who served with Beau Biden in the military, said he spoke to Hunter Biden early this year and got the impression he was trying to focus on personal matters rather than the campaign. Mr. Mowrer said he saw the elder Mr. Biden in Iowa last month and they discussed not Hunter but his other son, Beau.

“Beau’s death is very, very fresh in his mind, and so now these attacks on Hunter are even more unsettling,” Mr. Mowrer said.

A big bet on South Carolina

The politics of Ukraine and impeachment have been so costly for Mr. Biden, in part, because he is confronting so many other challenges in the Democratic race : a struggle to excite liberal primary voters, an ascendant rival in Ms. Warren and a decline in fund-raising that has forced him to spend even more time appealing to donors in cities hundreds of miles from the early primary states.

Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, Greg Schultz, acknowledged some of those problems in a briefing for Democratic donors at Morgan Stanley’s New York office last month. Mr. Schultz assured the group that they had a path to the nomination that depended on winning South Carolina — the fourth primary state — and then scoring big victories in the Super Tuesday primaries in March."

Note: Facebook ad spending data from March 24 to Oct. 5. | Sources: Bully Pulpit Interactive; Facebook

When it comes to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s Facebook ads, the odds are overwhelming that people seeing them were born before 1975. For Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the opposite is true: People born in 1975 or after are more than twice as likely to see his Facebook ads than those born earlier. A gender split is clear, too: About half of Mr. Sanders’s audience are men, while about two-thirds of Mr. Biden’s are women.

Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, more or less, splits the difference between them. She has targeted a Facebook audience that more closely mirrors the projected universe of likely Democratic primary voters in 2020: more women than men (though not by as much as Mr. Biden), leaning older more than younger (but again, not by as much as Mr. Biden).

Collectively, the 19 current Democratic candidates for president have poured nearly $32 million into Facebook ads this year — more money than they have spent so far on television ads, a striking measure of the social network's ever-rising influence in politics. The heavy spending on Facebook comes even as leading party officials have raised alarms about the site’s role in American democracy.

Ms. Warren sparred with Facebook in recent days over the company’s willingness to run false ads. She has been a heavy spender nonetheless, pouring $172,000 into the site over the seven most recent days records are available.

The advertising decisions that each campaign makes on one of the Internet’s biggest platforms offer an almost unparalleled window into their political priorities and strategies, illuminating their core supporters and providing a glimpse into their potential coalitions. The spending patterns reveal not just who the campaigns are targeting but where.

The 2020 race marks the first presidential campaign where Facebook is publicly publishing who is buying ads — and whom they are targeting. This story is based on Facebook data compiled and analyzed by Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic consultancy. Its database includes estimates of which gender and age group every candidate has targeted since March but not does not include race or ethnicity, which Facebook does not explicitly allow campaigns to use for targeted ads.

Because campaigns receive so much real-time feedback from Facebook, they are able to precisely hone their audiences.

“You can prioritize toward people taking the action you want them to take,” said Alex Kellner, a Democratic strategist at Bully Pulpit. “Facebook helps you optimize toward the outcome you want.”

Aside from Mr. Sanders and Mr. Yang, candidates are mostly reaching out to older voters.

Note: Includes only spending where gender is identified.

Among the leading candidates, Mr. Sanders targets a younger and more male audience on Facebook. That mirrors his support in polls, which regularly show him strongest among young voters, and performing better among men than women.

“There’s a reason why they’re called ‘Bernie Bros,’” said Jefrey Pollock, a Democratic pollster who formerly advised Senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s campaign. “Nothing about him targeting younger men is surprising to me.”

One of the most striking findings of the Facebook advertising data is just how little Mr. Biden is spending to reach the youngest generation of voters. Less than one half of 1 percent of Mr. Biden’s Facebook ad buys have targeted users born in 1995 or later. That was the smallest share — and smallest dollar amount — that any of the 11 other candidates who will be on the debate stage Tuesday spent for any age segment.

Mr. Biden spent less than $12,000 targeting voters younger than 25 through the beginning of October. Mr. Sanders spent nearly half a million dollars targeting the same age group, according to Bully Pulpit.

Emily Williams, a Democratic digital strategist who worked on Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign, said Mr. Biden’s lack of spending on young voters was a cause for concern. “It says to me that they’re struggling to break through with younger voters,” she said, “and I hope it doesn’t mean they’ve given up on younger voters.”

Mr. Biden’s bread and butter was older women: Fifty-five percent of his entire Facebook ad budget was devoted to women 45 or older, including some ads last month about Medicare.

The targeted audience for this Biden ad on Medicare was overwhelmingly women 65 or older. Source: Facebook

It makes sense that the demographic groups targeted by the leading candidates look a lot like their existing supporters, digital strategists said, because much of the advertising so far has been seeking out new donors. A campaign’s best bet is serving ads to its base.

Still, the degree to which Facebook advertising aligns with polling can be almost eerie.

In a Quinnipiac poll last week, Mr. Biden led the field by a wide margin among voters who were at least 65 years old — the same segment he tops in Facebook ad spending. In the same survey, Mr. Sanders dominated among those 18 to 34 years old — where Mr. Sanders dominates in spending. Ms. Warren came in second in the poll among both extreme ends of the age spectrum, while she led among voters 35 to 65 years old.

On Facebook, Ms. Warren’s share of spending fell in between Mr. Sanders’s and Mr. Biden’s for every age segment.

Her spending splits were closely aligned with those of Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., whose spending skewed slightly younger and more male. The age and gender groups targeted by the billionaire Tom Steyer, who entered the race in July and has quickly outspent all his rivals, was similar to Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren.

A majority of Mr. Buttigieg’s Facebook spending has gone to those aged 45 years and above, despite running as a candidate for a “new generation,” a phrase featured in some of his ads. (Mr. Buttigieg wrote in his autobiography that back in his first run for mayor as a 29-year-old, older voters were more likely to see his youth as a positive.)

Candidates’ ad spending largely skews female.

Almost all of the candidates in the debate on Tuesday are advertising to a majority-female audience on Facebook. But the campaign most lopsidedly targeting women on Facebook is not one of the four female candidates at the debate, but Julián Castro, the former federal housing secretary. Jennifer Fiore, a senior adviser to Mr. Castro, was not surprised by that fact.

She noted that Mr. Castro’s campaign manager and other top strategists are women and that Mr. Castro has made his mother a big part of his pitch, featuring her in video ads on Facebook earlier this year. (Of late, the campaign has also run Facebook ads with pictures of puppies, touting that Mr. Castro would “make animal abuse a federal crime.”)

“We’re targeting women because women are responding,” Ms. Fiore said.

That self-reinforcing truism is a feature across the platform: Operatives said that Facebook’s formulas encourage advertisers to double-down on whatever demographic groups are already clicking, driving those candidates with older bases to target ever older audiences, and vice versa.

That, for instance, is how Andrew Yang, the former tech executive, is targeting an overwhelmingly male and young audience. (Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii skews slightly more male but she is spending a fraction of what Mr. Yang is.)

“The Facebook algorithm optimizes for people who are taking action,” said Eric Ming, the director of paid media for the Yang campaign, explaining that Mr. Yang’s demographics are younger and more male because that is where his message is resonating. The ads also often feature cartoon character versions of the candidate.

Digital strategists describe three phases to online advertising in campaigns. The first is acquiring new donors and supporters. The second is persuading undecided voters. The third is getting people out to vote.

For the most part, campaigns have been focused on the first phase. But some have begun to invest in persuasion — and it’s visible in their geographic splits.

Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Steyer are dominant in the first four voting states.

For Senator Kamala Harris of California, her biggest states for advertising in the spring were those with the biggest populations: California, New York, Texas and Florida. But in July, she shifted. Her biggest state for Facebook advertising in each of the last three months has been Iowa, a shift made in spending priorities long before she publicly announced her “pivot” to focus on that state’s leadoff caucuses.

In September, for the first time, South Carolina jumped up to one of her biggest spending states. That month, she spent $52,000 there on Facebook, second to Mr. Steyer.

Mr. Buttigieg has been the biggest spender on Facebook nationally, besides Mr. Steyer and his virtually unlimited budget. Mr. Buttigieg’s dominance is particularly apparent in the opening states of Iowa and New Hampshire. In September, Mr. Buttigieg was the top spender in both states by a wide margin. In fact, he spent more than all his rivals, other than Mr. Steyer, combined.

As the Democrats have focused on the critical primary contests, President Trump has flooded Facebook with messaging aimed at the general election. In the last month, he spent more than $700,000 on Facebook ads just in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida — four swing states he narrowly carried in 2016.

“Danger, danger, danger!” said Betsy Hoover, who was the director of digital organizing for Mr. Obama’s re-election campaign and is unaligned in the 2020 primary.

Ms. Hoover said she worries that Democrats are “focusing on the coasts or early states — none of which matter in the general,” while Mr. Trump is delivering his message to key voters.

“We are running a primary strategy and Trump is running a general election strategy,” she said, “And that’s terrifying.”"

Peinovich grew up in liberal, affluent Maplewood, N.J. All you really need to know about Peinovich’s m.o. is that he hosts a podcast called “The Daily Shoah.” Peinovich’s father was so ashamed by his son’s radicalization that after the Charlottesville rally in 2017, he asked Peinovich to change his name — eliciting bruised complaints from Peinovich about his father’s abject insensitivity. “Perhaps if you had shown more sympathy and interest in fairness,” Mike Jr. wrote to Mike Sr., “my decision would be different.”

Is this a son who feels deeply hurt? Or is this a petulant man who has a preternatural gift for trolling? Could he be a bit of both — and does that mean anything? Marantz’s wife was once a public defender who represented some people accused of “horrifically violent” crimes; if you believe in rehabilitation, do you also hold out hope that even a few of the people Marantz meets might be redeemed?

Questions like these come up again and again for Marantz, who is an essential part of this narrative, which has as much to do with the collapsing media ecosystem that allowed these people to flourish as it does with the people themselves. Marantz knows that his subjects see him as a stand-in for an insipid media elite — a boring category that he bristles at, though the lurid extremism he encounters forces him to accept that he’s a “reluctant institutionalist.” He finds himself feeling protective of a system that he knows is flawed but is better than the cruelly nihilistic alternative.

“Of all that I resented about the Deplorables,” Marantz writes, “one of the things I found most irksome was that they forced me to think like an establishment shill.”

Marantz meets a number of women who joined the alt-right movement. Some of their stories exude a dismal obliviousness: A former Bernie Sanders supporter and ardent Bob Dylan fan — “one of the last true rebels,” she gushes — busily assembles gift baskets for the DeploraBall in Washington while the male organizers do nothing to help her, scrolling through Twitter on their phones. Other trajectories are downright chilling: One woman ascended the ranks of the alt-right by appearing “confident enough to keep up with the guys, but subservient enough to know her place”; she went from being a volunteer for the Obama campaign to someone who gave a Nazi salute.

As disturbing as these specific stories are, what filled me with a creeping sense of dread were the parts of “Antisocial” that incisively describe how a Darwinian information environment has degraded to the point where it now selects for people who can command the most attention with the fewest scruples. Marantz meets a 60-year-old “surly racist” with 25,000 subscribers on YouTube who, in another era, might have been relegated to muttering on his front porch."

Ms. Gabbard, in response, fashioned an insult for Mrs. Clinton that seemed drawn from the “Iliad,” or perhaps “Game of Thrones,” calling Mrs. Clinton “the queen of warmongers.”

Mrs. Clinton’s assertions, backed only by innuendo, verged on the conspiratorial, yet it is a sign of the times that it was hard not to wonder at least for a moment whether to take her seriously. No one can honestly doubt that the Russian government is trying to foster chaos and disunity in the United States. Certainly it has preferred presidential candidates. If the Russians think there is something to be gained by indirectly or directly supporting someone, why wouldn’t they?

You’re a conspiracy theorist, as the saying goes, only if there isn’t a conspiracy.

Even so, it is a terrible thing to label candidates as “Russian assets” based on their views alone. It actually helps create its own kind of propaganda victory for foreign rivals, by replacing serious policy debate with rumor-mongering and suggestions of disloyalty."

In addition to providing a ratings boon, an emphasis on politics wins accolades. HBO’s “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver,” a show that is as much journalism as it is comedy, has won the Emmy for outstanding variety talk series four years in a row. And with the 2020 campaign heating up, the presidential candidates Joseph R. Biden Jr., Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Beto O’Rourke, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker have all made the late-night rounds.

“If you’re a candidate now and you’re not on one of these shows or discussed by one of these hosts, you are not alive,” said Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran Democratic political consultant.

Hollywood stars are still staples of late night. “If I could have Tom Hanks every night, I would get him,” Mr. Licht said. Will Smith scored 3.9 million viewers for his recent appearance on Mr. Colbert’s show, and James Corden, the host of CBS’s “The Late Late Show,” has lately led the 12:30 a.m. time slot in total viewers with a program that often has the feel of a celebrity clubhouse.

But Mr. Corden’s rival Seth Meyers, the host of NBC’s “Late Night With Seth Meyers, ” drew more total viewers in the 2018-19 season thanks to a formula that had him devoting the first 20 minutes of his show to the latest on Mr. Trump. Mr. Meyers also led among adult viewers under 50 last season, and he remains the leader among that segment of the audience.

In this supercharged news environment, anchors like Bret Baier and Chris Wallace, both of Fox News, have been late-night guests, as have the CBS News stalwarts Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell. When Ms. King and Ms. O’Donnell were the lead guests on Mr. Colbert’s live show after the State of the Union address in February, they drew an audience of 4.6 million.

Jay Sures, a co-president of the United Talent Agency, which represents many news anchors, said he had noticed a spike in bookings for his clients. “They’ve unintentionally become celebrities based on how the news business has become part of our daily routine in a way it never has before,” he said. “The Trump era has elevated news.”"

Journalists have been badgering Warren to get specific about how much taxes would have to go up to pay for Medicare for all. She has, with considerable justice, insisted that this is a bad way to frame the discussion, since any additional taxes would be offset by savings on the huge premiums workers and their employers now pay for private insurance — on average, more than $20,000 a year for a family plan.

The right question is whether the overall costs facing U.S. families would go up or down. Warren has been claiming that for most families, they would go down, but she hasn’t offered specifics. And this vagueness, which has started to seem like evasiveness, is more of a problem for her than it might be for other politicians. As I said, Warren has made policy seriousness a key aspect of her political persona, so her fogginess on health care really stands out.

The plan in the works will presumably try to dispel that fog, but doing so will be tricky. An independent estimate from the Urban Institute (which is, for what it’s worth, left-leaning) suggests that a highly comprehensive Medicare-for-all plan, similar to what Sanders is proposing, would substantially increase overall health spending, although a more modest plan wouldn’t.

But cost isn’t the only issue — in fact, I’m not sure how important it really is, given that full abolition of private insurance remains unlikely in practice. Also, let’s get real: If Warren gets the Democratic nomination, the outcome of the general election isn’t going to hinge on dueling think tank estimates.

The election might, however, hinge on the support of people who have good private coverage and would be nervous about making a leap into the unknown, no matter how many facts and figures Warren deploys.

So what I’ll want to see is whether Warren gives herself and her party enough flexibility to assuage these concerns. I’m not sure what form that flexibility might take. Maybe something like an extended transition period, with greatly enhanced Obamacare (which might actually be politically doable) in the interim?

Whatever Warren comes up with, this is a crucial moment. There are many excellent things in her overall policy agenda; but she won’t get a chance to do those things unless she can extricate herself from what looks like a health policy trap.

But the public’s rising disgust with corruption in the Democratic administration of Mayor David Rose led to steady and significant gains for the socialists, and in 1910 they won 21 of 35 City Council seats, 14 state legislative seats and the mayor’s office. That year, Victor Berger also became the first socialist elected to Congress.

There was no need to go on a “listening tour” to find out what the working class wanted, since so many of the party’s newly elected officials were workers themselves, including the new mayor of Milwaukee, a woodcarver named Emil Seidel. The eldest of 11 children, Seidel had been forced to go to work after grammar school. He and his fellow socialists in city government — including his personal secretary, the poet Carl Sandburg — instituted dozens of measures to improve their constituents’ lives.

They installed hundreds of drinking fountains, prosecuted restaurateurs for serving tainted food and compelled factory owners to put in heating systems and toilets. Most significantly, Seidel appointed an aggressive new health commissioner, whose department oversaw a reduction of more than 40 percent in the number of cases of the six leading contagious diseases, among them scarlet fever, whooping cough and smallpox, within two years.

The most widely admired trait of the sewer socialists was their integrity. “They never were approached by the lobbyists, because the lobbyists knew it was not possible to influence these men,” William Evjue, a Republican assemblyman, said of his socialist colleagues. Chicago, 80 miles to the south, was awash in corruption for decades, while Seidel’s administration had largely cleaned up Milwaukee’s municipal government in its brief run. But Democrats and Republicans joined forces to run a single candidate against Seidel, and he and most of the city’s elected socialists were defeated in 1912. (Later that year, when Debs ran for president, Seidel was his running mate, helping the Socialist Party win 6 percent of the vote, its highest percentage ever.)

One Milwaukee socialist who survived, however, was Daniel Hoan, the city attorney, who was not up for re-election that year. In 1916, Hoan avenged the socialists’ losses by winning the mayor’s office, which he held until 1940. Hoan oversaw further public investment, including the construction of the nation’s first public housing project, Garden Homes.

During Hoan’s tenure, an urban planner named Charles Whitnall designed sewer socialism’s most enduring achievement: the Milwaukee County park system, one of the most extensive and acclaimed in the country. The city added miles of new parkland along Lake Michigan’s waterfront, which had been dominated by private mansions.

Hoan adhered to sewer socialism’s tradition of spending taxpayer money frugally. “The objective is to give the best government possible,” Hoan once said. “But not necessarily at a low tax rate — at the lowest cost that can be paid.” During the Depression, he created a voluntary program in which city employees, including Hoan, took a 10 percent pay cut to fund public works projects that put nearly 15,000 unemployed people to work."

How many trillion???

Mr. Biden, deploying one of his favorite rhetorical weapons against Medicare for All, said Tuesday night that the plan would cost $30 trillion, or roughly 278 Jeff Bezoses, over the next 10 years. But Mr. Sanders has pointed out that that figure is much less than what the current system is projected to cost.

The truth is that no one knows for certain whether the country’s health care costs — which in total and per person far exceed those of any other industrialized country — would go up or down under Medicare for All. Ezekiel J. Emanuel and Victor R. Fuchs explain in The Times:

Medicare for All would move money from one column (private health insurance spending) to another (federal health spending); it does not automatically increase total costs. … We have our doubts about Medicare for All. But unaffordability is not a reason to oppose it.

“In some estimates, the country would not pay more for health care,” a Times analysis of five studies found. Rather, there would be “a drastic shift in who is doing the paying.” For that reason, it is more accurate to think of Mr. Sanders’s plan not as an outlay of (imaginary) money but as a redistribution of it away from insurers, drug companies, health care providers and higher-income people.

About those taxes …

Ms. Warren has drawn criticism for her continued unwillingness during debates to say whether Medicare for All would cause taxes to go up for middle-class families. Mr. Sanders admits they would, but Ms. Warren has refused the premise of the question, emphasizing the money most taxpayers would save overall after premiums (which come out of many people’s paychecks like taxes), deductibles, co-pays and coverage gaps are eliminated.

Middle-class people would “save a lot of money on health care,” the Kaiser Family Foundation’s Larry Levitt told NPR in July. Yet how exactly their net costs would change depends on the particulars of Medicare for All’s funding plans, which neither Mr. Sanders nor Ms. Warren has fully outlined. The Times wrote in a fact check:

Mr. Sanders has suggested various possible tax increases that could pay for this expansion, including a payroll tax that would affect workers across the economic spectrum. He has not provided enough details about the mix and magnitude of taxes for economists to measure what sorts of families would be better or worse off under Medicare for all.

Why not a public option?

Americans should be allowed to keep their private health insurance, Mr. Buttigieg has argued.

“The problem, Senator Sanders, with that damn bill that you wrote, and that Senator Warren backs is that it doesn’t trust the American people,” Mr. Buttigieg said during September’s debate. “I trust you to choose what makes the most sense for you, not my way or the highway.” He elaborated on his own health care plan, which he calls “Medicare for all who want it,” in an earlier debate:

You take something like Medicare, a flavor of that, you make it available on the exchanges, people can buy in. And then if people like us are right, that that will be not only a more inclusive plan, but a more efficient plan than any of the corporate answers out there, then it will be a very natural glide path to the single-payer environment.

Critics of public option proposals point out that the path may not actually be so glide-y. That’s because the price of health care services — not insurance or pharmaceutical profits — is the primary driver of America’s ballooning health care spending. Only a single-payer system can restrain those costs, Benjamin Studebaker and Nathan J. Robinson argue in the left-wing magazine Current Affairs, because it gives the government a monopoly on access to patients. “If instead there are a large number of insurance companies, providers can play those insurance companies off each other,” they write."

Opinion Out With the Old, In With the Young

It’s not just that President Trump is a well-seasoned 73 and his three top Democratic Party challengers are also septuagenarians. The average senator is now almost 63 and the average member of the House nearly 58, making them roughly 20 years older than their average constituent, and nearly a decade older than they were in 1981.

Older people today hold disproportionate power because they have the numbers and the means to do so. People 65 and older, for example, are more than three times as likely to make political donations as those under 30. As a result, their voices, amplified by money, carry farther politically than those of the young and impecunious.

There are a lot of voices in their chorus. The American electorate is the oldest it’s been since at least 1970 and is graying at a rapid clip, with the well-off living longer than ever before. By 2034, according to the Census Bureau, the population 65 and older will exceed the population under 18; by 2060 the 65-and-older crowd is projected to have almost doubled. There are some 74 million baby boomers alone, and when election time comes, they turn out in droves. During the 2018 midterms, 64 percent of citizens ages 54 to 72 cast a ballot, compared to 31 percent of eligible voters 29 and under.

“Money, numbers and power have been inexorably accruing to the aging ‘baby boomer’ generation for the last few decades,” the political scientist John Seery warned in his 2011 book “Too Young to Run?” The trends show no signs of slowing. Migration to metropolitan centers by people who tend to be younger and more diverse, along with rural depopulation and aging, will only intensify age-based inequities given the geographic biases of the American electoral system. Call it the coming gerontocracy.

While significant divisions exist within every age cohort (many older people in this country are progressive and poor, just as some young people are rich and right-wing), the divisions between older and younger generations are becoming increasingly salient. Of course, young people are not intrinsically enlightened or virtuous compared to their elders — as someone who just turned 40, I certainly hope that’s not the case — and our society desperately needs older people to participate in public life.

But our democracy is in a moment of crisis. People are, for good reason, losing faith in institutions, parties and political processes and questioning longstanding assumptions. Everything, it seems, is up for grabs. The lack of intergenerational justice, of equity between the young and old, is an underappreciated facet of the current turmoil: A hoary establishment hoards influence, curtailing young people’s ability to effect change.

That is not to say that the faults in America’s political system are solely the result of its biases against the young; the problems we face are myriad and addressing gerontocracy won’t solve them all. But an antiquated system that produces unrepresentative leadership is ill equipped to respond to the problems of our time. And that should concern anyone committed to democratic ideals.

A profound and growing experiential divide now fuels conflicting outlooks, material interests and political priorities. Not only is the cohort of people born after 1980 much more diverse than that of Americans now entering retirement (nearly 80 percent of Americans over 65 are white, a figure that drops to around 50 percent for people between 6 and 21) they are less well-off compared to their predecessors at the same age. (Given the persistence of racial discrimination, though, diversity and precarity cannot be neatly disentangled.)

Contrary to stereotypes, polls show that young people across the political spectrum are deeply concerned about the state of the world. This concern has translated into rising youth voter turnout and a resurgence of protest movements. On a range of issues, including global warming, gun control, economic inequality, racism, immigration and trans rights, youth-led movements are creating a generational insurgency.

But this insurgency faces major obstacles. From age limits on voting and eligibility for office, to the way House districts are drawn, to the problem of money in politics, our modern political system is stacked against the young. These barriers need to be openly acknowledged and broken down.

We the (Old) People

Black and indigenous people, white men without property, women and some religious groups were all excluded from America’s original democratic compact. So were young people, though we rarely consider this fact.

In “Too Young to Run?” Professor Seery argues that the Constitution effectively treats young people as second-class citizens by imposing minimum age requirements for elected federal office: 25 for Congress, 30 for the Senate, and 35 for president. The nation’s framers, the youngest of whom was 26, Professor Seery writes, “bequeathed an age bias unto posterity by which they themselves did not fully abide,” devising rules ensuring that the country would be governed by people more senior than themselves. (The founders no doubt knew a Latin root of the word “senator,” senex, means “old man.”)

The geographically based idiosyncrasies of American democracy that the founders put in place compound the problem. On average, ballots cast by older people hold more weight and are less frequently “wasted” than those of the young. (Wasted votes are those garnered in excess of what a candidate needs to win; in our winner-take-all systems that means anything over 50 percent.) Clustered in sparsely populated states and counties, voters who are older, whiter and wealthier get a boost: Older Americans wield disproportionate sway over the Electoral College, the Senate and a gerrymandered Congress.

Migration patterns worsen these trends. A growing percentage of young people now dream of city life, but their preferences inadvertently reduce their political clout: “18 percent of rural residents are 65 or older versus 15 percent in suburban and small metro counties and 13 percent in cities,” the Pew Research Center reported last year. Millennials, concentrated in metropolitan areas, are the predominant generation of potential voters in only 86 congressional districts, while boomer voters predominate in 341. By 2040, 70 percent of Americans are expected to live in the 15 most populous states; that would mean that 70 percent of America will be represented by only 30 senators.

Not Your Grandfather’s Generation Gap

On Sept. 20, millions of people around the world took to the streets as part of the youth-led Global Climate Strike, a week of protests timed with the United Nations climate summit. The movement began when the 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg stopped attending classes to protest government failure to curb greenhouse gas emissions. (Ms. Thunberg said she was inspired by the anti-gun violence walkouts led by high school students from Parkland, Fla.)

One of the young Americans who took up Ms. Thunberg’s call to action was Haven Coleman, a 13-year-old from Colorado. A co-founder of the national group U.S. Youth Climate Strike, she began skipping school every Friday to head to the steps of the State Capitol in Denver. Older people often stop to tell her they don’t understand why she’s protesting. “Because you didn’t do it,” she replies.

The environment is one of the critical lines separating the old from the young. Baby boomers may have helped organize the first Earth Day in 1970, but back then ecological disaster was a more distant threat. Today, intimate knowledge of planetary devastation, from hurricanes to forest fires, is distressingly common. When the Colorado hills burn, Ms. Coleman’s asthma flares up.

The other critical divide is the economy. The boomers who came of age in the 1950s and ’60s benefited from boom times while millennials and Generation Z have been dogged by the aftermath of the mortgage meltdown, an underwhelming recovery and Gilded Age levels of inequality. One generation enjoyed a comparatively high minimum wage, affordable college tuition and reasonable costs of living; for everyone after, stagnating wages, ballooning student debt and unaffordable housing have become the norm.

“Millennials are less well off than members of earlier generations when they were young,” a 2018 report by economists from the Federal Reserve Board bluntly states. Other economists have shown that a household headed by someone born in 1970 has a quarter less income and 40 percent less wealth than one headed by a comparable person born in 1940. In contrast, between 1989 and 2013, only the cohort of families headed by people at least 62 saw an increase in median wealth. Older people are more likely to own property, stocks and other assets — and, consequently, to prefer policies that will keep the values of those assets high. No wonder so many young people have pivoted left, rejecting conventional wisdom about the virtues of unfettered capitalism.

Just as affluence translates into political power, being comparatively precarious creates a disempowering feedback loop. Burdened by student loans, young people are postponing home ownership, marriage and starting families. As a result, they are less likely to feel they have a stake in the communities where they live, which means they are less likely to participate politically and thus have their interests adequately represented. This puts policies overwhelmingly favored by the young at a further disadvantage.

Votes for Children

Some might argue that the problem of gerontocracy isn’t really a problem at all. Even if young people do not have equal political rights as older people, it evens out eventually; young people actually do possess the same political rights as their elders, just not yet.

The limits of this “be patient and wait your turn attitude” were on display in February, when protesters associated with the youth-led Sunrise Movement clashed with Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, then 85, over the need for a Green New Deal. In a video of the encounter, a group ranging in age from 11 to 24 insist that Ms. Feinstein is duty-bound to listen to their concerns about the warning by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that we have just over a decade to avert the worst effects of global warming. “Well, you didn’t vote for me,” the senator says, dismissing a girl who says she is 16.

For any adult with half a conscience, the senator’s remarks held up a discomfiting mirror, a reminder of our complicity in the present crisis. For younger viewers, it encapsulated a growing sense that many older people, even those who are ostensibly liberals, are dangerously blasé about the future — and that their willingness to play with fire stems from their belief that they won’t live long enough to get burned.

A month after the confrontation with Ms. Feinstein went viral, getting more than 10 million views, Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts introduced a proposal to lower the federal voting age to 16. Since the era of Plato’s Republic, aged-based exclusions have almost always been justified in terms of youthful immaturity and the wisdom that comes with experience. Ms. Pressley instead highlighted the fact that young people have their own distinct experiential wisdom:

A 16-year-old will bring with them the 2019 fears that their father’s insulin will run out before the next paycheck.

A 17-year-old will bring with them the 2019 hopes to be the first in their family to earn a college degree.

A 17-year-old will bring with them a 2019 solemn vow to honor the lives of their classmates stolen by a gunman.

The proposal failed by 126 to 305, an outcome in line with the likely result if the matter was put to a popular vote: A full 75 percent of registered voters oppose enfranchising 17-year-olds; 84 percent oppose it for 16-year-olds. (Individual states, however, may lower the voting age for state and local elections.)

David Runciman, a professor of politics at Cambridge, disagrees with mainstream public sentiment. The structural disenfranchisement of young people, he argues, must be remedied by even more drastic measures. His proposal: Enfranchise everyone over the age of 6. “What’s the worst that could happen?” he asked on a podcast last year. Given the current president of the United States, it’s not clear that letting kids vote would yield worse outcomes than what adults have delivered.

For Professor Runciman, the fundamental issue is fairness. He points to the 2016 Brexit vote, in which 73 percent of the 18-24 age group cast a ballot for Remain when more than 60 percent of 65 and older voted Leave. Hundreds of thousands of people who were too young to vote will have to spend their entire lives dealing with the repercussions of a nostalgic, ill-considered decision made by people not long for this earth.

It turns out there are plenty of pragmatic reasons to lower the voting age, if not to 6 then to 16. And not just because politicians like Senator Feinstein would have to listen to kids about global warming.

In 2013, Takoma Park, Md., became the first city in the United States to lower the voting age for local elections to 16. The turnout rate of 16- and 17-year-olds in the next election was nearly twice that of those 18 and older, inspiring the nearby town of Hyattsville to follow Takoma Park’s example.

Something similar happened in local elections in Norway in 2011, when 21 municipalities conducted a trial lowering the voting age from 18 to 16. A range of studies support the conclusion that 18 is not the optimal age to bestow the right to vote; people are leaving the nest and too preoccupied navigating college and work to figure out how to cast a ballot, let alone register to do so.

It is also the case that voting, though typically regarded as the paramount individual right, is actually a social affair. Research conducted in Denmark shows that having children old enough to vote at home makes their parents more likely to vote as well. And it’s habitual: Once you vote, you are more likely to do it again. A person’s first election is critical, a kind of democratic gateway drug, and it’s best to get him hooked young.

Sixteen seems a reasonable time to start. And lowering the voting age might also encourage more young people to run in the local and state races where the Constitution’s age restrictions do not apply.

Vote and Revolt

If our goal is to break the grip of the coming gerontocracy, giving more teenagers access to the ballot is a necessary but insufficient step. The inequities that result from the role of money in politics and our geographically based electoral system also need to be remedied. Otherwise, the power structure will keep pandering to older — and whiter and more affluent — voters.

To approach something resembling intergenerational justice, at least two additional transformations are required: campaign finance reform and a more proportional system of representation.

The imbalance of financial resources between the young and the old puts a generational twist on a longstanding conundrum: The concentration of political power that flows from concentration of wealth is anathema to the principle of political equality. A teenager working for minimum wage or a young parent struggling with student debt should have the same influence over her elected representatives as a retiree who has amassed a lifetime of wealth. Publicly financing elections would go a long way toward putting people of different ages on more even political footing.

At the same time, we need a new motto. Not “one person, one vote,” but “one person, one equally meaningful vote.” The Fair Representation Act proposed in the House is a step in the right direction, pointing the way to a more proportional model of congressional representation using larger multi-member districts. (The imbalances inherent to the Senate and Electoral College would need to be fixed through other means.)

Under a proportional system, if a party wins the support of 25 percent of votes cast by a given electorate, it gets 25 percent of the seats — votes are no longer “wasted” and more people are represented. Research indicates that more proportional systems may increase youth turnout by as much as 12 percentage points while also encouraging younger candidates to run for office. Larger districts would help address the problem of gerrymandering while urban-rural polarization, and the age-based inequities that stem from it, would diminish.

Some might respond that pursuing generational parity is the wrong approach. Recently, the Oxford University professor William MacAskill proposed age-weighting votes in favor of the young. By his accounting, 18- to 27- year-olds should possess six times the voting weight of someone 68 or older. Whether desirable or not, his thought experiment is provocative: Why shouldn’t those who will have to live longer with the consequences of elections have more of a say?

Such imaginative reforms are, of course, distant and unlikely prospects, which means it is incumbent on older people to find more immediate ways to express intergenerational solidarity. Just as many men stand against patriarchy, so can older people resist the gerontocracy.

Unlike their boomer predecessors who rallied under the ageist motto “Don’t trust anyone over 30,” kids today are eager to find venerable allies. Consider the popularity of the 78-year-old democratic socialist Bernie Sanders (still the favored presidential candidate among college-aged voters) or the fact that the 73-year-old Senator Ed Markey (a co-sponsor, along with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of the Green New Deal) recently secured the endorsement of the youthful Sunrise Movement over his telegenic 39-year-old primary challenger. They may be septuagenarians but they embrace millennial priorities.

Those of us who are older, if not wiser, should take another cue from young activists. We need to support forward-looking policies, and we also need to protest.

Climate activists in Denver gathered to hear Greta Thunberg speak on Oct. 11. Marc Piscotty/Getty Images

On Oct. 11, several thousand people, including Ms. Thunberg, gathered near the Colorado Capitol. For once, Ms. Coleman wasn’t the only climate striker in sight. Addressing the crowd, she didn’t spend a moment pleading to be formally enfranchised (though she has told me she thinks 16-year-olds should be). Her overwhelming mission was to spur adults to join the revolt. “Our hard work does not absolve you of action,” she said. “Adults step up.”

Ms. Coleman’s emphasis on the power of protest is historically informed. If the past proves anything, it is that structural reforms are rarely secured through elections alone. We should see the goal of including young people in political life as part of the prolonged fight for a more robust and inclusive democracy — a system, lest we forget, based on the premise that those affected by a decision should have a say in making it. This task is all the more urgent given the concerted effort to undermine hard-won democratic gains. The generational implications of brazen attempts to shore up minority rule by shrinking and disempowering the electorate through methods such as gerrymandering, voter ID laws and dark money too often go unremarked.

In 1776, John Adams wrote that the legislature should be in miniature “an exact portrait of the people at large -- it should think, feel, reason and act like them.” Should we ever build a movement powerful enough to create a government that takes this founder at his word, the result could be astounding: a democracy in which elected officials are responsive to the full range of their constituents; universal access to college and medical care ensures an educated and healthy citizenry; and the environment protected for generations to come. Over the long term, these outcomes — and this more democratic system — would benefit the vast majority of people, young and old alike."

The movie theater industry has long been at odds with online video. Why trek to theaters if thousands of movies are available at the click of a button at home or on your phone?

But that “windowing” practice, many analysts believe, will become untenable as streaming services like Netflix gain clout.

Focusing only on taxes is pointless. But in a larger way, she’s wrong.

The No. 1 reason to question her version of Medicare for All — in which private health insurance would be eliminated — is its political viability. It would be an enormous disruption to the health care system, and history shows that health care disruptions are very hard to pass and usually unpopular at first. Polls show that her plan is already unpopular, and it would be a bigger disruption than Obamacare or Bill Clinton’s failed plan.

Given all that, she needs to engage with the political realities — with how she would overcome people’s resistance to giving up their health insurance for a larger new program that, yes, would require a tax increase.

I think Warren has run an excellent campaign on the whole, and I think she has the most thoughtful agenda for addressing the stagnating living standards of most Americans. I’m surprised that she has chosen to focus so much of her candidacy on the most aggressive version of Medicare for All. But she has. Now it’s time for her to tell voters how she will deal with the politics of passing it.

In my view, her best answer involves finding a way to signal her openness to a transition, in which people who want to keep their private insurance can do so (and taxes don’t yet need to rise) while Medicare initially expands voluntarily. That idea is hugely popular."

The early state polling drought in the 2020 Democratic presidential contest really does seem to be ending. After this weekend’s gold-standard Selzer poll from Iowa, today we received results from high-quality polls in New Hampshire (Monmouth) and Nevada (USA Today/Suffolk).

The most immediate news in this mini-harvest of public opinion is that the Monmouth poll qualified a 12th candidate for the October Democratic debates in Ohio by taking 2 percent, Tulsi Gabbard now has met the four-poll 2 percent threshold. This development all but eliminates any doubts that this round of debates will again be a two-day affair, after the brief bliss of ten candidates fitting on the same stage in Houston earlier this month.

The same poll, though, continues a string of bad results for Bernie Sanders in terms of his standing in early states vis-à-vis his progressive rival Elizabeth Warren. Monmouth has Warren now edging Joe Biden in the Granite State by a 27-25 margin — but with Sanders down to 12 percent, just ahead of Pete Buttigieg with 10 percent. This is extremely similar to what Selzer found in Iowa (Warren 22 percent, Biden 20 percent, Sanders 11 percent, Buttigieg 9 percent). That makes any suspicion (based on an national poll in August showing Warren in a three-way tie with Biden and Sanders) that Monmouth is somehow putting a thumb on the scales for Warren a non-starter. The USA Today/Suffolk poll of Nevada shows Biden still in the lead with 23 percent, but Sanders at 14 percent is trailing Warren’s 19 percent by a significant margin. Indeed, as Nate Silver pointed out (a bit too avidly, you might say, but accurately), poor early state poll numbers for Sanders are becoming too routine for comfort:

This is a list Bernie Sanders' standing in all early- state polls since the Houston debate



IA: 9% (David Binder Research)

IA: 11% (Selzer)

NH: 12% (Monmouth)

NV: 14% (Suffolk)

IA: 16% (Civiqs) — Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) September 24, 2019

As a reminder, Sanders won nearly half the vote in Iowa and Nevada in 2016, along with 60 percent of the vote in New Hampshire.

Like his fellow late-septuagenarian Joe Biden, Sanders is doing quite a bit better in national polls. The latest RealClearPolitics averages have Biden at 30 percent, Warren at 20 percent, and Sanders at 17 percent, with Buttigieg way back at 6 percent. But the trends aren’t great for Bernie. For months one of his bulwarks was the vast Morning Consult tracking poll. He’s now fallen behind Warren there, too.

Aside from the good news for Gabbard concerning the October debates, we are now in the window when selected polls will count toward qualification for the November debate, too. With today’s releases, there are now two national qualifying polls and three from the early states, with the threshold now up to a three percent showing in four national and/or early state polls, or 5 percent from two early state polls. The Big Three plus Buttigieg and Harris are hitting these thresholds routinely, but among the iffier candidates, it’s notable that Booker and Yang now have two qualifying polls, while Klobuchar, O’Rourke, and Steyer have just one (September debate participant Julian Castro has been skunked so far, as has Gabbard, whose qualifying number from Monmouth for October fell short of the November threshold).

We’re probably looking at a single night of debates in November, but the thing to watch is whether the current Big Three of Biden, Warren, and Sanders is looking more like a Big Two with Bernie slipping back and perhaps some other candidate coming on."

For a minute there, it looked like Elizabeth Warren’s 2020 campaign would burst into flames five feet above its launchpad. The senator began her presidential bid by attempting to nullify one of her conspicuous liabilities — only to amplify that liability, amuse conservatives, and alienate indigenous groups. Within months, her finance director had quit, and her top left-wing rival had out fundraised her by an order of magnitude. Then, Joe Biden made his candidacy official, and promptly opened up a 30-point lead over the Massachusetts senator.

Nevertheless, she persisted. And with a little over four months before Iowa gets caucusing, Warren’s prospects have radically changed. As of this writing, betting markets now consider her by far the most likely candidate to win the Democratic nomination. For months now, each wave of new polling has shown her star steadily rising both nationally and in early primary states. And the latest batch of surveys is no exception.

A national Quinnipiac poll released Tuesday finds Warren’s support nationally climbing from 19 percent in August to 27 percent today — a large enough gain to put her ahead of Biden in that survey for the first time ever. Meanwhile, a new UC Berkeley/Los Angeles Times poll of the California primary suggests Warren has gained 11 points in the Golden State since June, giving her a commanding lead over the rest of the field. Meanwhile, the most recent data from the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire comport with this general trend.

But the best news for Warren in these polls may lay beneath the headline data. Here are five quick takeaways from the last week of polling that bode well for Warren’s odds of facing Trump next November:

1) Biden is bending, and just might break.

If you only looked at the national polling averages, Uncle Joe would appear to be in very solid shape. RealClearPolitics’s poll of polls has Biden boasting 29 percent support, which is just a tiny shade beneath where he’s typically been over the past three months; in other words, the national data shows no steep or uniform decline in Biden’s standing.

But in the early voting states — where each campaign’s resources have been concentrated — the picture looks much dimmer for the former vice-president. At the start of July, Biden’s average support in Iowa was 26 percent; today, it’s just 20. Warren now leads the field in the Hawkeye State by nearly three points in RCP’s polling average. And surveys from New Hampshire tell a similar story: As of mid-July, Biden was leading Warren there by an average of 22 points; now, he leads by an average of three. And Monmouth University poll released this week has Warren ahead of him by two.

Meanwhile, the national landscape may be in the process of converging on Iowa and New Hampshire’s: In Quinnipiac’s newly released national poll, Biden’s support is 7 percent lower than it was in the same survey one month ago. Other pollsters have documented declines in the percentage of Biden supporters who are “enthusiastic” about their candidate. Finally, there are some non-empirical reasons to think the former vice president’s standing will continue to erode. Thus far, Biden has benefited from the perception that he would be a uniquely “electable” nominee. But the increasingly conspicuous decline in his verbal skills — combined with the fact that the Democrats’ newly launched impeachment push is sure to call attention to his son Hunter’s influence-peddling (and Trump’s ostensibly, wildly false allegation that Biden corruptly intervened to fire a Ukranian prosecutor who was looking into Hunter’s company) — could erode Biden’s claim to being the Democrats’ “safe” option.

2) Warren’s base of support appears to be diversifying.

For most of the campaign, one of Warren’s apparent weaknesses was her coalition’s demographic homogeneity: She commanded the adoration of college-educated whites, but piddling levels of support among most other parts of the Democratic coalition.

This fact lent itself to two competing interpretations:

1) Something about Warren’s persona or program made her a niche candidate, who was already near her ceiling of support (there being only so many white professionals in blue America) and would thus fade away.

or

2) College-educated whites were more likely than other Democrats to be paying close attention to the primary race. Thus, Warren’s poor showing with nonwhite, and non-college-educated voters merely reflected the fact that her name was not as widely recognized as Joe Biden’s or Bernie Sanders’s. And if this were the case, then her strong support among college-educated whites might actually be a leading indicator of her appeal to the broader Democratic coalition: Once other groups began tuning in to this year’s race, they too would see the same things that had made “Patagonia Democrats” swoon.

While there may be an element of truth to No. 1 (Warren does appear to be especially appealing to Democrats who share her skin tone and academic pedigree), recent polling data has made the second look increasingly plausible. Quinnipiac’s new national poll show’s Warren’s coalition diversifying in both racial and class terms. In fact, the Q-poll has Warren beating Biden among white voters without a college degree by a remarkable 37 to 20 percent margin.

Quinnipiac poll on whether you would be “excited” if one of the 2020 Dems became the nominee:



Black voters: Biden 70%, Warren 68%, Sanders 63%



White Democrats w/o college degree: Warren 69%, Biden 54%, Sanders 52% — Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) September 25, 2019

New Quinnipiac poll this morning shows Warren making inroads among black voters:



July:

Biden 53%

Warren 4%



August:

Biden 47%

Warren 8%



Now:

Biden 40%

Warren 19% — Ryan Struyk (@ryanstruyk) September 25, 2019

The Los Angeles Times poll of California tells a similar story. After performing poorly with non-college whites in the same poll back in June, Warren now claims 29 percent of the demographic’s vote, while Sanders and Biden respectively boast 20 and 18 percent. And although Biden still leads the field with 40 percent support among African-American voters, Warren now has 24 percent support among that key demographic in California, putting her in second with that constituency.

But there’s even more direct evidence that Warren’s real base isn’t college-educated white voters, so much as it is voters who are paying attention: In the progressive think-tank Data For Progress’s polling of the 2020 primary, Warren consistently performs best among voters express a high level of interest in the news — including non-college-educated and non-white news junkies.

3) Harris 2020 (almost certainly) isn’t happening.

For a brief period in early July, Kamala Harris led both Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren in national polls. The California senator also boasted considerable support among professional Democrats and liberal donors. Many observers expected her to emerge as Biden’s main rival. But she’s proven to be the 2020 version of Scott Walker — a candidate with strong Establishment support who makes a lot of sense on paper, but never made much headway with actual voters. Quinnipiac now pegs Harris’s support at a mere 3 percent; her average in national polls is 5 percent. Critically, her numbers in Iowa and New Hampshire are almost identical to her national figures. Unless she orchestrates an improbable comeback in one of those early states, Harris could be forced to euthanize her campaign by early March, leaving Warren the only viable option for Democrats who wish to elect a female president.

4) Warren is acceptable to a broader range of Democratic voters than any of her rivals.

Both the Quinnipiac national poll, and Los Angeles Times California survey, show Warren with a higher favorability rating among Democratic voters than Biden or Sanders. And the Times finds that nearly 70 percent of California Democrats rank Warren as their first or second choice. Those results are consistent with a Data For Progress/Civiqs national poll released earlier this month, which showed Warren as the most popular second choice among Biden, Sanders, Buttigieg, and Harris voters. And several other surveys have produced similar findings. This obviously bodes well for Warren if and when the Democratic field narrows, and suggests that a contested convention, she may have a strong claim to being a “unity” figure.

5) Sanders is stagnating.

Bernie Sanders’s campaign is very much alive. The Vermont senator’s has amassed enviable donor and volunteer networks, and has led in multiple recent polls of early primary states. Still, Sanders’s support has been stagnant nationally for months now, while his average share of the vote in Iowa has fallen from 19 percent in July to 12 percent today. Given that the senator is already well-known among Democratic primary voters, it is not clear how much room he has to grow. Sanders has made no secret of the fact that he favors Warren over his other primary rivals. So, it is at least possible to imagine a scenario in which Sanders’s campaign runs out of steam by next April, and then throws its considerable resources behind Warren.

Of course, Warren’s nomination remains far from a sure thing. Biden’s numbers are still formidable. Sanders is still within striking distance. And it’s still early. But at this point, there’s a strong case that Warren is the candidate you’d want to be."

A confused reader passed along a tweet with a clip of these remarks. What was Biden talking about?

AD

After all, the Medicare-for-all plan advanced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) calls for eliminating premiums, deductibles and co-pays. Yet Biden suggests the plan would raise deductibles.

AD

Biden’s staff acknowledges that he misspoke, repeatedly, in this passage:

He meant to say the plan would double the federal budget, except for interest on the debt, not that it was twice the federal budget.

He meant to say a tax on employers was like a deductible from your paycheck. (The line he used in the last primary debate was: “It’s going to cost you in your pay — there will be a deductible in your paycheck”).

He meant to say the employer tax was 7.5 percent, not “5 percent and 4 percent.”

We understand politicians can misspeak — though Biden seems to do it more often than most — so we won’t be awarding Pinocchios. But the point he was trying to make gets to the heart of the debate about the cost of a single-payer health plan. So it’s worth exploring this issue and explaining it to readers, especially because more than 100,000 people watched the video embedded in the tweet.

AD

The Facts

Sanders, as Biden noted, has said his plan will raise taxes, but argues that the cost of health care will be lower overall. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), rising fast in the polls, has embraced Sanders’s plan but studiously avoids answering any questions about a possible tax increase. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) used to support the Sanders plan but then crafted her own version, in part because of what she called “a middle-class tax hike” embedded in the plan. Her plan would phase in much more slowly and still retain a role for private insurance.

AD

Biden has rejected a single-payer approach and advocated building on the Affordable Care Act, the law expanding health-care access passed during the Obama administration.

AD

Actually, no one really knows what would happen. You have to take any of the numbers offered by advocates and detractors with a huge grain of salt. As we have documented before, the cost of any health-care proposal will be affected by a variety of factors, including provider payments, health-care benefits, cost-sharing and administrative savings from a consolidated system. Any complex bill overhauling health care faces daunting prospects in a closely divided Congress.

But for the sake of argument, let’s look at the numbers Biden and Sanders are using.

Sanders has offered a menu of possible options to finance the cost of Medicare-for-all. One option would require a 7.5 percent payroll tax that employers would pay to help fund the program. Another would be a 4 percent income-based premium paid by households. (That’s what Harris labeled a middle-class tax hike.)

AD

AD

But Sanders argues that those taxes would be cheaper than the current system.

Sanders offers as an example a prototypical family of four earning $50,000. He says the employer is currently paying $12,865 a year in health-care premiums for this family, while the family pays $5,277 in premiums. Virtually every economist will tell you that payroll taxes or health-insurance premiums paid by an employer largely comes out of the pay earned by the employee.

For instance, both employers and employees pay 6.2 percent to Social Security (on the first $132,900 of wages) and 1.45 percent to Medicare. The employer obviously counts that 7.65 percent ($3,825 for a $50,000 wage) as part of the cost of employing that person, as well as the nearly $13,000 in health insurance premiums. To the employer, the cost of that employee is not $50,000, but almost $67,000. (There are tax deductions for employer-provided health insurance, but we will ignore them as part of this illustration.)

AD

AD

But note that almost $13,000 in insurance premiums is 26 percent of $50,000. Sanders’s 7.5 percent tax would be $3,750, so that suggests more than $9,000 in savings for the employer. Under Medicare-for-all, the total cost of the employee to the employer would be a little over $57,000, a reduction of more than $9,000.

As for the 4 percent income premium paid by the employee, that amounts to $844 a year, once the standard deduction is taken into account, Sanders says. That’s far less than the nearly $5,300 in premiums currently paid by this family.

Biden, by contrast, only focuses on the cost of tax increase (apparently because polling has found that it’s a way to undercut support for Medicare-for-all). In the debate, Biden argued that a three-person family earning $60,000 a year will face more than $5,000 in taxes — the 4 percent premium tax ($1,240 after the standard deduction) and the 7.5 percent tax paid by employers ($4,500), on the widely accepted economic theory that payroll taxes paid by employers are passed onto employees.

AD

AD

Notice that he did not take into account any of the savings that Sanders claims his plan will generate both for the employee and employer. So he’s really only telling half the story, misleadingly ignoring a possible reduction in health-care costs for many Americans.

Sanders also chose an example in which the numbers work in his favor. The savings for the employer fade as an employee’s wages increase.

Sanders also focuses on the cost of a family plan, which has much higher premiums. The Milliman Medical Index, a respected accounting of health-care costs, says the employer contribution in 2019 will be $3,773 per person. (Total health-care costs for a family of four on an employer-provided plan are $28,386, Milliman says.) So a single person making $50,000 in theory would barely represent any savings for that employer — a 7.5 percent payroll tax on $50,000 is $3,750 — and the tax would quickly be higher than current expenses as wages increase.

AD

AD

Similarly, wealthier Americans would end up paying much more in taxes than they currently pay for health-care premiums. (We take no position on whether that’s good or bad, and certainly Sanders and Warren have been forthright in saying the wealthy would largely finance the plan.)

The uncertain complexity was examined in a 2018 University of Massachusetts at Amherst study that predicted the impact of enacting Medicare-for-all in a variety of employer and employee scenarios. The report does not examine all of the same financing options as Sanders, but it calculated that a three-person family with $60,000 income would gain almost $1,600 (2.6 percent) in additional income under Medicare-for-all, while a family with income of $221,000 (top 20 percent of wages earners), would lose $8,520 (3.9 percent) and a family with $401,000 (top 5 percent) would lose $22,340 (5.6 percent). (To create these scenarios, the report relies on data for 2016 mean incomes for various income ranges.)

Meanwhile, the report said most businesses would see a reduction in costs with even an 8.2 percent payroll tax but that firms of more than 500 employees would experience a 5.7 percent increase in health-care costs.

AD

AD

“Vice President Biden’s priority as president will be to make sure every single American has access to affordable, quality health insurance in the quickest, most cost-effective way possible,” Biden spokesman Michael Gwin said. “That’s why his plan is to build on and improve the Affordable Care Act by creating a public option, allowing people to choose between this new option and their private plan, and taking other steps to lower health-care costs. Biden has also made clear that any health-care plan that raises taxes on the middle class is a nonstarter.”

The Bottom Line

Biden emphasizes the higher taxes that Medicare-for-all would impose while ignoring the fact that for many middle-class Americans (if you accept Sanders’s math) the change may result in higher incomes and lower health-care costs. It’s a classic political gambit to focus on only half the equation, and we will keep an eye on how Biden frames this in the future to see if he merits Pinocchios.

AD

Biden may have bungled his lines at the town hall, but he still has not developed an effective or sophisticated counterargument to Sanders’s prediction of lower overall costs. You can understand why Warren has generally refused to even acknowledge that there are higher taxes embedded in Medicare-for-all. She stays focused instead on an overall reduction in costs, clearly not wanting to engage in a debate on Biden’s playing field.

In the remarkable events of the last few days that have suddenly brought House Democrats together in determination to impeach the president, a name keeps coming up nearly as often as that of Trump. It’s “Biden,” as in presidential candidate Joe and his globetrotting son, Hunter.

Yes, the case for impeaching the 45th president is broad and deep. But for the moment, impeachment fever and the MAGA counter-fever it will inspire are dwelling on the story of Trump’s efforts to sink Biden by securing an investigation of Hunter by a foreign government. Trump failed to get the Ukrainian government to lower the boom on Hunter Biden. But his ultimate objective, ironically, could be nearly as well served by controversy over his likely illegal actions, which will keep the “Biden corruption” story in the news. It’s kind of a like a hurricane stalled on the coast, pounding unlucky residents who are suddenly the primary object of nature’s wrath.

No one, so far, has made a credible case that Joe Biden did anything directly to help his son in his career as a lawyer-lobbyist, a procurer of appropriations earmarks, and an international man of mystery — much less anything inappropriate. But clearly, Hunter benefited from his last name, and aside from questions about his business dealings in Ukraine and China, his personal problems will be catnip for hostile and even friendly media alike. Hunter Biden’s history of substance abuse, the allegations made against him by his ex-wife during an ugly divorce, and his relationship with the widow of his brother, Beau, have all been out there in the public record. But they will get fresh exposure so long as he is a figure, however peripheral, in the impeachment case against the man his father is trying to defeat. Obviously enough, Team Trump wants it to stay that way, which is precisely why Trump and his goon, Rudy Giuliani, were trying to drop a dime on Hunter Biden and smear Joe in the bargain.

Should Team Biden be worried about this problem, absent any real evidence of wrongdoing? It’s hard to say. His presidential candidacy has overcome more immediate blows, mostly concerning his friendliness toward bigots, his long Senate record with its questionable policy positions, and his tendency now and then to sound like an old man who has lost a few steps. His perceived “electability” is a powerful asset. And it won’t be that easy over time for Trump fans to hammer away at Biden for his son’s alleged missteps given the president’s own sketchy relationship with sketchy family members (not that fear of looking hypocritical is a major inhibition for most of them).

The main reason Hurricane Hunter could be a problem for Biden is the timing. The 2020 Democratic nomination contest is at a delicate point, with Biden very slowly but steadily losing ground as Elizabeth Warren’s candidacy takes off like a rocket. As recently as August 7, Biden had a 15-point national lead over then-second-place Bernie Sanders in the RealClearPolitics polling averages. Now he has a lead half that size over Warren. More alarmingly, Warren now leads Biden in the polling averages for Iowa, and has nearly caught him in New Hampshire (where the most recent high-quality poll, from Monmouth, gave Warren an actual lead). If Biden loses in both these initial states, history says his candidacy should fail (Bill Clinton didn’t win in Iowa or New Hampshire either in 1992, but that’s partially because he did not contest the former state, locked down by favorite son Tom Harkin). There’s even trouble down the road in California (which is voting just a few days after South Carolina), where a new Berkeley IGS poll shows Warren leading Biden by nine points.

In this period when voting intentions are beginning to form, it’s not a good thing for Joe Biden that his last name is hourly in the news in connection with a corruption claim associated with the biggest story in politics: impeachment. Perhaps Democratic voters will actually gain sympathy for the former veep as the victim of a notorious Trump smear. But voters obsessed with electability could see this as a preview of Trump’s signature ability to drag his opponents right down into the moral morass that is his natural habitat.

DECORAH, Iowa — The crowd that came to see Bernie Sanders was too big for Luther College's gym. It spilled over into a yard, where the senator delivered a short version of his stump speech — “the fate of the planet is at stake, democracy is at stake” — before he walked into a room full of “Bernie Beats Trump” signs.

But not everyone who showed up was sold on that message.

“I'm not necessarily a Bernie fan,” said Justin Knautz, 20, who said he was leaning toward South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigeg. “Even if he could beat Trump, which I'm not sure about, our country's so divided already.”

“I'm super confident that he'd win,” Avery Pazour, 20, said of Sanders. “Young people are tired of the system the way that it is.”

“I'm exactly the opposite,” said Marin Gabor, 21. “I like Pete Buttigieg's public-health option. I guess that's a weird thing for a young person to say?""

Five months after Sanders began arguing that he was the most electable Democratic candidate, a pitch he made with a tour of Rust Belt states, he has made little progress with voters terrified of a second Trump term. National and state polling has found Sanders persistently behind former vice president Joe Biden when voters are asked who has the best chance of defeating the president. In the past month, polling has found Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) roughly tied with Sanders on “electability.”

The “Bernie beats Trump” tour was the latest attempt to push back. That meant showing what a general election would look like, with the candidate leading raw, emotional town hall meetings where voters explained how the economic system failed them. It meant emphasizing that polling had shown him ahead of Trump in 2016 — an argument he briefly made to “superdelegates.” It meant reminding people that he had won the primaries in Wisconsin and Michigan, where some Democrats slept on the 2016 general election.

In Iowa, Sanders occasionally referred to the national and state polls that have shown him ahead of Trump, but in an interview, he waved off the polling that had shown Democratic voters still nervous about how a democratic socialist could take the presidency.

“I'm not much into all these speculations and all these polls,” Sanders said. “One day a poll has me doing great, the next day a poll has me doing terrible. It has a lot to do with who you're polling and what questions you're asking. But at the end of the day, I think we're going to win, because we have an extraordinary grass-roots movement.”

Apart from some turnover in its early state staff, the Sanders campaign has shown some broad support. It celebrated its 1 millionth individual donor last week; shortly after that, it drew an estimated 4,000 voters to a rally in Norman, Okla. (A 2016 rally in Tulsa, three times the size of Norman, had attracted a crowd of 11,000.)

But it has struggled to convince early-state voters that Sanders could win a general election, and the senator's support in early states has slipped since the start of his campaign. In interviews around the state, some at the senator from Vermont's rallies, voters sometimes praised Sanders or explained why they used to support him before laying out the reasons that they were supporting someone else.

“I love him. We caucused for him in 2016,” said Scott German, 50, who spent Monday evening at a rally for Buttigieg in Dubuque. “If he could win and put forward everything he's talking about, it'd be utopia. But I don't think America's ready for it. We need somebody more realistic.”

Sanders's campaign is combating the skepticism with a busy schedule and with sharp contrasts, some of them brighter than others. When Sanders announced his 1 millionth donor, campaign manager Faiz Shakir described him as “the only candidate who is able to say his campaign will rely only on grass-roots funding in both the primary and against Donald Trump” — a knock at Warren, who has said her no-fundraisers pledge applies to only the primary and who is headlining some fundraisers for the DNC.

Speech by speech, Sanders has structured an electability pitch around his brand — that of an Old Testament prophet who has been saying the same things about health care and economic fairness for 30 years. At four rallies on Monday, he emphasized that taxes would go up to pay for Medicare-for-all, encouraging the crowd to think about how the media would frame that.

“Bernie Sanders wants to raise your taxes! How terrible is this guy?” Sanders said sarcastically in Decorah, waving his arms and imitating a negative ad. The upshot: He was ready to handle the criticism, some candidates were not, and therefore, he could win.

That theory is getting a real-time test in Iowa, one that has not gone well for Sanders. His campaign believes that the Partnership for America's Health Care Future, a front group for insurance companies, has done damage to his support among Democrats by running digital and TV ads attacking Medicare-for-all. (Sanders has not yet purchased TV time in early states.) The senator's favorable numbers have decreased since the spring, robbing supporters of something that was true for years: that he was the most popular politician in America.

“There's a lot of lies going on about this,” Sanders said in Dubuque. “There's the health-care industry that's already advertising in here in Iowa. Every time you see that ad, know who paid for that ad! It was paid for by the drug companies and the insurance companies who made a hundred billion in profits last year. They love the current system! They're scared to death that we have the momentum to move to Medicare-for-all.”

The insurance industry ads make good foils, but Sanders is just as happy to criticize Biden. After learning that a pollster at Anzalone Liszt Grove Research had been testing messages against Medicare-for-all — John Anzalone is an adviser to Biden — Sanders emphasized that he was collecting story after story of medical debt, denied coverage and personal pain. Even after his events ended, he was being buttonholed by people with insurance horror stories. At every event, Sanders sees a story that is not being told in the corporate media. As the nominee, with that media bound to cover him, he could cut through the fog, he believes.

“If Joe Biden or anybody else wants to use the Republican Party and the health-care industry talking points, I guess they can. But we're going to win this fight because we're going to refute that disingenuous attack,” Sanders said. “You know, I think when I raised the issue during the last debate, that we spend twice as much, Biden's response was, 'This is America.' Well, I don't know that Americans have to be chumps and to give the health-care industry $100 billion a year.”

Polling has found Democrats to be nervous about that argument, even if they agree with Sanders on the merits. In the Des Moines Register's weekend poll, a quarter of Democrats said they supported the concept of Medicare-for-all but were worried it was a general election loser — a threat to the entire Sanders premise.

At a Democratic meeting in Story County on Sunday, Linda Trudeau, 72, said that had never been convinced that Sanders could win. Warren had piqued her interest, she said, because she seemed liberal, but less stubborn.

“She's got to give up Medicare-for-all or she won't get elected,” said Trudeau. “She's not quite nailed down on that, unlike Bernie. That's a good thing.”

ON THE TRAIL

Pete Buttigieg speaks at a campaign event in Clinton, Iowa, on Tuesday. (Elijah Nouvelage/Reuters)

DUBUQUE, Iowa — First, there are the introductions from local Democrats. Then there’s the theme song — “High Hopes” by Panic! at the Disco, with a brass hook that tests the integrity of speakers and eardrums. Then the bus — a bus previously hired by everyone from Barack Obama to the producers of “Madam Secretary” — rolls into view. Only then does Pete Buttigieg race onto stage.

“Thanks for making me feel right at home!” Buttigieg told the crowd, 800 voters at an amphitheater on the banks of the Mississippi River. “You know, Dubuque has a great reputation among mayors — an example of a city leading the way, when Washington can’t get its act together.”

Buttigieg, one of the few Democrats whose favorability has increased over the primary campaign, is busy reintroducing himself as the candidate who can talk about anything — no gaffes, no dodges. On the bus, Buttigieg took questions on everything from college football (“problematic”) to how many white button-down shirts he owned (“a baker’s dozen”) to the violent abolitionist John Brown (“kind of a brutal guy”). When his Dubuque speech was over, Buttigieg worked the rope line for a half-hour, then walked over to the few reporters not on the bus to take more questions.

It wasn't an entirely new strategy. Buttigieg's early jump in the polls came after he did interview after interview, saying yes to TV shows and small outlets that were used to getting turned down. Most voters would not hear everything he said, but they could see that he was taking any questions.

The bus tour, and the entire media strategy, was also designed to show a contrast. The voters seen as most gettable for Buttigieg are moderates who have been disappointed by Joe Biden; the former vice president holds frequent media availabilities but has made a series of confusing statements, all of them amplified by social media.

Buttigieg's accessibility also contrasts with the candidates who've commanded the most attention so far, and for different reasons. Elizabeth Warren's short press gaggles are designed to make minimal news, and in the past week, she swerved back to a stock answer when asked whether her Medicare plans would raise “middle-class taxes” — something Buttigieg pounced on.

“Sen. Warren is known for being straightforward and was extremely evasive when asked that question,” Buttigieg had told CNN before the start of the tour. “And we've seen that repeatedly.”

Buttigieg's approach also clashed with Kamala Harris, whose uneasy answers to some policy questions sapped her momentum, and with Bernie Sanders, who often urges reporters to steer back to his preferred topic instead of badgering him about the horse race or the latest Trump news. With that group of competitors, and with a support base that gushes about his ability to communicate, Buttigieg's advantage was clear: He could go on the record about anything. The comparison with other candidates would become obvious.

“I will explain how we will pay for every promise that I make,” Buttigieg said in Dubuque. “It's why I'm a little careful about the promises I do make.”

On the stump, Buttigieg did not mention rival candidates by name. “I think I've named my disagreements with their plans at various times,” he explained afterward. Other candidates, such as Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, have also described their plans as realistic, or truth-telling — candidates who promise more than could probably pass, or plans that aren't fully paid for, get described as less straightforward. Asked whether he would rule out any middle-class tax increases, Buttigieg emphasized that nothing he was for had required them.

“Everything that we've rolled out to date can be achieved without a middle-class tax increase, and we're going to make sure that it's clear how the revenue side will work,” he said. “It does mean tax increases for the top 2 percent. It will mean a wealth tax or something like it. It can certainly mean closing corporate tax loopholes.”

How far would the transparency go? Several campaigns lagging behind Buttigieg have criticized him for holding so many fundraisers. Unlike Biden, who has faced the same criticism, Buttigieg has not let the media in to cover those fundraisers.

“We're open to thinking about it,” he said. “I think right now we're focused on what we can achieve on the bus tour, because it's just a different conversation than any other format that we have. But the team will always evaluate strategy and other ideas.”

POLL WATCH

New Hampshire Democratic primary (Monmouth, 401 likely Democratic voters)

Elizabeth Warren — 27% ( 19)

Joe Biden — 25% (-9)

Bernie Sanders — 12% (-6)

Pete Buttigieg — 10% ( 1)

Kamala Harris — 3% (-3)

Cory Booker — 2% (-)

Tulsi Gabbard — 2% ( 2)

Amy Klobuchar — 2% (-)

Tom Steyer — 2% ( 2)

Andrew Yang — 2% ( 1)

Beto O’Rourke — 1% (-1)

Marianne Williamson — 1% ( 1)

Polling in the first primary state has found (with different methodology) everything from a sizable lead for Bernie Sanders to resilient support for Joe Biden. This is the first major poll to find Elizabeth Warren positioned in the lead, albeit within the margin of error; more important is her favorable rating, which has risen since May from a net 39 points to a net 55 points, higher than any other candidate. Warren's strength extends even to voters who disagree with her on health care; she wins 40 percent of Democrats who, like she, support single-payer, but wins 25 percent among Democrats who support a ""public option"" instead. Warren's positioning might be helping her; she has endorsed a bevy of liberal health-care bills and is not as strongly associated as Sanders with Medicare-for-all.

Nevada Democratic caucus (Suffolk, 500 likely voters)

Joe Biden — 23%

Elizabeth Warren — 19%

Bernie Sanders — 14%

Kamala Harris — 4%

Pete Buttigieg — 3%

Cory Booker — 3%

Tom Steyer — 3%

Andrew Yang — 3%

Tulsi Gabbard — 1%

Michael Bennet — 1%

Beto O’Rourke — 1%

Julián Castro — 1%

The least-visited early state — even Democrats sometimes forget that it caucuses before South Carolina votes — has no obvious favorite. A tiny plurality of voters said that Elizabeth Warren did worse than they expected in the September debate; a tiny plurality said that Joe Biden did worse than they expected.

DEBATE SEASON

The fifth DNC debates, which will be held sometime in November, will introduce new, strict thresholds for entry in the latest effort to limit the party's biggest nights to candidates with widespread support. The short version: Candidates will need 165,000 individual donations (up from 130,000) to get space onstage, and polling at 2 percent won't cut it anymore.

In the new rules, candidates can reach the polling threshold in two ways: by hitting 3 percent in four polls (or more) recognized by the DNC or by hitting 5 percent in two (or more) polls taken in the first four primary states: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. The count started Sept. 13; it'll stop seven days before the date of the fifth debate, which has not yet been announced.

The DNC is transparent about which polls it counts. They are: the Associated Press; ABC News-Washington Post; CBS News-YouGov; CNN; Des Moines Register; Fox News; Monmouth University; NPR; NBC News-Wall Street Journal; NBC News-Marist; New York Times; Quinnipiac University; University of New Hampshire; USA Today-Suffolk University; and Winthrop University, which polls in South Carolina.

At the moment, using these standards, just five candidates have qualified for the November debate: Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris. Just four other candidates have claimed to reach that new donor threshold: Tom Steyer, Tulsi Gabbard, Beto O'Rourke and Andrew Yang.

2020

Joe Biden. He gave a prepared statement in Wilmington, Del., addressing the Ukraine saga more fully by saying no allegation about his son Hunter had merit and that the president was setting himself on a course to impeachment: “a tragedy of his own making.”

Tulsi Gabbard. She qualified for the fourth Democratic debate, after notching her fourth poll at 2 percent support — the Monmouth poll from New Hampshire. That significantly ups the chances of CNN, the debate's TV host, splitting the debate into two nights, each with six candidates.

Bernie Sanders. He introduced a new version of a “wealth tax,” a concept that he had introduced five years ago but that Elizabeth Warren had formulated for this presidential campaign. Unlike Warren's 2 percent tax (which has been strong when polled), Sanders's would tackle wealth in tiers: a 1 percent tax on net worth above $32 million, a 2 percent tax on net worth between $50 million and $250 million, a 3 percent tax on net worth between $250 million and $500 million, a 4 percent tax on net worth between $500 million and $1 billion, a 5 percent tax on net worth between $1 billion and $2.5 billion, a 6 percent tax on net worth between $2.5 billion $5 billion, a 7 percent tax on net worth between $5 billion and $10 billion, and an 8 percent tax on net worth above $10 billion.

Elizabeth Warren. She'll return to New Hampshire on Wednesday and Friday, her first visits to the state since shifts in polling found her in contention to win the primary. In a Q&A with the Council on Foreign Relations, she laid out her policies on issues not much discussed at campaign events, such as the fate of Venezuela's embattled president.

DEMS IN DISARRAY

Pick your metaphor — the dam is breaking, or maybe the floodgates, or maybe the Rubicon is being crossed — but House Democrats have begun moving faster toward some form of impeachment, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry. The president's apparent effort to obtain damaging information on Joe Biden's son in a call with Ukraine's president has pushed dozens of “front-line” Democrats into the fray; in the past 48 hours, more Democrats who represent districts won by President Trump have endorsed impeachment than had endorsed it in the past nine months.

Republicans claim to be overjoyed. “They’re obsessed with impeaching President Trump and they don’t care if they have to throw away the House Majority to do it,” wrote Calvin Moore, a spokesman for the House GOP's super PAC, after a group of Trump-seat Democrats came out for impeachment proceedings.

Thirty-one House Democrats represent districts won by the president in 2016, but they're not all created equal.

Blue-trending districts. Ten House Democrats won 2018 races in areas where Donald Trump ran behind Mitt Romney, from the Detroit suburbs won by Rep. Haley Stevens of Michigan to the Chicago exurbs won by Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois. And some of these districts voted for the statewide Democratic tickets last year, suggesting that the Trump brand has continued to hurt local Republicans.

Trump-trending districts. Twenty-one Democrats represent districts that either edged a toward the president in 2016, some by a little (Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia's district went from a 2.3-point Mitt Romney win to 3.4-point Trump win), some by a lot (Rep. Collin Peterson of Minnesota's massive district backed Mitt Romney by 9.8 points, then Trump by 30.8 points). Twelve of them come from places that flipped from backing Barack Obama in 2012 to backing Trump four years later.

Democrats with/without real opponents. The filing deadline for 2020 races is months away; only Illinois and Texas require House candidates to file by the end of this year. But not every Democrat who flipped a House seat last year is facing a real challenge yet. Rep. Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania is facing a first-time challenger who has raised less than $20,000; Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan hasn't drawn a Republican opponent. On the other side of the equation are Democrats such as Rep. Lizzie Fletcher of Texas, whose chief opponent, Wesley Hunt, raised more than $500,000 in just a few months as a candidate; after Fletcher joined the impeachment call, Hunt accused her of endorsing a ""blatantly partisan impeachment investigation.”

The relatively high threshold has helped Warren fend off critiques that large farms could be exposed to the tax.

AD

AD

Sanders would hit more people with the tax and would also significantly increase how much it would take from the very wealthiest, following a pattern in which he has sought to stake out the leftward boundary of the Democratic Party when it comes to policy proposals.

Sanders’s plan introduces a new 1 percent wealth tax on those earning over $32 million and then increases that rate in steps until it reaches 8 percent for those with more than $10 billion.

The announcement Tuesday highlighted the country’s striking divide over economic policy. Two of the three top-polling candidates for the Democratic nomination are now advocating a sweeping change in the way wealth is allocated in the United States, embracing policies that have not been so prominently discussed since the 1960s.

AD

Under President Trump, meanwhile, the Republicans have passed a far-reaching tax cut plan that economists say will dramatically expand the deficit. This comes less than a decade after the tea party angrily seized the nation’s attention, and a measure of power within the GOP, with a low-spending, anti-deficit message.

AD

On Tuesday, Sanders concluded a two-day swing through Iowa counties that Barack Obama won and then went for Trump. He’s dubbed the trip his “Bernie Beats Trump” tour, presenting himself as the most electable Democratic candidate against the president.

But Sanders has struggled to recapture the magic of his near-win in this first caucus state in 2016. A recent Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll showed Warren leading with 22 percent. Former vice president Joe Biden was at 20 percent, and Sanders was running third at 11 percent.

AD

Sanders and Warren have been battling for supremacy in the Democratic Party’s liberal wing, issuing dueling proposals on a number of topics that would reshape the nation’s safety net and significantly expand the role of government.

Their proposals include making public colleges and universities tuition-free, wiping away much or all of the student loan debt in the country, and enacting a Medicare-for-all health-care system.

AD

The plans are estimated to cost tens of trillions of dollars, raising questions about how they would be paid for. Warren for months has pointed to her wealth tax, and Sanders’s new proposal gives him a similar revenue source to cite.

AD

Sanders aides noted that the senator has spoken of a wealth tax for decades, including proposing it as a possible funding source for his Medicare-for-all plan. In 1997, Sanders wrote that it was “time, high time, to establish a tax on wealth similar to those that exist in most European countries.”

However, there is no guarantee that Warren or Sanders, if elected, could push such a far-reaching new tax through Congress.

When it comes to wealth taxes, the impact on the nation’s biggest fortunes would be profound. Bill Gates, estimated to have $107 billion in wealth, would under Sanders’s plan pay at least an additional $8 billion annually to the federal government. Sanders’s campaign says the wealth of billionaires overall would be halved under his proposal.

AD

AD

The plan to tax the wealthy could pay for some of Sanders’s plans but fall short of covering other parts of his agenda. Economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman at the University of California at Berkeley estimate Sanders’s plan would raise $4.35 trillion over 10 years, although conservatives have said such estimates overstate how much can be raised through a wealth tax.

Sanders has unveiled a $2.5 trillion plan to end homelessness and create 10 million new housing units and a $1.7 trillion plan to cancel all student debt in the United States; those two initiatives alone would come close to equaling the money raised by the wealth tax. The campaign said the tax would be used to fund the housing plan, pay for universal child care and help finance Medicare-for-all.

The senator has proposed a $30 trillion Medicare-for-all health-care system that would eliminate families’ health-care spending, which Sanders has said would be paid for with higher middle-class taxes, as well as ­taxes on the wealthy.

AD

AD

The biggest difference with Warren’s plan is that Sanders’s would more directly target the fortunes of billionaires and multi­billionaires.

Zucman noted on Twitter that Sanders’s plan “would make it much harder to remain a multibillionaire durably.” But he said that if Sanders’s tax had been enacted in the 1980s, billionaires’ share of the national wealth would still have increased.

That means Sanders’s plan would stop short of a “maximum income” plan favored by some on the left, although Sanders has come out in favor of that as a long-term goal, telling the New York Times, “I don’t think that billionaires should exist.”

That position follows months of debates in left-leaning circles over whether Democrats should push taxes high enough to eliminate all billion-dollar fortunes, an idea championed, for example, by an aide to first-term Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).

Her idea was ambitious and controversial, but Sanders’s idea goes much, much farther.

Warren’s plan is relatively straightforward: Tax all assets above $50 million at 2 percent per year and all assets above $1 billion at 3 percent per year. Sanders’s plan not only kicks in earlier, it includes more gradations that tax the mega-rich much more heavily. Here’s how it would work:

1 percent tax on wealth over $32 million

2 percent tax on wealth from $50 million to $250 million

3 percent tax on wealth from $250 million to $500 million

4 percent tax on wealth from $500 million to $1 billion

5 percent tax on wealth from $1 billion to $2.5 billion

6 percent tax on wealth from $2.5 billion to $5 billion

7 percent tax on wealth from $5 billion to $10 billion

8 percent tax on wealth above $10 billion

If you’re one of the 600 or so billionaires in the country, this tax would hit you much harder than Warren’s would; on that 11th billion, you’d have to pay $30 million under Warren’s plan but $80 million under Sanders’s plan. According to economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, Sanders’s tax would raise $4.35 trillion over 10 years, significantly more than Warren’s version.

For Sanders, the goal isn’t just to get the overclass to pay their fair share; he wants to cut them down to size. “Under this plan, the wealth of billionaires would be cut in half over 15 years,” the plan says, “which would substantially break up the concentration of wealth and power of this small privileged class.”

While the right might despise wealth taxes for ideological reasons, some liberals dislike them for practical reasons. In Europe, a dozen countries had wealth taxes a few decades ago, but now that number has been reduced to three: Norway, Spain and Switzerland. Countries decided that the rich found it too easy to avoid the tax, in many cases just moving out of the country, and they wound up raising less revenue than the governments had hoped.

Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a liberal economist and a wealth tax skeptic, predicted to me that if a tax of this sort was in the offing, you’d see billionaires renounce their citizenship before it took effect or find other creative ways to avoid the tax.

“If Warren and Sanders really want to crack down on inequality, they should address the market structures that generate inequality, such as patent and copyright monopolies, a bloated financial industry and a corrupt corporate governance structure,” Baker said. “Both have good proposals on these issues, but a wealth tax is likely to be economically wasteful and a political embarrassment.”

Other economists disagree, however. Jared Bernstein of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities offered me this qualified endorsement:

Given the extent of wealth concentration and the tax sheltering that protects it, it’s clear to me and most other progressives that the time has come to make a serious run at taxing wealth. I like the simplicity of Warren’s approach relative to Bernie’s, but given that any such tax is and will be a tremendous political reach from where we stand today, the important thing is to get these ideas bouncing around the echo chamber.

Both Sanders and Warren answer the criticism about the super-rich avoiding the tax by saying they’ll make sure the tax is free of loopholes and beef up the IRS budget for enforcement.

In fact, revitalizing the IRS should be a priority for any Democrat, whether they pass a wealth tax or not, since Republicans have spent decades eviscerating the agency, with the result that it’s incapable of forcing the ultrawealthy to pay what they owe right now.

On the politics: Getting either plan through Congress would be a long shot at best, but if nothing else, this discussion can expand the debate around taxes. Sanders would probably argue that fundamental change starts with getting people to consider ideas that some find radical.

At a time of grotesque inequality, wouldn’t it be good for Democrats to debate how much we should be making plutocrats contribute? Republicans will inevitably argue that billionaires should not have to be burdened by contributing to the country that enabled them to accumulate their vast holdings in the first place, a stance that won’t do them any favors with the voting public.

As enthusiastically as some Fox personalities will make that case (they’re already doing it), I say it’s the last thing President Trump would like to talk about. That’s especially true if Sanders or Warren becomes the nominee, since they’d run campaigns centered on the idea that wealthy people have rigged the system in their favor. Trump’s faux-populism only works if there isn’t a more genuine kind voters can compare and contrast.

But this proposal is one more signal from Sanders that he’s going to go farther in what he proposes than any other Democrat. It might not help him win the nomination, but it will certainly enable him to keep influencing the policy debate.

The dam is bursting, the floodgates are opening, the horse is out of the barn. Choose whichever metaphor you want — the point is that news of President Trump allegedly pressuring Ukraine’s president to investigate Joe Biden has supercharged Democratic support for impeachment proceedings — to the point that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is set to announce a formal impeachment inquiry on Tuesday afternoon.

What stands out about the latest crop of converts to the cause is how many are from swing congressional districts — the kinds of places where bringing charges against the president may be a far riskier political gamble than in safe Democratic areas, given that impeachment has consistently lacked majority support in national polls. The lack of enthusiasm from representatives in these districts is one reason House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been so unenthusiastic about triggering the procedure over Donald Trump’s alleged obstruction in the Russia investigation.

But the Ukraine story seems to be different. Here’s a running list of lawmakers joining the impeachment push.

House Democrats Newly in Favor of Impeachment

At least 20 House Democrats have expressed support for impeachment for the first time in just the past two days, bringing the total number of representatives on board to 174 Democrats out of 235, according to Politico’s running counter.

On Monday, Congresswoman Angie Craig, who represents a Minnesota district Trump carried by a point, said she is onboard with impeachment.

Later that night, seven freshman Democrats wrote a Washington Post op-ed in which they deemed Trump’s actions a possible threat to national security. Four of them — Virginia’s Abigail Spanberger and Elaine Luria, Michigan’s Elissa Slotkin, and New Jersey’s Mikie Sherrill — represent districts Trump carried in 2016.

Here's how Trump did in the Impeachment 7 op-ed writers' districts in 2016:



Spanberger VA-7 Trump +7

Slotkin MI-8 Trump +7

Luria VA-2 Trump +4

Sherrill NJ-11 Trump +1

Cisneros CA-39 Clinton +9

Crow CO-6 Clinton +9

Houlahan PA-6 Clinton +10



AVG: Clinton +1 — Domenico Montanaro (@DomenicoNPR) September 24, 2019

On Tuesday morning, New York’s Antonio Delgado joined the impeachment bandwagon. Delgado defeated incumbent Republican John Faso in an upstate district that voted for Trump by more than six points.

Some lawmakers appeared to be shifting on impeachment, but didn’t endorse it outright — yet. Texas’s Colin Allred said if the Trump administration doesn’t turn over the full report of the whistle-blower who alerted the government to Trump’s alleged misconduct, he would support impeachment. In 2018, Allred defeated a longtime Republican incumbent in a district that had voted for Hillary Clinton by just two points.

Later, Texas representative Lizzie Fletcher announced her support as well. Fletcher’s district narrowly voted for Clinton in 2016 but hadn’t been represented by a Democrat in Congress since 1967.

The facts we have learned recently are matters of utmost importance for our national security, country, and Constitution. The House should act swiftly to investigate and should be prepared to use the remedy exclusively in its power: impeachment.



See my full statement here: pic.twitter.com/xho0DlD107 — Rep. Lizzie Fletcher (@RepFletcher) September 24, 2019

Two representatives from Nevada, Susie Lee and Steven Horsford, followed suit.

Lee’s district narrowly voted for Trump in 2016.

Haley Stevens of Michigan, who won a district that Trump carried by five points, wrote that “if investigations confirm recent reports, these actions represent impeachable offenses that threaten to undermine the integrity of our elections and jeopardize the balance of power within the federal government.”

My statement calling for an impeachment inquiry: https://t.co/RChsYOZS3D pic.twitter.com/9xMbdFG3uh — Rep. Haley Stevens (@RepHaleyStevens) September 24, 2019

Also on Tuesday, civil-rights icon John Lewis announced his support for impeachment from the House floor.

Breaking. Rep. John Lewis just now on the House floor: ""I truly believe the time to begin impeachment proceedings against this president has come. To delay or to do otherwise would betray the foundation of our democracy."" — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) September 24, 2019

Other Democrats who joined the herd include New York’s Joe Morelle and Michigan’s Debbie Dingell, Tennessee’s Jim Cooper, and Florida’s Donna Shalala and Lois Frankel, Pennsylvania’s Susan Wild, and Iowa’s Cindy Axne.

As a rough measure of swing-district support, just five Democrats who represent districts Trump won in 2016 had endorsed impeachment before this week, according to Politico; now that number is up to 13 and is likely to rise.

These lawmakers’ decisions were apparently not triggered by House leadership in any way, making them all the more significant.

As one Dem operative notes, this is the opposite of how Hill votes usually pile up: there is NO whipping from leadership, it’s rank and file members coordinating w one another, swallowing and stepping out there. — Jonathan Martin (@jmartNYT) September 24, 2019

While most of the action was in the House on Tuesday, the Democrats’ second-in-command in the Senate, Dick Durbin, joined in as well.

Today, I am calling for the initiation of a formal impeachment inquiry by the House of Representatives of President Donald Trump. — Senator Dick Durbin (@SenatorDurbin) September 24, 2019

Non-Democrats in Favor of Impeachment

So far, only one non-Democrat in Congress supports impeachment: Michigan representative Justin Amash, who switched his party registration from Republican to Independent earlier this year after declaring that Trump should be investigated. On Tuesday, he reiterated his call to action in an effort to nudge his erstwhile Republican colleagues.

Just do what is right. Stop waiting for others to act first. Take responsibility for yourself and set an example. — Justin Amash (@justinamash) September 24, 2019

There is no sign that any House Republicans will join Amash.

In the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has appeared surprisingly eager to cooperate with Democrats, at least on the narrow matter of getting to the bottom of what the whistleblower actually said.

MCCONNELL has hotlined the resolution calling for the release of the whistleblower report. Schumer asking for unanimous consent for its passsage. — Jake Sherman (@JakeSherman) September 24, 2019

One Republican, Mitt Romney, has expressed serious consternation over Trump’s behavior.

If the President asked or pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out. — Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) September 22, 2019

When asked about impeachment on Tuesday — hours after Trump had mocked him on Twitter — Romney didn’t rule it out.

Romney on impeachment: “it’s early to be having those conversations. There’s so much we don’t know” — Burgess Everett (@burgessev) September 24, 2019

Some other Republicans, like Marco Rubio, have downplayed the allegations against Trump.

Democratic Presidential Candidates in Favor of Impeachment

Of the major presidential candidates, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Beto O’Rourke, Julián Castro, and Tom Steyer have previously called on Congress to impeach Trump. Pete Buttigieg has said Trump “deserves impeachment” but has stopped short of endorsing it. Bernie Sanders had also avoided a full-throated endorsement until Tuesday:

Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the modern history of this country.



Enough is enough.



I hope the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. House will begin the impeachment process. pic.twitter.com/WHth62v5br — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 24, 2019

Joe Biden, who is at the center of the Ukraine scandal, has so far resisted calls to impeach. But on Tuesday, he said that if the Trump administration does not cooperate with Democrats’ demands for full access to the whistle-blower’s complaint, he’s on board.

Joe Biden: If Pres. Trump doesn't give Congress documents on Ukraine, Trump will leave Congress with no choice but to initiate impeachment. That would be a tragedy but a tragedy ""of his own making.”



""We know who Donald Trump is. It is time to let the world know who we are."" — Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) September 24, 2019

Other candidates are reaffirming their belief that Trump should face charges.

The House must impeach. It must start today. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 24, 2019

Enough. It’s time to impeach. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) September 24, 2019

If we allow the president to get away with the crimes he’s committed, then we will set the precedent that some people are above the law. And then, this democracy will be lost to us forever.



It’s time for Speaker Pelosi and the House to do their job. — Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) September 24, 2019

We knew nearly 2 years ago that Donald Trump had passed the threshold for impeachment. Over 8 million Americans showed up and signed our petition. It is my sincere hope that today is the day the House Democrats stand up for democracy and move to impeach this lawless president. — Tom Steyer (@TomSteyer) September 24, 2019"

Medical-related debt is the top reason Americans file for bankruptcy. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wants to erase much of that debt in his latest ambitious plan to reshape the country’s health-care system.

But the way he’s proposing to do so may be logistically unworkable — and wouldn’t necessarily benefit the people who need help the most, experts say.

Over the weekend, Sanders pledged that as president he would wipe out $81 billion in past-due medical bills reported to credit agencies such as Equifax. He’s also proposing to replace private credit agencies with a government-run one that ensures medical debt never hurts people’s credit scores.

“The very concept of medical debt should not exist,” Sanders said in a statement. “In the wealthiest country in the history of the world, one illness or disease should not ruin a family’s financial life and future.”

Medical debt does not exist in other major countries. When I am president it won't exist in the U.S. either. pic.twitter.com/xowKtNHgK1 — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 21, 2019

Top Sanders aide Warren Gunnels:

The U.S is the only major country on earth where you can lose your house, car or have your wages garnished because you can't afford to pay a medical bill. That's unconscionable & unacceptable. When Bernie is president we're going to #EliminateMedicalDebt. https://t.co/1KbhvAcufZ — Warren Gunnels (@GunnelsWarren) September 21, 2019

Nick Coltrain, politics reporter for the Des Moines Register:

Sen. @BernieSanders recounts hearing from a veteran in Carson City, Nev., who was suicidal over $100K medical debt. Calls medical debt unconscionable.

""This is the wealthiest country in the history of the world. If we were a poor country, I'd be telling you something else."" — Nick Coltrain (@NColtrain) September 22, 2019

Sanders is right about this: Medical debt is a massive problem for Americans. That was true before the 2010 Affordable Care Act, and it remains a huge problem now.

Medical expenses are a contributing factor in two-thirds of individual bankruptcy filings. In a 2016 Kaiser Family Foundation poll, more than a quarter of U.S. adults ages 18 to 64 said they or someone in their household had problems paying medical bills in the past year.

So it's not surprising many people hailed Sanders's proposal as a well-intentioned goal. The president of the American Federation of Teachers:

Medical debt is a huge problem. That's why nurses, including @minurses have fought to lower debt and have paid off the debt of patients. Glad to see @BernieSanders talking about medical debt as a part of his campaign. #AFTvotes https://t.co/tr6QSue7Y5 — Randi Weingarten (@rweingarten) September 22, 2019

Larry Levitt, vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation:

The proposal from Senator Sanders to eliminate medical debt illustrates that health policy is as much about financial security as it is about access to care. — Larry Levitt (@larry_levitt) September 23, 2019

Vox editor-at-large Ezra Klein:

Of the various kinds of debt you can eliminate, I think the case is strongest for medical debt. That's not a voluntary investment people are making in their future. It's, usually, a catastrophic interaction of bad luck and bad (or no) health insurance. https://t.co/dalUu9ZgNq — Ezra Klein (@ezraklein) September 23, 2019

Erasing $81 billion in medical debt would certainly be good for those who owe it. But it's a lot trickier than it sounds for the government to find it, the founder of a charity that buys and sells medical debt told me. And it wouldn’t wipe out the problem — not even close.

Craig Antico leads a charity called RIP Medical Debt, which negotiates with hospitals to buy medical debt. Because so many medical bills go unpaid — and the problem has only gotten worse as insurance plans have required increasingly high deductibles from patients — he’s typically able to buy debt for just pennies on the dollar.

That’s good news for Sanders’s ambitious plan. Antico estimates that buying $81 billion in medical debt might cost as little as $500 million for the federal government.

But to buy up that debt, the government would have to figure out which hospitals are owed the $81 billion reported to credit agencies. And that information is protected by strict privacy rules credit agencies must adhere to.

“It’s definitely a worthy goal to abolish this debt,” Antico said. “It’s how do you find it?”

Antico provided an example: If the government wanted to abolish medical debt for everyone who lives in, say, New York state, it would have to go to every hospital and doctor's group that might have cared for a state resident and engage in a separate negotiation with each of them. So finding who holds the debt reported to credit agencies is harder than it sounds.

""If Bernie Sanders came to us and said 'I need you guys to abolish $81 billion in debt,' he couldn't direct it to that particular group,"" Antico said.

Plus, only a small fraction of total medical debt — less than 10 percent, according to Antico's estimates — is actually reported to credit agencies. So even if the government succeeded in erasing the $81 billion estimate, hundreds of billions more would remain. That debt would continue hurting those who owe it, as they would be less likely to visit hospitals even in dire need.

And there’s this: Targeting only medical debt reported to credit agencies carries an inherent bias toward patients who have more financial means. Patients who are poorer and could benefit more from having medical debt erased tend to have less or no credit history. Antico's charity focuses on patients who need help the most by going to hospitals and asking to buy the debt of those who might have qualified for financial assistance and didn't receive it, or those who are in bankruptcy.

Sanders didn’t go into detail about how he would approach these questions in a web page detailing his proposal. He also consistently overstates the number of people who go bankrupt every year because they can’t pay their medical bills (my Washington Post colleague Salvador Rizzo awarded Sanders three “Pinocchios” for this claim).

(Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters)

But Sanders’s proposal does make more sense when you consider it in light of his other health-insurance ideas. Under his Medicare-for-all plan, Americans would no longer incur medical debt because everyone would be covered under a universal plan requiring almost no out-of-pocket payments upon getting medical care.

Sanders's vision is to erase outstanding medical debt so the slate could essentially be wiped clean under a new single-payer system, said David Himmelstein, a professor at CUNY’s Hunter College. Sanders has relied on research conducted by Himmelstein, who has worked on the topic with Sanders’s Democratic rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.).

“If you’re saying that we’re gonna stop having financial ruin from medical bills in the future, it makes sense to say ‘let’s go back when the cost is relatively small and not let people be ruined by their medical debts from their past,” Himmelstein told me.

Yet, like Medicare-for-all, the proposal would undoubtedly meet with strong resistance from the behemoth health-care industry. Industry lobbyists argue that erasing medical debt would discourage Americans from purchasing health insurance, because they would be sheltered from it no matter what.

“Paying off everybody’s debts is great campaign rhetoric. As soon as you get into the details, a lot of things fall apart,” one industry lobbyist told me.

AHH, OOF and OUCH

AHH: Black-market vaping products may be behind the mysterious lung illnesses that have sickened at least 530 people in 38 states and killed nine, our Washington Post colleagues Lena H. Sun and Rob Kuznia report.

“Many sick patients said they bought vape products containing THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana, on the black market, officials and clinicians said,” they write. “The biggest legal marijuana market in the world is California — and the black market there is three times as big, said David Abernathy, an executive with Arcview Market Research, a cannabis investment and market research firm.”

Recent changes to the ingredients in popular marijuana vaping devices could be the culprit, according to interviews with more than a dozen people working in the legal and illegal cannabis markets. California has tightened restrictions, making the product even scarcer on the black market. So illegal operators are using a thickening agent to dilute THC oil and stretch their supplies. One such agent — vitamin E acetate — has been the focus of investigations around the mysterious illnesses.

“No one product or substance, including vitamin E acetate, has been conclusively identified as the cause of the lung injuries. But vitamin E acetate has been found in THC products taken from sickened patients and tested by state labs and the FDA’s forensic lab, officials said,” Lena and Rob add.

— Meanwhile, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official told lawmakers there have been “hundreds” of new cases of the vaping-related disease reported to the agency in the past week.

CDC Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat told lawmakers on a House Oversight and Reform subcommittee that more than 100 people are working on the investigation and that the “identification of the cause or causes for the outbreak may take substantial time and continuing effort,” as CNBC’s Angelica LaVito writes.

She also suggsted people may want to avoid vaping products until more is known about what’s causing the illness.

“At this point I think caution in all products is recommended. It may not even be the THC or the nicotine. It may be the additives or substances that may be common. It may be the material is not labeled appropriately,” Schuchat said.

OOF: Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) announced the state will ban all vaping product sales for four months, the toughest state crackdown issued in response to the vaping-related illnesses.

New York and Michigan have already announced bans of flavored products, and the Trump administration said its moving to set its own regulations to “clear the market” of flavored products. Massachusetts would go a step further by also temporarily halting sales of tobacco and marijuana e-cigarettes, as our Post colleague Hannah Knowles reports.

“The purpose of this public health emergency is to temporarily pause all sales of vaping products so that we can work with our medical experts to identify what is making people sick and how to better regulate these products to protect the health of our residents,” Baker said in a statement.

OUCH: An analysis from the Congressional Budget Office found a doctor-friendly approach to tackling surprise medical billing would deepen the deficit by “double digit billions,” the Hill’s Peter Sullivan reports. The analysis specifically examined the approach from Reps. Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) and Phil Roe (R-Tenn.), that calls for an arbitration system in which insurers and providers would propose payment amounts and an independent third party would determine the ""fairer"" payment option.

In an email to a congressional office, Peter writes, the CBO said under Ruiz and Roe’s approach that if “payments to providers increased by 5 percent as the result of the policy, that change alone would result in a $15 billion increase in the deficit over 10 years.”

Meanwhile, the CBO has found the bipartisan bills that advanced out of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee that use a benchmarking approach would save more than $20 billion over a decade.

— The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced premiums for Medicare Advantage plans are set to drop 14 percent in 2020 compared with 2019 and 23 percent compared with 2018. The $23 estimated average monthly premium for the plans for next year will be the lowest average monthly premium for Medicare Advantage plans since 2007, according to the agency.

The average monthly premiums for these plans have decreased by almost 30 percent since 2017. For next year, the average number of plans per county is set to increase from about 33 to 39 plans.

The agency noted more than a third of the approximately 60 million Medicare enrollees are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan and that the number of people in the program is set to increase to a record 24.4 million, up from the current 22.2 million.

In a statement, CMS Administrator Seema Verma sought to contrast the success of Medicare Advantage plans with Medicare-for-all proposals — “proposals for a total government takeover of healthcare, which would destroy options such as Medicare Advantage that seniors increasingly choose,” Verma said.

— Pharmaceutical companies are upping their lobbying efforts and spending millions on ads to try to stop drug pricing bills they worry will dull their pricing power and markedly reduce sales, the Wall Street Journal’s Peter Loftus reports.

Industry players are hoping to at least stop any proposals -- such as the effort to peg U.S. drug prices to prices paid by other countries -- from passing this year, assuming lawmakers will be less likely to advance any plans in an election year.

But the challenge for these drugmakers is their diminishing political capital as concerns about high drug prices extend across party lines.

""Industry executives and lobbyists are urging friendly lawmakers to pass legislation blocking the plans,” Peter writes. “They are also pushing administration officials to pursue measures that would pressure industry middlemen such as pharmacy-benefit managers to provide some relief on patients’ costs without directly curbing drugmakers’ pricing power.”

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the top trade group representing the drug industry, has spent $16.3 million on lobbying in the first six months of the year, compared to $28 million for all of last year.

The list of Democrats calling for Trump’s impeachment has been bolstered in recent days by revelations that Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son in a phone call that took place shortly after Trump had temporarily suspended military aid to the country.

Democrats have accused Trump of trying to pressure a foreign power to hurt Biden, now a leading Democratic presidential contender. Trump has acknowledged he held back the aid, but denies doing anything improper. On Tuesday, he said he was concerned the United States was contributing more to Ukraine than European countries. He has previously said he was worried about corruption in Ukraine.

In surveys of registered voters since the start of August, Trump has trailed Biden by 14 percentage points in a Fox News poll, by 15 points in a Washington Post-ABC poll, by 12 points in an Investor’s Business Daily/TIPP poll and by 16 points in a Quinnipiac University poll.

When matched against four other Democratic candidates — Sen. Warren Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Sen Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg — Trump did not have an advantage against any of them. At best he trailed within the range of sampling error.

Recent polling has also shown Trump without a clear lead against top Democrats in several of the mostly closely contested states in 2016.

In Michigan, for instance, an EPIC-MRA poll in August asked whether registered voters would support Trump against four different Democratic candidates.

Trump trailed Biden by 10 points, a statistically significant edge. Warren and Sanders held slight edges over Trump of 4 points and 5 points, respectively, while Harris had a 3-point lead, which was within the margin of error.

In Wisconsin, a Marquette Law School poll in August found Trump tied or behind Biden, Sanders, Warren and Harris among registered voters. Biden led Trump by 9 points; Sanders had a slight 4-point edge, while Warren and Harris were tied with Trump.

President Trump's congressional agenda -- and specifically, the adminstration's top economic priorities -- may be the first casualty of the impeachment inquiry House Democrats just launched.

Specifically, a reworked North American trade pact — officially the United States-Mexico-Canada deal (USMCA), the administration’s top legislative priority — and a measure to impose new price controls on prescription drugs now face even longer odds this year. And the impeachment showdown raises the stakes for a potential government shutdown in late November, when stopgap funding Trump is expected to sign this week runs out.

The confrontation between the president and the House majority promises to be consuming, leaving little bandwidth or appetite for cooperation on other matters. “Not that there’s a ton now, but there’s going to be less,” says Andy Laperriere, head of U.S. policy research for Cornerstone Macro. “It’s hard to walk and chew gum when impeachment is one of those things. I don’t think they can multitask impeachment and a legislative agenda.”

Investors drew a similar conclusion. The S&P 500 saw its biggest one-day drop in a month, sliding 0.8 percent, as did the Nasdaq. And the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0.5 percent after recovering some earlier losses. It was one of the most volatile trading day in weeks, as investors reacted to gyrations on the impeachment front while also absorbing gloomy news about consumer confidence and the U.S.-China trade war.

“Investors like gridlock, but they don’t like dysfunctional paralysis,” Stephen Myrow of Beacon Policy Advisors tells me. And impeachment “is raising the specter of dysfunctional paralysis,” a dynamic that could doom the USMCA, for example, while presenting new risks, “particularly in the event of a crisis.”

House Democrats haven’t foreclosed on continuing their everyday work while the impeachment inquiry gets underway. Via the Financial Times’s James Politi:

A spokesperson for Richard Neal, House Ways and Means committee chair, says he is ""absolutely committed to continuing"" the USMCA talks, ""regardless of any other congressional activity"" — James Politi (@JamesPoliti) September 24, 2019

But White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham signaled the administration will no longer work with House Democrats on matters of common interest. “In a far departure from all of the work and results of this President, House Democrats have destroyed any chances of legislative progress for the people of this country by continuing to focus all their energy on partisan political attacks,” she said in a statement.

Trump sent a similar message in a tweet:

The Democrats are so focused on hurting the Republican Party and the President that they are unable to get anything done because of it, including legislation on gun safety, lowering of prescription drug prices, infrastructure, etc. So bad for our Country! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019

Washington analysts who help decode political developments for Wall Street investors reported a heavy volume of calls as clients attempted to make sense of the latest turmoil. Analysts said even amid rapidly moving and highly uncertain circumstances, the implications for a corporate priority such as the USMCA al are clear enough.

“From a purely market perspective, I think the impeachment conversation is being viewed as just another dynamic that will weigh on market sentiment until there is clarity on both the resolution and the longer-term implications,” Compass Point’s Isaac Boltansky said in an email.

Negotiations over the trade deal had showed signs of progress in recent days. Robert Lighthizer, Trump’s trade chief, was in talks with a working group of House Democratic lawmakers appointed by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). They were trying to forge a compromise on Democratic demands for stronger labor, environmental and enforcement provisions — changes Pelosi demanded before agreeing to put the measure to a floor vote. “Before this weekend, USMCA was looking good,” one top House Democratic aide tells me.

But revelations about Trump’s call with his Ukrainian counterpart — and pressure the president applied for him to probe former vice president Joe Biden— reset the fall agenda. In a sign of how dramatically circumstances have shifted, some freshmen Democrats from swing districts who had been agitating for a USMCA vote in part to have a bipartisan accomplishment to tout at home became the driving force for an impeachment inquiry. Public calls from that cohort to zero in on Trump’s dealings with Ukraine dissolved Pelosi’s months-long resistance to taking the next step against the president.

""Perhaps Pelosi will schedule a vote on USMCA this year, but that strikes us as a political bridge too far,"" Cowen Washington Research Group's Chris Krueger wrote in a note. ""Ratify Trump's signature trade achievement while calling for his impeachment?""

MARKET MOVERS

— Consumer confidence falls amid trade fears: “U.S. consumer confidence ebbed in September as an escalation in trade tensions fanned concerns about business and labor market conditions, a potentially worrying signal for consumer spending, which has been driving the economy,” Reuters’s Lucia Mutikani reports.

“The relatively downbeat survey from the Conference Board ... mirrors other confidence surveys and could renew financial market fears of a recession that had been assuaged somewhat by strong August retail sales, industrial production and housing data.”

""The overall measure remains elevated,"" Bloomberg's William Edwards notes. But the drop represented the biggest slip since the beginning of the year. And it was steeper than economists expected.

— Kashkari: The Fed is partially responsible for the slowdown. The Post's Heather Long: ""Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari says two factors are holding the U.S. economy back right now: President Trump’s trade war and high interest rates. The current U.S. interest rate is a bit below 2 percent after the Fed lowered it slightly last week. Kashkari would like to see the rate cut to under 1.5 percent to stimulate the economy.

""'I’m concerned that we’ve needlessly raised interest rates over the past three years and put the economy into a more dangerous position that makes it more vulnerable to shocks that could hit us,' Kashkari told The Washington Post in an interview Tuesday. 'Why are we trying to contract the economy?'""

— Boris Johnson defiant after court ruling. Bloomberg's Tim Ross and Kitty Donaldson: ""A defiant Boris Johnson hit back at the U.K.’s top judges and vowed to take the country out of the European Union next month, despite suffering an unprecedented legal defeat over his Brexit strategy in the highest court in the land. In a sweeping rebuke to the prime minister, Britain’s Supreme Court ruled that Johnson broke the law when he decided to suspend Parliament for five weeks in the run-up to the Oct. 31 deadline for leaving the EU.""

What's next: ""The ruling marks an extraordinary constitutional moment and an unprecedented political crisis for the U.K. It blows a hole in Johnson’s political authority and calls into question his ability to remain in office as the Queen’s principal adviser. Senior politicians, including the former Conservative Prime Minister John Major, demanded that he apologize to Parliament. While the opposition was quick to call for his resignation, Johnson’s aides say he won’t go.""

He repeated long-held criticism that the World Trade Organization is giving preferential treatment to China.

""Chinese delegates sat stone-faced as Trump also briefly praised protesters in Hong Kong this year who are opposing Beijing's tightening grip on the semi-autonomous city. 'We want balanced trade that is both fair and reciprocal,' Trump said. Trump said that while he wants a trade deal with China, he would 'not accept a bad deal for the American people.'""

WSJ's Tyler Blint-Welsh: ""Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the so-called decoupling of the world’s two largest economies would have disastrous results and that China and the U.S. need to work cooperatively through their disagreements. Mr. Wang’s comments came as the U.S. and China remain at an impasse in a more than yearlong trade war, one that some analysts say could lead to a widening chasm between the two countries.

""'Decoupling from China’s economy would be to decouple from opportunities, and the future,' said Mr. Wang, who in the past has called the U.S.’s and China’s interests 'inseparable.'""

“The European Court of Justice ruled that Google doesn’t generally have to apply the EU’s ‘right to be forgotten’ to versions of its search engine accessed outside the bloc’s borders, though judges left the door open for European regulators to order it to do so in specific cases.”

— More workers to qualify for OT: “Workers making less than $35,500 are now entitled to mandatory overtime pay from their employers, under new rules announced by the Department of Labor. The new rules will take effect at the beginning of 2020,” my colleague Eli Rosenberg reports.

“The rules raise the salary threshold for workers for whom overtime pay — 1.5 times a worker’s typical hourly rate — is required from $23,600, a standard set in 2004 during the George W. Bush presidency. The Department of Labor under President Obama tried to raise the threshold to $47,000, a shift that would have given overtime pay to four million additional workers. But that proposal was met with strong opposition from business groups like the Chamber of Commerce, as well as Republicans.”

— Saudis consider doubling history’s largest IPO: “After attacks on its oil infrastructure, Saudi Arabia is moving forward with the much-anticipated initial public offering of its state-owned oil company and considering a proposal to offer investors a much bigger stake in the company than previously planned, people familiar with the matter said,” the WSJ’s Summer Said and Julie Steinberg report.

“The Saudi Royal Court and its advisers have been debating an eventual float of as much as 10% of the Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Aramco, doubling the country’s longstanding public intention to list just 5%, according to these people. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ’s plan to expand what has already been billed as the world’s largest IPO suggests his often outsize ambitions are undeterred, even as the country’s oil giant attempts a full recovery from recent attacks on its largest facilities and faces risks to its valuation from subdued oil prices.”

— Pharma companies are ramping up their lobbying efforts: “Worried drugmakers are stepping up efforts to blunt proposals in Washington that they view as some of the most serious threats to their pricing power in recent years,” the WSJ’s Peter Loftus reports.

“Pharmaceutical industry trade organizations and outside groups are spending millions of dollars on advertisements attacking the proposals, which would peg drug prices in the U.S. to prices paid overseas and force companies to pay rebates if a drug’s price increases by more than the rate of inflation … Industry executives and lobbyists are urging friendly lawmakers to pass legislation blocking the plans. They are also pushing administration officials to pursue measures that would pressure industry middlemen such as pharmacy-benefit managers to provide some relief on patients’ costs without directly curbing drugmakers’ pricing power.”

This quote: “We’re facing the stiffest political headwinds in the history of the industry,” James Greenwood, president of the trade group Biotechnology Innovation Organization, told the WSJ. BIO’s member companies include Amgen Inc., Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer Inc.

— WeWork’s CEO is out: WeWork co-founder and Chief Executive Adam Neumann ""was forced to step down and cede control of the shared-office startup after its much-anticipated initial public offering was derailed, capping a swift fall from grace for the leader of one of the country’s most valuable startups,” the WSJ’s Eliot Brown, Dana Cimilluca, David Benoit and Maureen Farrell report.

“Mr. Neumann will also cede majority control of the company, with his voting shares reduced to 3-to-1 from 10-to-1, the people said. The company earlier this month had reversed a recent enhancement to Mr. Neumann’s voting power that allotted him 20 votes for each share he held.”

The situation: “Mr. Neumann’s position at the company became tenuous after We postponed an IPO earlier this month amid concerns from prospective investors about its governance and ability to reverse big losses. That skepticism has placed a major dent in the company’s expected valuation, which has plummeted from $47 billion earlier this year to as low as $15 billion.”

— Hedge fun runs into Trump’s vaping ban: “Jason Mudrick has been enjoying a run this year that most other hedge fund managers only dream of,” Bloomberg News’s Sridhar Natarajan and Josh Saul report. “His flagship fund at Mudrick Capital Management is up 32% on soaring valuations for one of the largest players in the U.S. vaping market. Now, that same bet could pose a headache for the maverick investor.”

“About $800 million, or almost 30% of the assets overseen by his firm, are tied to E-cigarette maker NJOY Holdings Inc., according to people with knowledge of the matter. Mudrick’s controlling stake in the vaping venture has powered pretty much all of the gains in his flagship fund this year at a time when many other managers are posting tepid returns.”

— Sanders calls for 8% wealth tax: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) ""unveiled a proposal to create a new tax on the wealth of the richest Americans, including a steep tax on billionaires that could greatly diminish their fortunes,” the New York Times’s Thomas Kaplan reports.

The details: “Mr. Sanders’s plan to tax accumulated wealth, not just income, is particularly aggressive in how it would erode the fortunes of billionaires. His tax would cut in half the wealth of the typical billionaire after 15 years, according to two economists who worked with the Sanders campaign on the plan.”

Wall Street is sounding the alarm over Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s rise in the Democratic presidential race, as investors start to grapple with the possibility the industry scourge secures her party's nomination.

One investor joked that the stock market wouldn't even open if the Massachusetts senator became president; a segment on CNBC featured the idea that married couples could get divorced rather than be subjected to Warren's ""wealth tax.""

For now, the rising nerves are mostly evident in chatter. There's an emerging consensus that a Warren presidency would hurt the stock market -- yet there’s little evidence that investors are pricing in the risk.

""From a pure markets perspective, a Warren nomination hardly seemed 'priced in,'"" Chris Krueger of Cowen Washington Research Group writes. He offers a few theories why that's the case: The election remains far away; Warren could be seen as a weaker Trump foe; or that Warren will moderate her pitch if she secures the nomination. ""In any event, buckle up.""

Greg Valliere, chief U.S. policy strategist for AGF Investments, dismissed the possibility of market fallout from the firestorm in Washington over reports Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate former vice president Joe Biden — and the renewed impeachment talk it has touched off.

“What could affect the markets, however, is what we have warned about for months: the growing possibility that [Warren] may be the Democrats’ nominee,” Valliere writes.

Hedge fund titan Leon Cooperman went further. “They won’t open the stock market if Elizabeth Warren is the next president,” he said to the crowd at the Delivering Alpha Conference, apparently joking.

He later clarified the comment in a CNBC interview, saying the market would open, just “a hell of a lot lower,” estimating a 25 percent selloff and a bear market lasting at least a year. (Institutional investors, according to an RBC survey, view the Massachusetts Democrat as the candidate most threatening to the stock market, beating out Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) 51 percent to 38 percent.)

The network just aired a piece suggesting married couples rich enough to face Warren’s wealth tax, which proposes a 2 percent levy on a household's assets greater than $50 million, could avoid it by getting divorced. Richer couples stand to save even more by splitting, since the tax would apply an extra percent to assets over $1 billion. “If a couple worth $2 billion divorces, they would save $10 million a year in taxes,” CNBC’s Robert Frank explained.

Couples could continue living together, the piece suggested, and just legally end their marriages for the tax savings. No matter that Warren’s proposal, if she is nominated then elected, still faces exceedingly long odds in what is expected to be a closely divided Senate.

“The markets probably won't really focus on the campaigns until the candidates have been set next year at the parties' conventions, says Jeff Mortimer, director of investment strategy at BNY Mellon Wealth Management,” Randall Forsyth writes in Barron’s. “Even so, Wall Street has taken notice of Warren's recent surge in the polls past Sanders, to second place behind [Biden].”

Indeed, Warren’s growing traction in the Democratic race is making a possible presidency more vivid for financiers she wants to subject to higher taxes and tougher regulation.

The latest Des Moines Register poll showed the senator leading in Iowa for the first time, edging ahead of Biden, 22 percent to 20 percent, though still within the survey’s 4 percent margin of error. And a new national Wall Street Journal/ NBC News poll finds Biden and Warren separating from the rest of the field. Biden is backed by 31 percent, Warren pulled in 25 percent, and Sanders, at 14 percent, was the only other candidates with more than single-digit support.

The “ultimate irony,” Valliere writes, is that Trump “is going after the wrong opponent. His scorched earth assault on Biden comes as the former vice president is slipping into second place in the fight to win the nomination. Warren is the candidate Trump needs to worry about; simply calling her ‘Pocahontas’ will not be sufficient to stop her momentum.”

Warren's rise hasn't yet weighed on stock prices. But the rising level of alarm among investors suggests they may be clearer-eyed about Trump’s challengers than the president himself.

MARKET MOVERS

— Wall Street quant finds rising impeachment risk. The possibility of impeachment no longer drives market performance the way it did, say, in the opening months of Trump’s presidency, when the prospect of his ouster clouded the outlook for his corporate tax cut. But GeoQuant CEO Mark Rosenberg, whose firm uses artificial intelligence-powered indexes to chart different kinds of political risks, says Trump now faces the highest risk of impeachment yet. His ""Mueller Risk Index,"" which measures institutional support for the president, shows the threat to Trump spiking early next month:

“I am a bit surprised that these events pushed us to an all time peak--higher than late June 2017, when Mueller expanded the probe to include obstruction and was reportedly ordered to be fired by Trump,” Rosenberg emails. But he also notes his index shows the risk trailing off sharply after early next month, “suggesting that a successful impeachment remains quite unlikely.”

— British court: Boris Johnson acted illegally. The Post's Karla Adam and William Booth: ""Britain’s highest court dealt a major blow on Tuesday to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, ruling that his controversial decision to suspend Parliament was unlawful, in a landmark judgment that will have immediate implications for Britain’s departure from the European Union. In one of the most high-profile cases to come before Britain’s Supreme Court, the 11 judges ruled unanimously that Johnson had not acted lawfully in shuttering Parliament...

""The decision was a brutal one for the embattled prime minister, asserting that his move to suspend the Parliament was political maneuver, and suggesting that he might have misled the queen... Johnson, who is in New York for the U.N. General Assembly session, said he will not resign.""

— NY Fed: Central bank did the right thing last week. CNBC's Jeff Cox: ""New York Fed President John Williams said Monday that the central bank acted quickly during last week’s jolt to overnight lending markets and that the issue appears resolved for now. However, he cautioned that short-term lending markets face another crisis, though a few years in the distance, if banks don’t prepare themselves for when the London Interbank Offer Rate, or LIBOR, is phased out. LIBOR is used as an international benchmark for overnight lending.

""Williams also said that there’s potential for further disruptions at the end of the quarter Sept. 30 and that the Fed is continuing to monitor the need for more reserves in the system.""

— Japan trade deal stalls: “The trade agreement [Trump] told Congress he had reached with Japan last week is now hung up amid Japanese concerns that Trump will still move to penalize their auto shipments to the United States, according to two people familiar with the negotiations,” my colleague David J. Lynch reports.

“Japanese officials have insisted they should be able to back out of the deal if Trump imposes these tariffs, something he has threatened to do for more than a year. This concern has emerged as the principal substantive issue before a formal pact can be signed, said the people, who weren’t authorized to discuss the private deliberations. Trump had wanted to ink the deal during the U.N. General Assembly session in New York, but that now appears unlikely.”

What might happen this week: “The finishing touches now are unlikely to be completed in time for Wednesday’s scheduled meeting between Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. But the leaders may sign a nonbinding statement, according to Japanese news reports.”

— China buys more soybeans after trade talks: “Chinese importers bought about 10 boatloads of U.S. soybeans,” Reuters’s Karl Plume reports, a development that occurs “following deputy-level trade talks in Washington last week that were overshadowed by the abrupt cancellation of a U.S. farm state visit by Chinese agriculture officials.”

— Juul is the subject of a criminal probe: “Federal prosecutors in California are conducting a criminal probe into e-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc., according to people familiar with the matter, escalating law-enforcement scrutiny of the startup,” the WSJ’s Jennifer Maloney reports. “The investigation by the U.S. attorney’s office of the Northern District of California is in its early stages, the people said. The focus of the probe couldn’t be learned.”

“General counsel Ravinder Passi brought up the matter with Nissan directors by handing them a letter when they gathered Sept. 9 to review the investigation’s results, say people who attended the meeting in Yokohama, Japan … The objections by Mr. Passi and others lay bare the continuing turmoil at the car maker over corporate governance nearly a year after Mr. Ghosn’s arrest and following the resignation this month of Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa.”

“Neumann has not yet agreed to step aside as CEO of WeWork parent We Company, and there is no certainty he will do so, the sources said. However, a board challenge planned by investors, including SoftBank Group Corp and Benchmark Capital, has been put on hold until these discussions produce an outcome, the sources added.”

— Credit Suisse had a star banker followed. Bloomberg's Jan-Henrik Foerster and Patrick Winters: ""A made-in-Zurich banking drama spilled out into the open over the weekend after it emerged that ex-top Credit Suisse Group AG banker Iqbal Khan had been shadowed by the lender, leading to a confrontation in broad daylight in the Swiss financial capital.

""The private banker, hired by crosstown rival UBS Group AG last month, was followed by detectives trying to establish if he was attempting to poach ex-Credit Suisse colleagues to join him at the world’s top wealth manager, according to several people familiar with the situation. They asked not to be identified because the matter is private.""

Senate lawmakers are eager to take Facebook to task for its high-profile acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp at a big antitrust hearing today. But one of their key witnesses will warn them that heavyhanded regulation from Washington could have unintended consequences for tech startups -- and ultimately prevent them from becoming competitors to tech giants.

“It’s critical that policymakers understand that not all [mergers and acquisitions are] the same,” Patricia Nakache, a general partner at Trinity Ventures, will tell lawmakers on a Senate Judiciary subcommittee today, according to her prepared testimony.

One of lawmakers' top concerns at this afternoon's hearing on ""acquisitions of nascent or potential competitors"" will be whether Facebook tried to prevent the rise of new competitors by buying them up. But Nakache will stress that, if Washington goes too far in scrutinizing deals, it could end up causing problems for smaller companies seeking funding so they can challenge existing leaders in the industry.

She plans to warn lawmakers against “the unintended consequence of dampening the creation of and investment in companies that seek to directly challenge incumbents.""

Nakache will be one of the first venture capitalists to publicly testify about competition on Capitol Hill since antitrust scrutiny increased this summer. Her comments reflect their delicate position. Startups stand to benefit if the tech giants they hope to compete with are distracted by Washington's antitrust inquiries or regulators impose more limitations on their business. But at the same time, small tech companies are still deeply intertwined with -- and reliant on -- existing larger platforms.

That tension is particularly acute when it comes to acquisitions, which are a very common way for venture capitalists and founders to get a return on their investment in a startup. The four companies under scrutiny in Washington -- Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon -- are some of the biggest acquirers of tech startups. Problems for them could mean problems for deals.

So far, the tech giants have continued to acquire smaller companies, as we wrote about in The Technology 202 this summer when Google bought Looker. Just yesterday, Facebook acquired the brain computing startup CTRL-labs.

“I am concerned,” said Scott Kupor, managing partner of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and author of the new book “Secrets of Sand Hill Road"" told me at the time of the Looker acquisition. “It's not a tomorrow problem, but if this goes on for five, ten years, it could have a meaningful impact.”

Yet lawmakers are growing fed up with the Wild West environment that has allowed Silicon Valley tech titans to amass so much power, and some think it's time for Washington to play a greater role on these issues. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) told me in an email that today's hearing is important because recent mergers have raised serious competition issues.

“Big technology companies have become some of the most powerful organizations in the world,” said Klobuchar, who is also running for president. “These companies' practices can limit options for consumers, distort prices, and stifle innovation. With virtually no meaningful pushback from our government, these companies have reshaped the meaning of American privacy, the purchasing of goods and services, and the working of our elections and our democracy.”

She has previously called for antitrust laws to be modernized and for more resources for federal regulators to enforce existing laws.

Other witnesses at the hearing will include Bruce Hoffman, director of the Bureau of competition at the Federal Trade Commission, as well as American Antitrust Institute president Diana Moss and John Yun, director of economic education At The Global Antitrust Institute at George Mason University.

BITS: Google scored a key victory as a European court ruled that the company does not have to apply the ""Right to be Forgotten"" rule globally, the BBC's Leo Kelion reports this morning. When it receives a request to remove information under the law, Google will only have to remove links from its search results in the European Union, not elsewhere.

""Currently, there is no obligation under EU law, for a search engine operator who grants a request for de-referencing made by a data subject... to carry out such a de-referencing on all the versions of its search engine,"" the European Court of Justice ruling said.

The decision comes after a French regulator ordered Google to globally remove search result listing pages about a person under the European law, which allows people to ask tech companies to remove damaging or false information about them online. Google created a geoblocking feature that censored the links in Europe, but ensured they were still available to people in other parts of the world. Google then challenged a 100,000 fine the French regulator levied against the company.

The case has broad implications as technology companies operate globally across borders, and regulators around the world increasingly consider regulations to rein in American tech giants. Google argued removing the links globally could set a precedent that authoritarian governments outsie of Europe could abuse when trying to hide human rights abuses.

NIBBLES: Political campaigns and advocacy groups are taking a page from marketers by partnering with social media influencers in hopes of getting an edge with digital natives, the Wall Street Journal's Emily Glazer and Georgia Wells report. Presidential campaigns of Donald Trump, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang are all hoping that the Internet-grown celebrities will be able to persuade potential voters more than impersonal television ads or mailers, Emily and Georgia report.

Candidates' approaches to influencers varies. Kamala Harris's campaign has offered event invitations and merchandise in exchange for promoting her campaign; Andrew Yang's campaign has employed a public relations firm to create memes for influencers to share.

The Republican National Committee, which is fielding only one candidate, has taken a much more aggressive approach, offering social media influencers social-media training at its headquarters, Georgia and Emily report. Trump's campaign has also advertised on multiple YouTube channels, a significant platform for his base.

These efforts are expected to increase as 2020 approaches. Curtis Hougland, founder of tech start-up Main Street One — which is working on micro-targeted campaigns in several states — tells the Journal.

BYTES: Facebook took down a page spreading conservative content called “I Love America” and eight associated pages yesterday after a media report publicized that the page was run by Ukrainians, my colleague Craig Timberg reports. The continued circulation of political content targeted at American audiences by foreign actors raises doubts about Facebook's ability to curb foreign influence on its platform before the 2020 elections.

The page was founded in 2017, but only recently moved into spreading conservative content to an audience of more than 1 million followers, according to journalist Judd Legum, who first flagged the page to Facebook.

UPDATE: 8 hours after https://t.co/Gl6evXRDcZ's report, Facebook has taken down the Ukrainian ""I Love America"" page & every other page identified in the piece

While Facebook originally told Legum that the page did not violate appear to violate its rules for coordinated inauthentic behavior, it determined the pages did violate the policy and removed them late yesterday. Facebook said it did not detect that the pages were tied to any nation-state actor, but its investigation is ongoing. The pages appeared to be ""financially motivated, Facebook's head of cybersecurity Nathaniel Gleicher said on Twitter, adding that ""it's also critical that we don’t assume every clickbait operation is [government operations.]""

The pages repurposed content connected with Russia's Internet Research Agency, which continues to surface on both Facebook and Instagram. Researchers including David Carroll have questioned why the company hasn't done more to prevent the content from continuing to circulate.

You’d think Facebook would have fingerprinted the RU IRA memes to automate their detection when recycled on new pages with huge audiences in the US but operated out of Ukraine. But no. @JuddLegum’s latest discovery is “troubling” leading up to 2020. https://t.co/A9HBQRvseA — David Carroll 🦅 (@profcarroll) September 23, 2019

-- Apple will manufacture its new Mac Pro in Texas after the Trump administration granted the company exemptions from tariffs on several key components manufactured in China, my colleague Reed Albergotti reports.

“We believe deeply in the power of American innovation,” Cook said in the statement. “That’s why every Apple product is designed and engineered in the U. S, and made up of parts from 36 states, supporting 450,000 jobs with U.S. suppliers, and we’re going to continue growing here.”

The exemptions mark a reversal on Trump's previous comments about Apple and tariffs. President Trump tweeted in July: “Apple will not be given Tariff waiver, or relief, for Mac Pro parts that are made in China.""

The Trump administration granted the company exemptions for 10 items last week, but many more core products, including the iPhone, will face steep tariffs by the end of the year unless the U.S. government strikes a new trade deal with China, Reed reports.

On The Hill

THE POINT OF NO RETURN: Pressure is mounting on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to open the formal impeachment inquiry she has so long resisted.

And then there were 146: On Monday night, seven House Democrats with national security and military backgrounds who won competitive House districts in 2018 came out to back launching an impeachment inquiry — bringing the total count of Democrats in favor of opening an inquiry to 146.

In an op-ed in The Post, freshman Democratic Reps. Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia write:

“If these allegations are true, we believe these actions represent an impeachable offense. We do not arrive at this conclusion lightly, and we call on our colleagues in Congress to consider the use of all congressional authorities available to us, including the power of “inherent contempt” and impeachment hearings, to address these new allegations, find the truth and protect our national security.”

They are referring to allegations Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to reopen an investigation into unsubstantiated claims of corruption by Joe Biden and his son. Trump did so while the United States was withholding promised aid from Ukraine.

House Dem just now: “the dam is breaking” on impeachment. — Jonathan Martin (@jmartNYT) September 24, 2019

More than a majority: Pelosi, who has said impeaching Trump is “just not worth it,” is now “sounding out top allies and lawmakers about whether the time has come to impeach President Trump,” multiple Democratic officials told my colleagues Rachael Bade and Mike DeBonis.

“Pelosi, according to multiple senior House Democrats and congressional aides, has asked colleagues whether they believe that Trump’s own admission that he pressured a Ukrainian leader to investigate a political foe is a tipping point,” Rachael and Mike report. “She was making calls as late as Monday night to gauge support in the caucus, and many leadership aides who once thought Trump’s impeachment was unlikely now say they think it’s almost inevitable.”

From a Pelosi ally: Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), a close Pelosi ally, also has changed her tune, writing in a statement that an impeachment inquiry “may be the only recourse Congress has” to hold Trump accountable.

“Congress must meet this pivotal moment in our nation’s history with decisive action,” she tweeted.

On today's docket: Pelosi has summoned House leaders to a 4 p.m. meeting to discuss the matter.

“Mindful that Democrats may have only a brief window to decide their course, [Pelosi] summoned the leaders of six House committees involved in investigations of the president to meet on Tuesday, telling the lawmakers to come without aides. Afterward, she planned to convene a special meeting of the Democratic caucus to discuss impeachment,” the New York Times's Maggie Haberman, Nick Fandos, Michael Crowley and Ken Vogel report. A full meeting of the Democratic caucus will take place afterward.

Rachael and Mike report that House leadership has discussed “the possibility of a special select committee that would combine House Judiciary with other panels such as Intelligence” to handle a hypothetical impeachment inquiry.

In the meantime though, Pelosi still faces some political obstacles:

“Voters still overwhelming disapprove of Democrats impeaching the president — though those polls where conducted before last week’s reports about the whistleblower complaint. In the Senate, Republicans have made it clear that they are standing with Trump and are unlikely to convict him if a trial occurs,” per Rachael and Mike.

But Trump seems impervious to the growing political firestorm — indeed, he appeared to be stoking it yesterday with incendiary comments targeting Biden at the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York.

“What he’s learned is you can get away with just about anything if you’re willing to gamble and you have zero shame,” Gwenda Blair, a biographer of the Trump family, told the New York Times's Peter Baker. “He had just outbluffed the old-school way of holding people to account, so what the heck, why not go for it in the phone call to the new, young and vulnerable Ukrainian president?”

“It’s difficult to imagine a purer example, even on the president’s own account of his conduct, of why the Constitution’s framers thought it essential to include the impeachment power,” Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor, told Baker.

At The White House

THE FACTS ARE COMING OUT: As the White House refuses to release the transcript of the call between Trump and Zelensky, reporters unearthed important details fueling suspicions Trump may have sought to leverage and withhold congressionally approved aid to Ukraine.

The latest: “President Trump told his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to hold back almost $400 million in military aid for Ukraine at least a week before a phone call in which Trump is said to have pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate the son of former vice president Joe Biden, according to three senior administration officials,” per our colleagues Karoun Demirjian, Josh Dawsey, Ellen Nakashima and Carol Leonnig.

“Officials at the Office of Management and Budget relayed Trump’s order to the State Department and the Pentagon during an interagency meeting in mid-July, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. They explained that the president had 'concerns' and wanted to analyze whether the money needed to be spent.”

Key: “Administration officials were instructed to tell lawmakers that the delays were part of an 'interagency process' but to give them no additional information — a pattern that continued for nearly two months, until the White House released the funds on the night of Sept. 11,” per Karoun, Josh, Ellen and Carol.

'A perfect phone call': That's how Trump has described the July phoner with Ukraine's president. But Zelensky spoke with Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) during an early September visit to Ukraine and “'directly' expressed concerns at their meeting that 'the aid that was being cut off to Ukraine by the president was a consequence' of his unwillingness to launch an investigation into the Bidens,” per our colleagues.

Trump took his attacks on Biden and the press to a whole new level:

“If that ever happened, if a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair right now,” Trump told reporters on Monday from a meeting at the United Nations General Assembly.

The Campaign

DNC RAISES DEBATE THRESHOLDS: “The Democratic National Committee announced new qualification rules for the November debates,” our colleague Michael Scherer writes of the decision “that could kick more candidates off the stage, as party leaders continue to push to shrink the field in the presidential nomination fight.”

The new rules: "" … candidates will have to demonstrate they have 165,000 unique donors, an increase of 30,000 from the October qualification levels. They will also have to meet a new polling criteria, either by scoring 3 percent in at least four national or state polls approved by the party, or by receiving at least 5 percent in two approved single-state polls from Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina or Nevada,” Scherer reports.

Who is in trouble: Sen. Michael Bennet (Colo.), Rep. Tim Ryan (Ohio), Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and former Rep. John Delaney (Md.) have yet to qualify for the October debate. They've so far failed to rank in a single qualifying poll.

Bus tours across Iowa are quite common, but in a modern day twist on the late Sen. John McCain's ""Straight Talk Express,"" Buttigieg's team welcomed reporters to join him for the entirety of his four-day trip, everything on-the-record.

Some of the questions he's answered so far: ""What does he think about growing calls for an impeachment investigation against President Donald Trump?"" Rodriguez writes. ""Did he have a comment on the Republican Party's talking points about the presidential race? How does he assess the current psyche of American voters? What does he miss about home? How many of his signature white shirts and jeans had he packed for his four-day bus tour across Iowa? And was he ironing"" (4 shirts, he ironed himself; one pair of jeans).

In the Media

THIS BOMBSHELL STORY FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHER: A.G. Sulzberger, the Times publisher, spoke at Brown University about the state of journalism. He discussed for the first time a story that shows how much the Trump administration “has retreated from our country’s historical role as a defender of the free press.” It is simply jaw-dropping.

You can read the full-text of his speech here.

What happened: “Two years ago, we got a call from a United States government official warning us of the imminent arrest of a New York Times reporter based in Egypt named Declan Walsh,” Sulzberger said. “Though the news was alarming, the call was actually fairly standard. Over the years, we’ve received countless such warnings from American diplomats, military leaders and national security officials.”

Over the years, we’ve received countless such warnings from American diplomats, military leaders and national security officials.” But this time was different: “We learned the official was passing along this warning without the knowledge or permission of the Trump administration. Rather than trying to stop the Egyptian government or assist the reporter, the official believed, the Trump administration intended to sit on the information and let the arrest be carried out. The official feared being punished for even alerting us to the danger,” Sulzberger said.

The official feared being punished for even alerting us to the danger,” Sulzberger said. Luckily, they figured out another way: “Unable to count on our own government to prevent the arrest or help free Declan if he were imprisoned, we turned to his native country, Ireland, for help,” Sulzberger said. “Within an hour, Irish diplomats traveled to his house and safely escorted him to the airport before Egyptian forces could detain him. We hate to imagine what would have happened had that brave official not risked their career to alert us to the threat.”

On The Hill

WHY PELOSI CHANGED HER MIND: The speaker of the House “crossed the Rubicon,” in her words, when she announced late yesterday afternoon that Democrats would officially embrace an impeachment inquiry into President Trump.

It was a defining moment for Nancy Pelosi and for the Trump presidency, one which was far from guaranteed. Just a week ago, Pelosi was cautioning restive members of her caucus to hold their fire on wielding impeachment, a blunt political tool brandished only four times in American history. But the speaker relented following allegations Trump encouraged the Ukrainian president to reopen an investigation into Joe Biden and his son.

“The actions of the Trump presidency have revealed the dishonorable fact of the president’s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,” Pelosi said. “Therefore, today, I am announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.”

Pelosi said. What this means: “Pelosi’s move all but ensures that the House will vote on articles charging Trump with 'high crimes and misdemeanors' in a matter of weeks, according to senior Democratic lawmakers and top leadership aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations,” my colleagues Rachael Bade, Mike DeBonis and Karoun Demirjian report.

“Pelosi’s move all but ensures that the House will vote on articles charging Trump with 'high crimes and misdemeanors' in a matter of weeks, according to senior Democratic lawmakers and top leadership aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations,” my colleagues Rachael Bade, Mike DeBonis and Karoun Demirjian report. “Unlike any other caucus meeting, there was broad consensus — I did not hear one word of dissent, and that’s the first time that I recall that’s occurred in a discussion of the president,” House Intelligence Committee member Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) told reporters upon exiting a caucus meeting to discuss the historic move.

The speaker's change of heart was long in coming and fed by an array of new factors:

Groundswell from Democrats in swing seats: Over 20 Democrats — many of whom sit in competitive districts won by Trump in 2016 — changed their minds and came out in support of impeachment over the last 48 hours.

An overwhelming majority: As of this morning, 198 House Democrats have called for an impeachment inquiry, according to my colleagues JM Rieger, Amber Phillips, and Kevin Schaul.

'Most understandable': Pelosi pointed out in an interview yesterday with The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg that the new allegations — unlike, perhaps, the web of complicated charges in Robert S. Mueller III's report — could be clearer to the American public, which is so far not behind impeachment.

She said: “This is about the Constitution of the United States and we have many other, shall we say, candidates for impeachable offense in terms of the Constitution, we would say … but this one is the most understandable by the public. And it's really important to know this. It is — there is no requirement there be a quid pro quo in the conversation. If the President brings up he wants them to investigate something, that's to — and — of his political opponent, that is self-evident that it is not right,” Pelosi explained.

And it's really important to know this. It is — there is no requirement there be a quid pro quo in the conversation. If the President brings up he wants them to investigate something, that's to — and — of his political opponent, that is self-evident that it is not right,” Pelosi explained. The bottom line: “We don't ask foreign governments to help us in our elections,” Pelosi concluded.

The Trump factor: Unlike other controversies plaguing the Trump White House, the president himself has suggested he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden multiple times.

“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don’t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” Trump told reporters on Sunday morning. “And Ukraine, Ukraine’s got a lot of problems.”

“NO quid pro quo”: In a series of tweets yesterday afternoon, Trump insisted his July 25 call with Zelensky was “very friendly and totally appropriate” and that there was “NO quid pro quo!” Pelosi, however, made clear in her Atlantic interview “the quid pro quo is not essential to an impeachable offense.”

In a series of tweets yesterday afternoon, Trump insisted his July 25 call with Zelensky was “very friendly and totally appropriate” and that there was “NO quid pro quo!” Pelosi, however, made clear in her Atlantic interview “the quid pro quo is not essential to an impeachable offense.” Key: “The president of the United States admitted that he spoke to the president of a foreign country — that would be Ukraine — about something that would assist him in his election, Pelosi told reporters, according to Politico's Kyle Cheney, Heather Caygle, and John Bresnahan. “So that has changed everything.”

Behind the scenes: Rachael, Mike and Karoun report that Pelosi and Trump spoke on Tuesday morning in a conversation in which Pelosi informed Trump of her decision to launch an impeachment inquiry.

“Trump insisted he had nothing to do with his administration’s refusal to share with Congress an intelligence community whistleblower complaint about his actions, according to individuals familiar with the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity to frankly describe the conversation,” per Rachael, Mike, and Karoun.

Pelosi replied that Trump had the power to turn over the complaint and challenged him to do so: “I said, ‘Well, then undo it.’ Undo it. Because you are asking the DNI to break the law. I mean, it’s just outrageous.”

Public polling?: Voters, to this point haven't been behind an impeachment inquiry. But the impact of the fast-moving Ukraine developments haven't yet been tested, said one Democratic pollster.

Democratic pollster Geoff Garin told Power Up in an email that while he doesn't have any new numbers “they wouldn’t mean all that much now anyway — this is a quickly moving target.”

Adopted by Unanimous Consent: S.Res.325 - Transmission of Whistleblower Complaint:

NEXT STEPS: “White House and intelligence officials were working out a plan on Tuesday to release a redacted version of the whistle-blower complaint that helped ignite the impeachment drive against President Trump and to allow the whistle-blower to speak with congressional investigators, people briefed on the matter said,"" the New York Times's Michael Schmidt, Julian Barnes and Maggie Haberman report.

“People familiar with the situation said the administration was putting the complaint through a declassification process and planned to release a redacted version within days,” Schmidt, Barnes and Haberman report of the complain that was filed on Aug. 12.

Even the GOP-controlled Senate — in a rare bipartisan moment — voted unanimously for the whistleblower complaint to be turned over to the Senate Intelligence Committee.

— in a rare bipartisan moment — voted unanimously for the whistleblower complaint to be turned over to the Senate Intelligence Committee.

“House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff said Tuesday that the lawyers had contacted the panel and testimony could be 'as soon as this week,'"" per the Associated Press.

At The White House

RUDY'S SHADOW UKRAINE AGENDA: “President Trump’s attempt to pressure the leader of Ukraine followed a months-long fight inside the administration that sidelined national security officials and empowered political loyalists — including the president’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani — to exploit the U.S. relationship with Kiev, current and former U.S. officials said,” my colleagues Greg Miller, Josh Dawsey, Paul Sonne and Ellen Nakashima report.

“The sequence, which began early this year, involved the abrupt removal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, the circumvention of senior officials on the National Security Council, and the suspension of hundreds of millions of dollars of aid administered by the Defense and State departments — all as key officials from these agencies struggled to piece together Giuliani’s activities from news reports.”

“Several officials described tense meetings on Ukraine among national security officials at the White House leading up to the president’s phone call on July 25, sessions that led some participants to fear that Trump and those close to him appeared prepared to use U.S. leverage with the new leader of Ukraine for Trump’s political gain.”

“Rudy — he did all of this,” one U.S. official told my colleagues. “This s---show that we’re in — it’s him injecting himself into the process.”

one U.S. official told my colleagues. Read the full story here.

From the mayor: Giuliani responded to the story in a memorable appearance on Fox News last night where he claims that the State Department directed him to contact Ukrainian officials about Biden.

“I never talked to a Ukrainian official until the State Department called me and asked me to do it. And then I reported every conversation back to them. Laura, I’m a pretty good lawyer, just a country lawyer, but it’s all right here, right here. The first call from the State Department,” Giuliani told host Laura Ingraham, brandishing his cellphone to say he had proof of the contact.

How it all unfolded: Support for impeachment was not inevitable.

As our colleagues documented, the push began with the lonely Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) in 2017. Trump's actions, Mueller's Russia investigation and, finally, the whistleblower brought along successive waves of converts and increasingly a broader swath of the Democratic caucus.

Not even two years after Green's first efforts, they are now almost 200 strong.

Prior to Mueller's report being released, supporters were from some of the most liberal districts:

The redacted report's release in mid-April, Mueller's initial statement in late May and, finally, his testimony in late July began to broaden the base:

The Campaign

HOW THE 2020 CANDIDATES REACTED: Biden is not quite there yet, but he moved a lot closer toward endorsing an impeachment inquiry, our colleagues Matt Viser, Colby Itkowitz and Cleve R. Wootson Jr. report. As the early leader in the field, the former vice president’s opposition to impeachment has for months stood in stark contrast to nearly every other major 2020 hopeful --- including the nine other candidates who joined him Sept. 12 on the debate stage.

“If he continues to obstruct Congress and flout the law, Donald Trump will leave Congress, in my view, no choice but to initiate impeachment,” Biden said in a brief statement from Wilmington, Del. “That would be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making.”

The rest of the field mostly reiterated their previous calls for impeachment.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) “would not say whether he would vote to convict Trump if articles of impeachment were before the Senate, explaining that he wanted to review evidence before concluding how he would vote,” our colleagues write.

“would not say whether he would vote to convict Trump if articles of impeachment were before the Senate, explaining that he wanted to review evidence before concluding how he would vote,” our colleagues write.

wrote on Twitter, “The impeachment inquiry must move forward with the efficiency and seriousness this crisis demands.” “To my former colleagues in Congress: Finish the job and impeach him,” former congressman Beto O’Rourke wrote on Twitter.

It will be interesting to watch the amount of pressure the group puts on Pelosi and House Democrats going forward. On Friday, Warren reiterated her call for impeachment that she first made in April by saying that Congress’ failure to act had made it “complicit,"" a statement that was widely viewed as a shot at Pelosi’s leadership.

The Policies

HOUSE HOLDS HEARING ON ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN: The Judiciary Committee will meet later this morning to consider the possibility of renewing the federal assault weapons ban, a controversial law passed during the 1990s that banned 19 types of semiautomatic firearms and magazines which held more than 10 rounds. But the law contained a sunset provision and Republicans were perfectly content to let it expire in 2004 --- Democrats also failed to make a serious push to renew it when they had control of Congress early in the Obama administration.

The witnesses: Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley, whose city was the site of a mass shooting in August that left nine people dead; Alejandro Rios Tovar, a surgeon at the University Medical Center of El Paso, which experienced its own mass shooting just 24 hours before Dayton that left 20 people dead; and Charlottesville Police Chief RaShall Brackney. Dianna Muller, a former Tulsa police officer who works with a group focused on encouraging female firearm owners to tell their stories, will testify. As will Amy Swearer, a Heritage Foundation legal policy analyst who has criticized similar efforts to renew the ban.

Who's not appearing: Nobody from the NRA, which fiercely fought such legislation.

Uphill battle: Rep. David Cicilline's bill to renew the ban has 211 Democratic co-sponsors and 1 Republican, Rep. Peter King (N.Y.), supporting it. That is tantalizingly close to the necessary 218, but as CNN's Ronald Brownstein and Aaron Kessler pointed out many of the holdouts come from the majority makers that flipped Republican-leaning districts in 2018. And the GOP-controlled Senate is disinclined to action as long as Trump hasn't put his cards on the table. (The White House has still not released its promised gun-control plan.)

We apologize for the delay.

THE BIG IDEA: If President Trump thought releasing the readout of his call with Ukraine’s president would break impeachment fever on Capitol Hill, he miscalculated.

The five-page summary released this morning intensified Democratic demands to see the entire whistleblower complaint. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), a member of Democratic leadership, said the president asking for Ukraine’s help to undermine his 2020 challenger is “a textbook abuse of power.” At a news conference, he said “the transcripts become exhibit A.”

According to the rough transcript, Trump told Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Attorney General Bill Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to investigate the conduct of Joe Biden and offered to meet with the new president at the White House after he promised to conduct such an inquiry. “I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it,” Trump said, according to the transcript, after asking for ""a favor."" (Here are seven additional takeaways, via Aaron Blake.)

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) urged fellow party leaders in a private meeting to keep the impeachment investigation narrowly focused on Trump and his dealings with his Ukrainian counterpart, per Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade.

Several Senate Republicans were stunned and questioned the White House’s judgment after it released the rough transcript, Robert Costa reports. “It remains troubling in the extreme. It’s deeply troubling,” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told reporters after reading the transcript.

-- “Senior Justice Department officials said the director of national intelligence referred the concerns about the call to the Justice Department, after the intelligence community inspector general found that it was a possible violation of campaign finance laws that ban people from soliciting contributions from foreign sources. The inspector general later also referred the matter to the FBI,” Devlin Barrett, Matt Zapotosky, Josh Dawsey and Carol D. Leonnig report. “Career prosecutors and officials in the Justice Department’s criminal division then reviewed the transcript of the call, which they obtained voluntarily from the White House, and determined the facts ‘could not make out and cannot make out’ the appropriate basis for an investigation, a senior Justice Department official said. As part of their reasoning, Justice Department lawyers determined that help with a government investigation could not be considered ‘a thing of value’ under the law.”

-- What was released by the White House is a five-page summary of a 30-minute conversation. That means some of what was covered is likely not even in the memo. The document includes a disclaimer on the first page that it is “not a verbatim transcript of a discussion.”

“The text in this document records the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty Officers and NSC policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place,” it says. “A number of factors can affect the accuracy of the record, including poor telecommunications connections and variations in accent and/or interpretation.”

-- Richard Nixon released a transcript, too. After the revelation that he recorded Oval Office meetings, the then-president refused to turn over the tapes, claiming executive privilege, and fought subpoenas in court. Eventually, trying to quell a political firestorm, he offered transcripts – which he personally edited – and insisted they exonerated him. “I want there to be no question remaining about the fact that the president has nothing to hide in this matter,” Nixon said in April 1974. Months later, when House investigators listened to some of the audio, it turned out there were significant discrepancies and key phrases missing. Ever since Nixon resigned, the White House has, perhaps understandably, generally avoided recording presidential phone calls. That tradition explains why there’s apparently no recording on the American side of Trump’s July conversation.

-- Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill made clear even before the summary came out that the summary will not be enough to deter them from moving ahead with the impeachment inquiry. They argue that Trump does not need to have explicitly linked U.S. financial assistance to a Biden investigation for the call to represent a clear-cut abuse of power. “There is no requirement there be a quid pro quo in the conversation,” Pelosi said during a live event for the Atlantic. “You don't ask foreign governments to help us in our election. … I don't think there's a grasp on the part of this administration that the quid pro quo is not essential to an impeachable offense.”

-- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) says the whistleblower, whose identity remains unknown and is entitled to legal protections, wants to speak to members of his committee and has formally sought guidance from acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire about how he could do so. “We’re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower’s testimony as soon as this week,” Schiff tweeted. Lawyers for the whistleblower confirmed this.

-- The Senate passed a resolution last night, by unanimous consent and with no Republican objections, calling for the Trump administration to turn over the whistleblower complaint to the intelligence committees, as is required by law. The House plans to vote later today on a resolution condemning the administration’s refusal to provide the complaint. Meanwhile, Trump is scheduled to sit down with the Ukrainian president later today at the U.N. General Assembly. Maguire, the acting DNI, is scheduled to testify in open session tomorrow before the House Intelligence Committee and then in closed session before the Senate Intelligence Committee.

-- Pelosi personally informed Trump of her decision to move forward with an impeachment inquiry in a Tuesday morning phone call. “The president, in New York for the U.N. meeting, telephoned the speaker to discuss gun legislation, Pelosi told lawmakers in private meetings,” per Rachael Bade, Mike DeBonis and Karoun Demirjian. “The conversation, however, quickly turned to the president’s conversations with the Ukrainian leader. Trump insisted he had nothing to do with his administration’s refusal to share with Congress an intelligence community whistleblower complaint about his actions … Trump told Pelosi that he wasn’t the one blocking the complaint. … She responded that he had the power to fix it and challenged him to turn over the complaint.”

-- The New York Times reports that White House and intelligence officials are trying to hash out a plan to release a redacted version of the whistleblower report in a bid to quell calls for impeachment and sow Democratic divisions on the best path forward: “People familiar with the situation said the administration was putting the complaint through a declassification process and planned to release a redacted version within days,” Michael Schmidt, Julian Barnes and Maggie Haberman report. “The appearance that they were stonewalling Congress, in their view, could prove more damaging than the whistle-blower’s account. Mr. Trump also believes that the allegations about him are not nearly as damning as they have been portrayed and that disclosing them will undercut the impeachment drive, people close to the president said.”

-- A senior administration official told Politico that the White House is “preparing” to give Congress both the whistleblower complaint and the inspector general’s report by the end of this week. “The administration official stressed the decision and timing could change over the next few days,” Nancy Cook reports. “The format of presentation, or process of viewing the documents, wasn't decided. The president has agreed to the move, the official added.”

-- Even though the whistleblower complaint focused on the Trump call with Zelensky, officials familiar with its contents say that it includes references to other developments tied to the president, including efforts by Giuliani to insert himself into U.S.-Ukrainian relations. “Rudy — he did all of this,” one U.S. official said. “This s---show that we’re in — it’s him injecting himself into the process.” That anonymous quote comes from a story that posted last night by Greg Miller, Josh Dawsey, Paul Sonne and Ellen Nakashima.

“Trump’s attempt to pressure the leader of Ukraine followed a months-long fight inside the administration that sidelined national security officials and empowered political loyalists … to exploit the U.S. relationship with Kiev,” they report. “The sequence, which began early this year, involved the abrupt removal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, the circumvention of senior officials on the National Security Council, and the suspension of hundreds of millions of dollars of aid administered by the Defense and State departments — all as key officials from these agencies struggled to piece together Giuliani’s activities from news reports.

As those worries intensified, some senior officials worked behind the scenes to hold off a Trump meeting or call with [Zelensky] out of concern that Trump would use the conversation to press Kiev for damaging information on Trump’s potential rival in the 2020 race …

“U.S. officials described an atmosphere of intense pressure inside the NSC and other departments since the existence of the whistleblower complaint became known, with some officials facing suspicion that they had a hand either in the complaint or in relaying damaging information to the whistleblower … One official — speaking, like others, on the condition of anonymity — described the climate as verging on ‘bloodletting.’ … Trump has fanned this dynamic with his own denunciations of the whistleblower and thinly veiled suggestions that the person should be outed. … Trump’s closest advisers, including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who was ordered by Trump to suspend the aid to Ukraine, are also increasingly targets of internal finger-pointing. Mulvaney has agitated for foreign aid to be cut universally but has also stayed away from meetings with Giuliani and Trump …

“Then-national security adviser John Bolton was outraged by the outsourcing of a relationship with a country struggling to survive Russian aggression … But by then his standing with Trump was strained, and neither he nor his senior aides could get straight answers about Giuliani’s agenda or authority … Giuliani told The Post that one of his calls with a top Ukrainian aide was partially arranged by Kurt Volker, a State Department official, and that he briefed the department afterward. ‘We had the same visibility as anybody else — watching Giuliani on television,’ a former senior official said. Officials at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev were similarly deprived of information, even as they faced questions from Ukrainians about whether Giuliani was a designated representative.”

-- Giuliani had an outburst on Fox News last night when a fellow panelist was talking over him. “Shut up, moron,” Giuliani shouted on “The Ingraham Angle,” yelling at liberal radio host Christopher Hahn. “Shut up. You don’t know what you’re talking about.” (Allyson Chiu)

DEMOCRATIC DIVISIONS REMAIN OVER IMPEACHMENT:

-- Pelosi’s declaration left unsettled key questions about how that investigation will unfold. Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade explore some of them: “How sweeping will the probe be? How long will it last? Who will conduct it? And will Pelosi’s unilateral pronouncement — which was delivered with no immediate plans to ratify it with a House vote — do anything to change the course of existing investigations that have hit a stone wall of White House resistance? … The lack of detail about the road ahead, according to interviews with more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers and aides, reflected both the speed with which once-wavering Democrats unified behind a formal impeachment probe — and the continuing divisions among them on how it should be conducted. …

“[T]he House Judiciary Committee will continue playing the lead role in the proceedings, despite the desire of some Democrats to involve a broader swath of lawmakers and to at least partly sideline Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), the panel’s fervently pro-impeachment chairman. In the days leading up to Tuesday’s announcement, Pelosi explored potentially establishing a special ‘select’ committee, with members handpicked by House leaders, but backed away from that idea after the dispute generated protests from liberals and threatened to divide the caucus along ideological lines. … The past two presidential impeachment processes, involving [Nixon] and Bill Clinton, included votes of the full House authorizing the Judiciary Committee to formally investigate. There are no plans for such a vote now … That is a question likely to be litigated in the courts. …

“Meanwhile, an even more fundamental dispute lingered — one that may not be resolved any time soon. Many Democrats are urging that the inquiry focus solely on the present outcry … and not on other alleged abuses, such as the potential obstruction of justice detailed by [Mueller], episodes of congressional stonewalling and instances of bigotry. More than 30 Democratic lawmakers announced support for impeachment just this week, many of them Democratic ‘frontliners’ in vulnerable districts who said that the Ukraine allegations prompted them to speak out. … ‘This should be a very distinct procedure relative to this allegation, rather than the whole basket,’ said Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), a freshman who backed impeachment proceedings Monday after months of resisting pressure to take that step.

“But Pelosi’s involvement of other committees besides the Judiciary, Foreign Affairs and Intelligence panels with direct jurisdiction over the Ukraine matter suggest the impeachment brief could go much wider. The Financial Services Committee, for instance, is probing Trump’s real estate dealings; the Ways and Means Committee is seeking Trump’s tax returns; and the Oversight and Reform Committee is investigating whether Trump is using the presidency for self-enrichment. ‘I see the most recent issue as one issue among many issues,’ said Rep. Al Green (D-Tex.), who has pushed for Trump’s impeachment for two years, forcing multiple unsuccessful votes on removing Trump over alleged instances of bigotry.”

-- Our latest whip count: 198 House Democrats now publicly support opening an impeachment inquiry. That includes 22 of the 24 Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee. Fifty-seven Democrats endorsed proceedings in a period of 24 hours:

THE POLITICS OF IMPEACHMENT:

-- House Democrats have crossed the Rubicon, and nobody really knows where it will lead. “I can’t tell you what will come from this. I don’t think anybody can,” said Dan Sena, who was executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2018. “But it is definitely going to be an X-factor going into the 2020 election.” Michael Scherer talked to several other political professionals:

Democratic strategists hope the fact pattern behind Trump’s communications with Ukraine is far more direct and damning than the complex stories of potential obstruction contained in Bob Mueller's report: “This is a more supportable narrative about his conduct,” said pollster Geoff Garin. “Trump has already admitted to most of the egregious behavior. He is out of the business of claiming nothing happened.""

“This is a more supportable narrative about his conduct,” said pollster Geoff Garin. “Trump has already admitted to most of the egregious behavior. He is out of the business of claiming nothing happened."" GOP strategists hope impeachment would gin up their voters in 2020: “There is nothing that will do more for Republican turnout than this. And the last couple of presidential elections have all been turnout elections,” said Jim McLaughlin, a pollster working on the Trump reelection effort.

-- A Quinnipiac poll that was in the field from this past Thursday through Monday found that 57 percent of voters believe Trump should not be impeached. John Wagner reports: “Among Democrats, 73 percent support impeachment, while 21 percent are opposed. Among Republicans, only 4 percent support impeachment, while 95 percent are opposed. Trump’s overall job approval rating remains in the range it has for nearly his entire presidency, with 40 percent of voters approving of how he is handling his job, and 55 percent saying they disapprove.”

-- This explains why many moderate Democrats still remain cautious. For example, Rep. Sharice Davids (D-Kan.) – who picked up a Republican seat in the Kansas City suburbs last year – expressed support for Pelosi’s pronouncement last night but carefully avoided using the word “impeachment” in her statement. (K.C. Star)

-- Biden is mostly alone in the Democratic presidential field in not calling for the House to begin an immediate impeachment inquiry. Speaking in Delaware, the former vice president called on Congress to begin proceedings if the White House continues stalling lawmakers' investigations. ""Biden, who spoke for several minutes and left without taking questions, said that if Trump doesn’t comply with Congress, it will be forced to begin impeachment hearings,"" Matt Viser, Colby Itkowitz and Cleve Wootson Jr. report:

Bernie Sanders would not say whether he would vote to convict Trump if articles of impeachment come before the Senate, saying he wants to review evidence before making a decision. He also reserved judgment about whether Hunter Biden’s conduct is fair game. ""I don’t know enough at this point to make any definitive statement,"" he said in Iowa.

He also reserved judgment about whether Hunter Biden’s conduct is fair game. ""I don’t know enough at this point to make any definitive statement,"" he said in Iowa. Elizabeth Warren said proceedings must begin now.

said proceedings must begin now. Pete Buttigieg , who has been more cautious on the question, said Trump “has made it clear he deserves to be impeached.”

, who has been more cautious on the question, said Trump “has made it clear he deserves to be impeached.” Beto O’Rourke called on his former House colleagues to “finish the job and impeach him.”

called on his former House colleagues to “finish the job and impeach him.” Hillary Clinton also changed her mind, saying she’s now in favor of moving toward impeachment of a president she described as a “corrupt human tornado.” “I did not come to that decision easily or quickly,” she said, “but this is an emergency as I see it.”

-- The impeachment debate will effectively freeze the 2020 campaign, predicts ABC News political director Rick Klein: “It would all play out against an inconvenient political timeline, with hearings in the House and a potential trial in the Senate almost certainly extending well into the winter. That's the precise time that campaigning is most intense, with primary voting beginning in February. For the six senators and two sitting House members running for president, that could make for far more time spent at the day job in Washington than anticipated. Long-developed plans for policy rollouts and potential breakout moments could wind up subsumed by the news.""

-- The Trump reelection campaign immediately tried to turn the impeachment inquiry into a fundraising opportunity. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: “Emails, texts, tweets and a video directed his supporters to a new Republican portal designed to capi­tal­ize on Trump’s army of online donors. ‘The Democrats thrive on silencing and intimidating his supporters, like YOU, Friend. They want to take YOUR VOTE away,’ read an email to supporters Tuesday afternoon. ‘President Trump wants to know who stood with him when it mattered most.’ … The appeals on Tuesday called on his supporters to join an ‘Official Impeachment Defense Task Force’ made up of ‘only President Trump’s most LOYAL supporters,’ with suggested donations ranging from $5 to the maximum $2,800, or $45 to show support for the 45th president.”

-- In public, Trumpworld is making the impeachment inquiry look like white noise. But in private, White House aides and allies are starting to feel anxious. Politico reports: “Few in the White House or the wider Trump orbit have privately defended Trump’s call … ‘The president’s strategy on these matters has always been pretty clear: Never back up and go forward. He learned that from Page Six,’ said Newt Gingrich, an informal adviser to Trump who served as House speaker during Republicans’ impeachment inquiry of President Bill Clinton. … The White House is betting Trump can ride out this ‘outrage du jour,’ as one senior administration official called it, and move on just as he has skated through the … dozens of other threats to his presidency. … But current and former administration aides believe Trump will view the latest impeachment inquiry as a major blow to his ego — and the proceedings will likely distract him, cloud all his meetings and halt any agenda for this fall, including the passage of a major trade bill heading into an election year.”

-- The world is reacting warily to the specter of impeachment. Rick Noack and David Crawshaw report: Some experts said it “would have little effect on hot-button issues such as the trade dispute with China or his promises on Brexit, while others predicted that increased domestic pressure would force Trump to seek a quick foreign-policy breakthrough… The developments weighed on financial markets, already hit by concerns about global economic weakness and the impact of the U.S.-China trade dispute. Stocks were lower across Asia and Europe, but the dollar recovered earlier losses.”

COMMENTARY:

-- “I’m a Republican. Let’s force the question of impeachment with the GOP,” writes veteran GOP strategist Mike Murphy: “In the wake of the president’s actions on Ukraine, the Republican Party and the officials who lead it must be brutally marked to market on the issue of Trump’s fitness for office. This test would create an existential question for every Republican senator and representative: Why am I here? To serve my future or my country?”

-- “This isn’t just another spat. Trump compromised our security for his gain,” writes columnist David Ignatius: “Not for the first time, Trump was putting himself above his country. … Trump’s interruption of the delivery of essential military equipment was especially troubling for members of Congress who have served overseas with the U.S. military or intelligence agencies and know how precious our promises are.”

-- “If we legitimize Trump’s behavior, it will be open season on our politics,” writes columnist Robert Kagan: “Consider what it will mean if we decide that what Trump and Giuliani have already acknowledged doing in Ukraine becomes an acceptable practice for all future presidents … Every government in the world wishing to influence U.S. foreign policy will have an incentive to come to a sitting president with information on his or her potential political opponents.”

-- “Republicans (who decided perjury about sex was impeachment-worthy, and who thought it an abuse of power to defer deportations of certain illegal immigrants) must now decide whether to accept Trump’s standard as proper for future presidents,” writes columnist Dana Milbank.

-- Conservative columnist Max Boot identifies seven reasons why he thinks Trump should be impeached:

He obstructed the administration of justice.

He failed to defend America from foreign election interference.

He attempted to investigate and prosecute his political opponents.

He failed to produce papers and testimony as duly directed by Congress.

He conspired with Michael Cohen to conceal alleged extramarital relationships.

He misused his emergency powers to spend funds on a border wall.

He retains ownership of a global business empire, which allows him to benefit from dealings with foreign and state governments.

-- But Biden sill could wind up being the principal casualty, Pat Buchanan writes, hopefully, in the New Hampshire Union Leader: “Calls are rising for Biden’s son to be called to testify before congressional committees. ... The charges and the countercharges will become what the campaign is all about.""

-- Democrats are upholding a double standard on Ukraine, chimes in conservative columnist Marc Thiessen.

-- Impeaching Trump could hurt the institution of the presidency, worries John Yoo, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the George W. Bush administration: “If Congress could regulate presidential discussions with foreign leaders, presidents and foreign leaders would speak less candidly or stop making the calls altogether. United States foreign policy — approved by the American people at each election — would be crippled.”

-- We should talk about how Ukrainians feel about this, says Alyona Getmanchuk, director of the New Europe Center, in the Times: “Ukraine remains in a precarious position. Crimea is still under Russian control, and the war in the east continues; the fight against corruption at home is also not yet won. In all of these matters, Ukraine is reliant on bipartisan American support, which is why our leadership is desperate to avoid becoming part of the American presidential campaign. Ukraine is now facing the prospect of becoming a double victim: on the one hand, a victim of [Vladimir] Putin’s aggression; on the other, a victim of Mr. Trump’s desire to be re-elected at any price.”

-- The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board calls this the Impeachment Congress: “Mr. Trump’s invitation to Mr. Zelensky to investigate Mr. Biden, if that’s what it was, showed bad judgment in our view … But bad judgment is not a crime, and voters may demand more to annul an election only months before they have a chance to render their own judgment about Mr. Trump’s behavior.""

-- Pelosi’s patience on impeachment has paid off, so far, CNN’s Michael Warren writes: “Democrats have now created the appearance that impeachment of Trump is a last resort, not a first resort. She divorced the process from the mess of the Mueller findings. And she allowed those moderate freshmen who built her majority, rather than the divisive members on the left, to lead on the issue.”

-- “Pelosi has to hope for the worst case for Trump,"" writes National Review executive editor Rich Lowry, ""because it’s going to be difficult to climb down from impeachment now.""

-- Fox News chief political analyst Brit Hume believes Pelosi has handled this cleverly: “It strikes me that the Speaker and the other leaders are under pressure from the left wing of the party and the leftists in their caucus -- who are numerous -- to move ahead here … I think [she’s] thinking that she needs to be responsive to the needs of her caucus -- look at what she did today, it was really quite clever if you think about it.”

Bijan Rafiekian leaves a court hearing last year in Washington. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP)

THERE’S STILL A BEAR IN THE WOODS:

-- A judge overturned a jury's verdict convicting Michael Flynn’s former business partner of illegally lobbying for Turkey, saying the evidence against him was “insufficient.” Rachel Weiner reports: “'The verdict was against the heavy weight of the evidence,’ Judge Anthony J. Trenga of the Eastern District of Virginia wrote in a 39-page opinion tossing Bijan Rafiekian’s convictions. The decision is another blow to efforts by the Justice Department to crack down on unregistered lobbying for foreign governments. … Trenga pointed to the fact that Flynn was not charged or implicated by prosecutors until the eve of trial as ‘particularly telling.’”

-- Tony Podesta, a longtime Democratic power broker, and Vin Weber, a Republican former congressman, said they were notified on Monday that federal prosecutors in Manhattan had closed the inquiry into work they did that benefited Ukrainian interests. It’s another reflection of the challenges facing prosecutors attempting to more aggressively pursue possible violations of foreign lobbying rules, Tom Hamburger and Matt Zapotosky report: “The decision to drop the investigation came weeks after a federal jury in Washington found former White House counsel Gregory B. Craig not guilty of lying to the Justice Department about his media contacts related to his work for the Ukrainian government. …

""Weber and Podesta were among several lobbyists and lawyers that (Paul) Manafort helped bring aboard as part of an effort to improve the image of the Ukrainian government between 2012 and 2014, according to Mueller’s report. Mueller ultimately referred the case involving the two men to federal prosecutors in New York. ... As the investigation proceeded, Podesta closed his iconic lobbying firm, the Podesta Group, in the fall of 2017. Weber left Mercury, a firm he had helped lead since 2011, in August.”

-- A federal judge rejected former Trump confidant Roger Stone’s request to suppress all evidence gathered through 18 search warrants at his November trial. Spencer S. Hsu reports: “Attorneys for Stone had argued that prosecutors illegally relied on unproven assumptions about Russia’s involvement and sought to force them to prove in court the role of Russian operatives in hacks on the Democratic National Committee and [Clinton’s] presidential campaign chairman, John Podesta, among others. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said Stone had ‘not come close’ to showing the government misled the magistrates or judges who approved the warrants, that federal agents knowingly or intentionally lied to them or that the warrants were premised on Russia’s role in the hacking.”

Students line up for school lunches at an elementary school in Canton, Miss. (Rogelio V. Solis/AP)

THE DOMESTIC AGENDA:

-- A new Trump administration proposal to limit the number of people who qualify for food stamps could end free school lunches for about 500,000 American children. Moriah Balingit reports: “The change, proposed over the summer, would cut an estimated 3 million people from the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. It is intended to eliminate eligibility for people who get food stamps because they have qualified for other forms of government aid, even though they may have savings or other assets. But the impact of the cuts is anticipated to go further: Children in those households could also lose access to free school lunches, since food stamp eligibility is one way students can qualify for the lunches.”

-- NASA is trying to land on the moon, and its biggest obstacle might be Congress. Christian Davenport reports: NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine, a Republican from Oklahoma, is seeking “votes in Congress for what could become one of the boldest human exploration endeavors NASA has undertaken in decades — the first return to the moon since the end of the Apollo era. … Bridenstine knows that before NASA builds the rockets, spacecraft and lunar landers needed for the mission, the agency must clear the political roadblocks that are every bit as daunting as the vacuum of space. While members of Congress love to say they support NASA — as they do lowering crime or boosting national security — getting them to increase the agency’s budget is another story. Traditionally, space does not equal votes in elections. And getting Democrats to support a project that, if successful, could be a legacy for the Trump administration is going to be a tough sell.”

-- The administration has granted few waivers to visitors blocked from entering the U.S. by the travel ban Trump imposed days after taking office, with officers arguing that people from five predominantly Muslim countries continue to pose a national security threat. Abigail Haulsohner reports: “Since the initial rollout, in early 2017, of what critics and federal judges have branded a ‘Muslim ban,’ the Trump administration has fielded approximately 72,000 visa applications from the citizens of Iran, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Syria, a U.S. State Department official told members of Congress on Tuesday. Approximately 10 percent of those applicants — 7,679 — have received waivers to enter the United States, according to Edward Ramotowski, deputy assistant secretary for visa services at the department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs, who testified during a House judiciary and foreign affairs subcommittee hearing.”

-- The chief executive of Juul Labs is stepping down amid outrage over the soaring use of teenage vaping. From the Times: “The executive, Kevin Burns, will be replaced by K.C. Croswaite, an executive from Altria, the major tobacco company that owns a 35 percent stake in Juul, the San-Francisco-based company. Juul also said it would end one of its campaigns, ‘Make the Switch,’ which the Food and Drug Administration had criticized as an effort to portray its e-cigarettes as safer than traditional cigarettes. The company also said it would not fight the Trump administration’s proposal to ban flavored e-cigarettes.”

-- Massachusetts will place a four-month ban on all sales of vaping products, the toughest state crackdown on e-cigarettes so far. Hannah Knowles reports: “Bans on sales of flavored vaping products took effect this month in New York and Michigan, and the Trump administration said it plans to enact a similar regulation at the federal level. Flavored products have attracted particular scrutiny from policymakers who say they are getting children hooked on nicotine. But Massachusetts would go beyond a flavor ban to also temporarily eliminate tobacco and marijuana e-cigarettes from the market. Officials say the halt will allow time to properly investigate a crisis that’s expanded to 530 cases in 38 states as of last week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.”

-- California health officials called on everyone to stop vaping immediately, per the Los Angeles Times: “‘We are seeing something that we have not seen before,’ said Dr. Charity Dean, California’s acting public health officer, in a statement. ‘There are numerous unknown factors at this time, and due to the uncertainty of the exact cause, it is our recommendation that consumers refrain from vaping until the investigation has concluded.’”

-- House Republicans are seriously considering relaxing term limits for committee chairmen. From Politico: “House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy floated the idea of changing the GOP’s long-standing rule that allows members to be the top Republican on a committee for only three terms, regardless of whether they serve in the majority or minority. One idea that was suggested, according to multiple Republican sources who attended the meeting, is allowing a lawmaker’s term as ranking member to not count the same as a chairmanship.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- A new United Nations climate report finds that massive change is already here for the world’s oceans and frozen regions. Chris Mooney and Brady Dennis report: “Wednesday’s report on the world’s oceans, glaciers, polar regions and ice sheets finds that such effects only foreshadow a more catastrophic future as long as greenhouse gas emissions remain unchecked. Given current emissions levels, a number of serious impacts are essentially unavoidable, says the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Extreme floods that have historically struck some coastal cities and small island nations once every 100 years will become an annual occurrence by 2050, according to the IPCC. In addition, if emissions continue to increase, global sea levels could rise by more than three feet by the end of this century — around 12 percent higher than the group estimated as recently as 2013. Melting glaciers could harm water supplies, and warming oceans could wreck marine fisheries. … More than 100 scientists from around the world contributed to the latest report...""

-- A glacier on Mont Blanc could collapse. From the BBC: “About 250,000 cubic metres of ice are in danger of breaking away from the Planpincieux glacier on the Grandes Jorasses peak ... The mayor of the nearby town of Courmayeur said global warming was changing the mountain. … The glacier, in the Glarus Alps, has shrunk to a tiny fraction of its original size. Scientists say it has lost at least 80% of its volume just since 2006, a trend accelerated by rising global temperatures.”

-- The Trump administration declared there’s no “international right to abortion” during the U.N. General Assembly, calling on other countries to join a coalition pushing the elimination of what it calls “ambiguous” terms and expressions, such as sexual and reproductive health, from U.N. documents. Ariana Eunjung Cha reports: “Earlier this year, HHS officials began meeting with representatives from other countries, urging them to join a new international coalition that would focus on the value of the family, and which would not condone harmful sexual risks for young people, or promote abortion as a means of family planning.

“Other countries, civil society and women’s rights groups have expressed alarm at the efforts and accused the United States of aligning with countries like Saudi Arabia and Sudan with poor human rights records and, also, of putting unfair pressure on poor countries that depend on U.S. aid.""

-- Trump condemned globalism during his address to the General Assembly. Anne Gearan and Seung Min Kim report: “Trump read his address in a somber monotone, rarely punctuating words or pausing for emphasis, but his message for the 74th session of the annual gathering of world leaders was clear as he argued that a view of the world as a global commons had ‘exerted a religious pull over past leaders’ at the expense of their own nations. … In his 37-minute address, Trump stressed that all nations must take care of themselves first while adding that the United States would get involved abroad only when its own interests were threatened. He also used his platform Tuesday to take a hard line against Iran...""

-- Trump also heaped praise on Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi during UNGA. At home, Sissi faces mass protests to step down from human rights activists. Siobhán O’Grady reports: “When asked Monday whether he was concerned about the anti-Sissi demonstrations, Trump shrugged the suggestion aside. ‘Demonstrations? No, everybody has demonstrations,’ he told reporters ... ‘Egypt has a great leader. He’s highly respected; he’s brought order. Before he was here, there was very little order. There was chaos. So I’m not worried about that.’ … Trump and Sissi’s meeting Monday came just days after viral videos from a former government contractor alleging Sissi was complicit in a large-scale corruption scandal provoked protests in Egypt. People took to the streets in Cairo and elsewhere Friday, chanting, ‘Rise up, fear not, Sissi must go.’ The protests were relatively small but significant because such concerted public displays against Sissi are rare.”

-- Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said the Amazon isn’t on fire, rejecting calls for foreign intervention. Marina Lopes reports: “The Amazon isn’t in flames, he told [UNGA] in New York, but brimming with riches. And Brazil will decide how to develop it. ‘We are open to explore our potential in a sustainable way, through partnerships that add value,’ Bolsonaro said. It was his first address on the world stage since the worst fires in a decade hit the Amazon this year. In a speech peppered with references to God, socialism and patriotism, he said foreign powers with an eye on Brazil’s natural riches ‘have an interest in keeping indigenous people living like cave men.’”

-- Venezuela’s ex-intelligence chief said he told President Nicolás Maduro about Colombian guerrilla camps in Venezuela. Anthony Faiola reports: Gen. Manuel Ricardo Cristopher Figueroa said he hand-delivered reports including the rough locations and activities of Colombian drug cartels and criminal gangs operating on Venezuelan soil. “‘They never took action,’ he said. ‘You could say that Maduro is a friend of the guerrillas.’ Maduro, the head of Venezuela’s socialist government, has long voiced ideological sympathy for Colombia’s leftist guerrillas. But he has denied claims by Colombian officials and others that his government has cooperated with them. … The classified report ... offers new allegations about the scope of Maduro’s personal knowledge of the guerrillas’ presence and activities at a time when tensions in the region are rapidly escalating. “

-- Hong Kong police are waging a war on facts as protests on the island continue. David Crawshaw and Timothy McLaughlin report: “The ‘yellow object’ lying on the ground had a distinct shape, evident in the video footage that surfaced later. Certainly, a good portion of it was bright yellow. It appeared to have arms. And two protrusions that resembled legs. Someone had dressed the object in dark-colored shorts. As Hong Kong police officers swarmed over the object and roughed it up in a dark alley, it appeared to squirm. … With Beijing asserting increasing control over the city’s institutions and Hong Kong’s leader refusing to allow an independent inquiry into police behavior, authorities here appear not to fear the consequences of violating protocols intended to uphold the rule of law. Instead, their approach this week was to obfuscate. Asked Monday about the incident in Yuen Long, an outlying area of Hong Kong, acting senior superintendent Vasco Williams said footage showed an ‘officer kicking a yellow object,’ not a man lying on the ground.”

Haley Stevens (D-Mich.), center, celebrates after being sworn in by Nancy Pelosi in January. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)

THE BIG IDEA: Several House Democrats facing tough reelection fights next year in districts that Donald Trump carried in 2016 are expressing openness to impeachment for the first time, a major tipping point that reflects their palpable outrage over the president’s purported conduct toward Ukraine and will intensify pressure on their colleagues who hold safer seats to follow suit.

The latest is freshman Rep. Haley Stevens of Michigan. She picked up an open seat in the Detroit suburbs last fall that Republicans had held for decades. Trump won the district three years ago by 4.4 percentage points. In a statement sent after 7 a.m., Stevens said she did not get to this point lightly – “but rather out of a sober obligation to stand up for the rule of law and our national security.”

“Over the last several days, I have been deeply alarmed by reports of serious abuse of power by President Trump,” Stevens wrote. “The President is alleged to have used the power of his office to pressure a foreign head of state for his own personal political gain. Furthermore, the Director of National Intelligence continues to illegally withhold information about this matter from Congress. If investigations confirm recent reports, these actions represent impeachable offences that threaten to undermine the integrity of our elections and jeopardize the balance of power within the federal government.”

Stevens’s announcement follows a new Washington Post report that Trump ordered his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to hold back almost $400 million in military aid for Ukraine at least a week before a phone call in which the president is said to have pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden’s son. That’s according to three senior administration officials.

Trump confirmed this morning at the United Nations that he withheld military aid from Ukraine but insisted that he did so because he wanted other European countries to chip in. “But very importantly, Germany, France, other countries should put up money, and that’s been my complaint from the beginning,” the president told reporters at the United Nations.

We’ve been hearing lots of metaphors from plugged-in Democratic strategists we’ve spoken with over the past 24 hours like “the dam is breaking” and “the train is leaving the station.” Or, as Democratic pollster Geoff Garin put it, “The horse is out of the barn. Saddle up.”

Stevens is the third Michigan congresswoman to express support for moving toward an impeachment inquiry in a period of just 12 hours. As of 10 a.m., 148 House Democrats have now publicly expressed support for at least opening an impeachment inquiry into whether Trump committed “high crimes and misdemeanors.” (Follow our running whip count here.)

Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who represents a district that Trump carried by 6.7 points in 2016, which stretches from the northern Detroit suburbs to the state capital in Lansing, submitted an op-ed to The Washington Post last night with six other House freshmen who have extensive national security experience. They agreed that, if the allegations against Trump are true, “we believe these actions represent an impeachable offense.” And they’re calling on their colleagues to use all congressional authorities, including impeachment hearings, to “address these new allegations, find the truth and protect our national security.”

Slotkin, who toppled Republican incumbent Mike Bishop in the midterms, is a former CIA officer who was personally involved in briefings for both George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Fluent in Arabic, she was a Middle East analyst for the agency and deployed to Iraq for three tours over five years. Then she became the director for Iraq policy on the National Security Council, moved to the State Department and finally the Pentagon. (I profiled her in a 2017 Big Idea.)

The other signatories are Reps. Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia. “We have devoted our lives to the service and security of our country, and throughout our careers, we have sworn oaths to defend the Constitution of the United States many times over. Now, we join as a unified group to uphold that oath as we enter uncharted waters and face unprecedented allegations against President Trump,” the seven wrote. (One of the members, Crow from the Denver suburbs, endorsed impeachment in July. But the others had all previously held off.)

Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), the widow of the legendary John Dingell, has her finger on the pulse of the caucus better than all but a handful of her colleagues. She’s been exceedingly cautious on impeachment – arguing that it would “tear the country apart” – until last night. “This country is divided. We cannot be divided on the rule of law. As an elected official my oath is to protect national security and the Constitution,” she tweeted at 10:22 p.m. “After recent revelations, I support an impeachment inquiry because we must follow the facts and hold the President accountable.”

Because of Rep. Justin Amash, an independent from the other side of Michigan who left the GOP on July 4 after endorsing impeachment, Democrats can afford to lose 18 or so votes and still pass any article of impeachment. Republicans who control the Senate would then most likely acquit Trump during an ensuing trial in that body. Nancy Pelosi, though, wants something as close to unanimity in her caucus as possible and she’s been afraid to endanger her front-line members like Stevens.

Many prominent impeachment skeptics in the Democratic caucus have been friends and loyalists of the speaker who hold solidly blue seats but defer to her political judgment. That’s why it’s a huge deal that Pelosi loyalists have moved toward impeachment over the past 24 hours. The most prominent of these is Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut.

In a lengthy statement last night, she said Trump’s “reckless abuse of power” is a “turning point.” She explained that her thinking changed and impeachment “may be the only recourse Congress has” to hold Trump accountable. “Congress must meet this pivotal moment in our nation’s history with decisive action,” she wrote.

Anyone who knows DeLauro knows she doesn’t put that statement out before checking with Pelosi. And another member from Connecticut who is close to Pelosi, Rep. John Larson of the Hartford area, piled on, as well. “The Director of National Intelligence must comply with the law on Thursday,” he tweeted. “If not, the Trump Administration has left Congress with no alternative but for the House to begin impeachment proceedings, which I will support.”

-- Thursday is shaping up to be a huge day on Capitol Hill. Acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire is scheduled to testify in open session on Thursday before the House Intelligence Committee and in closed session before the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Pelosi has given the administration until Thursday to turn over the whistleblower’s complaint, which set in motion this firestorm. Under federal law, any matter deemed of “urgent concern” by the inspector general – which this has been – is supposed to be shared with Congress. But the Trump administration is refusing to comply with that legal requirement.

Separately, three House Democratic chairmen threatened to subpoena documents pertaining to Ukraine that the administration has thus far declined to voluntarily hand over if they don’t get answers by Thursday. In a joint statement, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (N.Y.), Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (Calif.) and Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (Md.) gave Mike Pompeo until then to let their panels know if he intends to comply with a request they sent to the State Department two weeks ago.

-- More on the internal power dynamics: “Pelosi has been quietly sounding out top allies and lawmakers about whether the time has come to impeach,” Rachael Bade and Mike DeBonis report. “She was making calls as late as Monday night, and many leadership aides who once thought Trump’s impeachment was unlikely now say they think it’s almost inevitable. … [A]n official familiar with her thinking warned that just because she was considering impeachment didn’t mean it would happen right away. …

“Senior Democratic officials cautioned that no steps have been finalized, and there were still questions about timing and how to conduct the proceedings. Some Democrats, for example, want [Schiff] to have a role in whatever impeachment process moves ahead. Democratic leaders are also discussing the possibility of a special select committee that would combine House Judiciary with other panels such as Intelligence. …

“In the meantime, House leaders are planning to hold a vote on a resolution to either condemn Trump’s actions or express the sense of the House that the administration turn over the whistleblower complaint, a move liberals are already dismissing as insufficient. The language has not been finalized. … Impeachment dominated a meeting of chiefs of staff for lawmakers in competitive districts on Monday … [T]he session grew heated and angry, pitting those congressional aides who thought it was time to back impeachment against those who worry about the political fallout.”

-- Just as DeLauro and Larson came out in tandem, many other House Democrats have taken the impeachment plunge in pairs. I wrote in July about how both House members from New Hampshire endorsed an impeachment inquiry on the same afternoon. It happened again Monday in Minnesota. Two moderate Democrats from suburban districts in the Twin Cities, who both defeated Republican incumbents last year, issued strongly worded statements: Dean Phillips and Angie Craig.

-- Fresh details continue to trickle out about Trump’s role in freezing the money appropriated by Congress to help Ukraine defend itself against a revanchist Russia: “Officials at the Office of Management and Budget relayed Trump’s order to the State Department and the Pentagon during an interagency meeting in mid-July,” per Karoun Demirjian, Josh Dawsey, Ellen Nakashima and Carol Leonnig. “They explained that the president had ‘concerns’ and wanted to analyze whether the money needed to be spent. Administration officials were instructed to tell lawmakers that the delays were part of an ‘interagency process’ but to give them no additional information — a pattern that continued for nearly two months, until the White House released the funds on the night of Sept. 11. … There was concern within the administration that if they did not spend the money, they would run afoul of the law … Trump on Monday repeated his denial of doing anything improper …

“Trump’s allies have frequently said he has been better about distributing military aid, and specifically lethal aid, to Ukraine than his predecessor. Yet according to Democratic and Republican aides, no administration has withheld funds as long and as mysteriously as the Trump administration did this year since the United States began helping Ukraine fend off Russian-backed separatists in the country’s eastern provinces. …Withholding aid from foreign governments is something the president has frequently requested, such as with Central American countries when he said they were not doing their part to help the United States with immigrants amassing at the southern border. …

“Former national security adviser John Bolton wanted to release the money to Ukraine because he thought it would help the country while curtailing Russian aggression. But Trump has said he was primarily concerned with corruption. … Besides Bolton, several other administration officials said they did not know why the aid was being canceled or why a meeting was not being scheduled.”

MORE ON THE L’AFFAIRE UKRAINE:

-- Senate Republicans mostly dodged and deflected questions about the whistleblower complaint. Felicia Sonmez, DeBonis and Erica Werner report: “So far only one Republican in the Senate, Mitt Romney of Utah, has voiced concern about the president’s alleged actions … As they returned to the Senate on Monday, most Republicans instead dodged questions about the whistleblower complaint or said that it is an issue for the Senate Intelligence Committee to address. Some, such as Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), cast doubt on the allegations against Trump. … Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) disputed the use of the word ‘whistleblower’ to describe the person who revealed Trump’s phone call with (Volodymyr) Zelensky. … Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) mainly kept his focus on Biden, but he also suggested that Trump should release more details about his call with Zelensky. …

“Even Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), co-founder of the bipartisan Senate Whistleblower Protection Caucus, steered clear of addressing the allegations directly. In a statement, Grassley chided Democrats and the media for ‘rampant speculation’ but made no mention of Trump. … Later, in an exchange with reporters, Grassley declined to say whether he believes it is appropriate that Trump brought up Biden in his phone call with Zelensky.

“Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who also sits on the Intelligence Committee, said he believes Trump was wrong to have raised Biden in his call with Zelensky. But he dismissed calls for the president’s impeachment and said that so far no evidence has emerged of a quid pro quo offer by Trump of military aid in exchange for investigating Biden. ‘He simply raised the issue of Biden, and I don’t believe he should have done it,’ Rubio said. ‘But that in and of itself is not an impeachable offense, as some people claim. Now, the second thing you raise, [a quid pro quo], he denies, and so do the Ukrainians. If alternative information emerges, we have a different set of circumstances, but that’s not before us right now.’”

-- A counterpoint: “I think this is the most serious charge against the president, far more serious than what Bob Mueller dug or dragged up against him,” said Fox News senior judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano. “If you are the President of the United States and you are making a conversation that you know your intelligence community is listening to, of course you’re not going to articulate a quid pro quo. You’ll just make the quid pro quo happen.” (Daily Beast)

-- Former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, who is challenging Trump for the Republican nomination next year, accused Trump of committing “treason” with his conduct toward Ukraine. “Talk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S. election,” Weld said Monday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “It couldn’t be clearer, and that’s not just undermining democratic institutions. That is treason. It’s treason, pure and simple, and the penalty for treason under the U.S. code is death. That’s the only penalty. … The penalty under the Constitution is removal from office, and that might look like a pretty good alternative to the president if he could work out a plea deal.” (John Wagner)

-- A taste of the commentary in today’s papers:

Peter Baker in the New York Times: When Trump was accused of collaborating with Russia to influence the 2016 election, he traveled the country chanting “No collusion!” This time, he is basically saying, so what if I did?

The Post’s Editorial Board: “In Ukraine, Trump’s allies are corrupt oligarchs and Russian stooges.”

Post columnist Eugene Robinson says Trump is basically begging for impeachment, so just give it to him already. “Let me put the question another way to Republican senators: If Trump is willing to do this to Biden, what makes you think he would hesitate someday to do the same to you?”

Trump is basically begging for impeachment, so just give it to him already. “Let me put the question another way to Republican senators: If Trump is willing to do this to Biden, what makes you think he would hesitate someday to do the same to you?” Conservative Jonah Goldberg writes in the Los Angeles Times: “The most noxious part of Ukraine-Biden whistleblower affair is Team Trump thinks we’re all idiots.”

-- In Trump’s attacks on Biden, Democrats see a worrisome reprise of 2016. Matt Viser and Isaac Stanley-Becker report: “Biden’s campaign released videos last weekend to supporters and memos to reporters attempting to debunk the unsubstantiated claims Trump is promoting about Biden, his son Hunter and Ukraine’s freshly minted celebrity president. … But in a worrisome sign for Democrats anxious about reliving the party’s woes in 2016, the campaign’s counterattack is being drowned out by a pro-Trump network on social media and cable news that kicked into gear over the weekend, leveling accusations against Biden that have scant factual basis. The skirmish illustrated how ill-equipped Democrats, busy battling one another in the fight for the nomination, are to compete with Trump’s online megaphone, which includes not just his own Twitter feed and that of the Republican National Committee’s leadership, but also a regiment of conservative talking heads and highly active Internet trolls who have closed ranks around the president.”

-- To wit: Trump kept his focus on Biden at the U.N. on Monday. Sitting next to the Polish president, he claimed to reporters that, if Biden was a Republican, the media would have him in “the electric chair by right now.” Anne Gearan, Philip Rucker and Ashley Parker report: “‘The one who’s got the problem is Biden,’ Trump said. … At the United Nations, visiting diplomats were baffled by the sudden interjection of a complex Trump scandal that they found mystifying. ‘It puts foreign leaders in a difficult if not impossible position,’ said Richard N. Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. ‘How do you manage this complicated person who doesn’t play the game by the rules, and how do you somehow protect this important relationship? Everybody’s a bit wary.’”

WHILE YOU WERE IN YOUR MORNING MEETINGS:

-- Bernie Sanders proposed a wealth tax plan that’s more ambitious than what Elizabeth Warren calls for. “Billionaires should not exist,” the democratic socialist from Vermont tweeted this morning. “Warren’s plan calls for levying a 2 percent tax on wealth above $50 million, as well as a 3 percent tax on wealth above $1 billion,” Sean Sullivan and Jeff Stein note. “Sanders’s plan introduces a new 1 percent wealth tax on those earning over $32 million, and then increases that rate in a series of steps until it reaches 8 percent for those with more than $10 billion.”

-- The requirements to qualify for the November debate, announced by the Democratic National Committee, will imperil several more presidential campaigns. “Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), former Housing and Urban Development secretary Julián Castro, and businessmen Andrew Yang and Tom Steyer are among those who could fail to qualify for the November debates if they do not improve their polling in the coming weeks,"" Michael Scherer reports. ""Under the new November rules, candidates will have to demonstrate they have 165,000 unique donors, an increase of 30,000 from the October qualification levels. They will also have to meet a new polling criteria, either by scoring 3 percent in at least four national or state polls approved by the party, or by receiving at least 5 percent in two approved single-state polls from Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina or Nevada.”

THE DOMESTIC AGENDA:

-- The Office of the Special Counsel found that safety inspectors who worked on training requirements for Boeing 737 Max pilots were “underqualified” and that the Federal Aviation Administration misled Congress about the issue. Michael Laris reports: “The findings of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel … have added to questions about the effectiveness and transparency of safety oversight at the FAA, which has come under scrutiny after two new 737 Max jets it had certified as safe crashed in Indonesia and Ethi­o­pia, killing 346 people. … Special Counsel Henry J. Kerner wrote that the ‘FAA’s official responses to Congress appear to have been misleading in their portrayal of FAA employee training and competency.’ … The FAA’s Office of Audit and Evaluation ‘determined’ that safety inspectors for the Max ‘had not met qualification standards. Specifically, these [inspectors] had not received formal classroom training as required by’ two FAA orders, Kerner wrote.”

-- Federal prosecutors in California are conducting a criminal probe of e-cigarette maker Juul, the Wall Street Journal reports: ""The investigation by the U.S. attorney’s office of the Northern District of California is in its early stages ... The Federal Trade Commission, the Food and Drug Administration and several state attorneys general are investigating its marketing practices. … The San Francisco company has said it never marketed to teens and that its products are intended for adult cigarette smokers who want to switch.""

-- Playing hardball with money already approved by Congress, Trump's appointees at the Environmental Protection Agency are threatening to cut highway funding for California over its alleged “failure” to submit complete reports on its implementation of the Clean Air Act, the Sacramento Bee reports.

-- White House infighting, buoyed by a lack of presidential leadership, is thwarting action to address gun violence. From Politico: “On one side is Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and adviser, and Attorney General William Barr. Both are urging the president to back new firearms restrictions — including expanded background checks for gun sales — insisting he can be the leader who succeeds on an intractable issue that has bedeviled his predecessors and that he can win back moderate suburban voters in the process ... On the other side, a group that includes Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son and an avid hunter, and a top aide to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, is telling Trump he risks losing support from his conservative base if he pushes too aggressively on new gun control legislation ... Then there’s Trump, who has heard all of these arguments privately but publicly hasn’t committed to any plan.”

-- Rural public housing is falling apart under the Department of Agriculture’s watch, an NBC News investigation by Suzy Khimm found: “The residents of the Okeechobee Center in Belle Glade have mold creeping up their walls and ceilings riddled with holes. One mother reported roaches crawling over her infant’s face. Sewage was found leaking onto the ground outside the squat concrete buildings. These broken-down homes were built with money from U.S. taxpayers. The Okeechobee Center is part of the country’s biggest federal housing complex for farmworkers, and is supported by federal subsidies that help cover some poor families’ rent. Though the property is privately owned, it is supposed to be closely overseen by [USDA], which requires that the homes be ‘decent, safe and sanitary.’ But federal safeguards failed to prevent the property from descending into disrepair ... and now, as low-income housing like the Okeechobee Center is falling apart, the Trump administration wants to eliminate federal funding that could help fix it.”

-- The Trump administration will end the “catch and release” immigration policy that allowed immigrants claiming asylum to live in the United States while they waited for a court hearing, acting secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan said. From NPR: “In a statement issued by DHS, the agency outlined how it intends to carry out its new policy starting next week. ‘If migrant family units do not claim fear of return, they will be quickly returned to their country of origin, in close collaboration with Central American countries,’ the statement read. ‘If they do claim fear, they will generally be returned to Mexico under the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP).’ … McAleenan said the end of ‘catch and release’ is a reaction, in part, to the record number of 144,000 migrants apprehended or encountered at the southern border in May. He said that 72 percent were unaccompanied children or families.”

-- A team of USA Today reporters spent a week documenting the complex issues along the U.S.-Mexico border: “The week began with the death of a father and daughter. It will end with five more recorded deaths of migrants in the U.S. and untold deaths of others along the way. In that time, a young mother will become disillusioned by life in the U.S. and consider returning home. Federal authorities will release thousands of migrants, who will board buses and planes and scatter to cities across the United States. A shelter director will struggle to keep migrants in his care from being kidnapped or raped. A family in El Salvador will bury their loved ones. And still, each day, more migrants begin their journey north.”

-- A new project by the Guardian and the Marshall Project reveals how the United States built the world’s largest immigrant detention system. From “DETAINED”: “Immigrants, including asylum seekers and legal migrants, wait an average of more than four weeks to be released, though some have been held inside for years or even decades. Up to 2,500 are children and parents fleeing war and violence in their home countries. Thousands have alleged sexual and physical abuse inside the facilities. Forty years ago, this system did not exist. A modest system holding fewer than 3,000 migrants a day at the end of the 1970s, detention has now morphed into a sprawling machinery ensnaring immigrants across the country.”

-- Sen. Dan Sullivan (R), who is seeking reelection in Alaska, plans to once again vote to uphold Trump’s emergency declaration at the border, even though Sullivan's constituents will lose out on $102 million in construction projects as a result. He says he'll try to get Congress to reappropriate the money. “While I do not agree with the decision to defer any military construction in Alaska, it should be noted that the Democrats’ obstruction to fund much needed border security has forced the Trump administration to undertake these measures,"" Sullivan said in a statement to National Journal.

Sencillo subir al #Muro pero son muchos los peligros para nuestra gente. Derechos Humanos, principios y dignidad son innegociables #México🇲🇽 pic.twitter.com/9PExn3RlnV — Braulio Guerra (@BraulioPRI) March 2, 2017

-- A Mexican congressman climbed the U.S. border fence to illustrate why he believes Trump’s wall is “totally absurd.” From ABC News: “Braulio Guerra, a congressman from the state of Queretaro, tweeted photos and a video of himself perched atop a 30-foot tall fence that separates the Mexican border city of Tijuana from the U.S. ‘I was able to scale it, climb it, and sit myself right here,’ Guerra said in the video. ‘It would be simple for me to jump into the United States, which shows that it is unnecessary and totally absurd to build a wall.’ He adds, ‘It's easy, and it shows how unnecessary this project, this political rhetoric from Donald Trump, is.’""

­-- The asylum agreement between the U.S. and El Salvador implies that any asylum seeker who is not from El Salvador could be sent back to that country and forced to seek asylum there, per the Intercept: “Although officials have said that the agreements would apply to people who passed through El Salvador or Guatemala en route, the text of the agreements does not explicitly make that clear. ‘This agreement is so potentially sweeping that it could be used to send an asylum-seeker who never transited El Salvador to El Salvador,’ said Eleanor Acer, senior director of refugee protection at the nonprofit organization Human Rights First. … Last week, the Salvadoran newspaper El Faro reported that the country’s agency that reviews asylum claims only has a single officer. Meanwhile, though homicide rates have gone down in recent months — since outsider president Nayib Bukele took office in June — September has already seen an increase in homicides.”

DIVIDED AMERICA:

-- Chilling: An Army private at Fort Riley, Kan., has been arrested on charges of providing instructions on how to make bombs to people he met online, including an undercover FBI agent. Devlin Barrett reports: “Pfc. Jarrett William Smith, 24, was charged with distributing information related to explosives and weapons of mass destruction. In a criminal complaint, FBI officials said Smith provided bombmaking recipes in Facebook conversations. … The FBI was alerted to Smith’s alleged statements on Facebook and used a confidential informant as well as an undercover agent to engage in online discussions with him. Over time, FBI officials said, Smith offered bombmaking formulas to them both.

“Investigators found Smith had talked about joining a far-right Ukrainian paramilitary group in 2016 but ended up joining the U.S. Army a year later. In his group conversation, Smith wrote last month that he was looking for more ‘radicals’ like himself and talked about possibly killing far-left protesters known as ‘antifa,’ or possibly destroying cell towers or a local news station, authorities have alleged. That same month, he also talked about using a vehicle bomb to attack the headquarters of a major news network, according to the criminal complaint, although authorities did not identify the network in court papers. …

“After receiving a number of recipes, the undercover agent wrote to Smith: ‘Got a liberal texas mayor in my sights! Boom with that IED and that dude’s dead.’ FBI officials said Smith replied: ‘There ya go.’ The undercover agent asked, ‘You got anyone down in Texas that would be a good fit for fire, destruction, and death?’ Smith, according to the complaint, replied: ‘Outside of Beto? I don’t know enough people that would be relevant enough to cause a change if they died.’ … FBI agents arrested Smith on Saturday, and officials say that after his arrest he made several incriminating statements acknowledging he had shared bombmaking recipes with others.”

-- Facebook removed an “I Love America” page run by Ukrainians and featuring patriotic themes, rippling flags and pro-Trump memes. Craig Timberg reports: “Facebook took action against the page — which had 1.1 million followers — and several affiliated ones after a report in Popular Information, a politically themed online newsletter, detailed the page’s Ukrainian management and remarkable reach. The report said ‘I Love America’ was founded in 2017 but had moved heavily into pro-Trump content and conservative memes in recent weeks, building a huge audience in the process. Data showed the ‘I Love America’ pages collectively generated tens of millions of ‘interactions,’ a metric capturing how many people like, share or comment on a post, on par with several of the largest American news sites. ‘I Love America’ also reposted memes from Russian sources, such as the Internet Research Agency, the St. Petersburg troll farm that faces criminal charges stemming from its efforts to manipulate the 2016 presidential election.”

-- A West Palm Beach Marine Corps Reserve unit canceled its plans to celebrate the corps' 244th birthday at Mar-a-Lago due to bad optics, per the Palm Beach Post, even though no tax dollars would have been spent at the president’s club.

-- Abortion restrictions are costing states millions of dollars in taxpayer money, and it's going to reproductive rights groups they're trying to destroy. Dan Keating reports: “In the past four years, taxpayers in states trying to restrict abortion access have paid almost $10 million in attorney fees for abortion providers. That price tag is likely to keep growing as more abortion restrictions are challenged, including three in federal courts today. In an effort to overturn Roe v. Wade, these states are passing laws that severely limit or prohibit abortion, hoping that the courts will uphold them. But when, instead, those new laws are thrown out, the state has to pay the legal expenses for the abortion advocates. That puts taxpayers in the position of having to pay for the attorneys on both sides of abortion battles that often last for years.”

-- Daily 202 alumna Joanie Greve, now at the Guardian, reports from Topsham, Maine, on the continuing fallout for Susan Collins of her decisive vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh: “To some Maine voters – and especially Collins’ would-be Democratic opponents – the renewed focus on Kavanaugh has opened up a fresh opportunity to unseat Collins from her crucial Senate seat. … But Republicans are responding to Democratic enthusiasm by powering an even more impressive fundraising operation for Collins, who has not yet officially announced her intention to run for re-election. … Collins’ critics have been keen to point out how much of her money has come from outside Maine, arguing it represents her ideological drift away from the center of the political spectrum.”

-- The Florida police officer who arrested two 6-year-old children at their school was fired. Allyson Chiu reports: “Orlando Police Chief Orlando Rolón said Dennis Turner, who had been suspended after the incidents Thursday at a charter school, did not follow the department’s policy requiring approval from a supervisor for any arrest of a minor younger than 12. … The charges against the children have been dropped and state attorney Aramis D. Ayala said Monday that her office never intended to prosecute. …. Prosecutors said Monday that they intervened before either of the children were taken to a juvenile detention center. But the arrests have renewed scrutiny on policing in schools, which advocates and studies say often unfairly targets students of color and those with disabilities, landing the young people in handcuffs for routine misbehavior.”

-- John Gray, the Republican candidate for chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors in Virginia, deleted offensive tweets from his account, but his political opponent, Democrat Ann Wheeler, found them and shared them. Antonio Olivo reports: “Now, as Gray seeks the highest office in the rapidly diversifying county of 456,000 people, he finds himself doing exactly what he had hoped to avoid: Explaining why, in 2016, he tweeted the falsehood that Islam sanctions domestic abuse; why he wrote ‘a funny tweet’ that same year that said African Americans would stop ‘rioting’ and take a knee if someone played the national anthem; and why, in 2017, he called former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson ‘a moron’ for wishing Indians a happy Diwali. … In July, he posted a suggestion that Muslim hookah-bar owners should be forced to sell alcohol, even though doing so would be against their religion. Gray later said he regretted that tweet, which was intended as a reference to a legal battle involving a Colorado baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple based on his religious beliefs.""

Anti-Brexit supporters celebrate today outside the Supreme Court in London after the court ruled it was illegal for the prime minister to suspend Parliament. (Frank Augstein/AP)

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Britain’s Supreme Court ruled today that Prime Minister Boris Johnson suspended Parliament illegally. William Booth and Karla Adam report from London: “Opponents of the U.K. leader argued that the five-week suspension, just ahead of the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline, had the effect of preventing lawmakers from scrutinizing the executive. The case could have major implications for Brexit, as well as for the balance of power in Britain. … The ruling follows a three-day court hearing last week at the highest court, which was hastily convened to weigh contrasting judgments from English and Scottish courts on Johnson’s decision to suspend Parliament until mid-October. … Johnson, who is in New York for the U.N. General Assembly, told the Daily Telegraph on Monday that he would not resign if the court ruled against him, insisting that he was correct to suspend Parliament so the government could focus on its domestic agenda. ‘It is absolutely absurd to be totally fixated on Brexit,’ he said.”

-- Johnson is also under growing fire for his relationship with a young woman and alleged misuse of public money. From the Times: “In an article published this weekend, The Sunday Times of London reported that, when Mr. Johnson was mayor of London, his office directed tens of thousands of pounds in government money to a fledgling entrepreneur and close friend whose apartment he often visited during working hours. The entrepreneur, Jennifer Arcuri, an American and a former model, was 27 when she first crossed paths with Mr. Johnson in 2012. In the ensuing years, she was given coveted spots on trade missions with the mayor to Tel Aviv, New York, Singapore and Malaysia. … On a plane to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Mr. Johnson repeatedly refused to answer reporters’ questions about the article, including whether he was in a sexual relationship with Ms. Arcuri at the time.”

-- British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn accused Johnson of an “alleged abuse of power,"" but he's facing down a rebellion in his own ranks. William Booth reports: Corbyn won “enough support from his party members to continue his strategy of strategic ambiguity on whether to leave the European Union. In chaotic show of hands in a packed hall at Labour’s annual conference, delegates rejected a motion calling for the party to immediately declare itself against Brexit, as many grass-roots activists had rallied for. Instead, the party will follow Corbyn’s cautious plan to try to win the next general election and only then decide — by a special party conference — whether it will campaign to remain in or leave the E.U. in a new referendum.”

-- In a must-read op-ed highlighting the growing threat to journalists across the world, New York Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger reveals that a U.S. government official once alerted the newspaper that the Trump administration could be sitting on information regarding the potential arrest of a Times reporter based in Egypt: “The current administration … has retreated from our country’s historical role as a defender of the free press. Seeing that, other countries are targeting journalists with a growing sense of impunity. … To give you a sense of what this retreat looks like on the ground, let me tell you a story I’ve never shared publicly before. Two years ago, we got a call from a United States government official warning us of the imminent arrest of a New York Times reporter based in Egypt named Declan Walsh. Though the news was alarming, the call was actually fairly standard. Over the years, we’ve received countless such warnings from American diplomats, military leaders and national security officials. But this particular call took a surprising and distressing turn.

“We learned the official was passing along this warning without the knowledge or permission of the Trump administration. Rather than trying to stop the Egyptian government or assist the reporter, the official believed, the Trump administration intended to sit on the information and let the arrest be carried out. The official feared being punished for even alerting us to the danger. Unable to count on our own government to prevent the arrest or help free Declan if he were imprisoned, we turned to his native country, Ireland, for help. Within an hour, Irish diplomats traveled to his house and safely escorted him to the airport before Egyptian forces could detain him.”

-- Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist, had one question for the global leaders assembled at the United Nations: “How dare you?” Kayla Epstein and Juliet Eilperin report: “Thunberg chastised leaders for praising young activists like herself while failing to deliver on drastic actions needed to avert the worst effects of climate change, and she warned that if the world continued with business as usual, her generation would face an insurmountable catastrophe. … ‘I shouldn’t be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean,’ said Thunberg, who traveled for two weeks on a solar-powered sailboat to reach the United States this month. … She and 15 other young people filed a legal complaint with the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child arguing that major countries — Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany and Turkey — have known about the risks of climate change for decades but have failed to take sufficient action to curb their emissions. … ‘For more than 30 years, the science has been crystal clear,’ Thunberg added. ‘How dare you continue to look away and come here and say you’re doing enough when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight?’”

-- Israeli President Reuven Rivlin summoned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his rival Benny Gantz to work out a deal that would weld their two parties into a unity government. Steve Hendrix and Ruth Eglash report: “ ‘We have taken a significant step forward tonight, and now the first challenge is to establish a channel of direct communication between the sides,’ Rivlin said in a statement after the meeting. The three had agreed not to reveal the nature of the conversation ‘at this time,’ the statement said. The discussions come as the country waits for Rivlin to kick off the next phase of Israel’s protracted political process: to announce which candidate he has chosen to make the first attempt at forming a governing coalition.”

-- U.S. and Afghan forces carried out a deadly raid on al-Qaeda in southern Afghanistan, destroying an apparent weapons cache. Susannah George reports: “Launched late Sunday, the operation was aimed at al-Qaeda targets in the Musa Qala district in Afghanistan’s southern Helmand province. A fierce firefight broke out as U.S. and Afghan ground forces surrounded a compound … The exchange of fire dragged into the early hours of Monday, and when the ground troops were unable to move into the compound, a U.S. airstrike was called in. The U.S. official said it was possible that civilians were inside the compound at the time of the strike. He added that allegations of civilian deaths are under investigation.”

-- The U.N. announced the creation of a Syrian constitutional committee to rewrite the country’s constitution. Sarah Daouch and Asser Khattab report: “In a statement, U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said the ‘Syrian-owned and Syrian-led’ constitutional committee will be facilitated by the United Nations in Geneva, and he thanked Russia, Turkey and Iran for their diplomatic efforts. Russia and Iran are allied with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while Turkey supports the opposition in Syria’s civil war.”

-- A coalition of Latin American countries decided to impose sanctions on Nicolás Maduro’s cronies in an attempt to further isolate and oust the Venezuelan president. Carol Morello reports: “Egged on by the United States and the opposition government recognized by more than 50 democracies, the foreign ministers invoked a NATO-like treaty called the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, also known as the Rio Treaty. It is rooted in the principle that a threat to one member threatens all members. … No one was specifically named besides the reviled Maduro, but the diplomats said their vote means they will identify those deemed complicit with Maduro’s government, investigate and prosecute them, and ultimately seize their assets and sentence them to prison.”

This is a column about Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and why you should or should not prefer the former over the latter. But before digging into that question, I’d like call your attention to something that is too often ignored in the “Bernie vs. Warren” debate: The American left’s bark is louder than its bite.

In recent years, socialists and their left-liberal fellow travelers have accrued an unprecedented degree of influence over our nation’s political discourse. As the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis undermined mainstream economic orthodoxy — and radicalized a generation of overeducated, underemployed journalists and academics — the technocracy’s center of gravity shifted leftward. In 2019, the Democrats’ Establishment think tank is agitating for industry-wide collective bargaining, the mainstream media has adopted a reflexively sympathetic attitude toward striking public-sector workers, and conscious capitalists are giving TED Talks on the evils of neoliberalism.

Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders’s surprising strength in the 2016 primaries and Hillary Clinton’s devastating weakness in that year’s general election — and the online left’s success in popularizing its interpretations of both phenomena— persuaded many 2020 Democratic hopefuls to stop worrying and learn to love social democracy. At the first three Democratic debates, the middle-ground position on health care was a public option strong enough to jeopardize the viability of private insurance. On higher education, it was free public college for all children from working-class families. On climate, it was “only” $1.7 trillion in green investments, and a mandate for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

But the left’s ideological clout far outstrips its material strength. American socialism is heavy on superstructure, light on base. The current trade-union movement is weak by historic standards, representing a piddling 10.5 percent of the U.S. workforce. Independent leftist organizations like the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) have grown since 2016 but still lack the scale and mass working-class membership that made such entities formidable agents of social change in earlier eras of American history. In the electoral realm, progressive challengers scored a couple notable victories in the 2018 primaries but failed to foment a “tea party of the left.” Outside of low-turnout elections in deep-blue districts, organizations like Our Revolution, Justice Democrats, and DSA gave Democratic incumbents little cause for fearing their wrath. And where left insurgents did win open primaries in purple territory, they failed to affirm their theory of change: Nominating economic populists unencumbered by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s allergy to class-warfare rhetoric and radical reforms like Medicare for All did not fix what’s the matter with Kansas. Sanders-backed ironworker Randy Bryce did worse in Wisconsin’s 1st District last year than Hillary Clinton did in 2016. Single-payer supporter Kara Eastman failed to flip Nebraska’s 2nd. The 2018 elections did not prove the electoral necessity of moderation — Warren acolyte Katie Porter pulled out a tough win in a historically Republican California district; Senator Tammy Baldwin’s calls for abolishing private insurance and putting workers on corporate boards proved compatible with winning reelection in a Trump state — but nor did they prove that Sanders-ism an electoral panacea.

Thus far, the 2020 primary has further undermined the notion that Democratic voters will overwhelmingly support radical change if only the left can get the Establishment’s thumbs off the scale. Joe Biden owes his front-runner status less to his party’s high-dollar donors than its high-propensity voters. Few Democratic pooh-bahs went into 2019 favoring Uncle Joe. Many saw Kamala Harris as Hillary’s heiress apparent, while others were so averse to backing Obama’s senescent wingman that they put their chips on the mayor of South Bend instead. But the people (or a plurality of them, anyway) have preferred Biden. The fact that Warren and Sanders are his chief rivals — rather than Harris and Buttigieg — may reflect the radicalization of some segments of the Democratic electorate. But much of the rank and file evinces little interest in their party’s ideological divides. And a significant portion of Democratic-base voters still espouse a preference for ideological moderation (however hazily defined).

Finally, even if the left were to build enthusiastic majoritarian support for a radical break with “Obamaism” among both Democratic-primary voters and the general public, it might still have difficulty enacting its legislative agenda. Both chambers of Congress overrepresent the most conservative elements in American society. And with its six-year terms and immense incumbency advantages, the Senate largely insulates Democrats in even the bluest states from grassroots pressure (see: Feinstein, Dianne).

The left is too weak to enact Sanders’s or Warren’s big plans. Do either of them have a plan for that?

Much of the time, the Democratic left is content to wage its “Bernie vs. Warren” civil war in a parallel universe free of this context. Sanders supporters comb through the Warren campaign’s every utterance on health care for intimations of agnosticism on single-payer, as though the chief obstacle to Medicare for All in 2021 will be the next Democratic president’s lack of backbone rather than the fact that there are currently 14 votes for Bernie’s bill in Chuck Schumer’s caucus (and none of the Democrats who oppose single-payer had any trouble winning renomination in the 2018 primaries). Meanwhile, progressive intellectuals debate the relative merits of Warren’s left-liberalism and Sanders’s “democratic socialism” as though the central question facing the next Democratic administration will be whether to implement the Meidner plan or settle for Denmark’s model of social democracy.

This isn’t to say that there are no areas where Warren’s and Sanders’s disparate worldviews and personal backgrounds could have real substantive implications. The commander-in-chief has immense discretion over foreign policy, and up to now Sanders appears more interested than Warren in radically reforming the Democratic Party’s approach to geopolitics. The president also has considerable power to shape domestic policy through regulatory appointments and creative interpretations of existing statutory authority — forms of “lawfare” to which Warren may be especially well suited.

Given how far the left is from possessing the power it will need to turn its wildest “green dreams” into reality, however, the most worthwhile Bernie-versus-Warren arguments may concern tactics, not policy. Whether Sanders’s approach to expropriating the billionaire class is preferable to Warren’s isn’t a question that’s likely to be of much practical consequence in the medium-term future. But whether his approach to winning elections — and using his power to build up the left’s — is more viable than Warren’s absolutely is.

In recent days, the staunchly pro-Sanders publication Jacobin has made the latter case, arguing that Sanders’s theory of change is both radically distinct from and superior to Warren’s. Refreshingly, the socialist magazine premises its argument on a frank acknowledgement of the left’s sorry state. In its account, Warren may have been a suitable agent of structural change three decades ago, when the grassroots left was still strong enough to arrange “a tense but functional relationship between a reformist administration in the White House and a strong and organized working class that could at least challenge capital’s imperatives.” But in the current context, the left doesn’t command enough divisions to make use of Warren’s technocratic gifts. It needs foot soldiers, not plans. And Bernie Sanders is uniquely capable of reassembling the left’s army because of his deeper commitment to radical, bottom-up change, his greater appeal to blue-collar constituencies, and his more unabashedly adversarial relationship with the Democratic Party.

I find this unconvincing. But Jacobin’s case merits examination, as it’s focused on the right questions: How do we get from where we are to a polity in which our plans actually matter? And is Warren or Sanders more likely to get us there?

The differences between Sanders and Warren may be smaller than they appear (in Jacobin articles, anyway).

One obstacle to a productive debate over whether Warren or Sanders is a more viable agent of change is the temptation to exaggerate the distinctions between their respective modes of operation. In “Elizabeth Warren’s Strategy Within the Democratic Party Is All Wrong,” Jacobin’s (typically incisive) Branko Marcetic falls prey to that impulse. In his column, Marcetic argues that the Massachusetts senator’s reported outreach to the Democratic Establishment betrays her commitment to an “inside strategy” that is bound to fail. The problem with his argument is that its central premise — that Warren’s decision to court power players in the Democratic Party sharply distinguishes her campaign from Sanders’s — appears to be false.

Marcetic’s essay is based on a New York Times story from last month that reported that, in an apparent bid to ingratiate herself with superdelegates, Warren had told influential Democratic brokers that she wanted to build power within the party and wouldn’t be assembling her own independent grassroots army. Sanders’s supporters responded to this news with (gleeful) indignation, as it appeared to heighten the contradictions between his and her theories of change. And yet, the most significant difference ostensibly established by the Times article — that Warren was forswearing the kind of independent organizing that Sanders champions — wasn’t actually any distinction at all. Oddly, Marcetic concedes this point in a parenthetical but declines to address its implications for his broader argument:

On August 26, the New York Times reported that Warren has been aggressively courting Democratic officials behind the scenes, assuring them, in the paper’s telling, that she is a loyal Democrat and does not plan to create her own political or organizing infrastructure outside the party. (The next day, the Association of State Democratic Committees announced that Sanders and a number of other candidates have, like Warren, pledged not to create “any organizing or messaging infrastructure that is parallel or duplicative” to the DNC or state parties.)

Marcetic proceeds to suggest that, even if Warren’s pledge is not as distinctive as it first appeared, her courting of superdelegates is:

Besides trying to convince Democrats that her progressive ideas won’t make her “unelectable,” Warren’s private assurances that she simply wants to breathe new life into the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and help the party recapture Congress, the Times notes, also have a politically strategic element. Thanks to a rule change last year, if no single candidate wins an outright majority of delegates in the primaries — a plausible scenario in this crowded field — the superdelegates will once again have a large role in choosing the nominee, this time on the second ballot. And, should it come down to a second ballot, Warren wants their votes.

It’s unclear how easily these overtures to the DNC will sit with Warren’s plans for major structural change in the United States.

This distinction, too, is nonexistent: In May, a Sanders-campaign aide told BuzzFeed News, “We’re taking superdelegates and superdelegates strategy seriously, hence having a team dedicated to delegates who can prepare for multiple convention scenarios. We will be reaching out to them over the course of the campaign. When the senator wins the nomination, he’s eager to work with them to support and unite all the party in the general and beyond.”

There is nothing especially telling about a candidate’s seeking the approval of powerful figures in the party whose nomination he or she is trying to win. To neglect such “inside” tactics would be political malpractice, as the Sanders campaign readily acknowledges.

Nevertheless, differences between each candidate’s relationship with the Democratic Party persist.

All this said, it is true that, as a general matter, Sanders has a more adversarial relationship with the Democratic Party than Warren. He has, of course, refused to join the party for the duration of his congressional career, and he has used that formal independence to criticize the Democratic Establishment with a (generally righteous) fury that Warren has reserved for financial executives. He has also made some efforts to build an independent political infrastructure capable of challenging incumbent Democrats that refuse to get with his program (though he has apparently promised to suspend those efforts upon winning the nomination).

Given these facts, it isn’t wholly implausible to view the “Bernie vs. Warren” debate as a proxy for a broader dispute over the left’s relationship to the Democratic Party. Namely: Should progressives and socialists seek to co-opt the Democratic brand, build power within its institutions, and seek accommodation with its leadership, out of a recognition that the left is strong enough (and, for now, ideologically fashionable enough) to exert influence as one interest group within the Democrats’ big tent but far too weak to establish an independent political identity capable of capturing the loyalties of the Democratic base? Or is the Democratic brand too toxic with the working class — and its leadership too entrenched and aligned with capital — to be worth co-opting? Which is to say: Is popularizing a socialist identity that can bridge America’s partisan divide and mobilize its nonvoters — while building an independent party-like entity capable of disciplining its candidates and putting the fear of obsolescence into the Democratic leadership — the only path to radical reform?

It is not clear to me that Sanders is personally committed to the latter theory of change (given his aforementioned pledge, and decades of productive cooperation with the Democratic leadership, it seems possible that becoming blue America’s standard-bearer would dispel his reservations about working within the two-party system). But many of his most enthusiastic, socialist supporters are; Jacobin’s editors, and many members of the DSA, proselytize an electoral strategy of building an independent socialist party that competes on the Democratic ballot line when necessary. And even if a President Sanders does not directly participate in that project, the election of a self-avowed socialist would surely abet such efforts more than that of a staunchly pro-market progressive Democrat.

So, for the sake of argument, let’s stipulate that Bernie plans to violate his pledges and brook no compromise with the Democrats’ old regime. What is the evidence for the premise that forswearing all accommodation with the Democratic Party would maximize the left’s gains?

Toward the end of his column, Marcetic gestures at one answer:

An insurgent movement like the Tea Party made heavy use of confrontational tactics and primary challenges to wrench the Republican Party toward its end of the political spectrum. Donald Trump’s antagonistic relationship with a GOP establishment that largely opposed him didn’t stop him from both winning the Republican primary and the general election, and today’s GOP has been refashioned in Trump’s image, with even his fiercest Republican critics now fully signing on to his agenda. Trump did this not by convincing members of the GOP establishment that he was correct, but by rallying voters and making it virtually impossible for Republicans to both keep their jobs and oppose him. If the next Democratic president fails to achieve something similar, they won’t just face an obstructionist Republican bloc, but a host of conservative Democrats who will stand as a barrier to their agenda, just as Obama did in 2009…Only a direct challenge to the power of those elites will enable a progressive president to overcome it.

There are several problems with this analogy. First, it is not clear why pursuing diplomacy with Establishment factions — while seeking control of a party’s apparatus — is incompatible with abetting some primary challenges (Warren’s staff has significant ties to the organization Justice Democrats, which exists to orchestrate such campaigns). Second, Donald Trump absolutely sought reconciliation with the GOP Establishment upon winning his party’s nomination in 2016, noticeably adjusted his platform to suit its wishes, and owed his victory largely to the strength of the RNC’s infrastructure (his own campaign being a ramshackle mess). Third, Trump’s fiercest critics have not actually “fully” signed on to his agenda. In fact, Republican senators have repeatedly rebuffed the president on his signature issue, voting down Trump’s proposed reductions in legal immigration by wide margins. One might therefore interpret Trump as a testament to the limitations of the inside game. But then does anyone really believe that America’s nativists would be exercising more power in our politics had they begrudged Trump his accommodations with the GOP’s corporate wing or attempted to popularize an independent political identity, instead of seeking to claim the Republican Party as their own? And can anyone argue that Trump has been too soft on his intraparty critics?

The lesson of Trump’s failure to rally Republican senators behind his immigration agenda is that it is extremely hard to force a U.S. senator to vote for something he or she strongly opposes — whether through direct challenges or backroom cajoling. Six-year terms, sky-high renomination rates, and, in many cases, the ability to obstruct all of a president’s other priorities make it very hard for a White House to hold any senator’s feet to the fire. Putting the fear of a credible primary challenge into all 33 of the Democratic senators who’ve withheld their support for Bernie’s health-care bill looks implausible on its face. And given the left’s showing in House races in 2018 (not to mention its sorry efforts at Senate challenges), the task appears even more implausible upon closer examination.

The left’s weakness makes it trivially easy to demonstrate how someone else’s approach to creating radical change will prove inadequate. It is much harder to make a persuasive case for one’s own. Sanders supporters are right that nothing less than a political revolution can make Medicare for All and a Green New Deal realities. But the evidence that Bernie is capable of fomenting such a revolution is limited. On the one hand, Sanders has assembled impressive small-dollar donor armies and volunteer networks. His ascent has undoubtedly abetted DSA’s growth. And he has used his vast email list to recruit reinforcements for various labor actions and protests, thereby demonstrating his commitment to social movements and to non-electoral forms of political contestation.

On the other hand, Sanders has had a national platform for three years now. He has built up an independent organization and traveled the country proselytizing for class struggle. And none of it has been sufficient for his acolytes to dominate Democratic primaries, or to win him a broader base of support for his 2020 run than he had in 2016, or even to keep his approval rating from slipping underwater. Although one can point to some polls showing Sanders with an enviable favorability rating, RealClearPolitics’ polling average shows the public disapproving of the socialist senator by a margin of 46.3 to 43.1 percent. It is possible that Sanders’s popularity and influence will balloon once he attains power. But it’s worth noting that even Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s historic popularity — and the existence of strong labor, socialist, and communist movements — were insufficient to render FDR’s attempted “purge” of anti–New Deal Democrats in the 1938 primaries successful.

In light of these facts, is it not conceivable that a president more closely aligned with the Democratic Party — and less openly hostile to its key power centers — would actually be able to get senators like Jon Tester and Kyrsten Sinema to swallow marginally more progressive legislation in 2021 than a president with an independent political identity who projected contempt for their wing of the party? Put differently, would such senators feel more inclined to perform their independence from a socialist president who’d deliberately stoked the enmity of centrist Democrats, or a “capitalist to her bones” progressive president who’d nursed Third Wayers’ threatened egos?

I do not want to live in a republic where maximizing the number of Americans with quality health insurance requires buttering up Joe Manchin in back rooms. But are we sure that that isn’t the republic we’ll be living in for the foreseeable future?

To be sure, many of Sanders’s socialist supporters see their project as a generational one. And the incremental benefits of maximizing the left’s clout in the Democratic Party today (with all the distasteful, coalition-solidifying compromises that ostensibly requires) may pale next to the radical possibilities that militancy could open up tomorrow. After all, even if righteous intransigence does not immediately inspire a mobilization capable of cowing centrist Democrats, the struggle could facilitate the recruitment of progressives into the independent, mass-membership socialist party, a development sought by Jacobin. And yet, even if the goal is to maximize the left’s power in 2030, it’s not obvious why building a party-like structure outside of the Democratic tent is a more promising strategy than competing for authority within it.

As Jacobin’s Seth Ackerman has ably explained, American election law treats the two major parties as state institutions and uses discriminatory ballot-access rules to stymie third parties. For this reason, he insists that socialists make peace with competing on the Democratic ballot line, even as they build a “a membership-run organization with its own name, its own logo, its own identity and therefore its own platform, and its own ideology.” And yet the institutionalization of the two major parties, combined with partisan polarization, makes the task of popularizing an alternative, left-wing political identity enormously difficult. The American left will achieve nothing without the backing of the black working class. And while not all African-Americans proudly identify as Democrats, a very hefty percentage of them feel a profound loyalty to the party of civil rights and Barack Obama. And the same is true for many of the left’s other key constituencies. At present, the Democratic Party is an institution that manages to put Latinx housekeepers in Las Vegas in coalition with white industrial laborers in Dearborn, black church ladies in Charleston, and long-winded politics bloggers in Manhattan. The party’s infrastructure is relatively porous on the local level, where even the most formidable Democratic “machines” have proved unable to fend off challenges from charismatic bartenders. And while the party’s base voters have strong partisan identities, many are open to a wide range of definitions of what it means to be a true Democrat in ideological terms; some recent surveys suggest Bernie Sanders is the most popular second choice among Joe Biden backers.

Given these conditions, why isn’t commandeering the Democratic Party’s infrastructure, platform, and considerable social base not a simpler, faster, and more viable path to power than attempting to build an entirely new party and political identity and then hijacking the Democrats’ ballot line — in the ostensible hope that voters who affirmatively choose to register as Democrats will look more favorably on leftist primary challengers who disparage their party than on candidates who claim membership in it?

Proletarians prefer L.L. Bean?

In “Elizabeth Warren Is Thirty Years Too Late,” Connor Kilpatrick and Bhaskar Sunkara do not address this question directly. But their analysis suggests that the existing Democratic coalition is too heavily reliant on affluent voters for the party to serve as an effective vehicle of radical change, and that Bernie’s relative distance from the taint of the Democratic brand and greater affinity for class politics and bottom-up organizing make him uniquely capable of winning back the legions of working-class voters whom Third Way Democrats lost to right-wing populism or political apathy.

Like Marcetic’s piece, Kilpatrick and Sunkara’s draws strong conclusions from limited evidence. The authors observe that Sanders’s support among Democratic-primary voters is markedly less white and more working-class than Warren’s. In fact, many surveys have suggested that Warren owes her viability to overwhelming support among professional-class white liberals — or, as Kilpatrick and Sunkara describe them, “Patagonia Democrats.” This distinction between the class composition of the two progressive candidates’ nascent coalitions has become a popular talking point among Sanders supporters. And it may have some validity. In Vermont, Sanders has regularly outperformed other Democrats with white, non-college-educated voters. It’s plausible that his brand of politics may play better with a critical mass of secular, rural, white swing voters in Wisconsin, and therefore that he would be a stronger general-election candidate than Warren.

But Kilpatrick and Sunkara use this polling data to make a far more sweeping claim. Sanders’s greater appeal with blue-collar Democratic-primary voters doesn’t merely suggest he can improve on Clinton’s margins in Kenosha County, but that he can reorient the polarization of U.S. politics along class lines. In their telling, Warren’s coalition is potentially broad “enough to keep Republicans from the White House but not Congress or state legislatures. It would be yet another coalition that could win but never govern.” Bernie’s working-class coalition, by contrast, would have the numbers and self-interest necessary to force radical change through political institutions that were designed to thwart it.

That America’s low- and middle-income workers do not share a class consciousness or partisan coalition is a genuine constraint on radical economic reform. Kilpatrick and Sunkara’s commitment to overcoming that constraint is commendable. But the fact that Sanders commands the loyalties of a disproportionately working-class 16 percent of the Democratic-primary electorate scarcely qualifies as evidence that his appeal with non-college-educated voters is so powerful it can radically realign American politics. After all, Biden boasts even stronger support among nonwhite and working-class Democrats. Does that mean that nominating Uncle Joe would reassemble the New Deal coalition? Sanders supporters might dismiss the racial and socioeconomic diversity of Biden’s support as a product of mere name recognition. But Warren backers can play that card against Sanders too: In the last week, multiple polls have shown her not only gaining more non-college-educated and non-white support as her campaign rolls on, but actually outperforming Sanders with such voters.

Quinnipiac poll on whether you would be “excited” if one of the 2020 Dems became the nominee:



Black voters: Biden 70%, Warren 68%, Sanders 63%



White Democrats w/o college degree: Warren 69%, Biden 54%, Sanders 52% — Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) September 25, 2019

Regardless, the evidence that no Democratic candidate can drastically change the party’s class composition in the near term is considerable. The movement of non-college-educated white voters to the right — and college-educated white ones to the left — is not an exceptionally American phenomenon. Rather, it has been happening for decades across much of Western Europe. The left attributes this development to center-left parties’ myriad betrayals of their working-class constituencies in the neoliberal era. And that is certainly part of the story. But it is also the case that non-college-educated white voters in the West have, in the aggregate, long evinced a preference for restricted immigration in opinion polls. It’s conceivable that, irrespective of economic policy, the demographic shifts of the past three decades were bound to increase the salience of immigration in partisan politics and thus drive a significant portion of the white working class away from center-left parties with bases in diverse urban centers.

But whatever the origins of this development, there is little evidence that left-wing parties can rapidly reverse it by embracing more robustly class-conscious rhetoric and ambitiously redistributionist economic policies. When Britain’s Labour Party elected a democratic socialist as its leader and campaigned on its most radical manifesto in a generation, it gained a historic number of seats in the 2017 general election — by, among other things, flipping Tory-held districts in the wealthiest parts of London. Meanwhile, as already mentioned, the bulk of Sanders-aligned, working-class House candidates in 2018 did not have much more success at winning non-college-educated white voters than did centrist Democrats running in similar districts (Richard Ojeda notwithstanding). None of this means that the left must give up on uniting the bulk of America’s multiethnic working class into a single party. But it does suggest that such a project may require years of patient organizing (and demographic replacement), rather than the nomination of any particular presidential candidate.

If Kilpatrick and Sunkara overestimate Sanders’s capacity to realign American politics, they understate how much the Democratic Party can accomplish with its existing coalition. The U.S. economy does not currently serve the average college-educated voter very well. And most of the marquee items on Sanders’s agenda are in the objective self-interest of virtually all affluent suburbanites. Charles Koch may have little use for free public college, universal health care, more generous Social Security benefits, or child-care subsidies. But the typical upper-middle-class family does. Meanwhile, the indebted and underemployed millennial sons and daughters of the professional middle class are one of the most reliably left-wing constituencies in the country and make up no small percentage of Jacobin’s subscriber base and DSA’s membership. There are limitations on what this coalition can achieve. But in California, the existing Democratic coalition just secured subsidized health care for undocumented immigrants and employment rights for exploited “gig economy” workers, over the furious objections of multibillion-dollar companies. Under Barack Obama, meanwhile, it extended Medicaid to millions of people, likely saving nearly 20,000 working-class Americans from premature deaths. The lamentable shortcomings of Obama’s tenure do not nullify that achievement.

Sunkara and Kilpatrick are right to find no contentment in such marginal gains. But by projecting contempt for one of the voting blocs that made those gains possible — and asserting that the existing Democratic Party can “never govern” — they risk projecting an air of indifference toward such reforms and the working-class people who’ve benefited from them (an indifference that I know neither writer actually feels). Socialists must always guard against the impression that they are more invested in chasing an ideological abstraction than delivering concrete benefits to the exploited classes they claim to champion. As a wise (and/or violently racist and jingoistic) man once said, “People don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.” For many Democratic-primary voters, expressions of contempt for the organization that represents their best line of defense against racist, reactionary rule can be deeply alienating. Which points to the most immediate strategic upside of Warren’s “inside strategy”: Polls have repeatedly found that Sanders attracts a relatively high level of disapproval or discomfort among Democratic-primary voters, while Warren boasts an aberrantly low one. This reality, combined with the intensity of elite Democratic opposition to Sanders, invites the question of whether Warren is the only progressive with sufficient breadth of appeal (among Democratic voters and power brokers) to prevent Biden from securing the nomination — in which case Sanders’s theoretical superiority as a general-election candidate or president would be moot. The answer to that question is far from clear, in my view. But it’s hard to see how Sanders can negate its premise without stepping up his “inside game.”

All this may read as an elaborate endorsement of Warren. But I do not intend it as such. That Sanders evinces more interest in radically revising American foreign policy is no small thing. Further, as Kilpatrick and Sunkara note, in a context where the left is materially weak, the personal ideological commitments of elected leaders take on a heightened importance. And there is no question that Bernie Sanders has a more deeply rooted ideological commitment to radical politics than does Elizabeth Warren.

But too many prominent arguments for Sanders’s superiority consist of easily debunked distinctions between the two left-wing candidates or blithely unsubstantiated assertions that Bernie is uniquely capable of fomenting a political revolution and thus of bending the Democratic Establishment and U.S. Senate to his will. The first mode of argument risks alienating undecided liberals and obscuring Sanders’s genuinely distinctive merits. The second threatens to replace rigorous reflection on the obstacles to radical change in the United States with magical thinking — and a much-needed debate over how to overcome those impediments with the recitation of rival dogmas.

Which would be unfortunate. In this country, optimism of the intellect is a luxury that no “Champagne socialist” nor “Patagonia progressive” can afford."

The Gini index measures wealth distribution across a population, with zero representing total equality and 1 representing total inequality, where all wealth is concentrated in a single household. The indicator has been rising steadily for several decades. When the Census Bureau began studying income inequality in 1967, the Gini index was 0.397. In 2018, it climbed to 0.485.

By comparison, no European nation had a score greater than 0.38 last year.

The federal minimum wage has stood at $7.25 for more than a decade. That’s one of the biggest reasons the gap between the rich and poor is widening, said Brielle Bryan, an assistant professor of sociology at Rice University.

“Inequality will go up as long as the people at the top of the tail are seeing their wealth increase,” Bryan said. “A booming economy means that people who have higher income and own capital are able to see continued higher returns on that.”

Recent economic gains by lower-income workers who have found jobs and benefited from minimum-wage increases in many states haven’t made up for the long-running trend of the wealthy seeing far larger income growth than middle- or lower-income earners. The number of families earning $15,000 or less has fallen since 2007, according to the latest census data, while the number of households bringing in $250,000 a year or more has grown more than 15 percent.

The persistent rise in inequality has become a central topic in the 2020 presidential race, with candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren calling for a wealth tax. This week, Sanders unveiled a proposal that would impose a tax as high as 8 percent on the ultrawealthy, raising $4.35 trillion over a decade, according to an analysis by economists who consulted with the Warren and Sanders campaigns.

“There should be no billionaires,” Sanders tweeted when he announced his plan. “We are going to tax their extreme wealth and invest in working people.”

Systemic inequality is actually starkest in the top tier of the economic ladder, which is populated primarily by white men, Bryan said. Women in the 95th percentile of earners make around 68 cents on the dollar compared with their male counterparts.

“We don’t have as much sympathy for CEOs,” Bryan said, “but what’s happening at the top end is really symbolic of problems happening throughout the system.”

For a minute there, it looked like Elizabeth Warren’s 2020 campaign would burst into flames five feet above its launchpad. The senator began her presidential bid by attempting to nullify one of her conspicuous liabilities — only to amplify that liability, amuse conservatives, and alienate indigenous groups. Within months, her finance director had quit, and her top left-wing rival had out fundraised her by an order of magnitude. Then, Joe Biden made his candidacy official, and promptly opened up a 30-point lead over the Massachusetts senator.

Nevertheless, she persisted. And with a little over four months before Iowa gets caucusing, Warren’s prospects have radically changed. As of this writing, betting markets now consider her by far the most likely candidate to win the Democratic nomination. For months now, each wave of new polling has shown her star steadily rising both nationally and in early primary states. And the latest batch of surveys is no exception.

A national Quinnipiac poll released Tuesday finds Warren’s support nationally climbing from 19 percent in August to 27 percent today — a large enough gain to put her ahead of Biden in that survey for the first time ever. Meanwhile, a new UC Berkeley/Los Angeles Times poll of the California primary suggests Warren has gained 11 points in the Golden State since June, giving her a commanding lead over the rest of the field. Meanwhile, the most recent data from the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire comport with this general trend.

But the best news for Warren in these polls may lay beneath the headline data. Here are five quick takeaways from the last week of polling that bode well for Warren’s odds of facing Trump next November:

1) Biden is bending, and just might break.

If you only looked at the national polling averages, Uncle Joe would appear to be in very solid shape. RealClearPolitics’s poll of polls has Biden boasting 29 percent support, which is just a tiny shade beneath where he’s typically been over the past three months; in other words, the national data shows no steep or uniform decline in Biden’s standing.

But in the early voting states — where each campaign’s resources have been concentrated — the picture looks much dimmer for the former vice-president. At the start of July, Biden’s average support in Iowa was 26 percent; today, it’s just 20. Warren now leads the field in the Hawkeye State by nearly three points in RCP’s polling average. And surveys from New Hampshire tell a similar story: As of mid-July, Biden was leading Warren there by an average of 22 points; now, he leads by an average of three. And Monmouth University poll released this week has Warren ahead of him by two.

Meanwhile, the national landscape may be in the process of converging on Iowa and New Hampshire’s: In Quinnipiac’s newly released national poll, Biden’s support is 7 percent lower than it was in the same survey one month ago. Other pollsters have documented declines in the percentage of Biden supporters who are “enthusiastic” about their candidate. Finally, there are some non-empirical reasons to think the former vice president’s standing will continue to erode. Thus far, Biden has benefited from the perception that he would be a uniquely “electable” nominee. But the increasingly conspicuous decline in his verbal skills — combined with the fact that the Democrats’ newly launched impeachment push is sure to call attention to his son Hunter’s influence-peddling (and Trump’s ostensibly, wildly false allegation that Biden corruptly intervened to fire a Ukranian prosecutor who was looking into Hunter’s company) — could erode Biden’s claim to being the Democrats’ “safe” option.

2) Warren’s base of support appears to be diversifying.

For most of the campaign, one of Warren’s apparent weaknesses was her coalition’s demographic homogeneity: She commanded the adoration of college-educated whites, but piddling levels of support among most other parts of the Democratic coalition.

This fact lent itself to two competing interpretations:

1) Something about Warren’s persona or program made her a niche candidate, who was already near her ceiling of support (there being only so many white professionals in blue America) and would thus fade away.

or

2) College-educated whites were more likely than other Democrats to be paying close attention to the primary race. Thus, Warren’s poor showing with nonwhite, and non-college-educated voters merely reflected the fact that her name was not as widely recognized as Joe Biden’s or Bernie Sanders’s. And if this were the case, then her strong support among college-educated whites might actually be a leading indicator of her appeal to the broader Democratic coalition: Once other groups began tuning in to this year’s race, they too would see the same things that had made “Patagonia Democrats” swoon.

While there may be an element of truth to No. 1 (Warren does appear to be especially appealing to Democrats who share her skin tone and academic pedigree), recent polling data has made the second look increasingly plausible. Quinnipiac’s new national poll show’s Warren’s coalition diversifying in both racial and class terms. In fact, the Q-poll has Warren beating Biden among white voters without a college degree by a remarkable 37 to 20 percent margin.

Quinnipiac poll on whether you would be “excited” if one of the 2020 Dems became the nominee:



Black voters: Biden 70%, Warren 68%, Sanders 63%



White Democrats w/o college degree: Warren 69%, Biden 54%, Sanders 52% — Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) September 25, 2019

New Quinnipiac poll this morning shows Warren making inroads among black voters:



July:

Biden 53%

Warren 4%



August:

Biden 47%

Warren 8%



Now:

Biden 40%

Warren 19% — Ryan Struyk (@ryanstruyk) September 25, 2019

The Los Angeles Times poll of California tells a similar story. After performing poorly with non-college whites in the same poll back in June, Warren now claims 29 percent of the demographic’s vote, while Sanders and Biden respectively boast 20 and 18 percent. And although Biden still leads the field with 40 percent support among African-American voters, Warren now has 24 percent support among that key demographic in California, putting her in second with that constituency.

But there’s even more direct evidence that Warren’s real base isn’t college-educated white voters, so much as it is voters who are paying attention: In the progressive think-tank Data For Progress’s polling of the 2020 primary, Warren consistently performs best among voters express a high level of interest in the news — including non-college-educated and non-white news junkies.

3) Harris 2020 (almost certainly) isn’t happening.

For a brief period in early July, Kamala Harris led both Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren in national polls. The California senator also boasted considerable support among professional Democrats and liberal donors. Many observers expected her to emerge as Biden’s main rival. But she’s proven to be the 2020 version of Scott Walker — a candidate with strong Establishment support who makes a lot of sense on paper, but never made much headway with actual voters. Quinnipiac now pegs Harris’s support at a mere 3 percent; her average in national polls is 5 percent. Critically, her numbers in Iowa and New Hampshire are almost identical to her national figures. Unless she orchestrates an improbable comeback in one of those early states, Harris could be forced to euthanize her campaign by early March, leaving Warren the only viable option for Democrats who wish to elect a female president.

4) Warren is acceptable to a broader range of Democratic voters than any of her rivals.

Both the Quinnipiac national poll, and Los Angeles Times California survey, show Warren with a higher favorability rating among Democratic voters than Biden or Sanders. And the Times finds that nearly 70 percent of California Democrats rank Warren as their first or second choice. Those results are consistent with a Data For Progress/Civiqs national poll released earlier this month, which showed Warren as the most popular second choice among Biden, Sanders, Buttigieg, and Harris voters. And several other surveys have produced similar findings. This obviously bodes well for Warren if and when the Democratic field narrows, and suggests that a contested convention, she may have a strong claim to being a “unity” figure.

5) Sanders is stagnating.

Bernie Sanders’s campaign is very much alive. The Vermont senator’s has amassed enviable donor and volunteer networks, and has led in multiple recent polls of early primary states. Still, Sanders’s support has been stagnant nationally for months now, while his average share of the vote in Iowa has fallen from 19 percent in July to 12 percent today. Given that the senator is already well-known among Democratic primary voters, it is not clear how much room he has to grow. Sanders has made no secret of the fact that he favors Warren over his other primary rivals. So, it is at least possible to imagine a scenario in which Sanders’s campaign runs out of steam by next April, and then throws its considerable resources behind Warren.

Of course, Warren’s nomination remains far from a sure thing. Biden’s numbers are still formidable. Sanders is still within striking distance. And it’s still early. But at this point, there’s a strong case that Warren is the candidate you’d want to be."

In the remarkable events of the last few days that have suddenly brought House Democrats together in determination to impeach the president, a name keeps coming up nearly as often as that of Trump. It’s “Biden,” as in presidential candidate Joe and his globetrotting son, Hunter.

Yes, the case for impeaching the 45th president is broad and deep. But for the moment, impeachment fever and the MAGA counter-fever it will inspire are dwelling on the story of Trump’s efforts to sink Biden by securing an investigation of Hunter by a foreign government. Trump failed to get the Ukrainian government to lower the boom on Hunter Biden. But his ultimate objective, ironically, could be nearly as well served by controversy over his likely illegal actions, which will keep the “Biden corruption” story in the news. It’s kind of a like a hurricane stalled on the coast, pounding unlucky residents who are suddenly the primary object of nature’s wrath.

No one, so far, has made a credible case that Joe Biden did anything directly to help his son in his career as a lawyer-lobbyist, a procurer of appropriations earmarks, and an international man of mystery — much less anything inappropriate. But clearly, Hunter benefited from his last name, and aside from questions about his business dealings in Ukraine and China, his personal problems will be catnip for hostile and even friendly media alike. Hunter Biden’s history of substance abuse, the allegations made against him by his ex-wife during an ugly divorce, and his relationship with the widow of his brother, Beau, have all been out there in the public record. But they will get fresh exposure so long as he is a figure, however peripheral, in the impeachment case against the man his father is trying to defeat. Obviously enough, Team Trump wants it to stay that way, which is precisely why Trump and his goon, Rudy Giuliani, were trying to drop a dime on Hunter Biden and smear Joe in the bargain.

Should Team Biden be worried about this problem, absent any real evidence of wrongdoing? It’s hard to say. His presidential candidacy has overcome more immediate blows, mostly concerning his friendliness toward bigots, his long Senate record with its questionable policy positions, and his tendency now and then to sound like an old man who has lost a few steps. His perceived “electability” is a powerful asset. And it won’t be that easy over time for Trump fans to hammer away at Biden for his son’s alleged missteps given the president’s own sketchy relationship with sketchy family members (not that fear of looking hypocritical is a major inhibition for most of them).

The main reason Hurricane Hunter could be a problem for Biden is the timing. The 2020 Democratic nomination contest is at a delicate point, with Biden very slowly but steadily losing ground as Elizabeth Warren’s candidacy takes off like a rocket. As recently as August 7, Biden had a 15-point national lead over then-second-place Bernie Sanders in the RealClearPolitics polling averages. Now he has a lead half that size over Warren. More alarmingly, Warren now leads Biden in the polling averages for Iowa, and has nearly caught him in New Hampshire (where the most recent high-quality poll, from Monmouth, gave Warren an actual lead). If Biden loses in both these initial states, history says his candidacy should fail (Bill Clinton didn’t win in Iowa or New Hampshire either in 1992, but that’s partially because he did not contest the former state, locked down by favorite son Tom Harkin). There’s even trouble down the road in California (which is voting just a few days after South Carolina), where a new Berkeley IGS poll shows Warren leading Biden by nine points.

In this period when voting intentions are beginning to form, it’s not a good thing for Joe Biden that his last name is hourly in the news in connection with a corruption claim associated with the biggest story in politics: impeachment. Perhaps Democratic voters will actually gain sympathy for the former veep as the victim of a notorious Trump smear. But voters obsessed with electability could see this as a preview of Trump’s signature ability to drag his opponents right down into the moral morass that is his natural habitat.

Medical-related debt is the top reason Americans file for bankruptcy. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wants to erase much of that debt in his latest ambitious plan to reshape the country’s health-care system.

But the way he’s proposing to do so may be logistically unworkable — and wouldn’t necessarily benefit the people who need help the most, experts say.

Over the weekend, Sanders pledged that as president he would wipe out $81 billion in past-due medical bills reported to credit agencies such as Equifax. He’s also proposing to replace private credit agencies with a government-run one that ensures medical debt never hurts people’s credit scores.

“The very concept of medical debt should not exist,” Sanders said in a statement. “In the wealthiest country in the history of the world, one illness or disease should not ruin a family’s financial life and future.”

""This is the wealthiest country in the history of the world. If we were a poor country, I'd be telling you something else."" — Nick Coltrain (@NColtrain) September 22, 2019

Sanders is right about this: Medical debt is a massive problem for Americans. That was true before the 2010 Affordable Care Act, and it remains a huge problem now.

Medical expenses are a contributing factor in two-thirds of individual bankruptcy filings. In a 2016 Kaiser Family Foundation poll, more than a quarter of U.S. adults ages 18 to 64 said they or someone in their household had problems paying medical bills in the past year.

So it's not surprising many people hailed Sanders's proposal as a well-intentioned goal. The president of the American Federation of Teachers:

Medical debt is a huge problem. That's why nurses, including @minurses have fought to lower debt and have paid off the debt of patients.

The proposal from Senator Sanders to eliminate medical debt illustrates that health policy is as much about financial security as it is about access to care. — Larry Levitt (@larry_levitt) September 23, 2019

Vox editor-at-large Ezra Klein:

Of the various kinds of debt you can eliminate, I think the case is strongest for medical debt. That's not a voluntary investment people are making in their future. It's, usually, a catastrophic interaction of bad luck and bad (or no) health insurance. https://t.co/dalUu9ZgNq — Ezra Klein (@ezraklein) September 23, 2019

Erasing $81 billion in medical debt would certainly be good for those who owe it. But it's a lot trickier than it sounds for the government to find it, the founder of a charity that buys and sells medical debt told me. And it wouldn’t wipe out the problem — not even close.

Craig Antico leads a charity called RIP Medical Debt, which negotiates with hospitals to buy medical debt. Because so many medical bills go unpaid — and the problem has only gotten worse as insurance plans have required increasingly high deductibles from patients — he’s typically able to buy debt for just pennies on the dollar.

That’s good news for Sanders’s ambitious plan. Antico estimates that buying $81 billion in medical debt might cost as little as $500 million for the federal government.

But to buy up that debt, the government would have to figure out which hospitals are owed the $81 billion reported to credit agencies. And that information is protected by strict privacy rules credit agencies must adhere to.

“It’s definitely a worthy goal to abolish this debt,” Antico said. “It’s how do you find it?”

Antico provided an example: If the government wanted to abolish medical debt for everyone who lives in, say, New York state, it would have to go to every hospital and doctor's group that might have cared for a state resident and engage in a separate negotiation with each of them. So finding who holds the debt reported to credit agencies is harder than it sounds.

""If Bernie Sanders came to us and said 'I need you guys to abolish $81 billion in debt,' he couldn't direct it to that particular group,"" Antico said.

Plus, only a small fraction of total medical debt — less than 10 percent, according to Antico's estimates — is actually reported to credit agencies. So even if the government succeeded in erasing the $81 billion estimate, hundreds of billions more would remain. That debt would continue hurting those who owe it, as they would be less likely to visit hospitals even in dire need.

And there’s this: Targeting only medical debt reported to credit agencies carries an inherent bias toward patients who have more financial means. Patients who are poorer and could benefit more from having medical debt erased tend to have less or no credit history. Antico's charity focuses on patients who need help the most by going to hospitals and asking to buy the debt of those who might have qualified for financial assistance and didn't receive it, or those who are in bankruptcy.

Sanders didn’t go into detail about how he would approach these questions in a web page detailing his proposal. He also consistently overstates the number of people who go bankrupt every year because they can’t pay their medical bills (my Washington Post colleague Salvador Rizzo awarded Sanders three “Pinocchios” for this claim).

(Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters)

But Sanders’s proposal does make more sense when you consider it in light of his other health-insurance ideas. Under his Medicare-for-all plan, Americans would no longer incur medical debt because everyone would be covered under a universal plan requiring almost no out-of-pocket payments upon getting medical care.

Sanders's vision is to erase outstanding medical debt so the slate could essentially be wiped clean under a new single-payer system, said David Himmelstein, a professor at CUNY’s Hunter College. Sanders has relied on research conducted by Himmelstein, who has worked on the topic with Sanders’s Democratic rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.).

“If you’re saying that we’re gonna stop having financial ruin from medical bills in the future, it makes sense to say ‘let’s go back when the cost is relatively small and not let people be ruined by their medical debts from their past,” Himmelstein told me.

Yet, like Medicare-for-all, the proposal would undoubtedly meet with strong resistance from the behemoth health-care industry. Industry lobbyists argue that erasing medical debt would discourage Americans from purchasing health insurance, because they would be sheltered from it no matter what.

“Paying off everybody’s debts is great campaign rhetoric. As soon as you get into the details, a lot of things fall apart,” one industry lobbyist told me.

AHH, OOF and OUCH

A woman smokes on the street next to a wholesale vape shop in downtown Los Angeles. (Richard Vogel/AP)

AHH: Black-market vaping products may be behind the mysterious lung illnesses that have sickened at least 530 people in 38 states and killed nine, our Washington Post colleagues Lena H. Sun and Rob Kuznia report.

“Many sick patients said they bought vape products containing THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana, on the black market, officials and clinicians said,” they write. “The biggest legal marijuana market in the world is California — and the black market there is three times as big, said David Abernathy, an executive with Arcview Market Research, a cannabis investment and market research firm.”

Recent changes to the ingredients in popular marijuana vaping devices could be the culprit, according to interviews with more than a dozen people working in the legal and illegal cannabis markets. California has tightened restrictions, making the product even scarcer on the black market. So illegal operators are using a thickening agent to dilute THC oil and stretch their supplies. One such agent — vitamin E acetate — has been the focus of investigations around the mysterious illnesses.

“No one product or substance, including vitamin E acetate, has been conclusively identified as the cause of the lung injuries. But vitamin E acetate has been found in THC products taken from sickened patients and tested by state labs and the FDA’s forensic lab, officials said,” Lena and Rob add.

— Meanwhile, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official told lawmakers there have been “hundreds” of new cases of the vaping-related disease reported to the agency in the past week.

CDC Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat told lawmakers on a House Oversight and Reform subcommittee that more than 100 people are working on the investigation and that the “identification of the cause or causes for the outbreak may take substantial time and continuing effort,” as CNBC’s Angelica LaVito writes.

She also suggsted people may want to avoid vaping products until more is known about what’s causing the illness.

“At this point I think caution in all products is recommended. It may not even be the THC or the nicotine. It may be the additives or substances that may be common. It may be the material is not labeled appropriately,” Schuchat said.

OOF: Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) announced the state will ban all vaping product sales for four months, the toughest state crackdown issued in response to the vaping-related illnesses.

New York and Michigan have already announced bans of flavored products, and the Trump administration said its moving to set its own regulations to “clear the market” of flavored products. Massachusetts would go a step further by also temporarily halting sales of tobacco and marijuana e-cigarettes, as our Post colleague Hannah Knowles reports.

“The purpose of this public health emergency is to temporarily pause all sales of vaping products so that we can work with our medical experts to identify what is making people sick and how to better regulate these products to protect the health of our residents,” Baker said in a statement.

OUCH: An analysis from the Congressional Budget Office found a doctor-friendly approach to tackling surprise medical billing would deepen the deficit by “double digit billions,” the Hill’s Peter Sullivan reports. The analysis specifically examined the approach from Reps. Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) and Phil Roe (R-Tenn.), that calls for an arbitration system in which insurers and providers would propose payment amounts and an independent third party would determine the ""fairer"" payment option.

In an email to a congressional office, Peter writes, the CBO said under Ruiz and Roe’s approach that if “payments to providers increased by 5 percent as the result of the policy, that change alone would result in a $15 billion increase in the deficit over 10 years.”

Meanwhile, the CBO has found the bipartisan bills that advanced out of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee that use a benchmarking approach would save more than $20 billion over a decade.

— The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced premiums for Medicare Advantage plans are set to drop 14 percent in 2020 compared with 2019 and 23 percent compared with 2018. The $23 estimated average monthly premium for the plans for next year will be the lowest average monthly premium for Medicare Advantage plans since 2007, according to the agency.

The average monthly premiums for these plans have decreased by almost 30 percent since 2017. For next year, the average number of plans per county is set to increase from about 33 to 39 plans.

The agency noted more than a third of the approximately 60 million Medicare enrollees are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan and that the number of people in the program is set to increase to a record 24.4 million, up from the current 22.2 million.

In a statement, CMS Administrator Seema Verma sought to contrast the success of Medicare Advantage plans with Medicare-for-all proposals — “proposals for a total government takeover of healthcare, which would destroy options such as Medicare Advantage that seniors increasingly choose,” Verma said.

— Pharmaceutical companies are upping their lobbying efforts and spending millions on ads to try to stop drug pricing bills they worry will dull their pricing power and markedly reduce sales, the Wall Street Journal’s Peter Loftus reports.

Industry players are hoping to at least stop any proposals -- such as the effort to peg U.S. drug prices to prices paid by other countries -- from passing this year, assuming lawmakers will be less likely to advance any plans in an election year.

But the challenge for these drugmakers is their diminishing political capital as concerns about high drug prices extend across party lines.

""Industry executives and lobbyists are urging friendly lawmakers to pass legislation blocking the plans,” Peter writes. “They are also pushing administration officials to pursue measures that would pressure industry middlemen such as pharmacy-benefit managers to provide some relief on patients’ costs without directly curbing drugmakers’ pricing power.”

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the top trade group representing the drug industry, has spent $16.3 million on lobbying in the first six months of the year, compared to $28 million for all of last year.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) with 16 percent of the vote.

AD

Much has been made about Warren’s growing popularity with young voters — she stood in line for four hours earlier this month taking selfies with people who attended her speech near New York University. And while she is not polling as well with black voters as Biden or Sanders, she has growing support with the demographic, according to other polls.

As another friend and respected colleague comes out in favor of Warren, I recognize the black folk they keep polling who support Biden. But I don’t see them polling anyone who doesn’t. And in my clergy and academic black women circles, Warren is the clear favorite. — Black in Paradise (@WilGafney) September 24, 2019

But the lawmaker’s support grew from 25 percent in late August to 37 percent in late September with white college-educated voters, an influential group that largely voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.

Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy said: “Dig a little deeper, and the reasons behind Warren’s rise become more clear. She generates a lot of excitement as a potential nominee. On top of that, half of Democrats want a presidential candidate that supports big changes — even if it means things are harder along the way.”

AD

Seven out of 10 Democrats said they would be excited if Warren became the Democratic nominee for president in 2020. Fewer — 56 percent — said they would feel the same about Biden winning the nomination.

And the excitement is rooted in Warren’s left-of-center ideas — she has released dozens of plans on an array of topics, including universal child care and getting rid of the electoral college. Because of her left-leaning politics, some assumed that Sanders would be most at risk of losing his support to Warren. But this poll suggests that Warren may mostly be taking support from Biden — and that could continue.

AD

Warren is less well known than Biden. Only 9 percent of those surveyed haven’t heard of Biden, who served in Congress for three decades before becoming the vice president to America’s first black president. Nearly 20 percent haven’t heard of Warren.

This means there’s a good chance for an uptick in support for Warren. As more people become aware of who she is, there’s a chance of more people liking what she is saying — and keeping her at the top of the polls.

AMITE CITY, La.— The float carrying Gov. John Bel Edwards passed by quickly, and the tossed beads and campaign cups — “Putting Louisiana First” — landed a few feet short of Randy Foulks.

Foulks, the 68-year-old owner of an air conditioning company, likes Edwards. But he wasn't exactly jumping for campaign swag.

“I'm disappointed that he raised taxes when he said he wouldn't,” Foulks said. “I know he's got a big heart for this state. He took the bull by the horns when that storm came through here. But it's the taxes, man. Something's got to be done.”

Edwards, who was elected governor four years ago in a rout, is seeking a second term in a state that has largely moved away from Democrats. He has stayed far away from the party's presidential race, angered local and national Democrats by signing a strict abortion limitation law and expanded Medicaid. But he's in a tight battle for reelection against two Republicans running as allies of President Trump and enemies of a 2016 sales tax hike.

""[People] may not agree with everything that we've done,” Edwards said in an interview. “But you cannot, with any justification, say that Louisiana's not better off. We are running surpluses now, not deficits. We have an uninsured rate that's lower than the national average. Now, who would have thought that would ever be possible in the state of Louisiana?”

Louisiana's Oct. 12 election will test whether a socially conservative Democrat can still get elected in the South — whether it's still possible to excite liberal voters, mollify conservative voters and hold onto a job. With abortion practically off the table, Republicans have attacked Edwards's support for LGBT nondiscrimination laws. With unemployment falling under 5 percent, they credit the president's tax cuts and ask why Edwards can't govern more like Trump.

“We're the only state in the nation that lost jobs in the last 12 months,” said Rep. Ralph Abraham, the leading Republican candidate, in an interview from the sidelines of a Louisiana Tech football game. “He's got to own this stuff.” The congressman, who like Edwards is a military veteran, was there for one of the game's multiple salutes to the troops.

Republicans, who dominate Louisiana's state legislature, always saw Edwards as an accidental governor. He won 56 percent of the vote against Sen. David Vitter; one year later, Hillary Clinton won just 39 percent of the vote in the state. In 2015, Edwards benefited from two factors that disappeared right after the election: the unpopularity of two-term Gov. Bobby Jindal and the candidacy of Vitter. The senator, who had won reelection after admitting to paying for prostitutes (“a serious sin in my past”), was particularly vulnerable to Edwards's character-first campaign.

“The choice for governor couldn't be clearer,” one of Edwards's TV ads declared. “John Bel Edwards, who answered our country's call and served as a ranger in the 82nd Airborne Division, or David Vitter, who answered a prostitute's call, minutes after he skipped a vote honoring 28 soldiers.”

Edwards's two opponents this year, Abraham and businessman Eddie Rispone, have no such problems. Abraham's campaign has emphasized his work as a family doctor; Republicans call him “Doc” more than they call him “Ralph.”

The wealthy Rispone is running as an outsider, the closest thing state Republicans can get to their own Trump. Rispone has spent millions on ads attacking Edwards over “sanctuary cities” and even a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill; he's also gone after Abraham, dredging up an accusation that he used his salary to buy a plane instead of donating the income to charity. (The attack, previously used by Democrats, ignores that Abraham did give his salary to charity until congressional ethics prevented him from taking income from his medical practice.)

“I'm the grandson of legal immigrants, who worked hard and played by the rules” Rispone says in one of his omnipresent TV spots, drawling the word “legal” for emphasis.

If no candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote next month, the top two finishers will head to a November runoff. Edwards has consistently polled north of 40 percent, with his rivals in the 20s. But Republicans like their chances with either Abraham or Rispone, who have tag-teamed Edwards as a tax hiker who can't be trusted on social issues. The strategy is twofold: hoping that Democrats are less enthused to support an antiabortion governor and firing up the Republican vote by warning of “sanctuary cites,” crime waves and a breakdown of gender norms in the state's schools.

“As a doctor,” Abraham says in one TV spot, “I can assure you there are only two genders.”

Edwards has responded by constantly reminding voters of why their taxes went up at all — Jindal had blown up the state's deficit and Republicans got on board with the tax hike.

“We had already cut higher education deeper than any other state in the nation,” he said. “We'd already raised tuition more than any other state in the nation. People know that. The economy wasn't working.” Edwards has stood behind a gas tax increase that's supported by a plurality of voters but stalled in the legislature. In the first debate, he made a lonely promise not to cut taxes “until we know that we won’t go back into a structural budget deficit.”

Medicaid expansion, which Edwards brought to the state by executive action, hasn't reshaped the race. Republicans have not said outright that they'd reverse it, even as they support a lawsuit led by Republican attorneys general that would rip up the Affordable Care Act. (Louisiana's attorney general, Jeff Landry, is simultaneously suing to kill the ACA and promising to protect its most popular components.)

Republicans are not running against Medicaid expansion per se, focusing instead on troubles with how it was implemented and on the theory that it's better to get insurance through private employers than the government.

“Look, I'm a family doctor,” Abraham said. “There are those that need that safety net. We will take care of those people. My beef is that we've got over a hundred million dollars of waste, fraud, and abuse, and we've got over 1,600 people on the Medicaid rolls who are making over $100,000.” Abraham and other Republicans have attacked the implementation of expansion while navigating around the implications: that they would knock Louisianans off the Medicaid rolls.

A bill banning most abortions, which won't go into effect unless courts uphold a similar one in Mississippi, took a toll on the governor's Democratic support. Karen Carter Peterson, the state party chair and a member of the Democrats' legislative minority, even singled him out for criticism. But it also deprived Republicans of an issue, and they've spent the final weeks of the race with a different message to conservatives: Edwards is too lenient on LGBT rights.

Abraham described Edwards as two-faced on abortion — “he has a Planned Parenthood operative as his secretary of health” — but had even more to say about the state conducting a school survey that asked children about their sexual orientation.

“We need to let teachers teach and let the parents be the parents,” Abraham said. “If they want to have that discussion with their children, that's their business. The state should have no role in that agenda of social experimentation.”

Edwards has defended his support for gay rights, arguing that opposition will backfire on his opponents. “Discrimination and prejudice are not Louisiana values,” he said, when asked to respond to Abraham. “I think you have a candidate whose campaign is failing, and he's desperate, and he's trying to go back to some of those social wedge issues that have been used successfully in the past. That is not Louisiana today.”

On Saturday, as Edwards walked around the annual Fried Chicken Festival in New Orleans, his coalition came into view. Chrishelle DuPree, 46, rushed over to get a photo with her governor, even though she'd hated the abortion law.

“Abortion should be a woman's right,” Dupree said. “I totally don't agree with the governor on that. But I won't vote against him because of the abortion law. I was really pissed at first, but he's Catholic, so I understand it, and I can't let get a Republican in office. The hell with that!”

Moments later, the governor took a selfie with Steve Beatty, 64, who'd voted for Edwards in 2015 and then for Trump in 2016.

“I'm a Christian, and I believe every life needs a chance, like the governor,” Beatty explained. “I heard Franklin Graham say the night before the Trump election: You're not voting for Trump, you're voting for conservative values. I feel that way about the governor.”

But Edwards never supported Trump; in the final stretch, Republicans hope for that to make the difference, and point out that no incumbent governor who was forced into a runoff has won it. While Abraham has been massively outspent, his plan to win the runoff was for national attention to swing to Louisiana, and for the president to throw in behind him. Asked about the revelation that Trump had pressured Ukraine's president for dirt on Joe Biden's son, Abraham called it “the liberal media grasping at straws,” something that would not play in Louisiana.

“I want him down here,” Abraham said. “I want him to come down to Louisiana and have one of those MAGA rallies. He's welcome to come as many times as he wants.”

No national Democratic figure would be so welcome in Louisiana. Edwards had cheerfully ignored the party's race for president. Asked about the debate the 2020 candidates were having about Medicare-for-all, he emphasized that the current system was working for Louisiana. Asked about the president, he said he had worked with him plenty.

“I already got more than I can say grace over on my plate,” he said. “He typically doesn't go in the states where he's not going to win, and so I think he would be reluctant to come here. I would remind you that Democrats last year nationwide picked up seven new governorships. And I think the president went to just about all of those states.”

ON THE TRAIL

On Wednesday, the president defended his decision to ask Ukraine's new president for dirt on Joe Biden's son Hunter.

Joe Biden has responded in two ways: calling all of this ridiculous and trying to return the focus to health care. Apart from an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel's show and some tart statements, the former vice president has stuck to his previous campaign plan, attacking the administration for undermining the Affordable Care Act.

“Many Republican legislatures and governors are dodging their duties to their constituents by rejecting Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion opportunity,” he said in a Thursday morning statement. When he has talked about the Republican attempts to investigate Hunter Biden, it has been to talk about how the president's party is afraid of him.

“The reason I’m being attacked is most polls show me beating him by 10 to 15 points,” Biden told donors via speakerphone Tuesday night. “So I’m not at all surprised I’ve become the object of his affection and attention. The attacks on me, they’re going to come and they’re going to go and they’ll soon be forgotten.”

The willingness of Republicans to attack Biden, and justify the president's approach, is raising one of the most important political questions of the primary: Have Democrats figured out what to do when Trump attacks?

Up to now, the president has been less relevant in primary politics than expected. Liberal activists — from the Sunrise Movement to Moms Demand Action to labor leaders — have been driving the policy conversation; the president has made cameos by attacking “socialism” or amplifying stories that ran in conservative media, rarely reaching Democrats, who tend to tune him out.

But the Ukraine story is taking Democrats to territory that to them feels both terrifyingly familiar and worryingly uncertain. Some in the party wonder whether angry voters will rally behind Biden, seeing the attacks as evidence that Trump doesn't want to run against him. Some worry that Republicans could weaponize Hunter Biden the way that they once weaponized Hillary Clinton's private email server.

“There are some Democrats who have 2016 PTSD,” said Rep. Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, one of Biden's first supporters in Congress. “There were legitimate questions with the way that Hillary Clinton handled her email server. But in this case, come on: We're talking about something completely manufactured by a president who just committed the crime of extortion.”

The fight between Trump and Biden is asymmetrical; the president is almost unanimously supported in his party, while Biden's lead in the Democratic primary was slipping even before the Ukraine story. Of the 275 congressional Democrats who are not running for president, just 21 have endorsed Biden.

That's more than have endorsed any other candidate, but it's a fraction of the support Clinton had at this time in the race; by the time news broke about her use of a private email server, a majority of congressional Democrats had already endorsed her. It was in their interest to defend Clinton, whom they always saw as the likely nominee. They are not as sure what will happen to Biden. Even though they believe him, and not Trump, they have seen the president make stuff up and get away with it.

So far, most congressional Democrats and several of Biden's primary rivals have condemned Trump and defended the former vice president. At an appearance in California, Julián Castro directly compared what Trump was doing to the endless negativity of 2016: “Donald Trump is trying to do to Joe Biden what he did to Hillary Clinton; to turn somebody who has given a lifetime of service, and done it honorably, into the victim of false accusations.” Rep. Ro Khanna of California, a co-chair of the Bernie Sanders campaign, said no candidate should amplify what the president was saying about Biden.

“All Democratic candidates need to stand in solidarity against President Trump’s ad hominem attacks on Vice President Biden,” Khanna said. “Trump will smear whoever the Democratic nominee is, and Democrats must be united in rejecting his tawdry politics of hate, lies and personal attacks.”

“I don’t know enough at this point to make any definitive statement,” Sanders said in Iowa on Tuesday when asked whether he had concerns about Hunter Biden. Pressed on whether the controversy over Hunter Biden and Ukraine made Biden a weaker candidate, Sanders demurred: “You make the judgment. You guys write very perceptive articles on these things and I’ll let you make that judgment.” One day later, asked whether her own ethics plan would allow the children of vice presidents to take lucrative foreign jobs, Warren said “no,” then admitted that she had to check the plan again. Neither statement had much solidarity with Biden.

Democratic voters, meanwhile, don't seem to be moving. At a meeting this week of Story County, Iowa, Democrats, opinion of the accusations against Biden — not the substance, but the risk — dovetailed with voters' own candidate preferences. Lisa Heddens, a 55-year-old supervisor, said it was deeply sad to see Biden’s family come under attack. She’d gotten to know the former vice president years earlier, when he got to know her son, who had an intellectual disability.

“He called my son when he was in the hospital. He invited us to the inauguration,” said Heddens, a longtime state legislator. “It is going to be a nasty, nasty election. But I think most of the electorate, most of the people, are tired of this stuff. And I think Joe, in particular, is in a good position to push back against it.”

But other Democrats, with fresh and painful memories of 2016, were more worried. Janet Wahl, 74, said at the same gathering that one reason she was supporting Warren over Biden was that she wanted “new blood” and hated to see Biden dragged into the fray.

“I feel it's horrible to do to anybody, and it’s horrible to do to him in particular,” Wahl said. “But Joe knew what he was getting into. He stepped up to do this again, and he knew how dirty politics could be.”

AD WATCH

Pete Buttigieg, “Your Choice.” The Indiana Democrat's third Iowa spot conceals a negative message inside a positive one. “If you’re happy with the private insurance you’ve got, my plan would let you stick with it — if you want,” he says. “Now, others say it’s Medicare-for-all, or nothing.” This is the third ad Iowans will have seen from a presidential candidate warning them against Medicare-for-all. A spot from Joe Biden cryptically referred to politicians who want to “scrap” the Affordable Care Act, and one from Michael Bennet warned that ending private insurance “makes no sense.”

Tom Steyer, “Village.” The investor-turned-politico's latest ad emphasizes the need for Democrats to flip the Senate, name-checking two Republicans on the ballot next year (Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham) and one who isn't (Chuck Grassley). “It takes an entire village of politicians to rig the system,” Steyer says. “That’s why we need term limits; to make Washington work for you.” Term limits are part of Steyer's government change agenda, alongside national ballot measures that would let voters decide major issues; they have not recently been popular with Democratic voters.

POLL WATCH

California Democratic primary (Berkeley IGS, 2,272 likely voters)

Elizabeth Warren — 29% ( 11)

Joe Biden — 20% (-2)

Bernie Sanders — 19% ( 2)

Kamala Harris — 8% (-5)

Pete Buttigieg — 6% (-4)

Beto O'Rourke — 3% (-)

Amy Klobuchar — 2% ( 1)

Cory Booker — 1% (-)

Michael Bennet — 1% ( 1)

Tulsi Gabbard — 1% ( 1)

Julián Castro — 1% (-)

Of several recent polls that have shown Elizabeth Warren battling Joe Biden for the lead in their primary, this might be the one with the most Warren-friendly news. The reason: California is the first racially diverse primary state where she has shown strength and where neither of her closest competitors has a dominating lead with nonwhite voters.

Here, Warren leads the field by 18 points among white non-Hispanic voters and by 14 points among Asian Americans. Sanders narrowly leads with Latinos, with 28 percent support to 26 percent for Biden and 14 for Warren; Biden leads with black voters, with 32 percent to Warren's 24 percent, Harris's 18 percent and Sanders's 11 percent. (Harris, whose mother immigrated to the United States from India, polls at only 5 percent with Asian Americans.)





Would you be excited if this candidate became the Democratic nominee? (Quinnipiac, 561 Democratic voters)

Elizabeth Warren — 70%

Joe Biden — 56%

Bernie Sanders — 55%

Kamala Harris — 49%

Pete Buttigieg — 46%

Warren's strength over the past month has shaken up some of the story lines about her support and which voters she could or could not appeal to within a Democratic primary. Recent Quinnipiac polls had asked about who voters saw as electable or who had better policy ideas; the excitement question comes at that a different way and, for the moment, finds Warren doing well with Democrats she hadn't appealed to previously.

Among white voters without college degrees and voters making less than $50,000, the percentage of “excited” voters is, respectively, 69 percent and 67 percent; for Sanders, it's 52 percent and 62 percent. By a 60-point margin, white voters with college degrees are excited about a Warren nomination, which clicks with stories about her appeal to white, suburban liberals. The “excitement” margin among those voters for Biden is just seven points; by a 12-point margin, those voters say they would not be excited about a Sanders nomination.

2020

Bernie Sanders. He joined the UAW's picket line in Detroit on Wednesday, two days after Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden had rallied with striking workers, and ahead of a planned visit to a Reno picket line by Pete Buttigieg.

Joe Biden. He has continued to campaign against the Trump administration’s waivers that allow conservative states to limit access to Medicaid, in between attacks from the president about Ukraine; he also announced a wave of endorsements from Iowa teachers as part of “Educators for Biden.”

Kamala Harris. She’s opening a campaign office in Oakland on Sunday, after a wave of polls have showed her falling behind in her home state and even in the Bay Area.

Julián Castro. He’s turning a weekend in Austin, where the Texas Tribune Festival is being held, into a major homecoming: an appearance at a Latino turnout rally, a stop at a voter turnout bus tour, and a “women for Castro” brunch.

Michael Bennet. He’s also speaking at the Texas Tribune Festival, interviewed by MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell.

Amy Klobuchar. She’ll be in Austin over the weekend for the Texas Tribune Festival and the Voto Latino turnout event.

Beto O’Rouke. He’ll round out the Texas Tribune lineup, sitting for a Saturday interview with MSNBC’s Garrett Haake.

John Delaney. He’s making another trip to Iowa, with six weekend stops in six counties in the central part of the state.

Marianne Williamson. She’s spending Thursday and Friday in Las Vegas, joined at one stop by Richard Dreyfuss, who will “offer remarks about the power of civics in American public education.”

WHAT I'M WATCHING

The race for labor's endorsement. Four years ago, as nearly every major union either endorsed Hillary Clinton's nomination or stayed neutral in the Democratic primary, Bernie Sanders got a lot of help from California. The Oakland-based National Nurses United got behind Sanders early and spent millions of dollars to support him; the smaller National Union of Health Care Workers, also based there, endorsed him handily.

This year, NNU hasn't made its pick yet, and the NUHW just finished an interactive endorsement process that ended with a split decision: Warren and Sanders. Candidates gave video interviews, then the union's 15,000 members voted online, with ballot space for three choices. Warren appeared on 61 percent ballots to 50 percent for Sanders, 34 percent for Kamala Harris, 32 percent for Joe Biden, 21 percent for Pete Buttigieg, and 12 percent for a true dark horse: Trump.

The split endorsement was mostly an embarrassment for Harris, who had won the union's support in her California races. It's also a good look at how the momentum of the race is affecting the endorsement process that most unions have only just begun. No candidate looks like a sure thing for the nomination, as Clinton did four years ago. Sanders, a dream candidate for labor in 2015, has lost ground against his rivals, one of whom (Warren) is equally appealing to some labor organizers. Sanders has made solidarity with workers a key component of his campaign, even using his voter contact list to drive support and attention toward strikes.

Still to be determined: whether unions with more conservative membership, such as the building trades, will follow more left-wing unions, or will find Biden's campaign more compelling.

President Trump's congressional agenda -- and specifically, the adminstration's top economic priorities -- may be the first casualty of the impeachment inquiry House Democrats just launched.

Specifically, a reworked North American trade pact — officially the United States-Mexico-Canada deal (USMCA), the administration’s top legislative priority — and a measure to impose new price controls on prescription drugs now face even longer odds this year. And the impeachment showdown raises the stakes for a potential government shutdown in late November, when stopgap funding Trump is expected to sign this week runs out.

The confrontation between the president and the House majority promises to be consuming, leaving little bandwidth or appetite for cooperation on other matters. “Not that there’s a ton now, but there’s going to be less,” says Andy Laperriere, head of U.S. policy research for Cornerstone Macro. “It’s hard to walk and chew gum when impeachment is one of those things. I don’t think they can multitask impeachment and a legislative agenda.”

Investors drew a similar conclusion. The S&P 500 saw its biggest one-day drop in a month, sliding 0.8 percent, as did the Nasdaq. And the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0.5 percent after recovering some earlier losses. It was one of the most volatile trading day in weeks, as investors reacted to gyrations on the impeachment front while also absorbing gloomy news about consumer confidence and the U.S.-China trade war.

“Investors like gridlock, but they don’t like dysfunctional paralysis,” Stephen Myrow of Beacon Policy Advisors tells me. And impeachment “is raising the specter of dysfunctional paralysis,” a dynamic that could doom the USMCA, for example, while presenting new risks, “particularly in the event of a crisis.”

House Democrats haven’t foreclosed on continuing their everyday work while the impeachment inquiry gets underway. Via the Financial Times’s James Politi:

A spokesperson for Richard Neal, House Ways and Means committee chair, says he is ""absolutely committed to continuing"" the USMCA talks, ""regardless of any other congressional activity"" — James Politi (@JamesPoliti) September 24, 2019

But White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham signaled the administration will no longer work with House Democrats on matters of common interest. “In a far departure from all of the work and results of this President, House Democrats have destroyed any chances of legislative progress for the people of this country by continuing to focus all their energy on partisan political attacks,” she said in a statement.

Trump sent a similar message in a tweet:

The Democrats are so focused on hurting the Republican Party and the President that they are unable to get anything done because of it, including legislation on gun safety, lowering of prescription drug prices, infrastructure, etc. So bad for our Country! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019

Washington analysts who help decode political developments for Wall Street investors reported a heavy volume of calls as clients attempted to make sense of the latest turmoil. Analysts said even amid rapidly moving and highly uncertain circumstances, the implications for a corporate priority such as the USMCA al are clear enough.

“From a purely market perspective, I think the impeachment conversation is being viewed as just another dynamic that will weigh on market sentiment until there is clarity on both the resolution and the longer-term implications,” Compass Point’s Isaac Boltansky said in an email.

Negotiations over the trade deal had showed signs of progress in recent days. Robert Lighthizer, Trump’s trade chief, was in talks with a working group of House Democratic lawmakers appointed by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). They were trying to forge a compromise on Democratic demands for stronger labor, environmental and enforcement provisions — changes Pelosi demanded before agreeing to put the measure to a floor vote. “Before this weekend, USMCA was looking good,” one top House Democratic aide tells me.

But revelations about Trump’s call with his Ukrainian counterpart — and pressure the president applied for him to probe former vice president Joe Biden— reset the fall agenda. In a sign of how dramatically circumstances have shifted, some freshmen Democrats from swing districts who had been agitating for a USMCA vote in part to have a bipartisan accomplishment to tout at home became the driving force for an impeachment inquiry. Public calls from that cohort to zero in on Trump’s dealings with Ukraine dissolved Pelosi’s months-long resistance to taking the next step against the president.

""Perhaps Pelosi will schedule a vote on USMCA this year, but that strikes us as a political bridge too far,"" Cowen Washington Research Group's Chris Krueger wrote in a note. ""Ratify Trump's signature trade achievement while calling for his impeachment?""

MARKET MOVERS

— Consumer confidence falls amid trade fears: “U.S. consumer confidence ebbed in September as an escalation in trade tensions fanned concerns about business and labor market conditions, a potentially worrying signal for consumer spending, which has been driving the economy,” Reuters’s Lucia Mutikani reports.

“The relatively downbeat survey from the Conference Board ... mirrors other confidence surveys and could renew financial market fears of a recession that had been assuaged somewhat by strong August retail sales, industrial production and housing data.”

""The overall measure remains elevated,"" Bloomberg's William Edwards notes. But the drop represented the biggest slip since the beginning of the year. And it was steeper than economists expected.

— Kashkari: The Fed is partially responsible for the slowdown. The Post's Heather Long: ""Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari says two factors are holding the U.S. economy back right now: President Trump’s trade war and high interest rates. The current U.S. interest rate is a bit below 2 percent after the Fed lowered it slightly last week. Kashkari would like to see the rate cut to under 1.5 percent to stimulate the economy.

""'I’m concerned that we’ve needlessly raised interest rates over the past three years and put the economy into a more dangerous position that makes it more vulnerable to shocks that could hit us,' Kashkari told The Washington Post in an interview Tuesday. 'Why are we trying to contract the economy?'""

— Boris Johnson defiant after court ruling. Bloomberg's Tim Ross and Kitty Donaldson: ""A defiant Boris Johnson hit back at the U.K.’s top judges and vowed to take the country out of the European Union next month, despite suffering an unprecedented legal defeat over his Brexit strategy in the highest court in the land. In a sweeping rebuke to the prime minister, Britain’s Supreme Court ruled that Johnson broke the law when he decided to suspend Parliament for five weeks in the run-up to the Oct. 31 deadline for leaving the EU.""

What's next: ""The ruling marks an extraordinary constitutional moment and an unprecedented political crisis for the U.K. It blows a hole in Johnson’s political authority and calls into question his ability to remain in office as the Queen’s principal adviser. Senior politicians, including the former Conservative Prime Minister John Major, demanded that he apologize to Parliament. While the opposition was quick to call for his resignation, Johnson’s aides say he won’t go.""

TRADE FLY-AROUND:

— Trump laces into China in U.N. speech. USA Today's John Fritze: ""Trump accused China of 'gaming' the global trade system as he defended tariffs that his critics say have put the U.S. economy at risk of a recession. He repeated long-held criticism that the World Trade Organization is giving preferential treatment to China.

""Chinese delegates sat stone-faced as Trump also briefly praised protesters in Hong Kong this year who are opposing Beijing's tightening grip on the semi-autonomous city. 'We want balanced trade that is both fair and reciprocal,' Trump said. Trump said that while he wants a trade deal with China, he would 'not accept a bad deal for the American people.'""

Chinese foreign minister: ""Endless troubles"" if the countries delink. WSJ's Tyler Blint-Welsh: ""Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the so-called decoupling of the world’s two largest economies would have disastrous results and that China and the U.S. need to work cooperatively through their disagreements. Mr. Wang’s comments came as the U.S. and China remain at an impasse in a more than yearlong trade war, one that some analysts say could lead to a widening chasm between the two countries.

""'Decoupling from China’s economy would be to decouple from opportunities, and the future,' said Mr. Wang, who in the past has called the U.S.’s and China’s interests 'inseparable.'""

— Google, Starbucks fight E.U.: “Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Starbucks Corp. scored legal victories against European Union regulators,"" the Wall Street Journal’s Valentina Pop and Sam Schechner report, ""in court rulings that restrict the reach of the bloc’s privacy orders and deal a blow to its competition czar as she prepares to expand her regulatory powers.""

“The European Court of Justice ruled that Google doesn’t generally have to apply the EU’s ‘right to be forgotten’ to versions of its search engine accessed outside the bloc’s borders, though judges left the door open for European regulators to order it to do so in specific cases.”

POCKET CHANGE

— More workers to qualify for OT: “Workers making less than $35,500 are now entitled to mandatory overtime pay from their employers, under new rules announced by the Department of Labor. The new rules will take effect at the beginning of 2020,” my colleague Eli Rosenberg reports.

“The rules raise the salary threshold for workers for whom overtime pay — 1.5 times a worker’s typical hourly rate — is required from $23,600, a standard set in 2004 during the George W. Bush presidency. The Department of Labor under President Obama tried to raise the threshold to $47,000, a shift that would have given overtime pay to four million additional workers. But that proposal was met with strong opposition from business groups like the Chamber of Commerce, as well as Republicans.”

— Saudis consider doubling history’s largest IPO: “After attacks on its oil infrastructure, Saudi Arabia is moving forward with the much-anticipated initial public offering of its state-owned oil company and considering a proposal to offer investors a much bigger stake in the company than previously planned, people familiar with the matter said,” the WSJ’s Summer Said and Julie Steinberg report.

“The Saudi Royal Court and its advisers have been debating an eventual float of as much as 10% of the Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Aramco, doubling the country’s longstanding public intention to list just 5%, according to these people. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ’s plan to expand what has already been billed as the world’s largest IPO suggests his often outsize ambitions are undeterred, even as the country’s oil giant attempts a full recovery from recent attacks on its largest facilities and faces risks to its valuation from subdued oil prices.”

— Pharma companies are ramping up their lobbying efforts: “Worried drugmakers are stepping up efforts to blunt proposals in Washington that they view as some of the most serious threats to their pricing power in recent years,” the WSJ’s Peter Loftus reports.

“Pharmaceutical industry trade organizations and outside groups are spending millions of dollars on advertisements attacking the proposals, which would peg drug prices in the U.S. to prices paid overseas and force companies to pay rebates if a drug’s price increases by more than the rate of inflation … Industry executives and lobbyists are urging friendly lawmakers to pass legislation blocking the plans. They are also pushing administration officials to pursue measures that would pressure industry middlemen such as pharmacy-benefit managers to provide some relief on patients’ costs without directly curbing drugmakers’ pricing power.”

This quote: “We’re facing the stiffest political headwinds in the history of the industry,” James Greenwood, president of the trade group Biotechnology Innovation Organization, told the WSJ. BIO’s member companies include Amgen Inc., Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer Inc.

— WeWork’s CEO is out: WeWork co-founder and Chief Executive Adam Neumann ""was forced to step down and cede control of the shared-office startup after its much-anticipated initial public offering was derailed, capping a swift fall from grace for the leader of one of the country’s most valuable startups,” the WSJ’s Eliot Brown, Dana Cimilluca, David Benoit and Maureen Farrell report.

“Mr. Neumann will also cede majority control of the company, with his voting shares reduced to 3-to-1 from 10-to-1, the people said. The company earlier this month had reversed a recent enhancement to Mr. Neumann’s voting power that allotted him 20 votes for each share he held.”

The situation: “Mr. Neumann’s position at the company became tenuous after We postponed an IPO earlier this month amid concerns from prospective investors about its governance and ability to reverse big losses. That skepticism has placed a major dent in the company’s expected valuation, which has plummeted from $47 billion earlier this year to as low as $15 billion.”

— Hedge fun runs into Trump’s vaping ban: “Jason Mudrick has been enjoying a run this year that most other hedge fund managers only dream of,” Bloomberg News’s Sridhar Natarajan and Josh Saul report. “His flagship fund at Mudrick Capital Management is up 32% on soaring valuations for one of the largest players in the U.S. vaping market. Now, that same bet could pose a headache for the maverick investor.”

“About $800 million, or almost 30% of the assets overseen by his firm, are tied to E-cigarette maker NJOY Holdings Inc., according to people with knowledge of the matter. Mudrick’s controlling stake in the vaping venture has powered pretty much all of the gains in his flagship fund this year at a time when many other managers are posting tepid returns.”

MONEY ON THE HILL

— Sanders calls for 8% wealth tax: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) ""unveiled a proposal to create a new tax on the wealth of the richest Americans, including a steep tax on billionaires that could greatly diminish their fortunes,” the New York Times’s Thomas Kaplan reports.

The details: “Mr. Sanders’s plan to tax accumulated wealth, not just income, is particularly aggressive in how it would erode the fortunes of billionaires. His tax would cut in half the wealth of the typical billionaire after 15 years, according to two economists who worked with the Sanders campaign on the plan.”

“Mr. Sanders would use the money generated by his wealth tax to fund the housing plan he released last week and a forthcoming plan for universal child care, as well as to help pay for 'Medicare for all.' ” But Sanders made clear the effort is also meant to be punitive: ""I don’t think that billionaires should exist,” he said. “This proposal does not eliminate billionaires, but it eliminates a lot of the wealth that billionaires have, and I think that’s exactly what we should be doing.”

He zeroed in on an CNBC report explaining how hyper-rich married couples could dodge Warren's wealth tax proposal by getting divorced: ""The Wall Street-CNBC echo chamber is dangerously out of touch,"" Kelleher wrote in an email. ""After decades of redistribution from everyone else up to the .01%, the handful of unimaginably super-wealthy Americans with $2 BILLION are going to get divorced to save $10 million in taxes!

Joseph Maguire, acting director of national intelligence, spent more than three hours Thursday morning before the House Intelligence Committee, where lawmakers questioned him about the complaint, which revealed that Trump had pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son.

7:00 p.m. Top Democrats accuse Trump of trying to intimidate whistleblower to obstruct justice

Democratic Reps. Eliot L. Engel (N.Y.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), chairman of the Oversight Committee, issued a joint statement condemning Trump’s comments that seem to threaten the whistleblower’s life.

AD

At a private event, Trump called whistleblower a spy.

“You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now,” Trump said.

AD

The Democratic leaders said the president’s remarks were akin to obstructing the House impeachment inquiry by seeking to intimidate the whistleblower from cooperating.

“We condemn the President’s attacks, and we invite our Republican counterparts to do the same because Congress must do all it can to protect this whistleblower, and all whistleblowers,” they said. “Threats of violence from the leader of our country have a chilling effect on the entire whistleblower process, with grave consequences for our democracy and national security.”

6:30 p.m.: New polls find nation divided over impeachment inquiry

AD

Two flash polls found mixed reactions to the House of Representatives’ opening of an impeachment inquiry and the seriousness of the whistleblower’s claims.

An NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist poll conducted on Wednesday found 49 percent of Americans supported opening the impeachment inquiry while 46 percent were opposed, though independents tilted in disapproval, 50 percent to 44 percent.

A separate HuffPost-YouGov poll conducted from Tuesday to Thursday found 47 percent saying “Trump should be impeached and removed from office,” slightly higher than 43 percent in the same poll earlier this month. But that increase was driven more by increased support among Democrats than independents.

The NPR-PBS-Marist poll found 50 percent saying the impeachment inquiry is “a serious matter” compared with 48 percent who called it “just politics.” But a slightly larger 55 percent said the official notes about President Trump’s call with president of Ukraine is a serious matter.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) offered a blunt assessment of the congressional Republicans who have dodged reporters’ questions about the whistleblower complaint by saying they didn’t read it.

“There is almost no excuse for a member of Congress to have not read the whistleblower report by now. It’s a few pages. This is literally our jobs,” she tweeted. “If you don’t have the commitment to be here and do the work, cut your fancy fundraisers & make the time, or quit.”

5:50 p.m.: Schiff says he’s ‘deeply concerned’ about whistleblower’s safety

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said he is concerned about the safety of the whistleblower who raised the alarm about Trump’s call with Zelensky, citing “repugnant threats” made by the president earlier Thursday.

“I’m deeply concerned about it,” Schiff told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer when asked about the whistleblower’s safety. “And obviously, we’re going to do everything we can … to protect the whistleblower’s identity. But given those real, repugnant threats coming from the president, I have a real concern about this.”

Hours earlier, in a meeting with U.S. diplomats in New York, Trump had likened the whistleblower to a spy and suggested that the person should be punished for his or her actions.

Schiff also dismissed criticism from Republicans who have seized on his opening statement at Thursday’s hearing, in which he offered what he has described as a “parody” of Trump’s call with Zelensky.

“Oh, I don’t think it’s making light of the situation,” Schiff said on CNN. “And I certainly wouldn’t want to suggest that there’s anything comical about this.”

He added that it was accurate to say, as he did in the hearing, that Trump was “speaking like an organized crime boss.”

5:30 p.m.: Former Ukraine prosecutor says Hunter Biden ‘did not violate anything’

A former top Ukrainian prosecutor, whose allegations were at the heart of the dirt-digging effort by Rudolph W. Giuliani, said Thursday he believed that Hunter Biden did not run afoul of any laws in Ukraine.

“From the perspective of Ukrainian legislation, he did not violate anything,” former Ukrainian prosecutor general Yuri Lutsenko told The Washington Post in his first interview since the disclosure of a whistleblower complaint alleging pressure by Trump on Zelensky.

AD

Lutsenko’s comments about Hunter Biden — which echo what he told Bloomberg News in May — were significant, because Trump and his personal attorney Giuliani have sought to stir up suspicions about both Hunter and Joe Biden’s conduct in Ukraine in recent weeks.

4:30 p.m.: American Academy of Diplomacy says Trump’s statements about Yovanovich are cause for ‘great concern’

The American Academy of Diplomacy, a nonprofit that supports the work of U.S. diplomats, put out a strongly worded statement condemning the disparaging comments Trump made about Marie Yovanovitch, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, during his call with the Ukrainian president.

According to the rough transcript of the call between Trump and Zelensky provided by the White House, Trump said, “The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just want to let you know that.”

AD

Then Trump added, “She’s going to go through some things.”

The nonprofit’s chairman, Thomas Pickering, and its president, Ronald Neumann, said Trump’s comments causes them “great concern.”

Pickering worked in the State Department and as an ambassador under every president from Richard M. Nixon to Bill Clinton, while Neumann served as ambassador to Afghanistan and Bahrain under President George W. Bush and Algeria under Clinton.

“The threatening tone of this statement is deeply troubling,” they said in a joint statement. “It suggests actions outside of and contrary to the procedures and standards of a professional service whose officers, like their military counterparts, take an oath to uphold the Constitution. Whatever views the Administration has of Ambassador Yovanovitch’s performance, we call on the Administration to make clear that retaliation for political reasons will not be tolerated.

Yovanovitch was called back from her post in Ukraine in May, a move that Democrats have called a “political hit job.”

4:10 p.m.: Pompeo declines to say whether State Department told Giuliani to reach out to Ukraine

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declined to say Thursday whether the State Department directed Giuliani to contact Zelensky and his aides.

Giuliani said in a Fox News Channel interview earlier this week that he was “operating at the request of the State Department” when he reached out to Ukrainian officials about investigating Biden.

But in a news conference in New York, Pompeo dodged a question on Giuliani’s claim. He said he had yet to read the whistleblower’s complaint, telling reporters that he “read the first couple of paragraphs and then got busy today.” And he maintained that “to the best of my knowledge,” the behavior of State Department officials was “entirely appropriate.”

“We have tried to use this opportunity to create a better relationship between the United States and Ukraine, to build on the opportunities, to tighten our relationship, to help end corruption in Ukraine,” Pompeo said. “This was what President Zelensky ran on. We’re hopeful that we can help him execute and achieve that.”

4 p.m.: Clinton says Trump’s efforts to undercut Biden mirror his attacks against her in 2016

In an interview taped before Pelosi officially announced her support for an impeachment inquiry into Trump, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton described the latest developments regarding Trump’s alleged actions as “incredibly troubling.” She said Trump’s attempts to damage Biden’s 2020 chances are similar to his efforts to undercut her in 2016.

“The most outrageously false things were said about me,” Clinton said in an interview with CBS’s “Sunday Morning.” “And unfortunately, enough people believed them. So this is an effort to sow these falsehoods against Biden. And I don’t care if you’re for the [Democrats] or you’re a Republican, when the president of the United States — who has taken an oath to protect and defend the Constitution — uses his position to, in effect, extort a foreign government for his political purposes, I think that is very much what the founders worried about in high crimes and misdemeanors.”

Later in the interview, Clinton called Trump “a clear and present danger.”

The interview will air in its entirety on Sunday.

3:50 p.m.: Biden campaign says Trump’s actions extend from ‘fear’ that the former vice president will beat him in 2020

The Biden campaign responded to the latest revelations in Trump’s alleged efforts to seek incriminating information from Ukraine about the former vice president, claiming that Trump’s alleged actions are “all borne from his deep, fully substantiated fear that Joe Biden will beat him in November 2020.”

“An intelligence community whistleblower said, ‘I have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election,’” Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, said in a statement.

“An hour after the report was made public, the Acting Director of National Intelligence called this report ‘urgent and important’ and ‘totally unprecedented.’ And now we know that President Trump’s response to all of this was to privately issue a thinly veiled threat this morning to execute the national security professionals who followed their oath to uphold the Constitution by bringing this to light.”

Bedingfield added that Trump’s “abuse of power makes him one of the most divisive, unfit individuals to occupy the Oval Office in our nation’s history.”

3:30 p.m.: Trump compares whistleblower to a ‘spy’

In remarks at a meeting with staffers for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations on Thursday, Trump likened the whistleblower to a spy and suggested that the person should be punished for his or her actions.

He told staffers that “basically, that person never saw the report, never saw the call, he never saw the call — heard something and decided that he or she, or whoever the hell they saw — they’re almost a spy.”

“I want to know who’s the person, who’s the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that’s close to a spy,” Trump said, according to audio of his remarks posted by the Los Angeles Times and confirmed to The Washington Post by a person in the room. “You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.”

At a separate event with campaign donors at New York City’s Cipriani restaurant on Thursday, Trump waved a copy of the rough transcript of his call with Zelensky and boasted that it was good news for the GOP because it had prompted a flood of donations.

“This is the greatest thing that has ever happened to the Republican Party,” Trump said, according to an attendee.

When the crowd chanted “four more years,” the president responded by joking that they shouldn’t stop there.

“If you really want their heads to explode, you should chant eight more years,” Trump said.

2:30 p.m.: Timeline: The alarming pattern of actions by Trump included in whistleblower allegations

Six weeks after it was submitted, a complaint from an intelligence community whistleblower has been declassified and released publicly. Part of the complaint centers on the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky. The whistleblower complaint, filed more than a month earlier, accurately captures the content of that call, lending validity to the rest of the assertions in the complaint.

With that in mind, we’ve pulled out the significant dates mentioned in the whistleblower complaint to give a sense of how the effort by Trump and Giuliani to elicit an investigation in Ukraine unfolded.

1:30 p.m.: Number of House members supportive of impeachment inquiry stands at 220

The number of House members who support an impeachment inquiry into Trump has grown slightly to 220, according to a Washington Post tally.

The figure includes 219 Democrats and one independent member.

Of those, 27 have gone a step further and said they support impeaching the president.

The ranks of Democrats calling for an impeachment inquiry swelled in the past week, culminating Tuesday when Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced a formal inquiry.

1 p.m.: Trump arrives back in Washington

President Trump landed in Washington Thursday afternoon — and immediately lashed out at Democrats over their continued scrutiny of his phone call with Zelensky.

It was an “absolutely perfect phone call,” Trump told reporters shortly after getting off the plane.

He argued that Pelosi has been “hijacked by the radical left,” renewing his attacks on the speaker of the House after she announced her support for an impeachment inquiry.

1 p.m.: Schiff says Democrats are ‘determined to get to the bottom of this’

Schiff said his committee would work through an upcoming two-week recess as it continues to probe Trump’s interactions with Zelensky.

“We are determined to get to the bottom of this,” Schiff said, suggesting the committee would interview multiple witnesses, including the whistleblower.

The committee also wants to learn more about the roles of Attorney General William P. Barr and Giuliani among others, Schiff said.

Schiff spoke to reporters shortly after his panel adjourned after hearing from Maguire for more than three hours.

12:50 p.m.: Trump lashes out at Schiff after hearing wraps up

Trump took to Twitter shortly after the House Intelligence Committee hearing wrapped up, taking aim at its chairman and dismissing the whistleblower report as “second hand information.”

“Adam B. Schiff has zero credibility. Another fantasy to hurt the Republican Party!” Trump tweeted.

Adam Schiff has zero credibility. Another fantasy to hurt the Republican Party! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2019

The tweet came as Schiff (D-Calif.) was fielding questions following the hearing from reporters, one of whom asked about Trump’s tweet.

“I’m always flattered when I’m attacked by someone of the president’s character,” Schiff responded.

In a separate tweet, Trump sought to play down the seriousness of the allegations of the whistleblower, who acknowledged no firsthand knowledge of Trump’s actions but said the complaint was informed by “more than half a dozen U.S. officials.”

“A whistleblower with second hand information? Another Fake News Story! See what was said on the very nice, no pressure, call. Another Witch Hunt!” Trump wrote.

Later, Trump targeted Schiff again on Twitter, writing: “Liddle’ Adam B. Schiff, who has worked unsuccessfully for 3 years to hurt the Republican Party and President, has just said that the Whistleblower, even though he or she only had second hand information, “is credible.” How can that be with zero info and a known bias. Democrat Scam!”

12:40 p.m.: Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, voices support for impeachment inquiry

Phil Scott on Thursday became the nation’s first Republican governor to voice support for the House’s impeachment inquiry against Trump.

“I believe we need to figure out what exactly did happen, establish the facts, and let the facts drive us from there to where we go,” Scott, who has been a frequent Trump critic, said at a news conference in Vermont.

12:30 p.m.: Lewandowski denies having conversations with White House about leading impeachment team

Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s former campaign manager, denied a CNN report that he has had discussions with the White House about potentially leading the president’s impeachment team.

“For the last five years, I have done my best to help this president in any capacity that he has asked me,” Lewandowski said in a phone interview with The Washington Post. “But I have had no conversation with anyone at the White House regarding this.”

Lewandowski signaled, however, that he is open to helping Trump fight back against impeachment in whatever way the president requests.

“If the president asks me to push back on the fake impeachment narrative, I will do that in any way I can,” Lewandowski said.

CNN reported earlier Thursday that Lewandowski, who is mulling a U.S. Senate bid, representing his home state of New Hampshire, has had recent conversations with White House officials about taking an administration position as the impeachment battle ramps up.

12:20 p.m.: Maguire hearing wraps up

The House Intelligence Committee hearing concluded Thursday afternoon after more than three hours of heated questioning of Maguire by lawmakers.

Maguire is expected to go behind closed doors later Thursday to address the Senate Intelligence Committee.

12:10 p.m.: Republicans plan another House vote on impeachment authorization

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said he will force another House vote on authorizing an impeachment investigation, in a move designed to put pressure on Democrats on the issue.

“Every member owes it to their constituents — their constituents are the ones who lend their voice to the members for two years,” McCarthy said at his weekly news conference. “And they should be very clear on where they stand.”

On Thursday morning, the number of House members backing an impeachment inquiry had passed the halfway mark, with 218 House Democrats and one independent member supporting at least opening an inquiry into whether Trump committed “high crimes and misdemeanors.”

But some Democrats are still holding out, including several in Republican-leaning districts.

12 p.m.: Senate panel debates withholding State Department funds

The Senate Appropriations Committee spent some time Thursday morning debating an amendment that would have withheld some State Department funds until $448 million in security assistance is released for Ukraine.

Ultimately, the committee didn’t vote on the amendment after its author — Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) — withdrew it. Murphy said he didn’t want to set a bad precedent and wanted to retain bipartisan agreement on the committee. He also said he trusted a commitment from Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) to ensure funding for Ukraine. Graham chairs the Appropriations subcommittee on state and foreign operations.

“I accept Senator Graham’s commitment to continue to work on this,” Murphy said. “I would rather have us stay together united, Republicans and Democrats, speaking for the importance of continuing to fund aid to Ukraine, and I agree with him that even without this language, when we spend money, when we appropriate it, the president is legally obligated to spend it.”

Underlying the discussion was Trump’s decision to hold up security assistance for Ukraine until recently, as revelations emerged about his phone call with the president of Ukraine in which Trump suggested that Biden should be investigated by authorities in that country.

Graham insisted that Trump was withholding funds as a means to get other countries to pay more. Murphy raised questions about that explanation.

Several Democrats said that under the circumstances, there was a need for statutory language requiring money appropriated for Ukraine to be spent.

“The plot has thickened dramatically,” said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.).

But the discussion ended without specific resolution.

“I just want to find a way to tell the Ukraine we’re with them and not screw up everything else,” Graham said.

11:45 a.m.: Trump’s other Ukraine problem: New concern about his business

Buried in the controversy over Trump’s phone call with Zelensky was an effort by the Ukrainian leader at currying favor with Trump through his business.

“Actually, last time I traveled to the United States, I stayed in New York near Central Park, and I stayed at the Trump Tower,” Zelensky told Trump, according to a rough transcript of the July 25 call released Wednesday.

Zelensky’s comments mark the first known example of the kind of interaction Democrats and government ethics experts had warned about when Trump took office: that foreign leaders would try to influence Trump by spending money at his properties and telling him about it.

Other Ukrainian officials have also patronized Trump properties. A top Zelensky aide met at Trump’s D.C. hotel in July with Trump attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, a frequent patron of the hotel himself, according to the New York Times. A lobbyist who registered as an agent of Zelensky’s with the U.S. government hosted a $1,900 event at the D.C. hotel in April, according to a federal filing.

11:40 a.m.: Lawmakers urge Congress not to go on recess

The House is scheduled to leave town on Friday for a two-week recess. But several Democrats are arguing that lawmakers should remain in Washington amid the intensifying focus on Trump’s conduct and the whistleblower complaint.

“Trump clearly sees the Oval Office as his campaign office,” Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) said in a tweet. “We cannot let the occupant make a mockery of our Constitution any longer. Congress must cancel the upcoming recess so we can finally impeach this president.”

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) also said that “Congress must not leave for recess tomorrow.”

“If we are committed to holding Trump accountable and passing something on gun violence, we have to keep working here in DC,” he said in a tweet. “The stakes are too high.”

The liberal group Indivisible said in a statement earlier this week that Pelosi should cancel recess “and get to a vote on articles of impeachment as soon as humanly possible.”

11:15 a.m.: Pelosi accuses the White House of a “coverup”

Pointing to the whistleblower’s report during remarks to reporters late Thursday morning, Pelosi repeatedly accused the White House of having engaged in a “coverup.”

She was responding to claims by the whistleblower from the U.S. intelligence community that not only did Trump misuse his office for personal gain and endanger national security, but that unidentified White House officials had tried to hide that conduct.

According to the complaint, White House officials were so alarmed by Trump’s call with Zelensky that they sought to limit access to its written record.

“Their actions are a coverup,” Pelosi said at her weekly press briefing. “It’s not only happened that one time. My understanding is it may have happened before.”

Pelosi also said that there was no timeline on the impeachment inquiry announced earlier this week and that Trump would have an opportunity to present exculpatory information.

“There is no rush to judgment,” Pelosi said.

She said the episode involving Ukraine would take precedence in the impeachment inquiry.

“We are at a different level of lawlessness that is self-evident to the American people,” Pelosi said.

11 a.m.: Schumer says Senate will serve as ‘solemn jurors of our democracy’ if House impeaches Trump

In remarks as the Senate opened Thursday morning, Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) called for lawmakers to place the best interests of the country, not their political parties, front and center as they weigh their next steps following the release of the whistleblower’s complaint.

“We have a responsibility to consider the facts that emerge squarely and with the best interest of our country — not our party — in our hearts,” Schumer said. “We have a responsibility not to rush to final judgment or overstate the case — not to let ourselves be ruled by passion, but by reason.”

He added that “if the House at the end of its inquiry sees fit to accuse the president of impeachable offenses, we in the Senate will act as jury.”

“And our role as the solemn jurors of democracy demands that we place fidelity to the country and fidelity to the Constitution above all else,” he said.

10:30 a.m.: Trump campaign says Democrats are the ones interfering in the 2020 election

A spokesman for Trump’s reelection campaign said Thursday morning that it wasn’t Trump who sought to interfere in the 2020 elections — but Democrats.

“All of this amounts to Democrats interfering in the 2020 election by attempting to block @realDonaldTrump from running for re-election,” Tim Murtaugh, the communications director for Trump’s campaign, wrote on Twitter. “They want to deny Americans the opportunity to vote to re-elect the President. They know they can’t beat him, so they have to try to impeach.”

10:15 a.m.: House Republicans highlight 20-year-old clips of Democrats opposing President Bill Clinton’s impeachment

As House Democrats sought to build a case for impeachment against Trump, House Republicans were using their Twitter account to share two-decade-old video clips of Democrats taking issue with the impeachment of President Bill Clinton.

The House Republican conference account shared clips of more than a half-dozen lawmakers speaking out against Clinton’s impeachment in 1998, with some of them complaining about a partisan process seeking to undo the will of voters.

One video depicted Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), currently the chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, speaking on the House floor.

“I am greatly disappointed in the raw, unmasked, unbridled hatred and meanness that drives this impeachment coup d’etat. The unapologetic disregard for the voice of the people,” she said.

Others Democrats highlighted in the clips included Pelosi, now-House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (Md.), now-Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.), Rep. Jim McGovern (Mass.), Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (Tex.) and Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (Conn.).

9:45 a.m.: Democratic White House hopefuls start weighing in on whistleblower complaint

Democratic White House contenders have started weighing in on the whistleblower complaint, with one — former congressman Beto O’Rourke (Tex.) — calling on the House to cancel its upcoming two-week recess.

“The House should cancel its break and start impeachment proceedings now,” O’Rourke said in a tweet. “As the whistleblower made clear: Every day Trump is in office, our democracy is less safe. We can’t wait to act.”

Rep. Tim Ryan (Ohio) shared on Twitter that he had read the report.

“It’s as straightforward as can be,” Ryan said, alleging it detailed “third-rate, banana republic behavior.”

“I can’t believe my Republican colleagues are going to ignore this,” Ryan said in another tweet. “Would they if our President was an Democrat?”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) also weighed in, writing on Twitter: “Donald Trump solicited foreign interference in our elections from the Oval Office. He attempted to cover up his actions. And his appointees intervened, against the law, to attempt to suppress this whistleblower complaint.”

Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), meanwhile, highlighted a paragraph in the report and offered her assessment: “This is a coverup.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) later asserted in a statement that the whistleblower complaint was “only the tip of an iceberg of corrupt, illegal and immoral behavior by this president.”

“What the House must do is thoroughly investigate Trump’s cover-up of this call and his other attempts to use government resources to help his re-election campaign,” he said.

9:20 a.m.: White House dismisses whistleblower complaint as ‘third-hand accounts’

Shortly after the whistleblower complaint was made public, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham issued a statement.

“Nothing has changed with the release of this complaint, which is nothing more than a collection of third-hand accounts of events and cobbled-together press clippings — all of which shows nothing improper,” she said.

9:15 a.m.: Whistleblower claimed Trump abused his office and that White House officials tried to cover it up

The House Intelligence Committee has released the whistleblower complaint at the heart of the burgeoning controversy over Trump’s July phone call with the Ukrainian president — an explosive document that claims not only that Trump misused his office for personal gain, but that unidentified White House officials tried to hide that fact.

“In the course of my official duties, I have received information from multiple U.S. government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election,” the whistleblower wrote in the complaint dated Aug. 12. “This interference includes, among other things, pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the President’s main domestic political rivals. The President’s personal lawyer, Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani, is a central figure in this effort. Attorney General (William P.) Barr appears to be involved as well.”

8:45 a.m.: Trump lashes out at Democrats as whistleblower complaint is released

Minutes after a whistleblower complaint was made public, Trump lashed out at Democrats in a tweet written in all capital letters in which he accused them of trying to destroy the Republican Party “AND ALL THAT IT STANDS FOR.”

“STICK TOGETHER, PLAY THEIR GAME, AND FIGHT HARD REPUBLICANS. OUR COUNTRY IS AT STAKE!” he counseled members of his party.

The tweet was in response to a whistleblower from the U.S. intelligence community who alleged that Trump had improperly pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son.

8:10 a.m.: Sarah Sanders argues impeachment drive helps Trump politically

Former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders argued Thursday that House Democrats have given Trump a political boost by launching a formal impeachment inquiry.

“I think that it’s one of the dumbest and most ridiculous political moves that we’ve seen in history, how they have forced impeachment over this issue,” Sanders said during an appearance on Fox News, where she is now a contributor.

“All this is doing is helping fuel his campaign,” Sanders said of the Democrats’ move. “They’re raising more money, they’re rallying his base, and they’re unifying the Republican Party in a way that only they can by attacking this president the way they do time and time again.”

7:30 a.m.: Trump unleashes spate of morning tweets

The president asserted Thursday that the stock market would crash if Democrats followed through with impeaching him, a warning sent in the midst of a morning spate of tweets and retweets about the inquiry announced this week by Pelosi.

In one tweet, Trump highlighted a Fox Business Network report with the headline: “Stocks hit session lows after Pelosi calls for impeachment inquiry.”

“If they actually did this the markets would crash,” Trump wrote in response. “Do you think it was luck that got us to the best Stock Market and Economy in our history. It wasn’t!”

Trump also highlighted a tweet by his daughter Ivanka, a White House adviser, in which she thanked him for his work and included a photo of her father pumping his fist.

“So cute! Her father is under siege, for no reason, since his first day in office!” Trump wrote.

In another, he wrote: “THE GREATEST SCAM IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS!”

6:30 a.m.: Biden suggests a motive for Trump reaching out to Ukraine

Speaking at a fundraiser Wednesday night in Los Angeles, Biden said there was no proof of Trump’s allegation that he and his son Hunter Biden had conflicts of interest while he served as vice president.

“This is not about me, and it really isn’t because not a single publication said anything he has ever said about me or my son is true,” Biden said. “Everyone has gone and researched it and said it’s not true.”

Biden suggested that Trump asked Zelensky to investigate him and his son because “70-something polls show that I’ll kick his … toes.” The audience burst into laughter.

6:15 a.m.: Some House Democrats fret as Pelosi forges ahead with impeachment

As his fellow House Democrats moved en masse toward impeaching Trump after months of hesitation, Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey could only watch in bewilderment.

“I don’t get surprised often,” the freshman moderate said Wednesday, less than 24 hours after Pelosi dropped her own qualms and launched the House’s official impeachment inquiry targeting Trump. “But really, truly, I just was like, ‘Wow.’ It happened so quickly.”

As other Democrats proclaimed unity and resolve after Pelosi described the “dishonorable fact of the president’s betrayal of his oath of office,” pledging to move quickly toward impeachment articles, Van Drew stood with a group of Democrats who say they continue to have reservations and fear a rash impeachment could obliterate the rest of the party’s governing agenda, improve Trump’s chances of reelection and imperil their own.

6 a.m.: Biden edges closer to calling for impeachment on ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!’

Biden edged closer to calling for impeachment on Wednesday night, pointing to a rough transcript of a conversation between Trump and Ukraine’s president as evidence that Trump is likely to have committed “an impeachable offense.”

Biden, who had stopped short of calling for the president to be ousted earlier this week, adjusted his stance after the White House shared the details of a 30-minute phone call Trump made to Zelensky in July. According to the 2,000-word rough transcript, Trump repeatedly suggested that Zelensky investigate Biden, offering help from the Justice Department and raising the possibility of inviting the foreign leader to the White House.

“Based on the material that they acknowledged today, it seems to me it’s awful hard to avoid the conclusion that it is an impeachable offense and a violation of constitutional responsibility,” Biden said during an appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”

5 a.m.: 218 House Democrats support impeachment inquiry

As of Wednesday evening, there were now 217 House Democrats and Independent Rep. Justin Amash (Mich.) who support launching an impeachment inquiry, giving 218 votes to impeach Trump — the threshold number of votes needed to pass anything in the House.

In the past two days, 78 Democrats said they wanted the House to go through with an impeachment process. Before the whistleblower complaint news broke last week, there were 95 members total who supported doing so.

“Today, for the world to see, we learned in his own words that the President of the United States used the full weight of the most sacred office in the land to coerce a foreign leader in a way that undermines our democracy and threatens our national security,” said Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), who came out for an impeachment inquiry Wednesday night.

But just because 218 lawmakers want the House to go through with the impeachment process, there’s no guarantee that they would vote to impeach Trump at the end of it. Of the 218, only 25 have said they’d vote to impeach the president right now."

On The Hill

WHY PELOSI CHANGED HER MIND: The speaker of the House “crossed the Rubicon,” in her words, when she announced late yesterday afternoon that Democrats would officially embrace an impeachment inquiry into President Trump.

It was a defining moment for Nancy Pelosi and for the Trump presidency, one which was far from guaranteed. Just a week ago, Pelosi was cautioning restive members of her caucus to hold their fire on wielding impeachment, a blunt political tool brandished only four times in American history. But the speaker relented following allegations Trump encouraged the Ukrainian president to reopen an investigation into Joe Biden and his son.

“The actions of the Trump presidency have revealed the dishonorable fact of the president’s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,” Pelosi said. “Therefore, today, I am announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.”

Pelosi said. What this means: “Pelosi’s move all but ensures that the House will vote on articles charging Trump with 'high crimes and misdemeanors' in a matter of weeks, according to senior Democratic lawmakers and top leadership aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations,” my colleagues Rachael Bade, Mike DeBonis and Karoun Demirjian report.

“Pelosi’s move all but ensures that the House will vote on articles charging Trump with 'high crimes and misdemeanors' in a matter of weeks, according to senior Democratic lawmakers and top leadership aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations,” my colleagues Rachael Bade, Mike DeBonis and Karoun Demirjian report. “Unlike any other caucus meeting, there was broad consensus — I did not hear one word of dissent, and that’s the first time that I recall that’s occurred in a discussion of the president,” House Intelligence Committee member Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) told reporters upon exiting a caucus meeting to discuss the historic move.

The speaker's change of heart was long in coming and fed by an array of new factors:

Groundswell from Democrats in swing seats: Over 20 Democrats — many of whom sit in competitive districts won by Trump in 2016 — changed their minds and came out in support of impeachment over the last 48 hours.

An overwhelming majority: As of this morning, 198 House Democrats have called for an impeachment inquiry, according to my colleagues JM Rieger, Amber Phillips, and Kevin Schaul.

'Most understandable': Pelosi pointed out in an interview yesterday with The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg that the new allegations — unlike, perhaps, the web of complicated charges in Robert S. Mueller III's report — could be clearer to the American public, which is so far not behind impeachment.

She said: “This is about the Constitution of the United States and we have many other, shall we say, candidates for impeachable offense in terms of the Constitution, we would say … but this one is the most understandable by the public. And it's really important to know this. It is — there is no requirement there be a quid pro quo in the conversation. If the President brings up he wants them to investigate something, that's to — and — of his political opponent, that is self-evident that it is not right,” Pelosi explained.

And it's really important to know this. It is — there is no requirement there be a quid pro quo in the conversation. If the President brings up he wants them to investigate something, that's to — and — of his political opponent, that is self-evident that it is not right,” Pelosi explained. The bottom line: “We don't ask foreign governments to help us in our elections,” Pelosi concluded.

The Trump factor: Unlike other controversies plaguing the Trump White House, the president himself has suggested he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden multiple times.

“The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don’t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” Trump told reporters on Sunday morning. “And Ukraine, Ukraine’s got a lot of problems.”

“NO quid pro quo”: In a series of tweets yesterday afternoon, Trump insisted his July 25 call with Zelensky was “very friendly and totally appropriate” and that there was “NO quid pro quo!” Pelosi, however, made clear in her Atlantic interview “the quid pro quo is not essential to an impeachable offense.”

In a series of tweets yesterday afternoon, Trump insisted his July 25 call with Zelensky was “very friendly and totally appropriate” and that there was “NO quid pro quo!” Pelosi, however, made clear in her Atlantic interview “the quid pro quo is not essential to an impeachable offense.” Key: “The president of the United States admitted that he spoke to the president of a foreign country — that would be Ukraine — about something that would assist him in his election, Pelosi told reporters, according to Politico's Kyle Cheney, Heather Caygle, and John Bresnahan. “So that has changed everything.”

Behind the scenes: Rachael, Mike and Karoun report that Pelosi and Trump spoke on Tuesday morning in a conversation in which Pelosi informed Trump of her decision to launch an impeachment inquiry.

“Trump insisted he had nothing to do with his administration’s refusal to share with Congress an intelligence community whistleblower complaint about his actions, according to individuals familiar with the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity to frankly describe the conversation,” per Rachael, Mike, and Karoun.

Pelosi replied that Trump had the power to turn over the complaint and challenged him to do so: “I said, ‘Well, then undo it.’ Undo it. Because you are asking the DNI to break the law. I mean, it’s just outrageous.”

Public polling?: Voters, to this point haven't been behind an impeachment inquiry. But the impact of the fast-moving Ukraine developments haven't yet been tested, said one Democratic pollster.

Democratic pollster Geoff Garin told Power Up in an email that while he doesn't have any new numbers “they wouldn’t mean all that much now anyway — this is a quickly moving target.”

RUDY'S SHADOW UKRAINE AGENDA: “President Trump’s attempt to pressure the leader of Ukraine followed a months-long fight inside the administration that sidelined national security officials and empowered political loyalists — including the president’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani — to exploit the U.S. relationship with Kiev, current and former U.S. officials said,” my colleagues Greg Miller, Josh Dawsey, Paul Sonne and Ellen Nakashima report.

“The sequence, which began early this year, involved the abrupt removal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, the circumvention of senior officials on the National Security Council, and the suspension of hundreds of millions of dollars of aid administered by the Defense and State departments — all as key officials from these agencies struggled to piece together Giuliani’s activities from news reports.”

“Several officials described tense meetings on Ukraine among national security officials at the White House leading up to the president’s phone call on July 25, sessions that led some participants to fear that Trump and those close to him appeared prepared to use U.S. leverage with the new leader of Ukraine for Trump’s political gain.”

“Rudy — he did all of this,” one U.S. official told my colleagues. “This s---show that we’re in — it’s him injecting himself into the process.”

one U.S. official told my colleagues. Read the full story here.

From the mayor: Giuliani responded to the story in a memorable appearance on Fox News last night where he claims that the State Department directed him to contact Ukrainian officials about Biden.

“I never talked to a Ukrainian official until the State Department called me and asked me to do it. And then I reported every conversation back to them. Laura, I’m a pretty good lawyer, just a country lawyer, but it’s all right here, right here. The first call from the State Department,” Giuliani told host Laura Ingraham, brandishing his cellphone to say he had proof of the contact.

How it all unfolded: Support for impeachment was not inevitable.

As our colleagues documented, the push began with the lonely Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) in 2017. Trump's actions, Mueller's Russia investigation and, finally, the whistleblower brought along successive waves of converts and increasingly a broader swath of the Democratic caucus.

Not even two years after Green's first efforts, they are now almost 200 strong.

Prior to Mueller's report being released, supporters were from some of the most liberal districts:

The redacted report's release in mid-April, Mueller's initial statement in late May and, finally, his testimony in late July began to broaden the base:

The Campaign

HOW THE 2020 CANDIDATES REACTED: Biden is not quite there yet, but he moved a lot closer toward endorsing an impeachment inquiry, our colleagues Matt Viser, Colby Itkowitz and Cleve R. Wootson Jr. report. As the early leader in the field, the former vice president’s opposition to impeachment has for months stood in stark contrast to nearly every other major 2020 hopeful --- including the nine other candidates who joined him Sept. 12 on the debate stage.

“If he continues to obstruct Congress and flout the law, Donald Trump will leave Congress, in my view, no choice but to initiate impeachment,” Biden said in a brief statement from Wilmington, Del. “That would be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making.”

The rest of the field mostly reiterated their previous calls for impeachment.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) “would not say whether he would vote to convict Trump if articles of impeachment were before the Senate, explaining that he wanted to review evidence before concluding how he would vote,” our colleagues write.

“would not say whether he would vote to convict Trump if articles of impeachment were before the Senate, explaining that he wanted to review evidence before concluding how he would vote,” our colleagues write. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) wrote on Twitter, “The impeachment inquiry must move forward with the efficiency and seriousness this crisis demands.”

wrote on Twitter, “The impeachment inquiry must move forward with the efficiency and seriousness this crisis demands.” “To my former colleagues in Congress: Finish the job and impeach him,” former congressman Beto O’Rourke wrote on Twitter.

It will be interesting to watch the amount of pressure the group puts on Pelosi and House Democrats going forward. On Friday, Warren reiterated her call for impeachment that she first made in April by saying that Congress’ failure to act had made it “complicit,"" a statement that was widely viewed as a shot at Pelosi’s leadership.

The Policies

HOUSE HOLDS HEARING ON ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN: The Judiciary Committee will meet later this morning to consider the possibility of renewing the federal assault weapons ban, a controversial law passed during the 1990s that banned 19 types of semiautomatic firearms and magazines which held more than 10 rounds. But the law contained a sunset provision and Republicans were perfectly content to let it expire in 2004 --- Democrats also failed to make a serious push to renew it when they had control of Congress early in the Obama administration.

The witnesses: Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley, whose city was the site of a mass shooting in August that left nine people dead; Alejandro Rios Tovar, a surgeon at the University Medical Center of El Paso, which experienced its own mass shooting just 24 hours before Dayton that left 20 people dead; and Charlottesville Police Chief RaShall Brackney. Dianna Muller, a former Tulsa police officer who works with a group focused on encouraging female firearm owners to tell their stories, will testify. As will Amy Swearer, a Heritage Foundation legal policy analyst who has criticized similar efforts to renew the ban.

Uphill battle: Rep. David Cicilline's bill to renew the ban has 211 Democratic co-sponsors and 1 Republican, Rep. Peter King (N.Y.), supporting it. That is tantalizingly close to the necessary 218, but as CNN's Ronald Brownstein and Aaron Kessler pointed out many of the holdouts come from the majority makers that flipped Republican-leaning districts in 2018. And the GOP-controlled Senate is disinclined to action as long as Trump hasn't put his cards on the table. (The White House has still not released its promised gun-control plan.)

Those efforts prompted that whistleblower complaint that was released this morning and have led to an official impeachment inquiry.

The White House counsel helped to identify legal obstacles to the disclosure of information that could be politically damaging to Trump. The head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel issued a classified opinion to initially block the whistleblower’s complaint from being transmitted to congressional committees that are legally entitled to receive it. The director of DOJ’s criminal division swiftly dismissed a criminal referral from the intelligence community’s inspector general that said Trump may have broken campaign finance laws by seeking dirt on Joe Biden. And Bill Barr declined to recuse himself, even though Trump invoked the attorney general at least twice during his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Here’s a quick primer on why each of the four taxpayer-funded attorneys is in the spotlight:

Steven Engel, director of the Office of Legal Counsel:

In late August, the inspector general for the intelligence community gave to the acting director of national intelligence a whistleblower complaint alleging that unnamed White House officials had expressed concern about Trump’s call. The IG said this was credible and urgent and should be turned over to Congress. But then Joseph Maguire, the acting DNI, contacted the Justice Department to ask for guidance. Engel issued a secret memo on Sept. 3 saying that the complaint didn’t need to be turned over to congressional intelligence committee because it was outside of the DNI’s jurisdiction. Instead, he said the allegation would more properly be referred to the Justice Department as a potential criminal matter for further review. (The DOJ published yesterday an unclassified version of Engel’s legal reasoning.)

Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski, head of the criminal division:

When the intelligence community IG submitted a criminal referral that said the president possibly violated campaign finance laws, it was Benczkowski who made the call within a matter of weeks that there was not enough evidence to pursue an investigation of Trump. He’s a former Senate GOP staffer who worked at the same law firm as Barr before being appointed to the job. Benczkowski’s confirmation was held up for a stretch two years ago because of his legal work for a Russian bank.

“Senior Justice Department officials defended their handling of the matter, saying that campaign finance laws required them to ‘quantify’ the value of what Trump was seeking for his campaign, and that was impossible to do with the investigations Trump had requested. They said they were examining what was referred, and the rough transcript of the call was the ‘best evidence’ to help determine what to do,” Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett report. “The FBI, the officials said, deferred to the Justice Department. … They said career prosecutors agreed with the decision.”

“All relevant components of the Department agreed with his legal conclusion, and the Department has concluded the matter,” Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement.

Attorney General Bill Barr:

Justice Department officials also said that the attorney general was “generally knowledgeable” of discussions about Engel’s decision but he didn’t make the call not to move forward with the investigation.

Kupec, Barr’s spokeswoman, said in a statement: “The President has not spoken with the Attorney General about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son. The President has not asked the Attorney General to contact Ukraine – on this or any other matter. The Attorney General has not communicated with Ukraine – on this or any other subject. Nor has the Attorney General discussed this matter, or anything relating to Ukraine, with Rudy Giuliani.”

She added that U.S. Attorney John Durham, who has been investigating the origins of the FBI’s probe into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, is “exploring the extent to which a number of countries, including Ukraine, played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election,” per Devlin, Matt, Carol Leonnig and Shane Harris.

But Democrats said Barr should have recused himself entirely. The Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee called on Barr to not be involved with anything related to Ukraine and this episode. Sen. Kamala Harris, a Democratic presidential candidate and formerly California’s attorney general, demanded that Barr testify under oath before Congress as soon as possible about his role.

“Trump has repeatedly lauded Barr, a stark contrast from his relationship with his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions,” the AP’s Michael Balsamo and Mark Sherman note. “Not only did Barr provide the first, favorable framing for the Mueller report, but he also … has supported the White House’s decision to claim broad executive privilege to prevent the testimony of administration officials that could be potentially damaging for Trump. Barr has also defied subpoenas from Congress — in line with the Trump administration’s stance to block Democrats’ efforts to investigate Trump.”

White House counsel Pat Cipollone:

Cipollone has been engaged in this matter since shortly after the whistleblower action surfaced, we reported last week, helping to identify legal obstacles to the sharing of information that could be politically damaging to Trump.

Three of my colleagues revealed yesterday that Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, threatened to resign over concerns that the White House might attempt to force him to stonewall Congress when he was going to testify about the whistleblower complaint. “He has at times expressed his displeasure to [Cipollone] and others that the White House had put him in the untenable position of denying the material to Congress over a claim that it did not fall within his jurisdiction as leader of the intelligence community,” according to Greg Miller, Shane and Karoun Demirjian. “The current and former officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, said Maguire had pushed the White House to make an explicit legal decision on whether it would assert executive privilege over the whistleblower complaint … It was unclear whether Maguire’s threat had forced the White House to acquiesce and allow him to testify without constraint. But officials said Maguire has pursued the opportunity to meet with lawmakers to defend his actions and integrity.”

Maguire denied that he ever threatened to resign, and the White House also disputed the account. After their statements were issued, Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron said, “We stand by the story.”

TRUMP’S PERSONAL ATTORNEY IS ALSO IN THE SPOTLIGHT:

-- In the rough transcript, Trump praises Rudy Giuliani as a “highly respected man” who was a “great mayor” of New York. “If you could speak to him that would be great,” the president tells Zelensky.

-- “Giuliani has claimed that his discussions with Ukrainian officials have been at the request of the State Department, which remained fully abreast of his dealings. But the details of the July 25 phone call … raise new questions about Giuliani’s role, reinforcing the view of some U.S. officials that he operates at the president’s behest, often in a closed loop, and occasionally in contravention to the messages of diplomats in Kiev,” John Hudson reports. “Technically, it is illegal for private citizens to negotiate with a foreign government on behalf of the United States under the Logan Act, but the law has rarely been enforced. Trump is not the first president to enlist a trusted outside adviser for a sensitive international mission, but Giuliani’s interventions sparked concern among U.S. officials in Kiev who said Ukrainians told them they were unsure if Giuliani was speaking for the U.S. government …

“Giuliani has said that Kurt Volker, the U.S. special representative for Ukraine, helped secure his discussions with a top aide to Zelensky, Andriy Yermak. A State Department official said Giuliani ‘does not speak on behalf of the U.S. government’ and added that Volker only helped set up the meeting at Yermak’s request. Yermak’s request to meet with Giuliani came after Trump requested that Zelensky speak with the former mayor in the July call. U.S. Embassy officials in Kiev repeatedly expressed concern about the contacts between Giuliani and Ukrainian officials. They have not been privy to most of the discussions, and at times only learned about them later from the Ukrainians, U.S. officials said. Giuliani told The Post he has had about five conversations with Yermak this year.

“In May 2019, Giuliani also met with a top Ukrainian anti-corruption prosecutor, Nazar Kholodnytsky, in Paris. Kholodnytsky — who was caught on tape advising witnesses in corruption cases how to avoid prosecution — had faced calls to step down from the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. But the meeting came at a triumphant moment for Kholodnytsky. He was holding on to his office. Yovanovitch had been recalled from her posting early. Kholodnytsky declined to comment on the contents of his conversation with Giuliani, which he described as that of a ‘prosecutor to a former prosecutor.’ But he has said that he believed something didn’t add up with the 2016 release of the ‘black ledger’ that forced Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to resign, and that the investigation into Burisma, the energy company of which Hunter Biden was a board member, needed to be reopened. Giuliani, when asked about his meeting with Kholodnytsky, said: ‘I’m not going to tell you about that.’”

-- Trump’s effort to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens appears to have begun as an attempt to formulate a rationale by which the president could pardon Paul Manafort as part of an effort to undermine Mueller’s investigation, according to previously undisclosed records obtained by the New York Review of Books: “These records indicate that attorneys representing Trump and Manafort respectively had at least nine conversations relating to this effort, beginning in the early days of the Trump administration, and lasting until as recently as May of this year.

“Through these deliberations carried on by his attorneys, Manafort exhorted the White House to press Ukrainian officials to investigate and discredit individuals, both in the US and in Ukraine, who he believed had published damning information about his political consulting work in the Ukraine. … [The records show that] on at least three occasions, [Giuliani] was in communication with Manafort’s legal team to discuss how the White House was pushing a narrative that the Democratic National Committee, Democratic donors, and Ukrainian government officials had ‘colluded’ to defeat [Trump’s] 2016 presidential bid.”

-- The phone call memo followed Trump’s long obsession with Ukraine. More details from the New York Times: “Long before the July 25 call ... Trump’s focus on Ukraine started after a law enforcement organization, the National Anticorruption Bureau of Ukraine, released damaging information about cash payments earmarked to [Manafort] by the Russia-aligned political party of Ukraine’s ousted former president. Even after Mr. Manafort stepped down from the Trump campaign under pressure, he insisted to Mr. Trump’s aides that Mrs. Clinton’s campaign was behind the surfacing of the documents revealing the payments, and questioned the authenticity of the documents. … The issue continued to fester with Mr. Trump. He tweeted six months after his inauguration about ‘Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign’ and to ‘boost Clinton,’ and asked, ‘where is the investigation?’”

MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT:

-- Read it for yourself here.

-- “The whistleblower complaint focuses largely on the July 25 call … But the complaint also broadly alleges an effort by Trump and [Giuliani] to pressure Ukrainian officials over time … The whistleblower paints a picture, also using public news reports, to suggest that Giuliani pressured Ukrainian officials to further Trump’s interest in investigating his political opponents,” Devlin, Matt, Carol and Shane report.

“The complaint also alleges a pattern of obfuscation at the White House, in which officials moved the records of some of Trump’s communications with foreign officials onto a separate computer network from where they are normally stored … The whistleblower alleges that is what officials did with Trump’s July 25 call with Zelensky, an action that alarmed the intelligence community inspector general and prompted him to request that the White House retain records of the Zelensky call...""

-- “The whistle-blower, moreover, identified multiple White House officials as witnesses to potential presidential misconduct who could corroborate the complaint … [and] the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, interviewed witnesses,” the Times reports. “Mr. Atkinson also found reason to believe that the whistle-blower might not support the re-election of Mr. Trump and made clear that the complainant was not in a position to directly listen to the call or see the memo that reconstructed it before it was made public … Instead, the officer heard about the call secondhand from unidentified White House officials who expressed concern that Mr. Trump had ‘abused his authority or acted unlawfully in connection with foreign diplomacy,’ the memo said. Still, Mr. Atkinson concluded after an investigation that the information in the complaint was credible.”

­-- The whistleblower tentatively agreed to testify on the condition that Maguire approves appropriate security clearances for the person’s lawyers, so they can accompany their client, CNN reports.

THE ATMOSPHERICS ON CAPITOL HILL:

-- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and senior House Democrats agreed in a private meeting after the release of the rough transcript they should narrow their impeachment investigation to Trump's dealings on Ukraine, according to five Democrats familiar with the conversation. Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade report: “Democrats said the evidence was incriminating enough — and easy enough for voters to understand — to proceed with their impeachment inquiry and soon. ‘Strike while the iron’s hot,’ said one individual in the meeting, summarizing the sentiment. Democrats said they could move quickly on impeachment and act by the end of the year. … [Pelosi] told colleagues that keeping the inquiry narrowly focused on the Ukraine allegations could also help keep the investigation out of the courts, where a slew of investigative matters have been bogged down for months — though she did not rule out ultimately including other episodes in potential articles of impeachment ...

“Multiple Judiciary Committee members said that they expected probes of other matters to continue unabated and potentially contribute to impeachment articles drafted this year. Several liberal lawmakers also want to include multiple charges in any impeachment articles.”

-- A milestone: A majority of House members are now on the record in support of opening an impeachment inquiry. As of last night, 217 House Democrats and one independent (Justin Amash) say they support at least opening an impeachment inquiry. Of those, 25 have gone a step further, saying they would definitely support impeaching the president. (The Fix is keeping a live whip count here.)

-- That op-ed published by seven House Democratic freshmen from swing districts with national security credentials proved seismic in pushing both wavering Democrats and Pelosi toward supporting an impeachment inquiry. Paul Kane explains: “Throughout the first phase of the Trump investigations, focusing on Russian interference in 2016, these Democrats found that their constituents were confused by the complicated and long-running investigation by [Mueller]. Instead, while other freshmen got media attention for bashing Trump, this group focused on kitchen-table issues like health-care costs and infrastructure projects. ... Liberal activists tried to jam their town halls, but most Democratic aides reported that aside from one or two impeachment questions, the overwhelming majority of concerns focused on local economic matters. … To be sure, a dozen or so swing-seat Democrats remain mum, declining so far to take a position ... But no one spoke out against impeachment in their Tuesday afternoon huddle in the Capitol basement.""

-- Some House Democrats say they wish Pelosi had waited a little longer. “I don’t get surprised often,” said Rep. Jeff Van Drew (N.J.). “But really, truly, I just was like, ‘Wow.’ It happened so quickly.” (Mike DeBonis has more.)

THE GOP RESPONSE:

-- ""The helter-skelter way the administration handled the aftermath of the whistleblower complaint could be a harbinger of the coming impeachment fight, with the White House scrambling to respond to a mercurial and frustrated president, who is increasingly sidelining his aides and making decisions based on gut instinct,"" Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey and Philip Rucker report: ""Even some allies of the president worry that his team may not fully understand the potential upheaval that an impeachment fight could wreak on Trump and his administration, especially as he heads into the 2020 election. ...

""On Wednesday morning, aides invited roughly a dozen Republican lawmakers to the White House to preview and discuss the transcript before it was released to the public. At one point, Trump called in from New York, and attendees described him as generally in a good mood — 'chagrined' but not angry, though skittish about some of the details. At one point, the group began joking with the president that 'this was one of his better' phone calls with foreign leaders, an attendee said. And even privately, Trump did not believe his conversation with the Ukrainian president was problematic, according to four people with whom he spoke.""

-- While most Republican senators publicly toed the line and repeated talking points sent by the White House, several were privately stunned and questioned Trump's judgment after seeing the rough transcript. Robert Costa reports: “One Senate Republican, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly, said the transcript’s release was a ‘huge mistake’ that the GOP now has to confront and defend — while the party argues at the same time that House Democrats are overreaching with their impeachment inquiry of Trump. Three other GOP senators complained privately in discussions ... that the White House erred by releasing the transcript, arguing that it sets a precedent for future presidents about disclosure of calls with foreign leaders and could be seen as a concession to Democrats. Publicly, two senators expressed serious concerns about the revelation, as cracks have begun to emerge with GOP lawmakers privately discussing Trump’s conduct and their party’s political standing.""

“Republicans ought not to be rushing to circle the wagons and say there’s no ‘there’ there when there’s obviously a lot that’s very troubling there,” Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) told reporters.

(R-Neb.) told reporters. “It remains troubling in the extreme. It’s deeply troubling,” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told reporters.

(R-Utah) told reporters. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said there was “no quid pro quo,” adding, “while the conversation reported in the memorandum … was inappropriate, it does not rise to the level of an impeachable offense.”

“One early divide among Senate Republicans is between the ‘Burr camp’ and the ‘Johnson camp,’ according to two senior GOP aides,"" Costa reports, ""referring to Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. Burr’s faction of the Senate GOP has a darker, frustrated view of Trump’s handling of Ukraine, while Johnson has linked the Ukraine issue to his committee’s work into reviewing the launch of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails while serving as secretary of state.""

-- He does not get a vote, but Vermont’s Republican governor, Phil Scott, said the impeachment inquiry is “appropriate,” per the AP.

-- The impeachment inquiry is threatening to derail most of Trump's domestic agenda, upending trade and spending talks. From Erica Werner and David Lynch: “The White House and lawmakers must agree to a new spending deal by Nov. 21, and prospects for an easy resolution were already dim because of a fight over border wall funding. The White House also wants Congress to pass a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada by the end of this autumn, a timeline that could now be impossible to meet.""

THE UKRAINE ANGLE:

-- Trump’s meeting with Zelensky on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly offered a platform for salesmanship, grievance and a joke or two. Anne Gearan reports: “‘We spoke a couple of times, as you probably remember,’ Trump cracked. … Zelensky, a comedian and television star before he was elected this year, also tried to keep the mood light by noting that ‘it’s better to be on TV than by phone.’ … Standing alongside Trump, Zelensky insisted Wednesday that ‘nobody pushed me’ to investigate. ‘I think you read everything,’ Zelensky said as he and Trump faced the cameras. ‘I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved’ in U.S. elections, Zelensky continued, as Trump smiled beside him. ‘No, you heard that we had, I think, good phone call. It was normal.’ Trump chimed in: ‘In other words, no pressure.’""

-- Trump called former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin a “very good” prosecutor.” But Shokin resigned in disgrace. David L. Stern reports: Shokin “became Ukraine’s prosecutor general in 2015 with promises to wage an unflinching battle against corruption after political upheavals dumped a pro-Russian president and brought in Western-looking leadership. At the time, it was a message heartily welcomed by major donors … Shokin, however, quickly faced questions of his own. Critics complained that he fell short on his pledges to peer deeply into Ukraine’s shadows. By the end of his 13-month tenure, Shokin was scorned by the Obama administration and others that had once praised his appointment.”

-- Trump boasted about U.S. aid to Ukraine. But America isn’t Kiev’s only friend, writes Ruby Mellen: “Although the United States is one of the country’s biggest foreign-aid benefactors, other countries have also sent significant assistance to Ukraine. The European Union and its financial institutions have provided more than $16.5 billion in grants and loans to support its reform process since 2014. In addition to those E.U. funds, Germany on its own has pledged millions of dollars in assistance, as has Britain. And Japan, meanwhile, has given $3.1 billion in assistance to Ukraine to the establishment of diplomatic relations in the early 1990s.”

-- “The U.S. tried to fix Ukraine’s government. We exported our corruption, instead,” laments Paul Musgrave, a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.

DOMESTIC POLITICAL FALLOUT:

-- During the Ukraine call, Trump revived a pervasive conspiracy theory about the hacking of the Democratic National Committee. Craig Timberg, Drew Harwell and Ellen Nakashima report: “For years cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike was a source of news, not a subject, as it unraveled some of the world’s most notorious hacks. … Ever since the company exposed Russian intrusions into [DNC] computers in 2016, … CrowdStrike has been a subject of allegations that rippled through conservative news sources, onto social media, into the criminal trial of longtime Trump friend Roger Stone and [into the president’s call].”

The nature of Trump’s reference to CrowdStrike in his call is not obvious in the White House’s memo, but, basically, the company has become a boogeyman of right-wing conspiracy theorists who have falsely claimed it helped Democratic leaders cover up what they insist was a breach by a party insider. In reality, Drew and Ellen explain, “the FBI felt it was not necessary to enter the DNC's premises and take custody of the affected servers, as agents were able to obtain complete copies of forensic images made by CrowdStrike.""

-- Trump claimed Hunter Biden got China to put $1.5 billion in a fund, an allegation that has been flatly denied by Biden’s lawyer. Michael Kranish reports: “Trump, who has made a similar allegation for months, is referencing information from a book by Peter Schweizer, ‘Secret Empires,’ that first detailed how Hunter Biden flew to China on Air Force Two with his father in 2013. … Trump on Wednesday put it this way: ‘When Biden’s son walks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund and the biggest funds in the world can’t get money out of China and he’s there with one quick meeting and he flies in on Air Force Two. I think that’s a horrible thing.’ … In bringing up the China episode, Trump did not provide any new evidence to back up his claims.

""Hunter Biden did travel with his father on Air Force Two to China on Dec. 4, 2013. Twelve days later, Hunter Biden joined the board of a just-formed investment advisory firm, known as BHR, whose partners included Chinese entities. Affiliates of the advisory firm said they planned to raise $1.5 billion. Some media reports over the past five years have described Hunter Biden as an owner of a private equity company that sought to raise that amount. However, George Mesires, lawyer for Hunter Biden, said in an interview earlier this year that his client’s role has been misconstrued. He said Hunter Biden was on the board of the advisory firm that did not directly invest, but instead advised those who did.”

-- Trump was fixated on attacking Biden long before his call with Zelensky, per Toluse Olorunnipa and Matt Viser: “He attacked Biden at the White House and at campaign rallies. He attacked Biden on Twitter and on Instagram. He attacked Biden in France and in Japan, during news conferences and official speeches, in phone calls and in interviews, on Air Force One and in the Rose Garden, during morning 'executive time' and in late-night tweet storms. … Trump’s advisers say the president has targeted Biden in recent months for several reasons: He has emerged as a front-runner in a crowded field of Democratic contenders, he has a long record in Washington that allows the president to position himself as an outsider and he has been leading Trump in polling in key swing states. Campaign aides previously had been wary of singling out any of the Democratic presidential candidates, opting instead to lump the group of more than 20 contenders together under the banner of ‘socialism.’”

-- “An impeachment investigation will also shape the Democrats’ choice of a nominee, potentially foreshortening the race and freezing the current standings in place,"" writes Karen Tumulty. ""Those who are struggling to break from the rear of a 19-person field will find it even harder — and maybe impossible — to make their voices heard in the din. ‘Candidates who have advantages now may see those advantages multiplied,’ says David Axelrod, who was Barack Obama’s chief strategist.”

-- Trump’s call with Zelensky is unlike anything scholars have heard before, reports Karen DeYoung: “‘This is nothing like a conversation between Richard Nixon or Henry Kissinger and a foreign leader,’ said Ken Hughes of the Miller Center at the University of Virginia, an expert on Nixon during the Vietnam War and Watergate. ‘Nixon had very detailed knowledge when he spoke to foreign leaders. He could be subtle in negotiations and still get his point across,’ Hughes said. But ‘when he wanted to dig up dirt on his political adversaries,’ Nixon did it at home, he said. Even President Lyndon B. Johnson, whose vulgarity and pressure tactics are well documented, ‘tended to be a cautious and careful communicator with world leaders and diplomats, not the gunslinger that he could be with Americans that he knew well,’ said Kent Germany of the University of South Carolina. ‘He was not going to go rogue and be Lyndon Johnson with these other leaders.’”

-- Before the transcript was released, former New Jersey governor and the onetime Trump transition chief Chris Christie ominously said that Trump would be in trouble if he said something like “do me a favor.” Hours later, it was revealed the president asked the Ukrainian president to “do us a favor.” (Mediaite)

-- The Wall Street Journal stands behind its reporting that Trump pressured Zelensky to work with Giuliani about eight times, despite claims from Trump allies and conservative media that it's wrong. The Journal notes the rough transcript is incomplete. There are also ellipses. (Erik Wemple)

NOTEWORTHY COMMENTARY:

-- Tuesday was Pelosi’s day, but Wednesday was Trump’s – for better or for worse, writes chief correspondent Dan Balz: “The impeachment inquiry is both an epic battle between the speaker and the president and, more fundamentally, a constitutional clash that will help define the limits on presidential power, and the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches. The outcome will shape, perhaps decisively, the 2020 campaign. Trump will either be out of office by January 2021 or he will have emerged victorious, reelected to a second term in large part because of what would then, inevitably, be interpreted as an enormous gamble by the speaker and the Democrats that went terribly wrong. The past two days have shown that there is no turning back.”

-- The Trump-Ukraine transcript contains evidence of a quid pro quo, writes National Review’s David French, a leading conservative attorney: “The transcript provides proof that Trump made a completely improper request that the president of Ukraine work with Trump’s personal counsel to investigate a political rival. It provides strong evidence that this took place in the context of a quid pro quo for desperately needed military aid.”

-- The Trump-Zelensky readout is a devastating indictment of our president, says The Post’s Editorial Board.

-- The rough transcript of the call is devastating. How could Trump not realize that? Max Boot wonders: “At least Richard Nixon had the good sense to resist releasing the ‘smoking gun’ tape until finally forced to do so by the Supreme Court. … Trump, by contrast, is so clueless — so lacking in even the most basic sense of right and wrong — that he could actually tweet this morning: ‘Will the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President?’”

-- Democrats had no idea Trump would hand them so much ammo, writes E.J. Dionne Jr.

-- The House doesn’t need an impeachment inquiry to confirm Trump’s wrongdoing. His corruption is hidden in plain sight – just look at his D.C. hotel, argues Dana Milbank: “As the call notes were being released, a joint House committee opened a hearing on Trump’s lease of the Old Post Office, now the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Trump has violated the plain language of the lease (it says no U.S. elected official can be part of or benefit from the lease), and the plain language of the Constitution (it says no U.S. officeholder can accept payments from any ‘foreign state’). But the General Services Administration found a novel way to avoid declaring that Trump had obviously violated both: It looked the other way.”

THE TRUMP AGENDA:

-- The administration announced an asylum deal with Honduras, which could force migrants into one of the world’s most violent nations. Nick Miroff reports: “Department of Homeland Security officials reached the accord with the government of President Juan Orlando Hernández, who is embroiled in allegations of government corruption and charges that he and others have been operating the nation as a criminal enterprise — Hernández has been named as a co-conspirator in a major U.S. drug trafficking case. The deal paves the way for the United States to take asylum seekers from the U.S. border and ship them to a nation with one of the highest murder rates in the world, a country with gang wars that have fueled waves of mass migration and multiple ‘caravans’ to the United States that became a major irritant to [Trump].”

-- The new deal comes just days after a man was brutally murdered in Honduras -- just hours after being deported from the United States. (La Prensa)

-- The Republican-controlled Senate voted for the second time to overturn Trump’s declaration of a national emergency at the southern border, but the body once again fell well short of the veto-proof, two-thirds majority needed to block the president from diverting military construction money to his pet project. (Erica Werner and Aaron Gregg)

-- Human rights groups demanded that ICE release all LGBTQ detainees and anyone with HIV in the agency’s custody. Robert Moore reports: “‘We know that lack of medical and mental-health care, including lack of HIV care, is the norm,’ Roger Coggan, director of legal services at the Los Angeles LGBT Center, told reporters Wednesday afternoon. ‘By the Department of Homeland Security’s own count, 300 individuals identifying as transgender have been in custody and at the mercy of ICE since October of 2018. These cruel incarcerations need to stop immediately.’ DHS officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the complaint. It is unclear how many LGBTQ people and people with HIV are detained by U.S. immigration officials.”

-- Trump's decision to move the Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service out of Washington will cause “significant delays” in vital research reports on which farmers depend. Politico reports: “ERS conducts research into areas such as climate change, nutrition, export data and the farm economy. Farmers also heavily rely on its outlook reports to make planting decisions. Crop markets can swing on the results of the numbers. ... USDA identified 38 specific reports that may be delayed because staff members have departed.""

­-- Income inequality has grown, including in heartland states. From the AP: “The nation’s Gini Index, which measures income inequality, has been rising steadily over the past five decades. The Gini Index grew from 0.482 in 2017 to 0.485 last year, according to the bureau’s 1-year American Community Survey data. The Gini Index is on a scale of 0 to 1; a score of ‘0’ indicates perfect equality, while a score of ‘1’ indicates perfect inequality, where one household has all the income.”

-- The Federal Aviation Administration disputed an independent watchdog’s finding that safety inspectors who worked on training requirements for Boeing’s 737 Max jets were underqualified. Ian Duncan reports: “Deputy FAA Administrator Daniel K. Elwell also rejected the watchdog’s finding that his agency had misled Congress over the issue, saying that was ‘not what happened,’ ... that making any connection between that problem and the 737 Max was ‘simply not accurate.’”

-- Trump’s Turnberry resort is the only hotel named by Glasgow Prestwick Airport in promotional materials distributed at private meetings with American military air crews. From The Scotsman: “The document, prepared by the Scottish Government owned airport and handed out at ‘closed’ meetings with US Armed Forces personnel, emphasizes the ‘five star’ status of the US president’s flagship Scottish property, even noting how it has been ‘newly refurbished.’ Two sources familiar with the gatherings said Prestwick staff also delivered presentations in which they offered to arrange rounds of golf at Turnberry for visiting US Air Force (USAF) crews as part of their layovers.”

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani addresses the United Nations General Assembly. (Craig Ruttle/AP)

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- The White House banned Iranian officials from entering the U.S. just hours after a failed attempt to renew diplomacy with President Hassan Rouhani during the U.N. General Assembly, per the Times: “Mike Pompeo said the United States was still open to talking to Iran, and hoped to tamp down inflamed tensions after leaders in the United States, Europe and Arab nations blamed Tehran for attacks on oil fields in Saudi Arabia this month.""

-- Shortly after, Rouhani warned the Persian Gulf is ""on the edge of collapse."" From the AP: ""Rouhani accused the United States of engaging in 'international piracy' against his country by re-imposing economic sanctions after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Tehran 'will never negotiate with an enemy that seeks to make Iran surrender with the weapon of poverty,' Rouhani said ... 'Stop the sanctions so as to open the way for the start of negotiations.' ... Rouhani said U.S. wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria had failed, with Washington 'unable to resolve the more sophisticated issues' plaguing the Middle East.""

-- Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, speaking about his role in journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s murder for the first time, said it was done without his knowledge. From Frontline: “‘It happened under my watch,’ the Saudi leader [said.] ‘I get all the responsibility, because it happened under my watch.’ But he insists that it was without his knowledge. … [bin Salman was pressed] on how the murder could have happened without him knowing about it. ‘We have 20 million people. We have 3 million government employees,’ Prince Mohammed responded. … ‘I have officials, ministers to follow things, and they’re responsible, they have the authority to do that,’ Prince Mohammed said.”

-- Israeli President Reuven Rivlin asked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to try forming a new governing coalition. Steve Hendrix and Ruth Eglash report: “Rivlin’s decision to offer Netanyahu the first go at forming a government came on the day that official results from last week’s election were finalized, showing that the prime minister’s Likud party had secured one seat fewer in the Knessett, Israel’s parliament, than the rival Blue and White party headed by Benny Gantz. Neither of the two main parties is close to a 61-seat majority. But a plurality of all the newly elected parliament members told Rivlin that they preferred Netanyahu, earning him the president’s nod.”

-- Returning to Westminster, Prime Minister Boris Johnson goaded opposition lawmakers to call a no-confidence vote or agree to a general election and bring the Brexit fight back to the people after the Supreme Court ruled his decision to suspend Parliament was illegal. William Booth and Karla Adam report: “Facing a chamber packed with hooting and jeering lawmakers, Johnson said Britain’s highest court was ‘wrong to pronounce on what is essentially a political question at a time of great national controversy.’ Rather than apologize to the queen and the country, as opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn demanded, Johnson went on the offensive, saying it was anti-Brexit forces in Parliament who were working against democracy, with their cunning maneuvers designed to sabotage a departure and thwart the will of the people.”

-- At least 70 countries have engaged in disinformation campaigns, according to a new report by researchers at Oxford University. From the NYT: “In Vietnam, citizens were enlisted to post pro-government messages on their personal Facebook pages. The Guatemalan government used hacked and stolen social media accounts to silence dissenting opinions. Ethiopia’s ruling party hired people to influence social media conversations in its favor. Despite increased efforts by internet platforms like Facebook to combat internet disinformation, the use of the techniques by governments around the world is growing … The researchers … found that the number of countries with political disinformation campaigns more than doubled to 70 in the last two years, with evidence of at least one political party or government entity in each of those countries engaging in social media manipulation. In addition, Facebook remains the No. 1 social network for disinformation, the report said. Organized propaganda campaigns were found on the platform in 56 countries.”

-- Military drones are now common in nearly 100 nations, a new report found. From the WSJ: “China is a top exporter of drones alongside Israel and the U.S., according to the report. Pentagon officials have expressed concern over Beijing’s dominance of the global market for small drones. There are at least 21,000 and probably more than 30,000 unmanned aerial vehicles in military service world-wide, the report says. It catalogs 171 types of drones in military inventories and 268 military-drone units established by 58 countries. Fifteen countries have training academies for drone operators, and seven maintain drone bases outside their own borders, according to the report.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Cindy McCain, widow of John McCain, criticized the GOP, saying it is no longer the party she and her husband belonged to. Kim Bellware reports: McCain, when asked to size up the political landscape heading into the 2020 election, “pointed to the local GOP in Arizona and assessed that ‘it’s not functioning well’ and excludes people who aren’t ‘walking the line.’ ‘That’s just not right,’ McCain said. ‘That’s not the party my husband and I belonged to.’ While those issues may have McCain feeling alienated from the party, she predicted they could also have consequences for Republicans in 2020. Speaking about the Arizona GOP, she noted how the party’s exclusionary views, as McCain described them, could fail to resonate with Arizona voters; the state’s demographics increasingly include younger voters, a politically organized — and vocal — Latino population and transplants from around the country. … ‘I can see [Arizona] going Democrat, I really can,’ McCain said. ‘I’m not saying I want that, but I can see it happening.’”

-- Elizabeth Warren is rising everywhere, per CNN: “The latest Quinnipiac University national poll ... has Warren at 27% to [Biden’s] 25%. Now, one poll doesn't mean much, and Quinnipiac's result is well within the margin of error, so there's no clear leader. ... The trendline is what is important here.""

-- A volunteer for Warren’s campaign was killed in a car crash in western Iowa. Zachary Crombie Presberg, 22, joined the campaign as a summer organizing fellow and had stayed on as a volunteer. (Des Moines Register)

-- More infighting: Top aides are privately questioning Bernie Sanders's strategy. From CNN: “The campaign's in-house production team recently began shooting its first television ads of the 2020 cycle in Iowa, likely quieting at least one source of dissent among some senior aides, who have been pushing for Sanders to get on the air. … Even if the senator and his staff have reason to believe the Iowa race is closer than the most recent polling indicates, interviews with two senior aides to Sanders revealed growing concerns that the Hawkeye State and New Hampshire could be at risk of slipping away. The twin sources of frustration and internal debate, both aides told CNN, was a schedule that too often takes Sanders away from the early voting states and a perception among staff, especially in Iowa, that the campaign has been wrong-headed in its decision to put off investing there in television ads.”

-- Biden’s brother James Biden touted his ties to the former vice president’s cancer initiative during an investment pitch to a health-care firm, according to Politico: James Biden “made the promise to executives at Florida-based Integrate Oral Care during a phone call on or around November 8, 2018, according to Michael Frey, CEO of Diverse Medical Management, a health-care firm that is suing James Biden. At the time, James Biden's business partners were pursuing a potential investment in Integrate, according to Frey and court records. Frey, who had a business relationship with James Biden and his associates, had introduced the group to Integrate. James Biden told the Integrate executives that he would get the Biden Cancer Initiative to promote an oral rinse made by the firm and used by cancer patients, Frey, [told Politico]. He added that James Biden directly invoked the former vice president on the call. 'He said his brother would be very excited about this product,' Frey said. A spokesman for James Biden disputed Frey's account.”

-- Cory Booker has crossed the halfway threshold to his $1.7 million fundraising goal. His campaign manager said that he needs to raise that much in the final 10 days of September to have a viable path forward, per Yahoo News.

-- Tulsi Gabbard qualified for the fourth Democratic debate after missing out on the third one. The Hawaii Democrat has the support of 2 percent of registered Democrats and unaffiliated voters, according to a Monmouth University poll, per the Columbus Dispatch.

We apologize for the delay.

THE BIG IDEA: If President Trump thought releasing the readout of his call with Ukraine’s president would break impeachment fever on Capitol Hill, he miscalculated.

The five-page summary released this morning intensified Democratic demands to see the entire whistleblower complaint. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), a member of Democratic leadership, said the president asking for Ukraine’s help to undermine his 2020 challenger is “a textbook abuse of power.” At a news conference, he said “the transcripts become exhibit A.”

According to the rough transcript, Trump told Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Attorney General Bill Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to investigate the conduct of Joe Biden and offered to meet with the new president at the White House after he promised to conduct such an inquiry. “I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it,” Trump said, according to the transcript, after asking for ""a favor."" (Here are seven additional takeaways, via Aaron Blake.)

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) urged fellow party leaders in a private meeting to keep the impeachment investigation narrowly focused on Trump and his dealings with his Ukrainian counterpart, per Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade.

Several Senate Republicans were stunned and questioned the White House’s judgment after it released the rough transcript, Robert Costa reports. “It remains troubling in the extreme. It’s deeply troubling,” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told reporters after reading the transcript.

-- “Senior Justice Department officials said the director of national intelligence referred the concerns about the call to the Justice Department, after the intelligence community inspector general found that it was a possible violation of campaign finance laws that ban people from soliciting contributions from foreign sources. The inspector general later also referred the matter to the FBI,” Devlin Barrett, Matt Zapotosky, Josh Dawsey and Carol D. Leonnig report. “Career prosecutors and officials in the Justice Department’s criminal division then reviewed the transcript of the call, which they obtained voluntarily from the White House, and determined the facts ‘could not make out and cannot make out’ the appropriate basis for an investigation, a senior Justice Department official said. As part of their reasoning, Justice Department lawyers determined that help with a government investigation could not be considered ‘a thing of value’ under the law.”

-- What was released by the White House is a five-page summary of a 30-minute conversation. That means some of what was covered is likely not even in the memo. The document includes a disclaimer on the first page that it is “not a verbatim transcript of a discussion.”

“The text in this document records the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty Officers and NSC policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place,” it says. “A number of factors can affect the accuracy of the record, including poor telecommunications connections and variations in accent and/or interpretation.”

Richard Nixon points to edited transcripts of the White House tapes during a nationally televised address on April 29, 1974. (AP)

-- Richard Nixon released a transcript, too. After the revelation that he recorded Oval Office meetings, the then-president refused to turn over the tapes, claiming executive privilege, and fought subpoenas in court. Eventually, trying to quell a political firestorm, he offered transcripts – which he personally edited – and insisted they exonerated him. “I want there to be no question remaining about the fact that the president has nothing to hide in this matter,” Nixon said in April 1974. Months later, when House investigators listened to some of the audio, it turned out there were significant discrepancies and key phrases missing. Ever since Nixon resigned, the White House has, perhaps understandably, generally avoided recording presidential phone calls. That tradition explains why there’s apparently no recording on the American side of Trump’s July conversation.

-- Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill made clear even before the summary came out that the summary will not be enough to deter them from moving ahead with the impeachment inquiry. They argue that Trump does not need to have explicitly linked U.S. financial assistance to a Biden investigation for the call to represent a clear-cut abuse of power. “There is no requirement there be a quid pro quo in the conversation,” Pelosi said during a live event for the Atlantic. “You don't ask foreign governments to help us in our election. … I don't think there's a grasp on the part of this administration that the quid pro quo is not essential to an impeachable offense.”

-- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) says the whistleblower, whose identity remains unknown and is entitled to legal protections, wants to speak to members of his committee and has formally sought guidance from acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire about how he could do so. “We’re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower’s testimony as soon as this week,” Schiff tweeted. Lawyers for the whistleblower confirmed this.

-- The Senate passed a resolution last night, by unanimous consent and with no Republican objections, calling for the Trump administration to turn over the whistleblower complaint to the intelligence committees, as is required by law. The House plans to vote later today on a resolution condemning the administration’s refusal to provide the complaint. Meanwhile, Trump is scheduled to sit down with the Ukrainian president later today at the U.N. General Assembly. Maguire, the acting DNI, is scheduled to testify in open session tomorrow before the House Intelligence Committee and then in closed session before the Senate Intelligence Committee.

-- Pelosi personally informed Trump of her decision to move forward with an impeachment inquiry in a Tuesday morning phone call. “The president, in New York for the U.N. meeting, telephoned the speaker to discuss gun legislation, Pelosi told lawmakers in private meetings,” per Rachael Bade, Mike DeBonis and Karoun Demirjian. “The conversation, however, quickly turned to the president’s conversations with the Ukrainian leader. Trump insisted he had nothing to do with his administration’s refusal to share with Congress an intelligence community whistleblower complaint about his actions … Trump told Pelosi that he wasn’t the one blocking the complaint. … She responded that he had the power to fix it and challenged him to turn over the complaint.”

-- The New York Times reports that White House and intelligence officials are trying to hash out a plan to release a redacted version of the whistleblower report in a bid to quell calls for impeachment and sow Democratic divisions on the best path forward: “People familiar with the situation said the administration was putting the complaint through a declassification process and planned to release a redacted version within days,” Michael Schmidt, Julian Barnes and Maggie Haberman report. “The appearance that they were stonewalling Congress, in their view, could prove more damaging than the whistle-blower’s account. Mr. Trump also believes that the allegations about him are not nearly as damning as they have been portrayed and that disclosing them will undercut the impeachment drive, people close to the president said.”

-- A senior administration official told Politico that the White House is “preparing” to give Congress both the whistleblower complaint and the inspector general’s report by the end of this week. “The administration official stressed the decision and timing could change over the next few days,” Nancy Cook reports. “The format of presentation, or process of viewing the documents, wasn't decided. The president has agreed to the move, the official added.”

-- Even though the whistleblower complaint focused on the Trump call with Zelensky, officials familiar with its contents say that it includes references to other developments tied to the president, including efforts by Giuliani to insert himself into U.S.-Ukrainian relations. “Rudy — he did all of this,” one U.S. official said. “This s---show that we’re in — it’s him injecting himself into the process.” That anonymous quote comes from a story that posted last night by Greg Miller, Josh Dawsey, Paul Sonne and Ellen Nakashima.

“Trump’s attempt to pressure the leader of Ukraine followed a months-long fight inside the administration that sidelined national security officials and empowered political loyalists … to exploit the U.S. relationship with Kiev,” they report. “The sequence, which began early this year, involved the abrupt removal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, the circumvention of senior officials on the National Security Council, and the suspension of hundreds of millions of dollars of aid administered by the Defense and State departments — all as key officials from these agencies struggled to piece together Giuliani’s activities from news reports.

“Several officials described tense meetings on Ukraine among national security officials at the White House leading up to the president’s phone call on July 25, sessions that led some participants to fear that Trump and those close to him appeared prepared to use U.S. leverage with the new leader of Ukraine for Trump’s political gain. As those worries intensified, some senior officials worked behind the scenes to hold off a Trump meeting or call with [Zelensky] out of concern that Trump would use the conversation to press Kiev for damaging information on Trump’s potential rival in the 2020 race …

“U.S. officials described an atmosphere of intense pressure inside the NSC and other departments since the existence of the whistleblower complaint became known, with some officials facing suspicion that they had a hand either in the complaint or in relaying damaging information to the whistleblower … One official — speaking, like others, on the condition of anonymity — described the climate as verging on ‘bloodletting.’ … Trump has fanned this dynamic with his own denunciations of the whistleblower and thinly veiled suggestions that the person should be outed. … Trump’s closest advisers, including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who was ordered by Trump to suspend the aid to Ukraine, are also increasingly targets of internal finger-pointing. Mulvaney has agitated for foreign aid to be cut universally but has also stayed away from meetings with Giuliani and Trump …

“Then-national security adviser John Bolton was outraged by the outsourcing of a relationship with a country struggling to survive Russian aggression … But by then his standing with Trump was strained, and neither he nor his senior aides could get straight answers about Giuliani’s agenda or authority … Giuliani told The Post that one of his calls with a top Ukrainian aide was partially arranged by Kurt Volker, a State Department official, and that he briefed the department afterward. ‘We had the same visibility as anybody else — watching Giuliani on television,’ a former senior official said. Officials at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev were similarly deprived of information, even as they faced questions from Ukrainians about whether Giuliani was a designated representative.”

-- Giuliani had an outburst on Fox News last night when a fellow panelist was talking over him. “Shut up, moron,” Giuliani shouted on “The Ingraham Angle,” yelling at liberal radio host Christopher Hahn. “Shut up. You don’t know what you’re talking about.” (Allyson Chiu)

DEMOCRATIC DIVISIONS REMAIN OVER IMPEACHMENT:

-- Pelosi’s declaration left unsettled key questions about how that investigation will unfold. Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade explore some of them: “How sweeping will the probe be? How long will it last? Who will conduct it? And will Pelosi’s unilateral pronouncement — which was delivered with no immediate plans to ratify it with a House vote — do anything to change the course of existing investigations that have hit a stone wall of White House resistance? … The lack of detail about the road ahead, according to interviews with more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers and aides, reflected both the speed with which once-wavering Democrats unified behind a formal impeachment probe — and the continuing divisions among them on how it should be conducted. …

“[T]he House Judiciary Committee will continue playing the lead role in the proceedings, despite the desire of some Democrats to involve a broader swath of lawmakers and to at least partly sideline Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), the panel’s fervently pro-impeachment chairman. In the days leading up to Tuesday’s announcement, Pelosi explored potentially establishing a special ‘select’ committee, with members handpicked by House leaders, but backed away from that idea after the dispute generated protests from liberals and threatened to divide the caucus along ideological lines. … The past two presidential impeachment processes, involving [Nixon] and Bill Clinton, included votes of the full House authorizing the Judiciary Committee to formally investigate. There are no plans for such a vote now … That is a question likely to be litigated in the courts. …

“Meanwhile, an even more fundamental dispute lingered — one that may not be resolved any time soon. Many Democrats are urging that the inquiry focus solely on the present outcry … and not on other alleged abuses, such as the potential obstruction of justice detailed by [Mueller], episodes of congressional stonewalling and instances of bigotry. More than 30 Democratic lawmakers announced support for impeachment just this week, many of them Democratic ‘frontliners’ in vulnerable districts who said that the Ukraine allegations prompted them to speak out. … ‘This should be a very distinct procedure relative to this allegation, rather than the whole basket,’ said Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), a freshman who backed impeachment proceedings Monday after months of resisting pressure to take that step.

“But Pelosi’s involvement of other committees besides the Judiciary, Foreign Affairs and Intelligence panels with direct jurisdiction over the Ukraine matter suggest the impeachment brief could go much wider. The Financial Services Committee, for instance, is probing Trump’s real estate dealings; the Ways and Means Committee is seeking Trump’s tax returns; and the Oversight and Reform Committee is investigating whether Trump is using the presidency for self-enrichment. ‘I see the most recent issue as one issue among many issues,’ said Rep. Al Green (D-Tex.), who has pushed for Trump’s impeachment for two years, forcing multiple unsuccessful votes on removing Trump over alleged instances of bigotry.”

-- Our latest whip count: 198 House Democrats now publicly support opening an impeachment inquiry. That includes 22 of the 24 Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee. Fifty-seven Democrats endorsed proceedings in a period of 24 hours:

THE POLITICS OF IMPEACHMENT:

-- House Democrats have crossed the Rubicon, and nobody really knows where it will lead. “I can’t tell you what will come from this. I don’t think anybody can,” said Dan Sena, who was executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2018. “But it is definitely going to be an X-factor going into the 2020 election.” Michael Scherer talked to several other political professionals:

Democratic strategists hope the fact pattern behind Trump’s communications with Ukraine is far more direct and damning than the complex stories of potential obstruction contained in Bob Mueller's report: “This is a more supportable narrative about his conduct,” said pollster Geoff Garin. “Trump has already admitted to most of the egregious behavior. He is out of the business of claiming nothing happened.""

“This is a more supportable narrative about his conduct,” said pollster Geoff Garin. “Trump has already admitted to most of the egregious behavior. He is out of the business of claiming nothing happened."" GOP strategists hope impeachment would gin up their voters in 2020: “There is nothing that will do more for Republican turnout than this. And the last couple of presidential elections have all been turnout elections,” said Jim McLaughlin, a pollster working on the Trump reelection effort.

-- A Quinnipiac poll that was in the field from this past Thursday through Monday found that 57 percent of voters believe Trump should not be impeached. John Wagner reports: “Among Democrats, 73 percent support impeachment, while 21 percent are opposed. Among Republicans, only 4 percent support impeachment, while 95 percent are opposed. Trump’s overall job approval rating remains in the range it has for nearly his entire presidency, with 40 percent of voters approving of how he is handling his job, and 55 percent saying they disapprove.”

-- This explains why many moderate Democrats still remain cautious. For example, Rep. Sharice Davids (D-Kan.) – who picked up a Republican seat in the Kansas City suburbs last year – expressed support for Pelosi’s pronouncement last night but carefully avoided using the word “impeachment” in her statement. (K.C. Star)

-- Biden is mostly alone in the Democratic presidential field in not calling for the House to begin an immediate impeachment inquiry. Speaking in Delaware, the former vice president called on Congress to begin proceedings if the White House continues stalling lawmakers' investigations. ""Biden, who spoke for several minutes and left without taking questions, said that if Trump doesn’t comply with Congress, it will be forced to begin impeachment hearings,"" Matt Viser, Colby Itkowitz and Cleve Wootson Jr. report:

Bernie Sanders would not say whether he would vote to convict Trump if articles of impeachment come before the Senate, saying he wants to review evidence before making a decision. He also reserved judgment about whether Hunter Biden’s conduct is fair game. ""I don’t know enough at this point to make any definitive statement,"" he said in Iowa.

He also reserved judgment about whether Hunter Biden’s conduct is fair game. ""I don’t know enough at this point to make any definitive statement,"" he said in Iowa. Elizabeth Warren said proceedings must begin now.

, who has been more cautious on the question, said Trump “has made it clear he deserves to be impeached.” Beto O’Rourke called on his former House colleagues to “finish the job and impeach him.”

called on his former House colleagues to “finish the job and impeach him.” Hillary Clinton also changed her mind, saying she’s now in favor of moving toward impeachment of a president she described as a “corrupt human tornado.” “I did not come to that decision easily or quickly,” she said, “but this is an emergency as I see it.”

-- The impeachment debate will effectively freeze the 2020 campaign, predicts ABC News political director Rick Klein: “It would all play out against an inconvenient political timeline, with hearings in the House and a potential trial in the Senate almost certainly extending well into the winter. That's the precise time that campaigning is most intense, with primary voting beginning in February. For the six senators and two sitting House members running for president, that could make for far more time spent at the day job in Washington than anticipated. Long-developed plans for policy rollouts and potential breakout moments could wind up subsumed by the news.""

-- The Trump reelection campaign immediately tried to turn the impeachment inquiry into a fundraising opportunity. Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports: “Emails, texts, tweets and a video directed his supporters to a new Republican portal designed to capi­tal­ize on Trump’s army of online donors. ‘The Democrats thrive on silencing and intimidating his supporters, like YOU, Friend. They want to take YOUR VOTE away,’ read an email to supporters Tuesday afternoon. ‘President Trump wants to know who stood with him when it mattered most.’ … The appeals on Tuesday called on his supporters to join an ‘Official Impeachment Defense Task Force’ made up of ‘only President Trump’s most LOYAL supporters,’ with suggested donations ranging from $5 to the maximum $2,800, or $45 to show support for the 45th president.”

-- In public, Trumpworld is making the impeachment inquiry look like white noise. But in private, White House aides and allies are starting to feel anxious. Politico reports: “Few in the White House or the wider Trump orbit have privately defended Trump’s call … ‘The president’s strategy on these matters has always been pretty clear: Never back up and go forward. He learned that from Page Six,’ said Newt Gingrich, an informal adviser to Trump who served as House speaker during Republicans’ impeachment inquiry of President Bill Clinton. … The White House is betting Trump can ride out this ‘outrage du jour,’ as one senior administration official called it, and move on just as he has skated through the … dozens of other threats to his presidency. … But current and former administration aides believe Trump will view the latest impeachment inquiry as a major blow to his ego — and the proceedings will likely distract him, cloud all his meetings and halt any agenda for this fall, including the passage of a major trade bill heading into an election year.”

-- The world is reacting warily to the specter of impeachment. Rick Noack and David Crawshaw report: Some experts said it “would have little effect on hot-button issues such as the trade dispute with China or his promises on Brexit, while others predicted that increased domestic pressure would force Trump to seek a quick foreign-policy breakthrough… The developments weighed on financial markets, already hit by concerns about global economic weakness and the impact of the U.S.-China trade dispute. Stocks were lower across Asia and Europe, but the dollar recovered earlier losses.”

COMMENTARY:

-- “I’m a Republican. Let’s force the question of impeachment with the GOP,” writes veteran GOP strategist Mike Murphy: “In the wake of the president’s actions on Ukraine, the Republican Party and the officials who lead it must be brutally marked to market on the issue of Trump’s fitness for office. This test would create an existential question for every Republican senator and representative: Why am I here? To serve my future or my country?”

-- “This isn’t just another spat. Trump compromised our security for his gain,” writes columnist David Ignatius: “Not for the first time, Trump was putting himself above his country. … Trump’s interruption of the delivery of essential military equipment was especially troubling for members of Congress who have served overseas with the U.S. military or intelligence agencies and know how precious our promises are.”

-- “If we legitimize Trump’s behavior, it will be open season on our politics,” writes columnist Robert Kagan: “Consider what it will mean if we decide that what Trump and Giuliani have already acknowledged doing in Ukraine becomes an acceptable practice for all future presidents … Every government in the world wishing to influence U.S. foreign policy will have an incentive to come to a sitting president with information on his or her potential political opponents.”

-- “Republicans (who decided perjury about sex was impeachment-worthy, and who thought it an abuse of power to defer deportations of certain illegal immigrants) must now decide whether to accept Trump’s standard as proper for future presidents,” writes columnist Dana Milbank.

-- Conservative columnist Max Boot identifies seven reasons why he thinks Trump should be impeached:

He obstructed the administration of justice.

He failed to defend America from foreign election interference.

He attempted to investigate and prosecute his political opponents.

He failed to produce papers and testimony as duly directed by Congress.

He conspired with Michael Cohen to conceal alleged extramarital relationships.

He misused his emergency powers to spend funds on a border wall.

He retains ownership of a global business empire, which allows him to benefit from dealings with foreign and state governments.

-- But Biden sill could wind up being the principal casualty, Pat Buchanan writes, hopefully, in the New Hampshire Union Leader: “Calls are rising for Biden’s son to be called to testify before congressional committees. ... The charges and the countercharges will become what the campaign is all about.""

-- Democrats are upholding a double standard on Ukraine, chimes in conservative columnist Marc Thiessen.

-- Impeaching Trump could hurt the institution of the presidency, worries John Yoo, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the George W. Bush administration: “If Congress could regulate presidential discussions with foreign leaders, presidents and foreign leaders would speak less candidly or stop making the calls altogether. United States foreign policy — approved by the American people at each election — would be crippled.”

-- We should talk about how Ukrainians feel about this, says Alyona Getmanchuk, director of the New Europe Center, in the Times: “Ukraine remains in a precarious position. Crimea is still under Russian control, and the war in the east continues; the fight against corruption at home is also not yet won. In all of these matters, Ukraine is reliant on bipartisan American support, which is why our leadership is desperate to avoid becoming part of the American presidential campaign. Ukraine is now facing the prospect of becoming a double victim: on the one hand, a victim of [Vladimir] Putin’s aggression; on the other, a victim of Mr. Trump’s desire to be re-elected at any price.”

-- The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board calls this the Impeachment Congress: “Mr. Trump’s invitation to Mr. Zelensky to investigate Mr. Biden, if that’s what it was, showed bad judgment in our view … But bad judgment is not a crime, and voters may demand more to annul an election only months before they have a chance to render their own judgment about Mr. Trump’s behavior.""

-- Pelosi’s patience on impeachment has paid off, so far, CNN’s Michael Warren writes: “Democrats have now created the appearance that impeachment of Trump is a last resort, not a first resort. She divorced the process from the mess of the Mueller findings. And she allowed those moderate freshmen who built her majority, rather than the divisive members on the left, to lead on the issue.”

-- “Pelosi has to hope for the worst case for Trump,"" writes National Review executive editor Rich Lowry, ""because it’s going to be difficult to climb down from impeachment now.""

-- Fox News chief political analyst Brit Hume believes Pelosi has handled this cleverly: “It strikes me that the Speaker and the other leaders are under pressure from the left wing of the party and the leftists in their caucus -- who are numerous -- to move ahead here … I think [she’s] thinking that she needs to be responsive to the needs of her caucus -- look at what she did today, it was really quite clever if you think about it.”

Bijan Rafiekian leaves a court hearing last year in Washington. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP)

THERE’S STILL A BEAR IN THE WOODS:

-- A judge overturned a jury's verdict convicting Michael Flynn’s former business partner of illegally lobbying for Turkey, saying the evidence against him was “insufficient.” Rachel Weiner reports: “'The verdict was against the heavy weight of the evidence,’ Judge Anthony J. Trenga of the Eastern District of Virginia wrote in a 39-page opinion tossing Bijan Rafiekian’s convictions. The decision is another blow to efforts by the Justice Department to crack down on unregistered lobbying for foreign governments. … Trenga pointed to the fact that Flynn was not charged or implicated by prosecutors until the eve of trial as ‘particularly telling.’”

-- Tony Podesta, a longtime Democratic power broker, and Vin Weber, a Republican former congressman, said they were notified on Monday that federal prosecutors in Manhattan had closed the inquiry into work they did that benefited Ukrainian interests. It’s another reflection of the challenges facing prosecutors attempting to more aggressively pursue possible violations of foreign lobbying rules, Tom Hamburger and Matt Zapotosky report: “The decision to drop the investigation came weeks after a federal jury in Washington found former White House counsel Gregory B. Craig not guilty of lying to the Justice Department about his media contacts related to his work for the Ukrainian government. …

""Weber and Podesta were among several lobbyists and lawyers that (Paul) Manafort helped bring aboard as part of an effort to improve the image of the Ukrainian government between 2012 and 2014, according to Mueller’s report. Mueller ultimately referred the case involving the two men to federal prosecutors in New York. ... As the investigation proceeded, Podesta closed his iconic lobbying firm, the Podesta Group, in the fall of 2017. Weber left Mercury, a firm he had helped lead since 2011, in August.”

-- A federal judge rejected former Trump confidant Roger Stone’s request to suppress all evidence gathered through 18 search warrants at his November trial. Spencer S. Hsu reports: “Attorneys for Stone had argued that prosecutors illegally relied on unproven assumptions about Russia’s involvement and sought to force them to prove in court the role of Russian operatives in hacks on the Democratic National Committee and [Clinton’s] presidential campaign chairman, John Podesta, among others. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said Stone had ‘not come close’ to showing the government misled the magistrates or judges who approved the warrants, that federal agents knowingly or intentionally lied to them or that the warrants were premised on Russia’s role in the hacking.”

Students line up for school lunches at an elementary school in Canton, Miss. (Rogelio V. Solis/AP)

THE DOMESTIC AGENDA:

-- A new Trump administration proposal to limit the number of people who qualify for food stamps could end free school lunches for about 500,000 American children. Moriah Balingit reports: “The change, proposed over the summer, would cut an estimated 3 million people from the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. It is intended to eliminate eligibility for people who get food stamps because they have qualified for other forms of government aid, even though they may have savings or other assets. But the impact of the cuts is anticipated to go further: Children in those households could also lose access to free school lunches, since food stamp eligibility is one way students can qualify for the lunches.”

-- NASA is trying to land on the moon, and its biggest obstacle might be Congress. Christian Davenport reports: NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine, a Republican from Oklahoma, is seeking “votes in Congress for what could become one of the boldest human exploration endeavors NASA has undertaken in decades — the first return to the moon since the end of the Apollo era. … Bridenstine knows that before NASA builds the rockets, spacecraft and lunar landers needed for the mission, the agency must clear the political roadblocks that are every bit as daunting as the vacuum of space. While members of Congress love to say they support NASA — as they do lowering crime or boosting national security — getting them to increase the agency’s budget is another story. Traditionally, space does not equal votes in elections. And getting Democrats to support a project that, if successful, could be a legacy for the Trump administration is going to be a tough sell.”

-- The administration has granted few waivers to visitors blocked from entering the U.S. by the travel ban Trump imposed days after taking office, with officers arguing that people from five predominantly Muslim countries continue to pose a national security threat. Abigail Haulsohner reports: “Since the initial rollout, in early 2017, of what critics and federal judges have branded a ‘Muslim ban,’ the Trump administration has fielded approximately 72,000 visa applications from the citizens of Iran, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Syria, a U.S. State Department official told members of Congress on Tuesday. Approximately 10 percent of those applicants — 7,679 — have received waivers to enter the United States, according to Edward Ramotowski, deputy assistant secretary for visa services at the department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs, who testified during a House judiciary and foreign affairs subcommittee hearing.”

-- The chief executive of Juul Labs is stepping down amid outrage over the soaring use of teenage vaping. From the Times: “The executive, Kevin Burns, will be replaced by K.C. Croswaite, an executive from Altria, the major tobacco company that owns a 35 percent stake in Juul, the San-Francisco-based company. Juul also said it would end one of its campaigns, ‘Make the Switch,’ which the Food and Drug Administration had criticized as an effort to portray its e-cigarettes as safer than traditional cigarettes. The company also said it would not fight the Trump administration’s proposal to ban flavored e-cigarettes.”

-- Massachusetts will place a four-month ban on all sales of vaping products, the toughest state crackdown on e-cigarettes so far. Hannah Knowles reports: “Bans on sales of flavored vaping products took effect this month in New York and Michigan, and the Trump administration said it plans to enact a similar regulation at the federal level. Flavored products have attracted particular scrutiny from policymakers who say they are getting children hooked on nicotine. But Massachusetts would go beyond a flavor ban to also temporarily eliminate tobacco and marijuana e-cigarettes from the market. Officials say the halt will allow time to properly investigate a crisis that’s expanded to 530 cases in 38 states as of last week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.”

-- California health officials called on everyone to stop vaping immediately, per the Los Angeles Times: “‘We are seeing something that we have not seen before,’ said Dr. Charity Dean, California’s acting public health officer, in a statement. ‘There are numerous unknown factors at this time, and due to the uncertainty of the exact cause, it is our recommendation that consumers refrain from vaping until the investigation has concluded.’”

-- House Republicans are seriously considering relaxing term limits for committee chairmen. From Politico: “House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy floated the idea of changing the GOP’s long-standing rule that allows members to be the top Republican on a committee for only three terms, regardless of whether they serve in the majority or minority. One idea that was suggested, according to multiple Republican sources who attended the meeting, is allowing a lawmaker’s term as ranking member to not count the same as a chairmanship.”

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- A new United Nations climate report finds that massive change is already here for the world’s oceans and frozen regions. Chris Mooney and Brady Dennis report: “Wednesday’s report on the world’s oceans, glaciers, polar regions and ice sheets finds that such effects only foreshadow a more catastrophic future as long as greenhouse gas emissions remain unchecked. Given current emissions levels, a number of serious impacts are essentially unavoidable, says the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Extreme floods that have historically struck some coastal cities and small island nations once every 100 years will become an annual occurrence by 2050, according to the IPCC. In addition, if emissions continue to increase, global sea levels could rise by more than three feet by the end of this century — around 12 percent higher than the group estimated as recently as 2013. Melting glaciers could harm water supplies, and warming oceans could wreck marine fisheries. … More than 100 scientists from around the world contributed to the latest report...""

-- A glacier on Mont Blanc could collapse. From the BBC: “About 250,000 cubic metres of ice are in danger of breaking away from the Planpincieux glacier on the Grandes Jorasses peak ... The mayor of the nearby town of Courmayeur said global warming was changing the mountain. … The glacier, in the Glarus Alps, has shrunk to a tiny fraction of its original size. Scientists say it has lost at least 80% of its volume just since 2006, a trend accelerated by rising global temperatures.”

-- The Trump administration declared there’s no “international right to abortion” during the U.N. General Assembly, calling on other countries to join a coalition pushing the elimination of what it calls “ambiguous” terms and expressions, such as sexual and reproductive health, from U.N. documents. Ariana Eunjung Cha reports: “Earlier this year, HHS officials began meeting with representatives from other countries, urging them to join a new international coalition that would focus on the value of the family, and which would not condone harmful sexual risks for young people, or promote abortion as a means of family planning.

“Other countries, civil society and women’s rights groups have expressed alarm at the efforts and accused the United States of aligning with countries like Saudi Arabia and Sudan with poor human rights records and, also, of putting unfair pressure on poor countries that depend on U.S. aid.""

-- Trump condemned globalism during his address to the General Assembly. Anne Gearan and Seung Min Kim report: “Trump read his address in a somber monotone, rarely punctuating words or pausing for emphasis, but his message for the 74th session of the annual gathering of world leaders was clear as he argued that a view of the world as a global commons had ‘exerted a religious pull over past leaders’ at the expense of their own nations. … In his 37-minute address, Trump stressed that all nations must take care of themselves first while adding that the United States would get involved abroad only when its own interests were threatened. He also used his platform Tuesday to take a hard line against Iran...""

-- Trump also heaped praise on Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi during UNGA. At home, Sissi faces mass protests to step down from human rights activists. Siobhán O’Grady reports: “When asked Monday whether he was concerned about the anti-Sissi demonstrations, Trump shrugged the suggestion aside. ‘Demonstrations? No, everybody has demonstrations,’ he told reporters ... ‘Egypt has a great leader. He’s highly respected; he’s brought order. Before he was here, there was very little order. There was chaos. So I’m not worried about that.’ … Trump and Sissi’s meeting Monday came just days after viral videos from a former government contractor alleging Sissi was complicit in a large-scale corruption scandal provoked protests in Egypt. People took to the streets in Cairo and elsewhere Friday, chanting, ‘Rise up, fear not, Sissi must go.’ The protests were relatively small but significant because such concerted public displays against Sissi are rare.”

-- Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said the Amazon isn’t on fire, rejecting calls for foreign intervention. Marina Lopes reports: “The Amazon isn’t in flames, he told [UNGA] in New York, but brimming with riches. And Brazil will decide how to develop it. ‘We are open to explore our potential in a sustainable way, through partnerships that add value,’ Bolsonaro said. It was his first address on the world stage since the worst fires in a decade hit the Amazon this year. In a speech peppered with references to God, socialism and patriotism, he said foreign powers with an eye on Brazil’s natural riches ‘have an interest in keeping indigenous people living like cave men.’”

-- Venezuela’s ex-intelligence chief said he told President Nicolás Maduro about Colombian guerrilla camps in Venezuela. Anthony Faiola reports: Gen. Manuel Ricardo Cristopher Figueroa said he hand-delivered reports including the rough locations and activities of Colombian drug cartels and criminal gangs operating on Venezuelan soil. “‘They never took action,’ he said. ‘You could say that Maduro is a friend of the guerrillas.’ Maduro, the head of Venezuela’s socialist government, has long voiced ideological sympathy for Colombia’s leftist guerrillas. But he has denied claims by Colombian officials and others that his government has cooperated with them. … The classified report ... offers new allegations about the scope of Maduro’s personal knowledge of the guerrillas’ presence and activities at a time when tensions in the region are rapidly escalating. “

-- Hong Kong police are waging a war on facts as protests on the island continue. David Crawshaw and Timothy McLaughlin report: “The ‘yellow object’ lying on the ground had a distinct shape, evident in the video footage that surfaced later. Certainly, a good portion of it was bright yellow. It appeared to have arms. And two protrusions that resembled legs. Someone had dressed the object in dark-colored shorts. As Hong Kong police officers swarmed over the object and roughed it up in a dark alley, it appeared to squirm. … With Beijing asserting increasing control over the city’s institutions and Hong Kong’s leader refusing to allow an independent inquiry into police behavior, authorities here appear not to fear the consequences of violating protocols intended to uphold the rule of law. Instead, their approach this week was to obfuscate. Asked Monday about the incident in Yuen Long, an outlying area of Hong Kong, acting senior superintendent Vasco Williams said footage showed an ‘officer kicking a yellow object,’ not a man lying on the ground.”

-- As China’s government denounced Mike Pompeo’s criticism of its treatment of Muslims, a newly released video shows about 300 to 400 Uighur men being herded like prisoners at a train station in the country’s Xinjiang province. (CBS News)

This is a column about Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and why you should or should not prefer the former over the latter. But before digging into that question, I’d like call your attention to something that is too often ignored in the “Bernie vs. Warren” debate: The American left’s bark is louder than its bite.

In recent years, socialists and their left-liberal fellow travelers have accrued an unprecedented degree of influence over our nation’s political discourse. As the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis undermined mainstream economic orthodoxy — and radicalized a generation of overeducated, underemployed journalists and academics — the technocracy’s center of gravity shifted leftward. In 2019, the Democrats’ Establishment think tank is agitating for industry-wide collective bargaining, the mainstream media has adopted a reflexively sympathetic attitude toward striking public-sector workers, and conscious capitalists are giving TED Talks on the evils of neoliberalism.

Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders’s surprising strength in the 2016 primaries and Hillary Clinton’s devastating weakness in that year’s general election — and the online left’s success in popularizing its interpretations of both phenomena— persuaded many 2020 Democratic hopefuls to stop worrying and learn to love social democracy. At the first three Democratic debates, the middle-ground position on health care was a public option strong enough to jeopardize the viability of private insurance. On higher education, it was free public college for all children from working-class families. On climate, it was “only” $1.7 trillion in green investments, and a mandate for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

But the left’s ideological clout far outstrips its material strength. American socialism is heavy on superstructure, light on base. The current trade-union movement is weak by historic standards, representing a piddling 10.5 percent of the U.S. workforce. Independent leftist organizations like the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) have grown since 2016 but still lack the scale and mass working-class membership that made such entities formidable agents of social change in earlier eras of American history. In the electoral realm, progressive challengers scored a couple notable victories in the 2018 primaries but failed to foment a “tea party of the left.” Outside of low-turnout elections in deep-blue districts, organizations like Our Revolution, Justice Democrats, and DSA gave Democratic incumbents little cause for fearing their wrath. And where left insurgents did win open primaries in purple territory, they failed to affirm their theory of change: Nominating economic populists unencumbered by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s allergy to class-warfare rhetoric and radical reforms like Medicare for All did not fix what’s the matter with Kansas. Sanders-backed ironworker Randy Bryce did worse in Wisconsin’s 1st District last year than Hillary Clinton did in 2016. Single-payer supporter Kara Eastman failed to flip Nebraska’s 2nd. The 2018 elections did not prove the electoral necessity of moderation — Warren acolyte Katie Porter pulled out a tough win in a historically Republican California district; Senator Tammy Baldwin’s calls for abolishing private insurance and putting workers on corporate boards proved compatible with winning reelection in a Trump state — but nor did they prove that Sanders-ism an electoral panacea.

Thus far, the 2020 primary has further undermined the notion that Democratic voters will overwhelmingly support radical change if only the left can get the Establishment’s thumbs off the scale. Joe Biden owes his front-runner status less to his party’s high-dollar donors than its high-propensity voters. Few Democratic pooh-bahs went into 2019 favoring Uncle Joe. Many saw Kamala Harris as Hillary’s heiress apparent, while others were so averse to backing Obama’s senescent wingman that they put their chips on the mayor of South Bend instead. But the people (or a plurality of them, anyway) have preferred Biden. The fact that Warren and Sanders are his chief rivals — rather than Harris and Buttigieg — may reflect the radicalization of some segments of the Democratic electorate. But much of the rank and file evinces little interest in their party’s ideological divides. And a significant portion of Democratic-base voters still espouse a preference for ideological moderation (however hazily defined).

Finally, even if the left were to build enthusiastic majoritarian support for a radical break with “Obamaism” among both Democratic-primary voters and the general public, it might still have difficulty enacting its legislative agenda. Both chambers of Congress overrepresent the most conservative elements in American society. And with its six-year terms and immense incumbency advantages, the Senate largely insulates Democrats in even the bluest states from grassroots pressure (see: Feinstein, Dianne).

The left is too weak to enact Sanders’s or Warren’s big plans. Do either of them have a plan for that?

Much of the time, the Democratic left is content to wage its “Bernie vs. Warren” civil war in a parallel universe free of this context. Sanders supporters comb through the Warren campaign’s every utterance on health care for intimations of agnosticism on single-payer, as though the chief obstacle to Medicare for All in 2021 will be the next Democratic president’s lack of backbone rather than the fact that there are currently 14 votes for Bernie’s bill in Chuck Schumer’s caucus (and none of the Democrats who oppose single-payer had any trouble winning renomination in the 2018 primaries). Meanwhile, progressive intellectuals debate the relative merits of Warren’s left-liberalism and Sanders’s “democratic socialism” as though the central question facing the next Democratic administration will be whether to implement the Meidner plan or settle for Denmark’s model of social democracy.

This isn’t to say that there are no areas where Warren’s and Sanders’s disparate worldviews and personal backgrounds could have real substantive implications. The commander-in-chief has immense discretion over foreign policy, and up to now Sanders appears more interested than Warren in radically reforming the Democratic Party’s approach to geopolitics. The president also has considerable power to shape domestic policy through regulatory appointments and creative interpretations of existing statutory authority — forms of “lawfare” to which Warren may be especially well suited.

Given how far the left is from possessing the power it will need to turn its wildest “green dreams” into reality, however, the most worthwhile Bernie-versus-Warren arguments may concern tactics, not policy. Whether Sanders’s approach to expropriating the billionaire class is preferable to Warren’s isn’t a question that’s likely to be of much practical consequence in the medium-term future. But whether his approach to winning elections — and using his power to build up the left’s — is more viable than Warren’s absolutely is.

In recent days, the staunchly pro-Sanders publication Jacobin has made the latter case, arguing that Sanders’s theory of change is both radically distinct from and superior to Warren’s. Refreshingly, the socialist magazine premises its argument on a frank acknowledgement of the left’s sorry state. In its account, Warren may have been a suitable agent of structural change three decades ago, when the grassroots left was still strong enough to arrange “a tense but functional relationship between a reformist administration in the White House and a strong and organized working class that could at least challenge capital’s imperatives.” But in the current context, the left doesn’t command enough divisions to make use of Warren’s technocratic gifts. It needs foot soldiers, not plans. And Bernie Sanders is uniquely capable of reassembling the left’s army because of his deeper commitment to radical, bottom-up change, his greater appeal to blue-collar constituencies, and his more unabashedly adversarial relationship with the Democratic Party.

I find this unconvincing. But Jacobin’s case merits examination, as it’s focused on the right questions: How do we get from where we are to a polity in which our plans actually matter? And is Warren or Sanders more likely to get us there?

The differences between Sanders and Warren may be smaller than they appear (in Jacobin articles, anyway).

One obstacle to a productive debate over whether Warren or Sanders is a more viable agent of change is the temptation to exaggerate the distinctions between their respective modes of operation. In “Elizabeth Warren’s Strategy Within the Democratic Party Is All Wrong,” Jacobin’s (typically incisive) Branko Marcetic falls prey to that impulse. In his column, Marcetic argues that the Massachusetts senator’s reported outreach to the Democratic Establishment betrays her commitment to an “inside strategy” that is bound to fail. The problem with his argument is that its central premise — that Warren’s decision to court power players in the Democratic Party sharply distinguishes her campaign from Sanders’s — appears to be false.

Marcetic’s essay is based on a New York Times story from last month that reported that, in an apparent bid to ingratiate herself with superdelegates, Warren had told influential Democratic brokers that she wanted to build power within the party and wouldn’t be assembling her own independent grassroots army. Sanders’s supporters responded to this news with (gleeful) indignation, as it appeared to heighten the contradictions between his and her theories of change. And yet, the most significant difference ostensibly established by the Times article — that Warren was forswearing the kind of independent organizing that Sanders champions — wasn’t actually any distinction at all. Oddly, Marcetic concedes this point in a parenthetical but declines to address its implications for his broader argument:

On August 26, the New York Times reported that Warren has been aggressively courting Democratic officials behind the scenes, assuring them, in the paper’s telling, that she is a loyal Democrat and does not plan to create her own political or organizing infrastructure outside the party. (The next day, the Association of State Democratic Committees announced that Sanders and a number of other candidates have, like Warren, pledged not to create “any organizing or messaging infrastructure that is parallel or duplicative” to the DNC or state parties.)

Marcetic proceeds to suggest that, even if Warren’s pledge is not as distinctive as it first appeared, her courting of superdelegates is:

Besides trying to convince Democrats that her progressive ideas won’t make her “unelectable,” Warren’s private assurances that she simply wants to breathe new life into the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and help the party recapture Congress, the Times notes, also have a politically strategic element. Thanks to a rule change last year, if no single candidate wins an outright majority of delegates in the primaries — a plausible scenario in this crowded field — the superdelegates will once again have a large role in choosing the nominee, this time on the second ballot. And, should it come down to a second ballot, Warren wants their votes.

It’s unclear how easily these overtures to the DNC will sit with Warren’s plans for major structural change in the United States.

This distinction, too, is nonexistent: In May, a Sanders-campaign aide told BuzzFeed News, “We’re taking superdelegates and superdelegates strategy seriously, hence having a team dedicated to delegates who can prepare for multiple convention scenarios. We will be reaching out to them over the course of the campaign. When the senator wins the nomination, he’s eager to work with them to support and unite all the party in the general and beyond.”

There is nothing especially telling about a candidate’s seeking the approval of powerful figures in the party whose nomination he or she is trying to win. To neglect such “inside” tactics would be political malpractice, as the Sanders campaign readily acknowledges.

Nevertheless, differences between each candidate’s relationship with the Democratic Party persist.

All this said, it is true that, as a general matter, Sanders has a more adversarial relationship with the Democratic Party than Warren. He has, of course, refused to join the party for the duration of his congressional career, and he has used that formal independence to criticize the Democratic Establishment with a (generally righteous) fury that Warren has reserved for financial executives. He has also made some efforts to build an independent political infrastructure capable of challenging incumbent Democrats that refuse to get with his program (though he has apparently promised to suspend those efforts upon winning the nomination).

Given these facts, it isn’t wholly implausible to view the “Bernie vs. Warren” debate as a proxy for a broader dispute over the left’s relationship to the Democratic Party. Namely: Should progressives and socialists seek to co-opt the Democratic brand, build power within its institutions, and seek accommodation with its leadership, out of a recognition that the left is strong enough (and, for now, ideologically fashionable enough) to exert influence as one interest group within the Democrats’ big tent but far too weak to establish an independent political identity capable of capturing the loyalties of the Democratic base? Or is the Democratic brand too toxic with the working class — and its leadership too entrenched and aligned with capital — to be worth co-opting? Which is to say: Is popularizing a socialist identity that can bridge America’s partisan divide and mobilize its nonvoters — while building an independent party-like entity capable of disciplining its candidates and putting the fear of obsolescence into the Democratic leadership — the only path to radical reform?

It is not clear to me that Sanders is personally committed to the latter theory of change (given his aforementioned pledge, and decades of productive cooperation with the Democratic leadership, it seems possible that becoming blue America’s standard-bearer would dispel his reservations about working within the two-party system). But many of his most enthusiastic, socialist supporters are; Jacobin’s editors, and many members of the DSA, proselytize an electoral strategy of building an independent socialist party that competes on the Democratic ballot line when necessary. And even if a President Sanders does not directly participate in that project, the election of a self-avowed socialist would surely abet such efforts more than that of a staunchly pro-market progressive Democrat.

So, for the sake of argument, let’s stipulate that Bernie plans to violate his pledges and brook no compromise with the Democrats’ old regime. What is the evidence for the premise that forswearing all accommodation with the Democratic Party would maximize the left’s gains?

Toward the end of his column, Marcetic gestures at one answer:

An insurgent movement like the Tea Party made heavy use of confrontational tactics and primary challenges to wrench the Republican Party toward its end of the political spectrum. Donald Trump’s antagonistic relationship with a GOP establishment that largely opposed him didn’t stop him from both winning the Republican primary and the general election, and today’s GOP has been refashioned in Trump’s image, with even his fiercest Republican critics now fully signing on to his agenda. Trump did this not by convincing members of the GOP establishment that he was correct, but by rallying voters and making it virtually impossible for Republicans to both keep their jobs and oppose him. If the next Democratic president fails to achieve something similar, they won’t just face an obstructionist Republican bloc, but a host of conservative Democrats who will stand as a barrier to their agenda, just as Obama did in 2009…Only a direct challenge to the power of those elites will enable a progressive president to overcome it.

There are several problems with this analogy. First, it is not clear why pursuing diplomacy with Establishment factions — while seeking control of a party’s apparatus — is incompatible with abetting some primary challenges (Warren’s staff has significant ties to the organization Justice Democrats, which exists to orchestrate such campaigns). Second, Donald Trump absolutely sought reconciliation with the GOP Establishment upon winning his party’s nomination in 2016, noticeably adjusted his platform to suit its wishes, and owed his victory largely to the strength of the RNC’s infrastructure (his own campaign being a ramshackle mess). Third, Trump’s fiercest critics have not actually “fully” signed on to his agenda. In fact, Republican senators have repeatedly rebuffed the president on his signature issue, voting down Trump’s proposed reductions in legal immigration by wide margins. One might therefore interpret Trump as a testament to the limitations of the inside game. But then does anyone really believe that America’s nativists would be exercising more power in our politics had they begrudged Trump his accommodations with the GOP’s corporate wing or attempted to popularize an independent political identity, instead of seeking to claim the Republican Party as their own? And can anyone argue that Trump has been too soft on his intraparty critics?

The lesson of Trump’s failure to rally Republican senators behind his immigration agenda is that it is extremely hard to force a U.S. senator to vote for something he or she strongly opposes — whether through direct challenges or backroom cajoling. Six-year terms, sky-high renomination rates, and, in many cases, the ability to obstruct all of a president’s other priorities make it very hard for a White House to hold any senator’s feet to the fire. Putting the fear of a credible primary challenge into all 33 of the Democratic senators who’ve withheld their support for Bernie’s health-care bill looks implausible on its face. And given the left’s showing in House races in 2018 (not to mention its sorry efforts at Senate challenges), the task appears even more implausible upon closer examination.

The left’s weakness makes it trivially easy to demonstrate how someone else’s approach to creating radical change will prove inadequate. It is much harder to make a persuasive case for one’s own. Sanders supporters are right that nothing less than a political revolution can make Medicare for All and a Green New Deal realities. But the evidence that Bernie is capable of fomenting such a revolution is limited. On the one hand, Sanders has assembled impressive small-dollar donor armies and volunteer networks. His ascent has undoubtedly abetted DSA’s growth. And he has used his vast email list to recruit reinforcements for various labor actions and protests, thereby demonstrating his commitment to social movements and to non-electoral forms of political contestation.

On the other hand, Sanders has had a national platform for three years now. He has built up an independent organization and traveled the country proselytizing for class struggle. And none of it has been sufficient for his acolytes to dominate Democratic primaries, or to win him a broader base of support for his 2020 run than he had in 2016, or even to keep his approval rating from slipping underwater. Although one can point to some polls showing Sanders with an enviable favorability rating, RealClearPolitics’ polling average shows the public disapproving of the socialist senator by a margin of 46.3 to 43.1 percent. It is possible that Sanders’s popularity and influence will balloon once he attains power. But it’s worth noting that even Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s historic popularity — and the existence of strong labor, socialist, and communist movements — were insufficient to render FDR’s attempted “purge” of anti–New Deal Democrats in the 1938 primaries successful.

In light of these facts, is it not conceivable that a president more closely aligned with the Democratic Party — and less openly hostile to its key power centers — would actually be able to get senators like Jon Tester and Kyrsten Sinema to swallow marginally more progressive legislation in 2021 than a president with an independent political identity who projected contempt for their wing of the party? Put differently, would such senators feel more inclined to perform their independence from a socialist president who’d deliberately stoked the enmity of centrist Democrats, or a “capitalist to her bones” progressive president who’d nursed Third Wayers’ threatened egos?

I do not want to live in a republic where maximizing the number of Americans with quality health insurance requires buttering up Joe Manchin in back rooms. But are we sure that that isn’t the republic we’ll be living in for the foreseeable future?

To be sure, many of Sanders’s socialist supporters see their project as a generational one. And the incremental benefits of maximizing the left’s clout in the Democratic Party today (with all the distasteful, coalition-solidifying compromises that ostensibly requires) may pale next to the radical possibilities that militancy could open up tomorrow. After all, even if righteous intransigence does not immediately inspire a mobilization capable of cowing centrist Democrats, the struggle could facilitate the recruitment of progressives into the independent, mass-membership socialist party, a development sought by Jacobin. And yet, even if the goal is to maximize the left’s power in 2030, it’s not obvious why building a party-like structure outside of the Democratic tent is a more promising strategy than competing for authority within it.

As Jacobin’s Seth Ackerman has ably explained, American election law treats the two major parties as state institutions and uses discriminatory ballot-access rules to stymie third parties. For this reason, he insists that socialists make peace with competing on the Democratic ballot line, even as they build a “a membership-run organization with its own name, its own logo, its own identity and therefore its own platform, and its own ideology.” And yet the institutionalization of the two major parties, combined with partisan polarization, makes the task of popularizing an alternative, left-wing political identity enormously difficult. The American left will achieve nothing without the backing of the black working class. And while not all African-Americans proudly identify as Democrats, a very hefty percentage of them feel a profound loyalty to the party of civil rights and Barack Obama. And the same is true for many of the left’s other key constituencies. At present, the Democratic Party is an institution that manages to put Latinx housekeepers in Las Vegas in coalition with white industrial laborers in Dearborn, black church ladies in Charleston, and long-winded politics bloggers in Manhattan. The party’s infrastructure is relatively porous on the local level, where even the most formidable Democratic “machines” have proved unable to fend off challenges from charismatic bartenders. And while the party’s base voters have strong partisan identities, many are open to a wide range of definitions of what it means to be a true Democrat in ideological terms; some recent surveys suggest Bernie Sanders is the most popular second choice among Joe Biden backers.

Given these conditions, why isn’t commandeering the Democratic Party’s infrastructure, platform, and considerable social base not a simpler, faster, and more viable path to power than attempting to build an entirely new party and political identity and then hijacking the Democrats’ ballot line — in the ostensible hope that voters who affirmatively choose to register as Democrats will look more favorably on leftist primary challengers who disparage their party than on candidates who claim membership in it?

Proletarians prefer L.L. Bean?

In “Elizabeth Warren Is Thirty Years Too Late,” Connor Kilpatrick and Bhaskar Sunkara do not address this question directly. But their analysis suggests that the existing Democratic coalition is too heavily reliant on affluent voters for the party to serve as an effective vehicle of radical change, and that Bernie’s relative distance from the taint of the Democratic brand and greater affinity for class politics and bottom-up organizing make him uniquely capable of winning back the legions of working-class voters whom Third Way Democrats lost to right-wing populism or political apathy.

Like Marcetic’s piece, Kilpatrick and Sunkara’s draws strong conclusions from limited evidence. The authors observe that Sanders’s support among Democratic-primary voters is markedly less white and more working-class than Warren’s. In fact, many surveys have suggested that Warren owes her viability to overwhelming support among professional-class white liberals — or, as Kilpatrick and Sunkara describe them, “Patagonia Democrats.” This distinction between the class composition of the two progressive candidates’ nascent coalitions has become a popular talking point among Sanders supporters. And it may have some validity. In Vermont, Sanders has regularly outperformed other Democrats with white, non-college-educated voters. It’s plausible that his brand of politics may play better with a critical mass of secular, rural, white swing voters in Wisconsin, and therefore that he would be a stronger general-election candidate than Warren.

But Kilpatrick and Sunkara use this polling data to make a far more sweeping claim. Sanders’s greater appeal with blue-collar Democratic-primary voters doesn’t merely suggest he can improve on Clinton’s margins in Kenosha County, but that he can reorient the polarization of U.S. politics along class lines. In their telling, Warren’s coalition is potentially broad “enough to keep Republicans from the White House but not Congress or state legislatures. It would be yet another coalition that could win but never govern.” Bernie’s working-class coalition, by contrast, would have the numbers and self-interest necessary to force radical change through political institutions that were designed to thwart it.

That America’s low- and middle-income workers do not share a class consciousness or partisan coalition is a genuine constraint on radical economic reform. Kilpatrick and Sunkara’s commitment to overcoming that constraint is commendable. But the fact that Sanders commands the loyalties of a disproportionately working-class 16 percent of the Democratic-primary electorate scarcely qualifies as evidence that his appeal with non-college-educated voters is so powerful it can radically realign American politics. After all, Biden boasts even stronger support among nonwhite and working-class Democrats. Does that mean that nominating Uncle Joe would reassemble the New Deal coalition? Sanders supporters might dismiss the racial and socioeconomic diversity of Biden’s support as a product of mere name recognition. But Warren backers can play that card against Sanders too: In the last week, multiple polls have shown her not only gaining more non-college-educated and non-white support as her campaign rolls on, but actually outperforming Sanders with such voters.

Quinnipiac poll on whether you would be “excited” if one of the 2020 Dems became the nominee:



Black voters: Biden 70%, Warren 68%, Sanders 63%



White Democrats w/o college degree: Warren 69%, Biden 54%, Sanders 52% — Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) September 25, 2019

Regardless, the evidence that no Democratic candidate can drastically change the party’s class composition in the near term is considerable. The movement of non-college-educated white voters to the right — and college-educated white ones to the left — is not an exceptionally American phenomenon. Rather, it has been happening for decades across much of Western Europe. The left attributes this development to center-left parties’ myriad betrayals of their working-class constituencies in the neoliberal era. And that is certainly part of the story. But it is also the case that non-college-educated white voters in the West have, in the aggregate, long evinced a preference for restricted immigration in opinion polls. It’s conceivable that, irrespective of economic policy, the demographic shifts of the past three decades were bound to increase the salience of immigration in partisan politics and thus drive a significant portion of the white working class away from center-left parties with bases in diverse urban centers.

But whatever the origins of this development, there is little evidence that left-wing parties can rapidly reverse it by embracing more robustly class-conscious rhetoric and ambitiously redistributionist economic policies. When Britain’s Labour Party elected a democratic socialist as its leader and campaigned on its most radical manifesto in a generation, it gained a historic number of seats in the 2017 general election — by, among other things, flipping Tory-held districts in the wealthiest parts of London. Meanwhile, as already mentioned, the bulk of Sanders-aligned, working-class House candidates in 2018 did not have much more success at winning non-college-educated white voters than did centrist Democrats running in similar districts (Richard Ojeda notwithstanding). None of this means that the left must give up on uniting the bulk of America’s multiethnic working class into a single party. But it does suggest that such a project may require years of patient organizing (and demographic replacement), rather than the nomination of any particular presidential candidate.

If Kilpatrick and Sunkara overestimate Sanders’s capacity to realign American politics, they understate how much the Democratic Party can accomplish with its existing coalition. The U.S. economy does not currently serve the average college-educated voter very well. And most of the marquee items on Sanders’s agenda are in the objective self-interest of virtually all affluent suburbanites. Charles Koch may have little use for free public college, universal health care, more generous Social Security benefits, or child-care subsidies. But the typical upper-middle-class family does. Meanwhile, the indebted and underemployed millennial sons and daughters of the professional middle class are one of the most reliably left-wing constituencies in the country and make up no small percentage of Jacobin’s subscriber base and DSA’s membership. There are limitations on what this coalition can achieve. But in California, the existing Democratic coalition just secured subsidized health care for undocumented immigrants and employment rights for exploited “gig economy” workers, over the furious objections of multibillion-dollar companies. Under Barack Obama, meanwhile, it extended Medicaid to millions of people, likely saving nearly 20,000 working-class Americans from premature deaths. The lamentable shortcomings of Obama’s tenure do not nullify that achievement.

Sunkara and Kilpatrick are right to find no contentment in such marginal gains. But by projecting contempt for one of the voting blocs that made those gains possible — and asserting that the existing Democratic Party can “never govern” — they risk projecting an air of indifference toward such reforms and the working-class people who’ve benefited from them (an indifference that I know neither writer actually feels). Socialists must always guard against the impression that they are more invested in chasing an ideological abstraction than delivering concrete benefits to the exploited classes they claim to champion. As a wise (and/or violently racist and jingoistic) man once said, “People don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.” For many Democratic-primary voters, expressions of contempt for the organization that represents their best line of defense against racist, reactionary rule can be deeply alienating. Which points to the most immediate strategic upside of Warren’s “inside strategy”: Polls have repeatedly found that Sanders attracts a relatively high level of disapproval or discomfort among Democratic-primary voters, while Warren boasts an aberrantly low one. This reality, combined with the intensity of elite Democratic opposition to Sanders, invites the question of whether Warren is the only progressive with sufficient breadth of appeal (among Democratic voters and power brokers) to prevent Biden from securing the nomination — in which case Sanders’s theoretical superiority as a general-election candidate or president would be moot. The answer to that question is far from clear, in my view. But it’s hard to see how Sanders can negate its premise without stepping up his “inside game.”

All this may read as an elaborate endorsement of Warren. But I do not intend it as such. That Sanders evinces more interest in radically revising American foreign policy is no small thing. Further, as Kilpatrick and Sunkara note, in a context where the left is materially weak, the personal ideological commitments of elected leaders take on a heightened importance. And there is no question that Bernie Sanders has a more deeply rooted ideological commitment to radical politics than does Elizabeth Warren.

But too many prominent arguments for Sanders’s superiority consist of easily debunked distinctions between the two left-wing candidates or blithely unsubstantiated assertions that Bernie is uniquely capable of fomenting a political revolution and thus of bending the Democratic Establishment and U.S. Senate to his will. The first mode of argument risks alienating undecided liberals and obscuring Sanders’s genuinely distinctive merits. The second threatens to replace rigorous reflection on the obstacles to radical change in the United States with magical thinking — and a much-needed debate over how to overcome those impediments with the recitation of rival dogmas.

Which would be unfortunate. In this country, optimism of the intellect is a luxury that no “Champagne socialist” nor “Patagonia progressive” can afford."

Recent economic gains by lower-income workers who have found jobs and benefited from minimum-wage increases in many states haven’t made up for the long-running trend of the wealthy seeing far larger income growth than middle- or lower-income earners.

The persistent rise in inequality has become a central topic in the 2020 presidential race, with candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren calling for a wealth tax. This week, Sanders unveiled a proposal that would impose a tax as high as 8 percent on the ultrawealthy, raising $4.35 trillion over a decade, according to an analysis by economists who consulted with the Warren and Sanders campaigns.

“There should be no billionaires,” Sanders tweeted when he announced his plan. “We are going to tax their extreme wealth and invest in working people.”

Systemic inequality is actually starkest in the top tier of the economic ladder, which is populated primarily by white men, Bryan said. Women in the 95th percentile of earners make around 68 cents on the dollar compared with their male counterparts.

“We don’t have as much sympathy for CEOs,” Bryan said, “but what’s happening at the top end is really symbolic of problems happening throughout the system.”

AD

“He sounds like a criminal,” Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a presidential hopeful, told MSNBC on Thursday night. “'Who snitched? Who gave up the goods? Let’s find out who gave up the goods on us and make sure there’s a consequence and it’s serious, and let that be a lesson to everybody else.'”

AD

She continued: “It sounds like it’s straight out of some bad drama, but the fact is this is the president of the United States.”

Harris was joined by fellow Democratic candidates Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke, and former housing and urban development secretary Julián Castro, who suggested that Trump’s comments could endanger the lives of the whistleblower and anyone else who aided in the complaint. Trump was also rebuked by some Republicans, including former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh and former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, who are challenging the president for the GOP nomination, and Rep. Will Hurd (R-Tex.).

AD

In a joint statement, the chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform Committees argued that Trump’s remarks amounted to “reprehensible witness intimidation and an attempt to obstruct Congress’ impeachment inquiry.”

AD

“We condemn the President’s attacks, and we invite our Republican counterparts to do the same because Congress must do all it can to protect this whistleblower, and all whistleblowers,” said the statement from Reps. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.). “Threats of violence from the leader of our country have a chilling effect on the entire whistleblower process, with grave consequences for our democracy and national security.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment early Friday.

AD

Trump’s statements came after the House released a nine-page version of the whistleblower’s complaint. According to the complaint and a rough transcript of a July 25 phone call, Trump repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political opponent, former vice president Joe Biden, offering assistance from the Justice Department and raising the possibility of a White House sit-down. The call took place after Trump had halted almost $400 million in military aid to Ukraine.

AD

As Democrats speed up their impeachment investigation, Trump and other Republican leaders have continued to attack the credibility of the whistleblower and the complaint, highlighting that many of the allegations rely on secondhand information from other U.S. officials.

Thursday’s private event, which was closed to the press, was intended to honor the staff and families of the U.S. delegation, but Trump took it as an opportunity to grouse about his enemies. During his speech, the president again went after Biden, the “crooked” media and the whistleblower’s complaint.

AD

“Basically that person never saw the report, never saw the call,” Trump said of the whistleblower on Thursday. “Heard something, and decided that he or she or whoever the hell it is — sort of like, almost, a spy.”

Then, the president appeared to suggest that the whistleblower and whoever may have supplied the person with information about the Ukraine call had behaved like spies. Trump also mentioned treason, which in the past has been punished by death.

AD

In an interview with MSNBC on Thursday, Booker said Trump sounded “more like a threatening thug than giving forth the ideals of a statesman” and accused the president of using rhetoric that “gives license to people to do dangerous things.”

AD

“It’s not surprising that Donald Trump doesn’t know the difference between patriotism and treason,” the New Jersey senator said. “If there’s any treasonous actions here, it is coming from the White House.”

Castro, who also appeared on MSNBC, called the president a “dictator.” In Castro’s view, Trump had suggested that the whistleblower “should basically be killed.”

Meanwhile, other presidential candidates took aim at Trump on Twitter, echoing criticisms that his comment constituted a threat.

“This is wrong and this is un-American,” Walsh tweeted about Trump’s attacks on the whistleblower. “And Congressional Republicans say nothing. Shameful. History is watching.”

Several politicians also defended the whistleblower, with some referencing federal laws protecting those who expose wrongdoing. There are specific guidelines for whistleblowers in the intelligence community, who are protected from retaliation so long as they follow proper protocol when submitting complaints.

“This person is not a spy,” Hurd said at an event in Austin on Thursday night, according to the Dallas Morning News. “Let me say that very clearly. This is clearly somebody who knew the consequences of what he or she was doing … and they shared it through the right mechanism.”

In a video shared on Twitter, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) thanked the whistleblower for “an extraordinary act of courage.”

“Trump has used the word treasonous to describe this whistleblower,” Sanders said. “Well, let me tell you what I think treasonous activity is. It is a president who is trying to undermine the Constitution of the United States and a president who thinks he is above the law.”

In a surprise development that broke from its past precedent of limiting presidential debate fields to ten candidates on any one night, the Democratic National Committee has indicated that all 12 qualifiers for the next debate will on a single stage on October 15. Debate sponsor CNN had the story:

“To address several inquiries we have received we are writing to let you know that, pending a final decision after the certification deadline, it is the intention of the DNC and our media partners to hold the October debate over one night on Tuesday October 15th,” the DNC wrote in an email Friday morning.

The party’s fourth sanctioned primary debate will air live at 8 p.m. ET from the campus of Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, with CNN anchors Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooperand New York Times national editor Marc Lacey serving as moderators.

The October debate will include the ten September debaters (Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julián Castro, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O’Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Andrew Yang) plus two more recent qualifiers (Tulsi Gabbard and Tom Steyer). The qualifying window doesn’t end until Tuesday, October 1, but no other candidates are thought to be anywhere near making the combined polling and fundraising thresholds. It’s always possible some qualifiers will free up stage space by dropping out of the race before October 15, but it’s unlikely any will give up the free exposure and the long-shot possibility of a breakthrough performance that rallies the nation to her or his banner.

On the one hand, this means we can stop worrying about debate-night “draws” skewing the interaction by placing potentially colliding candidates on different nights. But there will be even more jockeying for time and attention than in earlier debates — and perhaps more clash since higher qualifying thresholds kick in for the November and subsequent debates.

Most excited by the one-night decision will be campaign operatives and journalists who won’t have to work really late on two consecutive weeknights. Here’s the viewing details for those who want to rev their engines and savor the anticipation:

The debate will air exclusively on CNN, CNN International, CNN en Español, and stream on CNN.com’s homepage and NYTimes.com’s homepage. In addition, the debate will be available across mobile devices via CNN’s and New York Times’ apps for iOS and Android, via CNNgo apps for Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Chromecast and Android TV, SiriusXM Channels 116, 454, 795, the Westwood One Radio Network and National Public Radio.

This is CNN’s second bite at the debate apple; it hosted the July debates as well.

Update, October 1: it’s official: the twelve candidate mentioned above are the qualifiers for the October 15 debate."

Much has been made about Warren’s growing popularity with young voters — she stood in line for four hours earlier this month taking selfies with people who attended her speech near New York University.

But the lawmaker’s support grew from 25 percent in late August to 37 percent in late September with white college-educated voters, an influential group that largely voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.

Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy said: “Dig a little deeper, and the reasons behind Warren’s rise become more clear. She generates a lot of excitement as a potential nominee. On top of that, half of Democrats want a presidential candidate that supports big changes — even if it means things are harder along the way.”

AD

Seven out of 10 Democrats said they would be excited if Warren became the Democratic nominee for president in 2020. Fewer — 56 percent — said they would feel the same about Biden winning the nomination.

And the excitement is rooted in Warren’s left-of-center ideas — she has released dozens of plans on an array of topics, including universal child care and getting rid of the electoral college. Because of her left-leaning politics, some assumed that Sanders would be most at risk of losing his support to Warren. But this poll suggests that Warren may mostly be taking support from Biden — and that could continue.

AD

Warren is less well known than Biden. Only 9 percent of those surveyed haven’t heard of Biden, who served in Congress for three decades before becoming the vice president to America’s first black president. Nearly 20 percent haven’t heard of Warren.

This means there’s a good chance for an uptick in support for Warren. As more people become aware of who she is, there’s a chance of more people liking what she is saying — and keeping her at the top of the polls.

AMITE CITY, La.— The float carrying Gov. John Bel Edwards passed by quickly, and the tossed beads and campaign cups — “Putting Louisiana First” — landed a few feet short of Randy Foulks.

Foulks, the 68-year-old owner of an air conditioning company, likes Edwards. But he wasn't exactly jumping for campaign swag.

“I'm disappointed that he raised taxes when he said he wouldn't,” Foulks said. “I know he's got a big heart for this state. He took the bull by the horns when that storm came through here. But it's the taxes, man. Something's got to be done.”

Edwards, who was elected governor four years ago in a rout, is seeking a second term in a state that has largely moved away from Democrats. He has stayed far away from the party's presidential race, angered local and national Democrats by signing a strict abortion limitation law and expanded Medicaid. But he's in a tight battle for reelection against two Republicans running as allies of President Trump and enemies of a 2016 sales tax hike.

""[People] may not agree with everything that we've done,” Edwards said in an interview. “But you cannot, with any justification, say that Louisiana's not better off. We are running surpluses now, not deficits. We have an uninsured rate that's lower than the national average. Now, who would have thought that would ever be possible in the state of Louisiana?”

Louisiana's Oct. 12 election will test whether a socially conservative Democrat can still get elected in the South — whether it's still possible to excite liberal voters, mollify conservative voters and hold onto a job. With abortion practically off the table, Republicans have attacked Edwards's support for LGBT nondiscrimination laws. With unemployment falling under 5 percent, they credit the president's tax cuts and ask why Edwards can't govern more like Trump.

“We're the only state in the nation that lost jobs in the last 12 months,” said Rep. Ralph Abraham, the leading Republican candidate, in an interview from the sidelines of a Louisiana Tech football game. “He's got to own this stuff.” The congressman, who like Edwards is a military veteran, was there for one of the game's multiple salutes to the troops.

Republicans, who dominate Louisiana's state legislature, always saw Edwards as an accidental governor. He won 56 percent of the vote against Sen. David Vitter; one year later, Hillary Clinton won just 39 percent of the vote in the state. In 2015, Edwards benefited from two factors that disappeared right after the election: the unpopularity of two-term Gov. Bobby Jindal and the candidacy of Vitter. The senator, who had won reelection after admitting to paying for prostitutes (“a serious sin in my past”), was particularly vulnerable to Edwards's character-first campaign.

“The choice for governor couldn't be clearer,” one of Edwards's TV ads declared. “John Bel Edwards, who answered our country's call and served as a ranger in the 82nd Airborne Division, or David Vitter, who answered a prostitute's call, minutes after he skipped a vote honoring 28 soldiers.”

Edwards's two opponents this year, Abraham and businessman Eddie Rispone, have no such problems. Abraham's campaign has emphasized his work as a family doctor; Republicans call him “Doc” more than they call him “Ralph.”

The wealthy Rispone is running as an outsider, the closest thing state Republicans can get to their own Trump. Rispone has spent millions on ads attacking Edwards over “sanctuary cities” and even a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill; he's also gone after Abraham, dredging up an accusation that he used his salary to buy a plane instead of donating the income to charity. (The attack, previously used by Democrats, ignores that Abraham did give his salary to charity until congressional ethics prevented him from taking income from his medical practice.)

“I'm the grandson of legal immigrants, who worked hard and played by the rules” Rispone says in one of his omnipresent TV spots, drawling the word “legal” for emphasis.

If no candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote next month, the top two finishers will head to a November runoff. Edwards has consistently polled north of 40 percent, with his rivals in the 20s. But Republicans like their chances with either Abraham or Rispone, who have tag-teamed Edwards as a tax hiker who can't be trusted on social issues. The strategy is twofold: hoping that Democrats are less enthused to support an antiabortion governor and firing up the Republican vote by warning of “sanctuary cites,” crime waves and a breakdown of gender norms in the state's schools.

“As a doctor,” Abraham says in one TV spot, “I can assure you there are only two genders.”

Edwards has responded by constantly reminding voters of why their taxes went up at all — Jindal had blown up the state's deficit and Republicans got on board with the tax hike.

“We had already cut higher education deeper than any other state in the nation,” he said. “We'd already raised tuition more than any other state in the nation. People know that. The economy wasn't working.” Edwards has stood behind a gas tax increase that's supported by a plurality of voters but stalled in the legislature. In the first debate, he made a lonely promise not to cut taxes “until we know that we won’t go back into a structural budget deficit.”

Medicaid expansion, which Edwards brought to the state by executive action, hasn't reshaped the race. Republicans have not said outright that they'd reverse it, even as they support a lawsuit led by Republican attorneys general that would rip up the Affordable Care Act. (Louisiana's attorney general, Jeff Landry, is simultaneously suing to kill the ACA and promising to protect its most popular components.)

Republicans are not running against Medicaid expansion per se, focusing instead on troubles with how it was implemented and on the theory that it's better to get insurance through private employers than the government.

“Look, I'm a family doctor,” Abraham said. “There are those that need that safety net. We will take care of those people. My beef is that we've got over a hundred million dollars of waste, fraud, and abuse, and we've got over 1,600 people on the Medicaid rolls who are making over $100,000.” Abraham and other Republicans have attacked the implementation of expansion while navigating around the implications: that they would knock Louisianans off the Medicaid rolls.

A bill banning most abortions, which won't go into effect unless courts uphold a similar one in Mississippi, took a toll on the governor's Democratic support. Karen Carter Peterson, the state party chair and a member of the Democrats' legislative minority, even singled him out for criticism. But it also deprived Republicans of an issue, and they've spent the final weeks of the race with a different message to conservatives: Edwards is too lenient on LGBT rights.

Abraham described Edwards as two-faced on abortion — “he has a Planned Parenthood operative as his secretary of health” — but had even more to say about the state conducting a school survey that asked children about their sexual orientation.

“We need to let teachers teach and let the parents be the parents,” Abraham said. “If they want to have that discussion with their children, that's their business. The state should have no role in that agenda of social experimentation.”

Edwards has defended his support for gay rights, arguing that opposition will backfire on his opponents. “Discrimination and prejudice are not Louisiana values,” he said, when asked to respond to Abraham. “I think you have a candidate whose campaign is failing, and he's desperate, and he's trying to go back to some of those social wedge issues that have been used successfully in the past. That is not Louisiana today.”

On Saturday, as Edwards walked around the annual Fried Chicken Festival in New Orleans, his coalition came into view. Chrishelle DuPree, 46, rushed over to get a photo with her governor, even though she'd hated the abortion law.

“Abortion should be a woman's right,” Dupree said. “I totally don't agree with the governor on that. But I won't vote against him because of the abortion law. I was really pissed at first, but he's Catholic, so I understand it, and I can't let get a Republican in office. The hell with that!”

Moments later, the governor took a selfie with Steve Beatty, 64, who'd voted for Edwards in 2015 and then for Trump in 2016.

“I'm a Christian, and I believe every life needs a chance, like the governor,” Beatty explained. “I heard Franklin Graham say the night before the Trump election: You're not voting for Trump, you're voting for conservative values. I feel that way about the governor.”

But Edwards never supported Trump; in the final stretch, Republicans hope for that to make the difference, and point out that no incumbent governor who was forced into a runoff has won it. While Abraham has been massively outspent, his plan to win the runoff was for national attention to swing to Louisiana, and for the president to throw in behind him. Asked about the revelation that Trump had pressured Ukraine's president for dirt on Joe Biden's son, Abraham called it “the liberal media grasping at straws,” something that would not play in Louisiana.

“I want him down here,” Abraham said. “I want him to come down to Louisiana and have one of those MAGA rallies. He's welcome to come as many times as he wants.”

No national Democratic figure would be so welcome in Louisiana. Edwards had cheerfully ignored the party's race for president. Asked about the debate the 2020 candidates were having about Medicare-for-all, he emphasized that the current system was working for Louisiana. Asked about the president, he said he had worked with him plenty.

“I already got more than I can say grace over on my plate,” he said. “He typically doesn't go in the states where he's not going to win, and so I think he would be reluctant to come here. I would remind you that Democrats last year nationwide picked up seven new governorships. And I think the president went to just about all of those states.”

ON THE TRAIL

On Wednesday, the president defended his decision to ask Ukraine's new president for dirt on Joe Biden's son Hunter.

Joe Biden has responded in two ways: calling all of this ridiculous and trying to return the focus to health care. Apart from an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel's show and some tart statements, the former vice president has stuck to his previous campaign plan, attacking the administration for undermining the Affordable Care Act.

“Many Republican legislatures and governors are dodging their duties to their constituents by rejecting Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion opportunity,” he said in a Thursday morning statement. When he has talked about the Republican attempts to investigate Hunter Biden, it has been to talk about how the president's party is afraid of him.

“The reason I’m being attacked is most polls show me beating him by 10 to 15 points,” Biden told donors via speakerphone Tuesday night. “So I’m not at all surprised I’ve become the object of his affection and attention. The attacks on me, they’re going to come and they’re going to go and they’ll soon be forgotten.”

The willingness of Republicans to attack Biden, and justify the president's approach, is raising one of the most important political questions of the primary: Have Democrats figured out what to do when Trump attacks?

Up to now, the president has been less relevant in primary politics than expected. Liberal activists — from the Sunrise Movement to Moms Demand Action to labor leaders — have been driving the policy conversation; the president has made cameos by attacking “socialism” or amplifying stories that ran in conservative media, rarely reaching Democrats, who tend to tune him out.

But the Ukraine story is taking Democrats to territory that to them feels both terrifyingly familiar and worryingly uncertain. Some in the party wonder whether angry voters will rally behind Biden, seeing the attacks as evidence that Trump doesn't want to run against him. Some worry that Republicans could weaponize Hunter Biden the way that they once weaponized Hillary Clinton's private email server.

“There are some Democrats who have 2016 PTSD,” said Rep. Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, one of Biden's first supporters in Congress. “There were legitimate questions with the way that Hillary Clinton handled her email server. But in this case, come on: We're talking about something completely manufactured by a president who just committed the crime of extortion.”

The fight between Trump and Biden is asymmetrical; the president is almost unanimously supported in his party, while Biden's lead in the Democratic primary was slipping even before the Ukraine story. Of the 275 congressional Democrats who are not running for president, just 21 have endorsed Biden.

That's more than have endorsed any other candidate, but it's a fraction of the support Clinton had at this time in the race; by the time news broke about her use of a private email server, a majority of congressional Democrats had already endorsed her. It was in their interest to defend Clinton, whom they always saw as the likely nominee. They are not as sure what will happen to Biden. Even though they believe him, and not Trump, they have seen the president make stuff up and get away with it.

So far, most congressional Democrats and several of Biden's primary rivals have condemned Trump and defended the former vice president. At an appearance in California, Julián Castro directly compared what Trump was doing to the endless negativity of 2016: “Donald Trump is trying to do to Joe Biden what he did to Hillary Clinton; to turn somebody who has given a lifetime of service, and done it honorably, into the victim of false accusations.” Rep. Ro Khanna of California, a co-chair of the Bernie Sanders campaign, said no candidate should amplify what the president was saying about Biden.

“All Democratic candidates need to stand in solidarity against President Trump’s ad hominem attacks on Vice President Biden,” Khanna said. “Trump will smear whoever the Democratic nominee is, and Democrats must be united in rejecting his tawdry politics of hate, lies and personal attacks.”

“I don’t know enough at this point to make any definitive statement,” Sanders said in Iowa on Tuesday when asked whether he had concerns about Hunter Biden. Pressed on whether the controversy over Hunter Biden and Ukraine made Biden a weaker candidate, Sanders demurred: “You make the judgment. You guys write very perceptive articles on these things and I’ll let you make that judgment.” One day later, asked whether her own ethics plan would allow the children of vice presidents to take lucrative foreign jobs, Warren said “no,” then admitted that she had to check the plan again. Neither statement had much solidarity with Biden.

Democratic voters, meanwhile, don't seem to be moving. At a meeting this week of Story County, Iowa, Democrats, opinion of the accusations against Biden — not the substance, but the risk — dovetailed with voters' own candidate preferences. Lisa Heddens, a 55-year-old supervisor, said it was deeply sad to see Biden’s family come under attack. She’d gotten to know the former vice president years earlier, when he got to know her son, who had an intellectual disability.

“He called my son when he was in the hospital. He invited us to the inauguration,” said Heddens, a longtime state legislator. “It is going to be a nasty, nasty election. But I think most of the electorate, most of the people, are tired of this stuff. And I think Joe, in particular, is in a good position to push back against it.”

But other Democrats, with fresh and painful memories of 2016, were more worried. Janet Wahl, 74, said at the same gathering that one reason she was supporting Warren over Biden was that she wanted “new blood” and hated to see Biden dragged into the fray.

“I feel it's horrible to do to anybody, and it’s horrible to do to him in particular,” Wahl said. “But Joe knew what he was getting into. He stepped up to do this again, and he knew how dirty politics could be.”

AD WATCH

Pete Buttigieg, “Your Choice.” The Indiana Democrat's third Iowa spot conceals a negative message inside a positive one. “If you’re happy with the private insurance you’ve got, my plan would let you stick with it — if you want,” he says. “Now, others say it’s Medicare-for-all, or nothing.” This is the third ad Iowans will have seen from a presidential candidate warning them against Medicare-for-all. A spot from Joe Biden cryptically referred to politicians who want to “scrap” the Affordable Care Act, and one from Michael Bennet warned that ending private insurance “makes no sense.”

Tom Steyer, “Village.” The investor-turned-politico's latest ad emphasizes the need for Democrats to flip the Senate, name-checking two Republicans on the ballot next year (Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham) and one who isn't (Chuck Grassley). “It takes an entire village of politicians to rig the system,” Steyer says. “That’s why we need term limits; to make Washington work for you.” Term limits are part of Steyer's government change agenda, alongside national ballot measures that would let voters decide major issues; they have not recently been popular with Democratic voters.

POLL WATCH

California Democratic primary (Berkeley IGS, 2,272 likely voters)

Elizabeth Warren — 29% ( 11)

Joe Biden — 20% (-2)

Bernie Sanders — 19% ( 2)

Kamala Harris — 8% (-5)

Pete Buttigieg — 6% (-4)

Beto O'Rourke — 3% (-)

Amy Klobuchar — 2% ( 1)

Andrew Yang — 2% ( 1)

Cory Booker — 1% (-)

Michael Bennet — 1% ( 1)

Tulsi Gabbard — 1% ( 1)

Julián Castro — 1% (-)

Of several recent polls that have shown Elizabeth Warren battling Joe Biden for the lead in their primary, this might be the one with the most Warren-friendly news. The reason: California is the first racially diverse primary state where she has shown strength and where neither of her closest competitors has a dominating lead with nonwhite voters.

Here, Warren leads the field by 18 points among white non-Hispanic voters and by 14 points among Asian Americans. Sanders narrowly leads with Latinos, with 28 percent support to 26 percent for Biden and 14 for Warren; Biden leads with black voters, with 32 percent to Warren's 24 percent, Harris's 18 percent and Sanders's 11 percent. (Harris, whose mother immigrated to the United States from India, polls at only 5 percent with Asian Americans.)





Would you be excited if this candidate became the Democratic nominee? (Quinnipiac, 561 Democratic voters)

Elizabeth Warren — 70%

Joe Biden — 56%

Bernie Sanders — 55%

Kamala Harris — 49%

Pete Buttigieg — 46%

Warren's strength over the past month has shaken up some of the story lines about her support and which voters she could or could not appeal to within a Democratic primary. Recent Quinnipiac polls had asked about who voters saw as electable or who had better policy ideas; the excitement question comes at that a different way and, for the moment, finds Warren doing well with Democrats she hadn't appealed to previously.

Among white voters without college degrees and voters making less than $50,000, the percentage of “excited” voters is, respectively, 69 percent and 67 percent; for Sanders, it's 52 percent and 62 percent. By a 60-point margin, white voters with college degrees are excited about a Warren nomination, which clicks with stories about her appeal to white, suburban liberals. The “excitement” margin among those voters for Biden is just seven points; by a 12-point margin, those voters say they would not be excited about a Sanders nomination.

2020

Bernie Sanders. He joined the UAW's picket line in Detroit on Wednesday, two days after Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden had rallied with striking workers, and ahead of a planned visit to a Reno picket line by Pete Buttigieg.

Joe Biden. He has continued to campaign against the Trump administration’s waivers that allow conservative states to limit access to Medicaid, in between attacks from the president about Ukraine; he also announced a wave of endorsements from Iowa teachers as part of “Educators for Biden.”

Kamala Harris. She’s opening a campaign office in Oakland on Sunday, after a wave of polls have showed her falling behind in her home state and even in the Bay Area.

Julián Castro. He’s turning a weekend in Austin, where the Texas Tribune Festival is being held, into a major homecoming: an appearance at a Latino turnout rally, a stop at a voter turnout bus tour, and a “women for Castro” brunch.

Michael Bennet. He’s also speaking at the Texas Tribune Festival, interviewed by MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell.

Amy Klobuchar. She’ll be in Austin over the weekend for the Texas Tribune Festival and the Voto Latino turnout event.

Beto O’Rouke. He’ll round out the Texas Tribune lineup, sitting for a Saturday interview with MSNBC’s Garrett Haake.

John Delaney. He’s making another trip to Iowa, with six weekend stops in six counties in the central part of the state.

Marianne Williamson. She’s spending Thursday and Friday in Las Vegas, joined at one stop by Richard Dreyfuss, who will “offer remarks about the power of civics in American public education.”

WHAT I'M WATCHING

The race for labor's endorsement. Four years ago, as nearly every major union either endorsed Hillary Clinton's nomination or stayed neutral in the Democratic primary, Bernie Sanders got a lot of help from California. The Oakland-based National Nurses United got behind Sanders early and spent millions of dollars to support him; the smaller National Union of Health Care Workers, also based there, endorsed him handily.

This year, NNU hasn't made its pick yet, and the NUHW just finished an interactive endorsement process that ended with a split decision: Warren and Sanders. Candidates gave video interviews, then the union's 15,000 members voted online, with ballot space for three choices. Warren appeared on 61 percent ballots to 50 percent for Sanders, 34 percent for Kamala Harris, 32 percent for Joe Biden, 21 percent for Pete Buttigieg, and 12 percent for a true dark horse: Trump.

The split endorsement was mostly an embarrassment for Harris, who had won the union's support in her California races. It's also a good look at how the momentum of the race is affecting the endorsement process that most unions have only just begun. No candidate looks like a sure thing for the nomination, as Clinton did four years ago. Sanders, a dream candidate for labor in 2015, has lost ground against his rivals, one of whom (Warren) is equally appealing to some labor organizers. Sanders has made solidarity with workers a key component of his campaign, even using his voter contact list to drive support and attention toward strikes.

Still to be determined: whether unions with more conservative membership, such as the building trades, will follow more left-wing unions, or will find Biden's campaign more compelling.

The fallout from a whistleblower’s complaint about Trump’s July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky played out on Capitol Hill, Twitter and television Friday, as the number of Democrats supporting the impeachment inquiry launched by Pelosi continued to grow.

Meanwhile, more than 300 former U.S. national security and foreign policy officials signed a statement supporting an impeachment inquiry based on Trump’s pressing Zelensky during their July call to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential contender, and his son Hunter Biden.

7:40 p.m.: Amodei denies supporting impeachment after comments signaling openness to inquiry

Rep. Mark Amodei (R-Nev.) on Friday denied supporting impeachment after signaling openness to an inquiry earlier in the day.

Instead, he said, he agreed with Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto’s (D-Nev.) statement to local media that “we have to follow the facts and figure out what happened here.”

“In no way, shape, or form, did I indicate support for impeachment,” Amodei said in a statement.

AD

Amodei told reporters on a conference call Friday that he was not yet convinced Trump broke the law but said, “Let’s put it through the process and see what happens,” according to the Reno Gazette Journal.

“If it’s proven you were using government agencies to try to put your finger on the scale of an election, then I don’t care who the president is, I don’t think that’s right,” he added.

AD

Amodei said he has reviewed the White House readout of the July phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as well as the whistleblower complaint, and called the documents “something to discuss.”

“No part of my process will be political,” he said. “If you broke the law, there are consequences for that.”

AD

This is the closest a current House Republican has come to supporting the impeachment inquiry. Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), a frequent Trump critic who called for the president’s impeachment before he left the GOP on July 4, also supports the impeachment inquiry. Currently all but 11 Democrats in the House support the decision to move forward with the investigation.

Amodei took issue with the reactions to the Nevada Independent’s report that stated, “Rep. Mark Amodei supports the House’s inquiry into whether President Donald Trump should be impeached, but is withholding judgment on whether Trump has crossed the legal line.”

AD

“Anyone who reads Mr. [Humberto] Sanchez’s article and thinks that somehow there is a vote to convict before the process has played out — as called for by the resolution unanimously supported by everyone concerned — is simply, individual fantasy,” Amodei said in his statement Friday evening.

AD

Jon Ralston, the Independent’s editor, tweeted that he was not surprised media “leapt” on the paper’s story and called Amodei’s pushback “hypersensitivity.”

“Amodei wants the inquiry/investigation/probe to continue before he makes up his mind,” he wrote.

6:55 p.m.: House Intelligence Committee to hold closed briefing with Atkinson next Friday

6:35 p.m.: Pelosi tells Democratic colleagues Trump’s actions indicate ‘disregard’ for national security, election integrity and oath of office

The House speaker told Democratic colleagues Friday evening that Trump’s much-scrutinized phone call with Zelensky indicated the president’s “disregard” for national security, the integrity of elections and his oath of office. Facts revealed this week call for an impeachment inquiry, she said.

“I have always said that any decision we make would be based on a review of the facts and the oath that we take,” Pelosi wrote. “I have also said that when the facts warranted it, we would be ready to proceed.”

AD

AD

The speaker lamented a “sad time for our country,” saying, “None of us has come to Congress to impeach a president.”

But Trump’s efforts to use his position to solicit foreign meddling in U.S. elections represent a “profound national security concern” because they put the president’s personal interests before those of the country and its closest partners, Pelosi wrote.

She pointed to the whistleblower complaint that led to public revelations about the phone call and acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire’s testimony that the intelligence community’s most important task is protecting the U.S. election system.

She said Democratic House members would be included in conference calls during the two-week break that begins this weekend.

“With our inquiry in place, we can focus on promoting our For The People agenda,” Pelosi told colleagues.

5:10 p.m.: Amodei becomes first current GOP House member to signal support for impeachment inquiry

Nevada’s only Republican congressman indicated Friday that he would consider voting in favor of impeaching Trump if the facts bore it out after the House finishes its investigation.

“Let’s put it through the process and see what happens,” Rep. Mark Amodei told reporters on a conference call, according to the Reno Gazette Journal.

“If it’s proven you were using government agencies to try to put your finger on the scale of an election, then I don’t care who the president is, I don’t think that’s right,” he added.

5 p.m.: RNC launching massive ad campaign off impeachment inquiry

The Republican National Committee announced Friday it is launching a $10 million effort to run television and online ads targeting vulnerable House Democrats over their stance on launching an impeachment inquiry into President Trump.

The ads will begin airing Sunday in 25 to 50 House districts, according to RNC officials. They added that the RNC has not purchased a TV ad in eight years.

One TV ad released by the committee attacks Rep. Max Rose (D-N.Y.), who unseated a Republican incumbent in 2018 in a district that voted for Trump in 2016, for siding with “the radicals for endless investigations of President Trump, wasting our tax dollars.”

The RNC has amassed a record-breaking war chest since Trump’s election, with the help of the president’s fundraising prowess.

4:20 p.m.: Top House committees subpoena Secretary of State Pompeo over Ukraine

Leaders of top House committees subpoenaed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Friday for documents related to their investigation into President Trump and his asking Ukraine to investigate a possible 2020 political opponent.

They also alerted Pompeo in a separate letter that they have scheduled depositions beginning next week with five State Department officials, beginning Tuesday with former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie “Masha” Yovanovitch, whom Trump disparaged during his phone conversation with the Ukrainian president in July.

The letters were signed by Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), Oversight Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) and Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.).

“The Committees are investigating the extent to which President Trump jeopardized national security by pressing Ukraine to interfere with our 2020 election and by withholding security assistance provided by Congress to help Ukraine counter Russian aggression,” the chairmen wrote.

Documents requested from Pompeo include a list of any State Department officials involved in the controversial July 25 call between Trump and the Ukrainian president as well as any correspondence since Trump’s inauguration about investigations that refer to Hunter Biden, Burisma Holdings — the natural gas company the former vice president’s son worked for, among others.

In addition to Yovanovitch, the chairmen have scheduled hearings with:

● Kurt Volker, U.S. special representative to Ukraine who met with Rudolph W. Giuliani and agreed to connect him with Andrey Yermak, a top aide to Zelensky.

● George Kent, a career Foreign Service officer, is deputy assistant secretary of state in the European and Eurasian Bureau, overseeing policy toward Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. He served as deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev from 2015 to 2018.

● T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, State Department counselor who was named in the whistleblower complaint as the State official who listened in on the Trump-Zelensky call.

● Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, who Giuliani said he briefed on his conversations with Ukrainians.

3:45 p.m.: Senate Republicans signal they’ll hold a trial if House votes to impeach

If at the end of the impeachment investigation the House votes to impeach President Trump, it will trigger a trial in the Senate to determine whether to convict the president.

Senate Republicans, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), have been critical of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s decision to move forward with impeachment, but no one has suggested that the Senate wouldn’t hold a trial.

“If they impeach, it has to be, we have to have a trial,” said Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.)

Asked if it’s possible that the Senate would seek to change the rules to eliminate a trial, Lankford said, “No one I’ve talked to has even implied to me at all, let’s go change the rules so we don’t have to deal with this.”

“I would not support just walking away saying let’s do a rule change so we don’t do this,” he added.

In March, McConnell told NPR that if the House impeached Trump he’d hold a trial in the Senate, but he hasn’t commented on that since Pelosi announced the inquiry on Tuesday.

“If it were to happen, the Senate has no choice,” McConnell said then. “If the House were to act, the Senate immediately goes into trial.”

When asked if McConnell stands by that, his spokesman Doug Andres said, “I have nothing to add to the Leader’s comments from March.”

3 p.m.: Schiff: ‘It’s going to be a very busy couple of weeks ahead.’

The House Intelligence Committee chairman wouldn’t offer details Friday about next steps for the impeachment inquiry, but he said committee members are going to be busy.

“I don’t want to comment about any specifics, but I can tell you it’s going to be a very busy couple of weeks ahead,” Schiff told reporters. “We’re going to be trying to schedule hearings, witness interviews. We’ll be working on subpoenas and document requests. We’ll be busy.”

If the White House stonewalls, he said, “they’ll just strengthen the case on obstruction.”

Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), who also sits on the Intelligence Committee, suggested a lot of work could get done in the next weeks. “The Speaker’s made it very clear that we are not to let momentum drop in these two weeks,” he said.

Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier (Calif.), another member of the panel, said next steps will include speaking to Rudolph W. Giuliani and the whistleblower as well as other people on the call.

“I think that we are going to want to interview persons that were engaged in what is clearly a scheme. This is not a one-off. This is not just a phone call. This is a scheme that was hatched some time ago, and you can see evidence of it dating back to 2018,” Speier said. “And I want to see us come up with that timeline, because this is a truly corrupt undertaking.”

But Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), asked whether the House will seek other transcripts that could be on the classified server beyond the Ukraine call, said he doesn’t know if that’s necessary for this investigation.

“Assume that if he’s acting shady with a Ukrainian president who was just elected, he’s probably acted shady in the long-standing relationships he’s had with Putin and MBS, particularly over Khashoggi,” Swalwell said, referring to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman by his initials. “He said he could shoot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue and get away with it. We have him holding the weapon now and it’s a question of whether he is right about who we are as Americans. I think he’s wrong, and I don’t think we need to go interview a thousand witnesses when he’s copped to it.”

2:30 p.m.: House committees request documents on delay of Ukraine military aid

Two powerful committees that oversee the federal budget and spending have requested from the White House a timeline and relevant documents that explain how the United States came to withhold almost $4oo million in military aid to Ukraine.

Central to the committees’ concerns are reports that the Office of Management and Budget was responsible for relaying to the State Department and the Pentagon President Trump’s order to hold back the funds to Ukraine.

“As reports continue to emerge, we have deepening concerns that OMB continues to demonstrate a pattern of impeding agencies’ ability to use their enacted appropriations,” wrote House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita M. Lowey (D-N.Y.) and House Budget Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), in a joint letter to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and OMB Acting Director Russell Vought.

The Democrats have asked OMB to answer a list of questions, including when the White House first instructed the other agencies to withhold the money, and to provide documentation showing “the factual, legal, and policy bases upon which these actions were taken.”

2:05 p.m.: Senate Democrats involve Trump judicial nominee in Ukraine controversy

Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats want one of Trump’s judicial nominees to the federal bench to disclose what he knew about Trump’s call with Zelensky and the subsequent whistleblower complaint.

Steven Menashi, a nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in New York, is currently working as White House associate counsel. During his confirmation hearing earlier this month he enraged Democrats and some Republicans by refusing to disclose basic details about his work at the White House.

The 10 Democrats on the panel, led by ranking member Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), sent a letter to Menashi on Friday requesting information about any work he’s done related to the Ukraine matter.

“We write to inquire about your knowledge of or involvement with any of the events related to a telephone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky on July 25, 2019, or a whistleblower complaint about that call and efforts to pressure Ukraine to interfere in the upcoming 2020 U.S. election,” they wrote.

1:35 p.m.: Schiff highlights statement signed by national security officials

Schiff took to Twitter on Friday afternoon to highlight the statement signed by more than 300 former U.S. national security and foreign policy officials warning that Trump’s actions regarding Ukraine are a “profound national security concern” and supporting an impeachment inquiry.

“The consensus of national security experts is clear: President Trump’s actions concerning Ukraine endanger America’s security,” Schiff said in his tweet. “By subjugating the national interest to his own political interest, Trump has shown he is incapable and unwilling to fulfill his oath of office.”

12:50 p.m.: White House hopeful Gabbard drops opposition to impeachment inquiry

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), the last of the 2020 Democratic White House hopefuls to oppose an impeachment inquiry, announced a change of position Friday.

“Up to this point, I have been opposed to pursuing impeachment because it will further divide our already divided country,” Gabbard said in a statement. “However, after looking carefully at the transcript of the conversation with Ukraine’s President, the whistleblower complaint, the Inspector General memo, and President Trump’s comments about the issue, unfortunately, I believe that if we do not proceed with the inquiry, it will set a very dangerous precedent.”

12:30 p.m.: Former senator Flake: ‘not a lot of love for this president’

Former senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) elaborated Friday on his claim a day before that at least 35 Republican senators would vote for Trump’s impeachment if they could do so privately.

“Anybody who has sat through two years, as I have, of Republican luncheons realizes that there’s not a lot of love for the president,” Flake said during an interview with NPR. “There’s a lot of fear of what it means to go against the president.”

Flake made his initial assessment Thursday at the Texas Tribune Festival.

Speaking to NPR, he added that he himself considers impeachment a bad idea.

“I’m not a fan of the president,” Flake said. “I hope that he’s not reelected next year. But I worry that this, in a very divided country, will divide it even further. So I’d rather defeat the president the old-fashioned way, at the ballot box.”

12:15 p.m.: Ukraine lawmakers seek new probes into allegations at ‘epicenter’ of U.S. political battles

Lawmakers in Ukraine are seeking to launch probes into some of the same allegations at the heart of the Trump administration’s dirt-digging efforts, including possibly reopening inquiries into the Ukrainian natural gas firm with connections to Hunter Biden.

The Ukraine push, however, could draw the country deeper into Washington’s whistleblower battles even as its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, tries to tread a careful path with one of its most important allies.

A separate probe by Ukraine also has the potential to add fuel to White House efforts to fire up President Trump’s base and lend legitimacy to his demands for Ukrainian prosecutors to look again at corruption allegations against Hunter Biden, despite no evidence of wrongdoing related to his work in Ukraine.

11:25 a.m.: Trump says all foreign leader calls are endangered

Trump returned to Twitter late Friday morning to argue that Democrats are jeopardizing all calls between U.S. presidents and foreign leaders.

“If that perfect phone call with the President of Ukraine Isn’t considered appropriate, then no future President can EVER again speak to another foreign leader!” he tweeted.

11:15 a.m.: House Intelligence Committee members plan to stay into recess

Members of the House Intelligence Committee said Friday that they plan to work during a scheduled two-week recess and left open the possibility that the panel would hold additional hearings.

“We’re expected to be here over the recess,” Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) told reporters, adding: “There could very well be hearings.”

Speier said Democrats feel a sense of urgency about investigating Trump’s call with Zelensky.

“This is not something we can wait around [for] and contemplate our navels,” she said.

Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), another member of the committee, said he also plans to spend much of the recess in Washington.

“I canceled a bunch of stuff in my district to be here,” he said.

Schiff told multiple media outlets that he plans to move expeditiously to issue subpoenas of officials with knowledge of Trump’s call with Zelensky and to take depositions.

10:30 a.m.: Cruz compares Pelosi TV appearance to a ‘hostage video’

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) likened an MSNBC interview of Pelosi on Friday morning to a “hostage video,” suggesting that she remains opposed to an impeachment inquiry but is responding to liberal lawmakers in her caucus who are “filled with rage.”

“I think Nancy understands that impeachment is a train wreck for the Democrats,” Cruz asserted during an appearance on Fox News. “She has been trying to hold back the hordes. And you know, watching her, it almost reminded me of a hostage video. I think she was blinking SOS.”

During the MSNBC interview, Pelosi said she supported an impeachment inquiry after the facts of the Ukraine call came to light.

“The facts changed the situation, and they cannot be ignored,” she said.

As of midmorning Friday, 222 House Democrats and one independent member had voiced support for at least opening an inquiry into whether the president committed “high crimes and misdemeanors.”

10 a.m.: Oregon congressman accuses Trump of ‘treason’

Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.), speaking on the House floor Friday morning, accused Trump of “treason.”

DeFazio referred to remarks Trump made at a private event where the president said the whistleblower’s actions were akin to being a spy or committing treason.

“Let’s see: Russia has invaded the Ukraine, Ukraine is dependent upon the United States for military assistance to defend itself, Trump is withholding the aid, at the same time asking them for dirt on his political opponent,” DeFazio said. “He’s jeopardizing the national security interests of the United States. If anybody is committing treason — and I believe that’s an impeachable offense — it’s the president of the United States, Donald Trump.”

The lawmaker presiding over the House reminded DeFazio not to engage in personal attacks against the president in the House chamber.

A little later, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said DeFazio crossed the line and asked that the Democrat be reminded that “such violation won’t be tolerated in the future.”

9:45 a.m.: Trump speculates ‘a leaker or a spy’ fed information to whistleblower

Trump speculated on Twitter on Friday morning that the whistleblower might have received information from “a leaker or spy” or a “partisan operative.” He offered no evidence for his suggestions.

“Sounding more and more like the so-called Whistleblower isn’t a Whistleblower at all,” the president tweeted. “In addition, all second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have even been somebody else, a leaker or spy, feeding it to him or her? A partisan operative?”

Earlier Friday, Trump personal attorney Jay Sekulow claimed that the whistleblower complaint wasn’t written by the whistleblower.

“Look at the phraseology, the endnotes and the footnotes,” Sekulow said during an appearance on Fox News’s “Fox & Friends. “This wasn’t drafted by this individual. This was written by a law firm.”

9:30 a.m.: Trump returns to Twitter, calls Schiff a ‘sick man’

Trump fired off midmorning tweets, once again claiming his conversation with Zelensky was “perfect” and taking aim again at Schiff.

“IT WAS A PERFECT CONVERSATION WITH UKRAINE PRESIDENT!” Trump said in one tweet written in all capital letters.

Shortly afterward, he renewed his call from earlier Friday for Schiff to resign for what Trump contended was embellishing Trump’s conversation with Zelensky during remarks during a hearing Thursday hearing with acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire.

“Rep. Adam B. Schiff totally made up my conversation with Ukraine President and read it to Congress and Millions,” Trump wrote. “He must resign and be investigated. He has been doing this for two years. He is a sick man!”

Following Thursday’s hearing, Schiff explained that his summary of Trump’s call “was meant to be at least part in parody.”

In his midmorning tweets, Trump also declared that, “The Democrats are now to be known as the DO NOTHING PARTY!”

9 a.m. Schiff responds to Trump’s call for his resignation

Schiff took to Twitter on Friday morning to respond to Trump’s call for him to resign for offering an embellished account of Trump’s phone conversation with Zelensky during Thursday’s House Intelligence Committee hearing.

“You engaged in a shakedown to get election dirt from a foreign country. And then you tried to cover it up,” Schiff tweeted. “But you’re right about one thing — your words need no mockery. Your own words and deeds mock themselves. But most importantly here, they endanger our country.”

Schiff said Thursday that his recounting of the Trump-Zelensky call was intended partly as parody, which Schiff said should have been obvious.

8 a.m.: Pelosi says she prays for Trump, asks that ‘God will illuminate him’

During a morning television appearance, Pelosi said she is praying for Trump and accused Barr of have “gone rogue” in his handling of the fallout from Trump’s call with Zelensky.

In the midst of a discussion about her decision to launch impeachment proceedings against Trump, Pelosi said: “I pray that God will illuminate him to see right from wrong. It’s very problematic.”

At other points during her appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Pelosi also accused Trump of “being disloyal to the oath of his office” and having used taxpayer dollars to “shake down” Zelensky.

Pelosi was referring to the fact that Trump had suspended military aid to Ukraine at the time of the phone conversation with Zelensky, in which he pressed for an investigation of the Bidens.

Trump has said repeatedly that there was “no quid pro quo.”

During the interview, Pelosi was also highly critical of Barr’s handling of the episode.

Barr’s Justice Department played a central role in holding up the disclosure of the whistleblower complaint to Congress.

As acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire testified Thursday, he consulted the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, which overruled the inspector general’s determination that the complaint was of “urgent concern,” a legal threshold that would have required disclosure to Congress within seven days.

“He’s gone rogue,” Pelosi said of Barr, adding: “I think where they’re going is a coverup of the coverup.”

“If by “going rogue” Speaker Pelosi means that the Department of Justice follows the law and long-established procedures, she is correct,” DOJ Spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said.

7:45 a.m.: Trump calls on Schiff to ‘resign immediately’

Trump on Friday called on Schiff to “immediately resign” following Thursday’s hearing in which the House Intelligence Committee chairman offered an embellished account of Trump’s conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

“Rep. Adam B. Schiff fraudulently read to Congress, with millions of people watching, a version of my conversation with the President of Ukraine that doesn’t exist,” Trump said in a tweet. “He was supposedly reading the exact transcribed version of the call, but he completely changed the words to make it sound horrible, and me sound guilty.”

“HE WAS DESPERATE AND HE GOT CAUGHT. Adam B. Schiff therefore lied to Congress and attempted to defraud the American Public,” Trump continued. “He has been doing this for two years. I am calling for him to immediately resign from Congress based on this fraud!”

Schiff explained later in the hearing what he had done.

“My summary of the president’s call was meant to be at least part in parody,” he said. “The fact that that’s not clear is a separate problem in and of itself.”

During an appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Pelosi said she was “so proud of Adam B. Schiff” for his handling of the hearing but did not allude to the episode in question.

7:15 a.m.: Trump takes swipes at the media in morning tweets

Trump took multiple swipes at the media in morning tweets, including complaining about punctuation used in a CNN report that mentioned a derogatory term he used for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.).

“To show you how dishonest the LameStream Media is, I used the word Liddle’, not Liddle, in describing Corrupt Congressman Liddle’ Adam B. Schiff,” Trump wrote on Twitter, misspelling describing. “Low ratings @CNN purposely took the hyphen out and said I spelled the word little wrong. A small but never ending situation with CNN!”

Trump in fact used an apostrophe, not a hyphen.

In another tweet, he took issue with a story by Peter Baker of the New York Times and declared that he “should not even be allowed to write about me.”

7 a.m.: White House spokesman decries those who gave information to whistleblower

White House spokesman Hogan Gidley denounced leaks coming from the White House, calling them “dangerous,” and questioned the motives of those who provided information to the whistleblower.

During an appearance on Fox News’s “Fox & Friends,” Gidley was asked about Trump’s remarks Thursday morning to the U.S. Mission to the United Nations in which he dismissed the complaint against him from the intelligence community whistleblower and suggested that the person’s actions made him or her “close to a spy.”

“He was talking about the people who actually gave the information to the whistleblower,” Gidley claimed.

The whistleblower said the complaint was based on information from more than a half dozen U.S. officials.

Gidley noted that transcripts of previous Trump calls with the leaders of Australia and Mexico had also been leaked to the press.

“These leaks are dangerous,” he said, adding that he was not sure why they have happened.

“Do they just want to bolster their own careers or get invited to the cocktail parties here in D. C.?” he asked.

During the same interview, Gidley insisted that no one in the White House is concerned about the revelations in the whistleblower report.

“No one I’ve talked to is concerned at all about this because there is nothing there,” he said. “No one in the White House is concerned about this because the president has done nothing wrong.”

6:45 a.m.: Democrats rip Trump’s ‘threatening’ comments against whistleblower

Someone laughed loudly during the closed-door speech President Trump gave at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations on Thursday. Other voices spoke in hushed murmurs.

Trump had just demanded to know who provided a whistleblower with information about his call with the Ukrainian president, describing that person as “close to a spy” and adding: “You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now.”

Trump’s comments, which were included in leaked video obtained by The Washington Post and others, have sparked intense backlash, with top Democrats decrying his words as “threatening” and defending the whistleblower at the center of a new push for impeachment.

“He sounds like a criminal,” Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a presidential primary candidate, told MSNBC on Thursday night. “‘Who snitched? Who gave up the goods? Let’s find out who gave up the goods on us and make sure there’s a consequence and it’s serious, and let that be a lesson to everybody else.’”

6:30 a.m.: Nearly 300 former officials call Trump’s actions concerning Ukraine ‘profound national security concern’

Nearly 300 former U.S. national security and foreign policy officials have signed a statement warning that Trump’s actions regarding Ukraine are a “profound national security concern” and supporting an impeachment inquiry by Congress to determine “the facts.”

“To be clear, we do not wish to prejudge the totality of the facts or Congress’ deliberative process,” said the statement, released Friday. “At the same time, there is no escaping that what we already know is serious enough to merit impeachment proceedings.”

The collection of signatures was set in motion by National Security Action, an organization founded and largely populated by officials from the Obama administration to call attention to Trump’s “reckless leadership.”

Many of the signers are former Obama officials. But the list includes others who served as career officials in both Democratic and Republican administrations, including Matthew Olsen, head of the Justice Department’s national security division under President George W. Bush and director of the National Counterterrorism Center under President Barack Obama.

6 a.m.: ‘Enough is enough with this guy,’ says Sen. Bernie Sanders

Echoing other Democratic White House hopefuls, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) lambasted Trump during an appearance Thursday night on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” during which he also called the president a “spoiled brat.”

“He’s probably the most corrupt president in the modern history of this country,” Sanders said, prompting applause from the studio audience. “I think this Ukrainian business — using national security money designed to protect the people of America and use that as leverage to try to get dirt on a political opponent, and then trying to cover that up — this is an outrage on top of an outrage. And I think this is kind of taking millions of people to say, ‘You know what? Enough is enough with this guy. ’ ”

Sanders went on to say that he doesn’t think Trump “knows the difference between lying and truth-telling.”"
163,Jenna Johnson,"PITTSBURGH Before hundreds crammed into a college-neighborhood burger joint, Sen. Amy Klobuchar assumed the tone of a stand-up comedian as she recounted taking a selfie with fellow Sens. John McCain and Bernie Sanders at President Trumps inauguration.

Less funny, anonymity also has largely defined Klobuchar’s role in the Democratic presidential contest — even though she has been a senator from Minnesota for 12 years and serves in leadership, even though she passes more legislation each session than most Democrats, even though she’s regularly on cable news and is campaigning across the country.

AD

At the beginning of the latest Democratic debate earlier this month, Klobuchar — who was stationed at the last lectern on the far left of the stage — embraced reality.

“I may not be the loudest person up here, but I think we’ve already got that in the White House,” she said, adding, “If you feel stuck in the middle of the extremes in our politics, and you are tired of the noise and the nonsense, you’ve got a home with me.”

The question for her campaign: In a primary driven by more combative activists, how many voters want that? And why her over other centrist candidates?

Klobuchar has seen a small bump in some polls since that debate, delighting her and her staff. A September Focus on Rural America poll of likely Iowa caucus-goers found her support at 8 percent, and a Des Moines Register-CNN-Mediacom Iowa poll released last weekend put her at 3 percent. Yet an average of national polls in September showed Klobuchar’s support around 1 percent.

AD

AD

She’s leaning on the fact that most voters say their support is fluid. Yet, for months she’s been overshadowed in the center by former vice president Joe Biden, who, like her, contends he’s a champion of working-class Midwestern voters and union members and knows how to work with Republicans to get legislation passed. And she has no clear strategy for changing that.

While most Democratic candidates have publicly challenged Biden — questioning his age and his comments on racial issues, among other things — Klobuchar largely has refrained and has even come to Biden’s defense. When asked why she thinks she would have a better shot at winning Rust Belt states than Biden, who grew up in Pennsylvania, Klobuchar says that she is “actually from the Midwest,” is a woman and is “in a new generation of politicians.” (At 59, she is 17 years younger than Biden.)

“A generation that actually has governed during the Trump era, which I think is key,” she said during a recent campaign stop in Philadelphia. “I was able to navigate this Congress during and before Donald Trump.”

AD

AD

Meanwhile, Klobuchar has repeatedly questioned and criticized policy ideas embraced by the two most prominent liberals in the race — Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts — that she says are too costly and would be paid for by the already strapped middle class. That includes Medicare-for-all, which Klobuchar calls “a bad idea” that would kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance plans, and making four-year colleges tuition free, which she says would force blue-collar workers to foot tuition bills of “rich kids.”

These sorts of ideas “are better left in the college faculty lounge,” Klobuchar said in Detroit last week — which sounded like a jab at Warren, a former law professor, although Klobuchar insisted it wasn’t. Klobuchar has said that although Warren has a plethora of plans, her own plans “have deadlines” and are more likely to be passed and implemented.

Via a small charter plane, Klobuchar recently took a whirlwind two-day trip through Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, three usually Democratic states that gave Trump the White House. During the trip, she made sure to note that in 2018 she won 42 Minnesota counties that voted for Trump two years earlier, when he came surprisingly close to winning her home state.

AD

AD

Klobuchar said that presidential candidates need to keep voters in these states in mind now — and that a more moderate candidate would have better success there during a general election.

During a visit to a carpentry-training center in Pittsburgh, Klobuchar often finished the sentences of her tour guides as they spoke of the dire need for welders and their frustration that some parents push their kids into four-year colleges when a trade school would be a better fit.

She said the government should double the amount of money given to students through Pell grants, increase the income cap to qualify for those grants and make one- and two-year-degree programs free.

AD

“We are so focused sometimes on one path to success and that’s not everyone’s path to success, and we need to make it easier for students to go to programs like this,” she said.

AD

The next day, she took artisanal doughnuts to United Auto Workers members striking outside a General Motors assembly factory in Detroit.

“I stand with you guys,” she told them. “You stood with the company when it was in trouble, right? Took a bunch of cuts, did things. And now the company is doing better, and you should share in that prosperity.”

Some responded positively.

“She said all the right things — which they do, but she seemed heartfelt and genuine, and you don’t usually get that from politicians,” said Meoshee Edwards, 47, who has worked at the plant for 23 years, likes Sanders and knew nothing about Klobuchar before she showed up. “She seems to know exactly what we’re fighting for and why we’re fighting for it. . . . I am going to research her now.”

AD

But Klobuchar wasn’t warmly embraced everywhere. During a tour of a dairy farm in rural Wisconsin — home to a young calf named “Amy” in her honor — a few of the local farmers who had gathered to meet her were upset that she spent more time talking to the media than to them. Later that day, she stopped by a training session in Milwaukee to share her ideas for expanding voting access with a group of African American activists and take a few questions about her time as a prosecutor. As she took a photograph with the group, one man declined to be included because he said she hadn’t taken enough questions and hadn’t fully answered the questions she was asked.

AD

Throughout the trip, Klobuchar made clear that to her, being a moderate isn’t just about policy — it’s also about her tone and approach. That’s meant focusing on issues and legislation that Republicans are willing to work on, even if it doesn’t excite a lot of Democratic primary voters. It has meant remaining calm and collected while questioning Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing. It has meant being the un-snazzy mom on the debate stage who scolds the others when they bicker.

“We need to not just change the policies in our country, but also change the tone of our politics,” Klobuchar said to cheers in a Milwaukee coffee shop last week.

AD

Sitting in the audience was Nancy Glissman, 59, who drove more than two hours with her husband from Illinois to be there. For many years, Glissman voted for Republicans for president but then voted for Barack Obama in 2012 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. With Trump in office, she is now firmly a Democrat.

AD

“I think Amy could lead us out of this without being divisive to our country,” said Glissman, who is retired. “We need somebody strong, but somebody that everyone can trust and get around. I think she’s that kind of person.”

Glissman sat with Brenda Dourseau, 60, a retired corrections officer who said the party needs to focus on reconnecting with young voters such as her grandchildren — and she wasn’t sure whether Klobuchar was the person to do that.

AD

“We need a candidate that can really touch these millennials. If they can lead them and get them excited, then [baby boomers] are going to follow, because we know that we have to get Trump out of there,” she said. Democrats “need to go to the younger voters. They truly do.”

Tom Glissman, Nancy’s husband, said that he would give Klobuchar more consideration if she were doing better in the polls. He is leaning toward Warren — although he wishes she would abandon her calls for Medicare-for-all and instead embrace offering a public option, as Klobuchar has done.

AD

“I love Elizabeth Warren, I really do, but she’s just a little too far left,” Dourseau said. “With all of the fire in the belly she has — if she was a little more moderate, she would be a shoo-in.”

All three agreed that they would vote for any Democrat in the general election.

“I can’t wait until this nightmare is over,” Glissman said. “I can’t wait until this Trump presidency is over. I will sleep better.”

“Me, too,” Dourseau said. “It’s a mess. The country is a mess.”"

7:00 p.m. Top Democrats accuse Trump of trying to intimidate whistleblower to obstruct justice

Democratic Reps. Eliot L. Engel (N.Y.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), chairman of the Oversight Committee, issued a joint statement condemning Trump’s comments that seem to threaten the whistleblower’s life.

The Democratic leaders said the president’s remarks were akin to obstructing the House impeachment inquiry by seeking to intimidate the whistleblower from cooperating.

“We condemn the President’s attacks, and we invite our Republican counterparts to do the same because Congress must do all it can to protect this whistleblower, and all whistleblowers,” they said. “Threats of violence from the leader of our country have a chilling effect on the entire whistleblower process, with grave consequences for our democracy and national security.”

Two flash polls found mixed reactions to the House of Representatives’ opening of an impeachment inquiry and the seriousness of the whistleblower’s claims.

An NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist poll conducted on Wednesday found 49 percent of Americans supported opening the impeachment inquiry while 46 percent were opposed, though independents tilted in disapproval, 50 percent to 44 percent.

A separate HuffPost-YouGov poll conducted from Tuesday to Thursday found 47 percent saying “Trump should be impeached and removed from office,” slightly higher than 43 percent in the same poll earlier this month. But that increase was driven more by increased support among Democrats than independents.

The NPR-PBS-Marist poll found 50 percent saying the impeachment inquiry is “a serious matter” compared with 48 percent who called it “just politics.” But a slightly larger 55 percent said the official notes about President Trump’s call with president of Ukraine is a serious matter.

“There is almost no excuse for a member of Congress to have not read the whistleblower report by now. It’s a few pages. This is literally our jobs,” she tweeted. “If you don’t have the commitment to be here and do the work, cut your fancy fundraisers & make the time, or quit.”

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said he is concerned about the safety of the whistleblower who raised the alarm about Trump’s call with Zelensky, citing “repugnant threats” made by the president earlier Thursday.

“I’m deeply concerned about it,” Schiff told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer when asked about the whistleblower’s safety. “And obviously, we’re going to do everything we can … to protect the whistleblower’s identity. But given those real, repugnant threats coming from the president, I have a real concern about this.”

5:30 p.m.: Former Ukraine prosecutor says Hunter Biden ‘did not violate anything’

A former top Ukrainian prosecutor, whose allegations were at the heart of the dirt-digging effort by Rudolph W. Giuliani, said Thursday he believed that Hunter Biden did not run afoul of any laws in Ukraine.

“From the perspective of Ukrainian legislation, he did not violate anything,” former Ukrainian prosecutor general Yuri Lutsenko told The Washington Post in his first interview since the disclosure of a whistleblower complaint alleging pressure by Trump on Zelensky.

Lutsenko’s comments about Hunter Biden — which echo what he told Bloomberg News in May — were significant, because Trump and his personal attorney Giuliani have sought to stir up suspicions about both Hunter and Joe Biden’s conduct in Ukraine in recent weeks.

4:30 p.m.: American Academy of Diplomacy says Trump’s statements about Yovanovich are cause for ‘great concern’

The American Academy of Diplomacy, a nonprofit that supports the work of U.S. diplomats, put out a strongly worded statement condemning the disparaging comments Trump made about Marie Yovanovitch, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, during his call with the Ukrainian president.

According to the rough transcript of the call between Trump and Zelensky provided by the White House, Trump said, “The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just want to let you know that.”

AD

Then Trump added, “She’s going to go through some things.”

The nonprofit’s chairman, Thomas Pickering, and its president, Ronald Neumann, said Trump’s comments causes them “great concern.”

Pickering worked in the State Department and as an ambassador under every president from Richard M. Nixon to Bill Clinton, while Neumann served as ambassador to Afghanistan and Bahrain under President George W. Bush and Algeria under Clinton.

“The threatening tone of this statement is deeply troubling,” they said in a joint statement. “It suggests actions outside of and contrary to the procedures and standards of a professional service whose officers, like their military counterparts, take an oath to uphold the Constitution. Whatever views the Administration has of Ambassador Yovanovitch’s performance, we call on the Administration to make clear that retaliation for political reasons will not be tolerated.

Yovanovitch was called back from her post in Ukraine in May, a move that Democrats have called a “political hit job.”

4:10 p.m.: Pompeo declines to say whether State Department told Giuliani to reach out to Ukraine

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declined to say Thursday whether the State Department directed Giuliani to contact Zelensky and his aides.

Giuliani said in a Fox News Channel interview earlier this week that he was “operating at the request of the State Department” when he reached out to Ukrainian officials about investigating Biden.

But in a news conference in New York, Pompeo dodged a question on Giuliani’s claim. He said he had yet to read the whistleblower’s complaint, telling reporters that he “read the first couple of paragraphs and then got busy today.” And he maintained that “to the best of my knowledge,” the behavior of State Department officials was “entirely appropriate.”

“We have tried to use this opportunity to create a better relationship between the United States and Ukraine, to build on the opportunities, to tighten our relationship, to help end corruption in Ukraine,” Pompeo said. “This was what President Zelensky ran on. We’re hopeful that we can help him execute and achieve that.”

4 p.m.: Clinton says Trump’s efforts to undercut Biden mirror his attacks against her in 2016

In an interview taped before Pelosi officially announced her support for an impeachment inquiry into Trump, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton described the latest developments regarding Trump’s alleged actions as “incredibly troubling.” She said Trump’s attempts to damage Biden’s 2020 chances are similar to his efforts to undercut her in 2016.

“The most outrageously false things were said about me,” Clinton said in an interview with CBS’s “Sunday Morning.” “And unfortunately, enough people believed them. So this is an effort to sow these falsehoods against Biden. And I don’t care if you’re for the [Democrats] or you’re a Republican, when the president of the United States — who has taken an oath to protect and defend the Constitution — uses his position to, in effect, extort a foreign government for his political purposes, I think that is very much what the founders worried about in high crimes and misdemeanors.”

Later in the interview, Clinton called Trump “a clear and present danger.”

The interview will air in its entirety on Sunday.

3:50 p.m.: Biden campaign says Trump’s actions extend from ‘fear’ that the former vice president will beat him in 2020

The Biden campaign responded to the latest revelations in Trump’s alleged efforts to seek incriminating information from Ukraine about the former vice president, claiming that Trump’s alleged actions are “all borne from his deep, fully substantiated fear that Joe Biden will beat him in November 2020.”

“An intelligence community whistleblower said, ‘I have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election,’” Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, said in a statement.

“An hour after the report was made public, the Acting Director of National Intelligence called this report ‘urgent and important’ and ‘totally unprecedented.’ And now we know that President Trump’s response to all of this was to privately issue a thinly veiled threat this morning to execute the national security professionals who followed their oath to uphold the Constitution by bringing this to light.”

Bedingfield added that Trump’s “abuse of power makes him one of the most divisive, unfit individuals to occupy the Oval Office in our nation’s history.”

3:30 p.m.: Trump compares whistleblower to a ‘spy’

In remarks at a meeting with staffers for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations on Thursday, Trump likened the whistleblower to a spy and suggested that the person should be punished for his or her actions.

He told staffers that “basically, that person never saw the report, never saw the call, he never saw the call — heard something and decided that he or she, or whoever the hell they saw — they’re almost a spy.”

“I want to know who’s the person, who’s the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that’s close to a spy,” Trump said, according to audio of his remarks posted by the Los Angeles Times and confirmed to The Washington Post by a person in the room. “You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.”

At a separate event with campaign donors at New York City’s Cipriani restaurant on Thursday, Trump waved a copy of the rough transcript of his call with Zelensky and boasted that it was good news for the GOP because it had prompted a flood of donations.

“This is the greatest thing that has ever happened to the Republican Party,” Trump said, according to an attendee.

When the crowd chanted “four more years,” the president responded by joking that they shouldn’t stop there.

“If you really want their heads to explode, you should chant eight more years,” Trump said.

2:30 p.m.: Timeline: The alarming pattern of actions by Trump included in whistleblower allegations

Six weeks after it was submitted, a complaint from an intelligence community whistleblower has been declassified and released publicly. Part of the complaint centers on the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky. The whistleblower complaint, filed more than a month earlier, accurately captures the content of that call, lending validity to the rest of the assertions in the complaint.

With that in mind, we’ve pulled out the significant dates mentioned in the whistleblower complaint to give a sense of how the effort by Trump and Giuliani to elicit an investigation in Ukraine unfolded.

1:30 p.m.: Number of House members supportive of impeachment inquiry stands at 220

The number of House members who support an impeachment inquiry into Trump has grown slightly to 220, according to a Washington Post tally.

The figure includes 219 Democrats and one independent member.

Of those, 27 have gone a step further and said they support impeaching the president.

The ranks of Democrats calling for an impeachment inquiry swelled in the past week, culminating Tuesday when Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced a formal inquiry.

1 p.m.: Trump arrives back in Washington

President Trump landed in Washington Thursday afternoon — and immediately lashed out at Democrats over their continued scrutiny of his phone call with Zelensky.

It was an “absolutely perfect phone call,” Trump told reporters shortly after getting off the plane.

He argued that Pelosi has been “hijacked by the radical left,” renewing his attacks on the speaker of the House after she announced her support for an impeachment inquiry.

1 p.m.: Schiff says Democrats are ‘determined to get to the bottom of this’

Schiff said his committee would work through an upcoming two-week recess as it continues to probe Trump’s interactions with Zelensky.

“We are determined to get to the bottom of this,” Schiff said, suggesting the committee would interview multiple witnesses, including the whistleblower.

The committee also wants to learn more about the roles of Attorney General William P. Barr and Giuliani among others, Schiff said.

Schiff spoke to reporters shortly after his panel adjourned after hearing from Maguire for more than three hours.

12:50 p.m.: Trump lashes out at Schiff after hearing wraps up

Trump took to Twitter shortly after the House Intelligence Committee hearing wrapped up, taking aim at its chairman and dismissing the whistleblower report as “second hand information.”

“Adam B. Schiff has zero credibility. Another fantasy to hurt the Republican Party!” Trump tweeted.

The tweet came as Schiff (D-Calif.) was fielding questions following the hearing from reporters, one of whom asked about Trump’s tweet.

“I’m always flattered when I’m attacked by someone of the president’s character,” Schiff responded.

In a separate tweet, Trump sought to play down the seriousness of the allegations of the whistleblower, who acknowledged no firsthand knowledge of Trump’s actions but said the complaint was informed by “more than half a dozen U.S. officials.”

“A whistleblower with second hand information? Another Fake News Story! See what was said on the very nice, no pressure, call. Another Witch Hunt!” Trump wrote.

A whistleblower with second hand information? Another Fake News Story! See what was said on the very nice, no pressure, call. Another Witch Hunt! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2019

Later, Trump targeted Schiff again on Twitter, writing: “Liddle’ Adam B. Schiff, who has worked unsuccessfully for 3 years to hurt the Republican Party and President, has just said that the Whistleblower, even though he or she only had second hand information, “is credible.” How can that be with zero info and a known bias. Democrat Scam!”

12:40 p.m.: Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, voices support for impeachment inquiry

Phil Scott on Thursday became the nation’s first Republican governor to voice support for the House’s impeachment inquiry against Trump.

“I believe we need to figure out what exactly did happen, establish the facts, and let the facts drive us from there to where we go,” Scott, who has been a frequent Trump critic, said at a news conference in Vermont.

12:30 p.m.: Lewandowski denies having conversations with White House about leading impeachment team

Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s former campaign manager, denied a CNN report that he has had discussions with the White House about potentially leading the president’s impeachment team.

“For the last five years, I have done my best to help this president in any capacity that he has asked me,” Lewandowski said in a phone interview with The Washington Post. “But I have had no conversation with anyone at the White House regarding this.”

Lewandowski signaled, however, that he is open to helping Trump fight back against impeachment in whatever way the president requests.

“If the president asks me to push back on the fake impeachment narrative, I will do that in any way I can,” Lewandowski said.

CNN reported earlier Thursday that Lewandowski, who is mulling a U.S. Senate bid, representing his home state of New Hampshire, has had recent conversations with White House officials about taking an administration position as the impeachment battle ramps up.

12:20 p.m.: Maguire hearing wraps up

The House Intelligence Committee hearing concluded Thursday afternoon after more than three hours of heated questioning of Maguire by lawmakers.

Maguire is expected to go behind closed doors later Thursday to address the Senate Intelligence Committee.

12:10 p.m.: Republicans plan another House vote on impeachment authorization

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said he will force another House vote on authorizing an impeachment investigation, in a move designed to put pressure on Democrats on the issue.

“Every member owes it to their constituents — their constituents are the ones who lend their voice to the members for two years,” McCarthy said at his weekly news conference. “And they should be very clear on where they stand.”

On Thursday morning, the number of House members backing an impeachment inquiry had passed the halfway mark, with 218 House Democrats and one independent member supporting at least opening an inquiry into whether Trump committed “high crimes and misdemeanors.”

But some Democrats are still holding out, including several in Republican-leaning districts.

12 p.m.: Senate panel debates withholding State Department funds

The Senate Appropriations Committee spent some time Thursday morning debating an amendment that would have withheld some State Department funds until $448 million in security assistance is released for Ukraine.

Ultimately, the committee didn’t vote on the amendment after its author — Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) — withdrew it. Murphy said he didn’t want to set a bad precedent and wanted to retain bipartisan agreement on the committee. He also said he trusted a commitment from Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) to ensure funding for Ukraine. Graham chairs the Appropriations subcommittee on state and foreign operations.

“I accept Senator Graham’s commitment to continue to work on this,” Murphy said. “I would rather have us stay together united, Republicans and Democrats, speaking for the importance of continuing to fund aid to Ukraine, and I agree with him that even without this language, when we spend money, when we appropriate it, the president is legally obligated to spend it.”

Underlying the discussion was Trump’s decision to hold up security assistance for Ukraine until recently, as revelations emerged about his phone call with the president of Ukraine in which Trump suggested that Biden should be investigated by authorities in that country.

Graham insisted that Trump was withholding funds as a means to get other countries to pay more. Murphy raised questions about that explanation.

Several Democrats said that under the circumstances, there was a need for statutory language requiring money appropriated for Ukraine to be spent.

“The plot has thickened dramatically,” said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.).

But the discussion ended without specific resolution.

“I just want to find a way to tell the Ukraine we’re with them and not screw up everything else,” Graham said.

11:45 a.m.: Trump’s other Ukraine problem: New concern about his business

Buried in the controversy over Trump’s phone call with Zelensky was an effort by the Ukrainian leader at currying favor with Trump through his business.

“Actually, last time I traveled to the United States, I stayed in New York near Central Park, and I stayed at the Trump Tower,” Zelensky told Trump, according to a rough transcript of the July 25 call released Wednesday.

Zelensky’s comments mark the first known example of the kind of interaction Democrats and government ethics experts had warned about when Trump took office: that foreign leaders would try to influence Trump by spending money at his properties and telling him about it.

Other Ukrainian officials have also patronized Trump properties. A top Zelensky aide met at Trump’s D.C. hotel in July with Trump attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, a frequent patron of the hotel himself, according to the New York Times. A lobbyist who registered as an agent of Zelensky’s with the U.S. government hosted a $1,900 event at the D.C. hotel in April, according to a federal filing.

11:40 a.m.: Lawmakers urge Congress not to go on recess

The House is scheduled to leave town on Friday for a two-week recess. But several Democrats are arguing that lawmakers should remain in Washington amid the intensifying focus on Trump’s conduct and the whistleblower complaint.

“Trump clearly sees the Oval Office as his campaign office,” Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) said in a tweet. “We cannot let the occupant make a mockery of our Constitution any longer. Congress must cancel the upcoming recess so we can finally impeach this president.”

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) also said that “Congress must not leave for recess tomorrow.”

“If we are committed to holding Trump accountable and passing something on gun violence, we have to keep working here in DC,” he said in a tweet. “The stakes are too high.”

The liberal group Indivisible said in a statement earlier this week that Pelosi should cancel recess “and get to a vote on articles of impeachment as soon as humanly possible.”

11:15 a.m.: Pelosi accuses the White House of a “coverup”

Pointing to the whistleblower’s report during remarks to reporters late Thursday morning, Pelosi repeatedly accused the White House of having engaged in a “coverup.”

She was responding to claims by the whistleblower from the U.S. intelligence community that not only did Trump misuse his office for personal gain and endanger national security, but that unidentified White House officials had tried to hide that conduct.

According to the complaint, White House officials were so alarmed by Trump’s call with Zelensky that they sought to limit access to its written record.

“Their actions are a coverup,” Pelosi said at her weekly press briefing. “It’s not only happened that one time. My understanding is it may have happened before.”

Pelosi also said that there was no timeline on the impeachment inquiry announced earlier this week and that Trump would have an opportunity to present exculpatory information.

“There is no rush to judgment,” Pelosi said.

She said the episode involving Ukraine would take precedence in the impeachment inquiry.

“We are at a different level of lawlessness that is self-evident to the American people,” Pelosi said.

11 a.m.: Schumer says Senate will serve as ‘solemn jurors of our democracy’ if House impeaches Trump

In remarks as the Senate opened Thursday morning, Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) called for lawmakers to place the best interests of the country, not their political parties, front and center as they weigh their next steps following the release of the whistleblower’s complaint.

“We have a responsibility to consider the facts that emerge squarely and with the best interest of our country — not our party — in our hearts,” Schumer said. “We have a responsibility not to rush to final judgment or overstate the case — not to let ourselves be ruled by passion, but by reason.”

He added that “if the House at the end of its inquiry sees fit to accuse the president of impeachable offenses, we in the Senate will act as jury.”

“And our role as the solemn jurors of democracy demands that we place fidelity to the country and fidelity to the Constitution above all else,” he said.

10:30 a.m.: Trump campaign says Democrats are the ones interfering in the 2020 election

A spokesman for Trump’s reelection campaign said Thursday morning that it wasn’t Trump who sought to interfere in the 2020 elections — but Democrats.

“All of this amounts to Democrats interfering in the 2020 election by attempting to block @realDonaldTrump from running for re-election,” Tim Murtaugh, the communications director for Trump’s campaign, wrote on Twitter. “They want to deny Americans the opportunity to vote to re-elect the President. They know they can’t beat him, so they have to try to impeach.”

10:15 a.m.: House Republicans highlight 20-year-old clips of Democrats opposing President Bill Clinton’s impeachment

As House Democrats sought to build a case for impeachment against Trump, House Republicans were using their Twitter account to share two-decade-old video clips of Democrats taking issue with the impeachment of President Bill Clinton.

The House Republican conference account shared clips of more than a half-dozen lawmakers speaking out against Clinton’s impeachment in 1998, with some of them complaining about a partisan process seeking to undo the will of voters.

One video depicted Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), currently the chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, speaking on the House floor.

“I am greatly disappointed in the raw, unmasked, unbridled hatred and meanness that drives this impeachment coup d’etat. The unapologetic disregard for the voice of the people,” she said.

Others Democrats highlighted in the clips included Pelosi, now-House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (Md.), now-Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.), Rep. Jim McGovern (Mass.), Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (Tex.) and Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (Conn.).

9:45 a.m.: Democratic White House hopefuls start weighing in on whistleblower complaint

Democratic White House contenders have started weighing in on the whistleblower complaint, with one — former congressman Beto O’Rourke (Tex.) — calling on the House to cancel its upcoming two-week recess.

“The House should cancel its break and start impeachment proceedings now,” O’Rourke said in a tweet. “As the whistleblower made clear: Every day Trump is in office, our democracy is less safe. We can’t wait to act.”

Rep. Tim Ryan (Ohio) shared on Twitter that he had read the report.

“It’s as straightforward as can be,” Ryan said, alleging it detailed “third-rate, banana republic behavior.”

“I can’t believe my Republican colleagues are going to ignore this,” Ryan said in another tweet. “Would they if our President was an Democrat?”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) also weighed in, writing on Twitter: “Donald Trump solicited foreign interference in our elections from the Oval Office. He attempted to cover up his actions. And his appointees intervened, against the law, to attempt to suppress this whistleblower complaint.”

Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), meanwhile, highlighted a paragraph in the report and offered her assessment: “This is a coverup.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) later asserted in a statement that the whistleblower complaint was “only the tip of an iceberg of corrupt, illegal and immoral behavior by this president.”

“What the House must do is thoroughly investigate Trump’s cover-up of this call and his other attempts to use government resources to help his re-election campaign,” he said.

9:20 a.m.: White House dismisses whistleblower complaint as ‘third-hand accounts’

Shortly after the whistleblower complaint was made public, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham issued a statement.

“Nothing has changed with the release of this complaint, which is nothing more than a collection of third-hand accounts of events and cobbled-together press clippings — all of which shows nothing improper,” she said.

9:15 a.m.: Whistleblower claimed Trump abused his office and that White House officials tried to cover it up

The House Intelligence Committee has released the whistleblower complaint at the heart of the burgeoning controversy over Trump’s July phone call with the Ukrainian president — an explosive document that claims not only that Trump misused his office for personal gain, but that unidentified White House officials tried to hide that fact.

“In the course of my official duties, I have received information from multiple U.S. government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election,” the whistleblower wrote in the complaint dated Aug. 12. “This interference includes, among other things, pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the President’s main domestic political rivals. The President’s personal lawyer, Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani, is a central figure in this effort. Attorney General (William P.) Barr appears to be involved as well.”

8:45 a.m.: Trump lashes out at Democrats as whistleblower complaint is released

Minutes after a whistleblower complaint was made public, Trump lashed out at Democrats in a tweet written in all capital letters in which he accused them of trying to destroy the Republican Party “AND ALL THAT IT STANDS FOR.”

“STICK TOGETHER, PLAY THEIR GAME, AND FIGHT HARD REPUBLICANS. OUR COUNTRY IS AT STAKE!” he counseled members of his party.

The tweet was in response to a whistleblower from the U.S. intelligence community who alleged that Trump had improperly pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son.

8:10 a.m.: Sarah Sanders argues impeachment drive helps Trump politically

Former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders argued Thursday that House Democrats have given Trump a political boost by launching a formal impeachment inquiry.

“I think that it’s one of the dumbest and most ridiculous political moves that we’ve seen in history, how they have forced impeachment over this issue,” Sanders said during an appearance on Fox News, where she is now a contributor.

“All this is doing is helping fuel his campaign,” Sanders said of the Democrats’ move. “They’re raising more money, they’re rallying his base, and they’re unifying the Republican Party in a way that only they can by attacking this president the way they do time and time again.”

7:30 a.m.: Trump unleashes spate of morning tweets

The president asserted Thursday that the stock market would crash if Democrats followed through with impeaching him, a warning sent in the midst of a morning spate of tweets and retweets about the inquiry announced this week by Pelosi.

In one tweet, Trump highlighted a Fox Business Network report with the headline: “Stocks hit session lows after Pelosi calls for impeachment inquiry.”

“If they actually did this the markets would crash,” Trump wrote in response. “Do you think it was luck that got us to the best Stock Market and Economy in our history. It wasn’t!”

Trump also highlighted a tweet by his daughter Ivanka, a White House adviser, in which she thanked him for his work and included a photo of her father pumping his fist.

“So cute! Her father is under siege, for no reason, since his first day in office!” Trump wrote.

In another, he wrote: “THE GREATEST SCAM IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS!”

6:30 a.m.: Biden suggests a motive for Trump reaching out to Ukraine

Speaking at a fundraiser Wednesday night in Los Angeles, Biden said there was no proof of Trump’s allegation that he and his son Hunter Biden had conflicts of interest while he served as vice president.

“This is not about me, and it really isn’t because not a single publication said anything he has ever said about me or my son is true,” Biden said. “Everyone has gone and researched it and said it’s not true.”

Biden suggested that Trump asked Zelensky to investigate him and his son because “70-something polls show that I’ll kick his … toes.” The audience burst into laughter.

6:15 a.m.: Some House Democrats fret as Pelosi forges ahead with impeachment

As his fellow House Democrats moved en masse toward impeaching Trump after months of hesitation, Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey could only watch in bewilderment.

“I don’t get surprised often,” the freshman moderate said Wednesday, less than 24 hours after Pelosi dropped her own qualms and launched the House’s official impeachment inquiry targeting Trump. “But really, truly, I just was like, ‘Wow.’ It happened so quickly.”

As other Democrats proclaimed unity and resolve after Pelosi described the “dishonorable fact of the president’s betrayal of his oath of office,” pledging to move quickly toward impeachment articles, Van Drew stood with a group of Democrats who say they continue to have reservations and fear a rash impeachment could obliterate the rest of the party’s governing agenda, improve Trump’s chances of reelection and imperil their own.

6 a.m.: Biden edges closer to calling for impeachment on ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!’

Biden edged closer to calling for impeachment on Wednesday night, pointing to a rough transcript of a conversation between Trump and Ukraine’s president as evidence that Trump is likely to have committed “an impeachable offense.”

Biden, who had stopped short of calling for the president to be ousted earlier this week, adjusted his stance after the White House shared the details of a 30-minute phone call Trump made to Zelensky in July. According to the 2,000-word rough transcript, Trump repeatedly suggested that Zelensky investigate Biden, offering help from the Justice Department and raising the possibility of inviting the foreign leader to the White House.

“Based on the material that they acknowledged today, it seems to me it’s awful hard to avoid the conclusion that it is an impeachable offense and a violation of constitutional responsibility,” Biden said during an appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”

5 a.m.: 218 House Democrats support impeachment inquiry

As of Wednesday evening, there were now 217 House Democrats and Independent Rep. Justin Amash (Mich.) who support launching an impeachment inquiry, giving 218 votes to impeach Trump — the threshold number of votes needed to pass anything in the House.

In the past two days, 78 Democrats said they wanted the House to go through with an impeachment process. Before the whistleblower complaint news broke last week, there were 95 members total who supported doing so.

“Today, for the world to see, we learned in his own words that the President of the United States used the full weight of the most sacred office in the land to coerce a foreign leader in a way that undermines our democracy and threatens our national security,” said Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), who came out for an impeachment inquiry Wednesday night.

But just because 218 lawmakers want the House to go through with the impeachment process, there’s no guarantee that they would vote to impeach Trump at the end of it. Of the 218, only 25 have said they’d vote to impeach the president right now."

Those efforts prompted that whistleblower complaint that was released this morning and have led to an official impeachment inquiry.

The White House counsel helped to identify legal obstacles to the disclosure of information that could be politically damaging to Trump. The head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel issued a classified opinion to initially block the whistleblower’s complaint from being transmitted to congressional committees that are legally entitled to receive it. The director of DOJ’s criminal division swiftly dismissed a criminal referral from the intelligence community’s inspector general that said Trump may have broken campaign finance laws by seeking dirt on Joe Biden. And Bill Barr declined to recuse himself, even though Trump invoked the attorney general at least twice during his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Here’s a quick primer on why each of the four taxpayer-funded attorneys is in the spotlight:

Steven Engel, director of the Office of Legal Counsel:

In late August, the inspector general for the intelligence community gave to the acting director of national intelligence a whistleblower complaint alleging that unnamed White House officials had expressed concern about Trump’s call. The IG said this was credible and urgent and should be turned over to Congress. But then Joseph Maguire, the acting DNI, contacted the Justice Department to ask for guidance. Engel issued a secret memo on Sept. 3 saying that the complaint didn’t need to be turned over to congressional intelligence committee because it was outside of the DNI’s jurisdiction. Instead, he said the allegation would more properly be referred to the Justice Department as a potential criminal matter for further review. (The DOJ published yesterday an unclassified version of Engel’s legal reasoning.)

Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski, head of the criminal division:

When the intelligence community IG submitted a criminal referral that said the president possibly violated campaign finance laws, it was Benczkowski who made the call within a matter of weeks that there was not enough evidence to pursue an investigation of Trump. He’s a former Senate GOP staffer who worked at the same law firm as Barr before being appointed to the job. Benczkowski’s confirmation was held up for a stretch two years ago because of his legal work for a Russian bank.

“Senior Justice Department officials defended their handling of the matter, saying that campaign finance laws required them to ‘quantify’ the value of what Trump was seeking for his campaign, and that was impossible to do with the investigations Trump had requested. They said they were examining what was referred, and the rough transcript of the call was the ‘best evidence’ to help determine what to do,” Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett report. “The FBI, the officials said, deferred to the Justice Department. … They said career prosecutors agreed with the decision.”

“All relevant components of the Department agreed with his legal conclusion, and the Department has concluded the matter,” Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement.

Attorney General Bill Barr:

Justice Department officials also said that the attorney general was “generally knowledgeable” of discussions about Engel’s decision but he didn’t make the call not to move forward with the investigation.

Kupec, Barr’s spokeswoman, said in a statement: “The President has not spoken with the Attorney General about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son. The President has not asked the Attorney General to contact Ukraine – on this or any other matter. The Attorney General has not communicated with Ukraine – on this or any other subject. Nor has the Attorney General discussed this matter, or anything relating to Ukraine, with Rudy Giuliani.”

She added that U.S. Attorney John Durham, who has been investigating the origins of the FBI’s probe into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, is “exploring the extent to which a number of countries, including Ukraine, played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election,” per Devlin, Matt, Carol Leonnig and Shane Harris.

But Democrats said Barr should have recused himself entirely. The Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee called on Barr to not be involved with anything related to Ukraine and this episode. Sen. Kamala Harris, a Democratic presidential candidate and formerly California’s attorney general, demanded that Barr testify under oath before Congress as soon as possible about his role.

“Trump has repeatedly lauded Barr, a stark contrast from his relationship with his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions,” the AP’s Michael Balsamo and Mark Sherman note. “Not only did Barr provide the first, favorable framing for the Mueller report, but he also … has supported the White House’s decision to claim broad executive privilege to prevent the testimony of administration officials that could be potentially damaging for Trump. Barr has also defied subpoenas from Congress — in line with the Trump administration’s stance to block Democrats’ efforts to investigate Trump.”

White House counsel Pat Cipollone:

Cipollone has been engaged in this matter since shortly after the whistleblower action surfaced, we reported last week, helping to identify legal obstacles to the sharing of information that could be politically damaging to Trump.

Three of my colleagues revealed yesterday that Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, threatened to resign over concerns that the White House might attempt to force him to stonewall Congress when he was going to testify about the whistleblower complaint. “He has at times expressed his displeasure to [Cipollone] and others that the White House had put him in the untenable position of denying the material to Congress over a claim that it did not fall within his jurisdiction as leader of the intelligence community,” according to Greg Miller, Shane and Karoun Demirjian. “The current and former officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, said Maguire had pushed the White House to make an explicit legal decision on whether it would assert executive privilege over the whistleblower complaint … It was unclear whether Maguire’s threat had forced the White House to acquiesce and allow him to testify without constraint. But officials said Maguire has pursued the opportunity to meet with lawmakers to defend his actions and integrity.”

Maguire denied that he ever threatened to resign, and the White House also disputed the account. After their statements were issued, Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron said, “We stand by the story.”

TRUMP’S PERSONAL ATTORNEY IS ALSO IN THE SPOTLIGHT:

-- In the rough transcript, Trump praises Rudy Giuliani as a “highly respected man” who was a “great mayor” of New York. “If you could speak to him that would be great,” the president tells Zelensky.

-- “Giuliani has claimed that his discussions with Ukrainian officials have been at the request of the State Department, which remained fully abreast of his dealings. But the details of the July 25 phone call … raise new questions about Giuliani’s role, reinforcing the view of some U.S. officials that he operates at the president’s behest, often in a closed loop, and occasionally in contravention to the messages of diplomats in Kiev,” John Hudson reports. “Technically, it is illegal for private citizens to negotiate with a foreign government on behalf of the United States under the Logan Act, but the law has rarely been enforced. Trump is not the first president to enlist a trusted outside adviser for a sensitive international mission, but Giuliani’s interventions sparked concern among U.S. officials in Kiev who said Ukrainians told them they were unsure if Giuliani was speaking for the U.S. government …

“Giuliani has said that Kurt Volker, the U.S. special representative for Ukraine, helped secure his discussions with a top aide to Zelensky, Andriy Yermak. A State Department official said Giuliani ‘does not speak on behalf of the U.S. government’ and added that Volker only helped set up the meeting at Yermak’s request. Yermak’s request to meet with Giuliani came after Trump requested that Zelensky speak with the former mayor in the July call. U.S. Embassy officials in Kiev repeatedly expressed concern about the contacts between Giuliani and Ukrainian officials. They have not been privy to most of the discussions, and at times only learned about them later from the Ukrainians, U.S. officials said. Giuliani told The Post he has had about five conversations with Yermak this year.

“In May 2019, Giuliani also met with a top Ukrainian anti-corruption prosecutor, Nazar Kholodnytsky, in Paris. Kholodnytsky — who was caught on tape advising witnesses in corruption cases how to avoid prosecution — had faced calls to step down from the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. But the meeting came at a triumphant moment for Kholodnytsky. He was holding on to his office. Yovanovitch had been recalled from her posting early. Kholodnytsky declined to comment on the contents of his conversation with Giuliani, which he described as that of a ‘prosecutor to a former prosecutor.’ But he has said that he believed something didn’t add up with the 2016 release of the ‘black ledger’ that forced Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to resign, and that the investigation into Burisma, the energy company of which Hunter Biden was a board member, needed to be reopened. Giuliani, when asked about his meeting with Kholodnytsky, said: ‘I’m not going to tell you about that.’”

-- Trump’s effort to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens appears to have begun as an attempt to formulate a rationale by which the president could pardon Paul Manafort as part of an effort to undermine Mueller’s investigation, according to previously undisclosed records obtained by the New York Review of Books: “These records indicate that attorneys representing Trump and Manafort respectively had at least nine conversations relating to this effort, beginning in the early days of the Trump administration, and lasting until as recently as May of this year.

“Through these deliberations carried on by his attorneys, Manafort exhorted the White House to press Ukrainian officials to investigate and discredit individuals, both in the US and in Ukraine, who he believed had published damning information about his political consulting work in the Ukraine. … [The records show that] on at least three occasions, [Giuliani] was in communication with Manafort’s legal team to discuss how the White House was pushing a narrative that the Democratic National Committee, Democratic donors, and Ukrainian government officials had ‘colluded’ to defeat [Trump’s] 2016 presidential bid.”

-- The phone call memo followed Trump’s long obsession with Ukraine. More details from the New York Times: “Long before the July 25 call ... Trump’s focus on Ukraine started after a law enforcement organization, the National Anticorruption Bureau of Ukraine, released damaging information about cash payments earmarked to [Manafort] by the Russia-aligned political party of Ukraine’s ousted former president. Even after Mr. Manafort stepped down from the Trump campaign under pressure, he insisted to Mr. Trump’s aides that Mrs. Clinton’s campaign was behind the surfacing of the documents revealing the payments, and questioned the authenticity of the documents. … The issue continued to fester with Mr. Trump. He tweeted six months after his inauguration about ‘Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign’ and to ‘boost Clinton,’ and asked, ‘where is the investigation?’”

MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT:

-- Read it for yourself here.

-- “The whistleblower complaint focuses largely on the July 25 call … But the complaint also broadly alleges an effort by Trump and [Giuliani] to pressure Ukrainian officials over time … The whistleblower paints a picture, also using public news reports, to suggest that Giuliani pressured Ukrainian officials to further Trump’s interest in investigating his political opponents,” Devlin, Matt, Carol and Shane report.

“The complaint also alleges a pattern of obfuscation at the White House, in which officials moved the records of some of Trump’s communications with foreign officials onto a separate computer network from where they are normally stored … The whistleblower alleges that is what officials did with Trump’s July 25 call with Zelensky, an action that alarmed the intelligence community inspector general and prompted him to request that the White House retain records of the Zelensky call...""

-- “The whistle-blower, moreover, identified multiple White House officials as witnesses to potential presidential misconduct who could corroborate the complaint … [and] the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, interviewed witnesses,” the Times reports. “Mr. Atkinson also found reason to believe that the whistle-blower might not support the re-election of Mr. Trump and made clear that the complainant was not in a position to directly listen to the call or see the memo that reconstructed it before it was made public … Instead, the officer heard about the call secondhand from unidentified White House officials who expressed concern that Mr. Trump had ‘abused his authority or acted unlawfully in connection with foreign diplomacy,’ the memo said. Still, Mr. Atkinson concluded after an investigation that the information in the complaint was credible.”

­-- The whistleblower tentatively agreed to testify on the condition that Maguire approves appropriate security clearances for the person’s lawyers, so they can accompany their client, CNN reports.

THE ATMOSPHERICS ON CAPITOL HILL:

-- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and senior House Democrats agreed in a private meeting after the release of the rough transcript they should narrow their impeachment investigation to Trump's dealings on Ukraine, according to five Democrats familiar with the conversation. Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade report: “Democrats said the evidence was incriminating enough — and easy enough for voters to understand — to proceed with their impeachment inquiry and soon. ‘Strike while the iron’s hot,’ said one individual in the meeting, summarizing the sentiment. Democrats said they could move quickly on impeachment and act by the end of the year. … [Pelosi] told colleagues that keeping the inquiry narrowly focused on the Ukraine allegations could also help keep the investigation out of the courts, where a slew of investigative matters have been bogged down for months — though she did not rule out ultimately including other episodes in potential articles of impeachment ...

“Multiple Judiciary Committee members said that they expected probes of other matters to continue unabated and potentially contribute to impeachment articles drafted this year. Several liberal lawmakers also want to include multiple charges in any impeachment articles.”

-- A milestone: A majority of House members are now on the record in support of opening an impeachment inquiry. As of last night, 217 House Democrats and one independent (Justin Amash) say they support at least opening an impeachment inquiry. Of those, 25 have gone a step further, saying they would definitely support impeaching the president. (The Fix is keeping a live whip count here.)

-- That op-ed published by seven House Democratic freshmen from swing districts with national security credentials proved seismic in pushing both wavering Democrats and Pelosi toward supporting an impeachment inquiry. Paul Kane explains: “Throughout the first phase of the Trump investigations, focusing on Russian interference in 2016, these Democrats found that their constituents were confused by the complicated and long-running investigation by [Mueller]. Instead, while other freshmen got media attention for bashing Trump, this group focused on kitchen-table issues like health-care costs and infrastructure projects. ... Liberal activists tried to jam their town halls, but most Democratic aides reported that aside from one or two impeachment questions, the overwhelming majority of concerns focused on local economic matters. … To be sure, a dozen or so swing-seat Democrats remain mum, declining so far to take a position ... But no one spoke out against impeachment in their Tuesday afternoon huddle in the Capitol basement.""

-- Some House Democrats say they wish Pelosi had waited a little longer. “I don’t get surprised often,” said Rep. Jeff Van Drew (N.J.). “But really, truly, I just was like, ‘Wow.’ It happened so quickly.” (Mike DeBonis has more.)

THE GOP RESPONSE:

-- ""The helter-skelter way the administration handled the aftermath of the whistleblower complaint could be a harbinger of the coming impeachment fight, with the White House scrambling to respond to a mercurial and frustrated president, who is increasingly sidelining his aides and making decisions based on gut instinct,"" Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey and Philip Rucker report: ""Even some allies of the president worry that his team may not fully understand the potential upheaval that an impeachment fight could wreak on Trump and his administration, especially as he heads into the 2020 election. ...

""On Wednesday morning, aides invited roughly a dozen Republican lawmakers to the White House to preview and discuss the transcript before it was released to the public. At one point, Trump called in from New York, and attendees described him as generally in a good mood — 'chagrined' but not angry, though skittish about some of the details. At one point, the group began joking with the president that 'this was one of his better' phone calls with foreign leaders, an attendee said. And even privately, Trump did not believe his conversation with the Ukrainian president was problematic, according to four people with whom he spoke.""

-- While most Republican senators publicly toed the line and repeated talking points sent by the White House, several were privately stunned and questioned Trump's judgment after seeing the rough transcript. Robert Costa reports: “One Senate Republican, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly, said the transcript’s release was a ‘huge mistake’ that the GOP now has to confront and defend — while the party argues at the same time that House Democrats are overreaching with their impeachment inquiry of Trump. Three other GOP senators complained privately in discussions ... that the White House erred by releasing the transcript, arguing that it sets a precedent for future presidents about disclosure of calls with foreign leaders and could be seen as a concession to Democrats. Publicly, two senators expressed serious concerns about the revelation, as cracks have begun to emerge with GOP lawmakers privately discussing Trump’s conduct and their party’s political standing.""

“Republicans ought not to be rushing to circle the wagons and say there’s no ‘there’ there when there’s obviously a lot that’s very troubling there,” Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) told reporters.

(R-Neb.) told reporters. “It remains troubling in the extreme. It’s deeply troubling,” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told reporters.

(R-Utah) told reporters. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said there was “no quid pro quo,” adding, “while the conversation reported in the memorandum … was inappropriate, it does not rise to the level of an impeachable offense.”

“One early divide among Senate Republicans is between the ‘Burr camp’ and the ‘Johnson camp,’ according to two senior GOP aides,"" Costa reports, ""referring to Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. Burr’s faction of the Senate GOP has a darker, frustrated view of Trump’s handling of Ukraine, while Johnson has linked the Ukraine issue to his committee’s work into reviewing the launch of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails while serving as secretary of state.""

-- He does not get a vote, but Vermont’s Republican governor, Phil Scott, said the impeachment inquiry is “appropriate,” per the AP.

-- The impeachment inquiry is threatening to derail most of Trump's domestic agenda, upending trade and spending talks. From Erica Werner and David Lynch: “The White House and lawmakers must agree to a new spending deal by Nov. 21, and prospects for an easy resolution were already dim because of a fight over border wall funding. The White House also wants Congress to pass a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada by the end of this autumn, a timeline that could now be impossible to meet.""

THE UKRAINE ANGLE:

-- Trump’s meeting with Zelensky on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly offered a platform for salesmanship, grievance and a joke or two. Anne Gearan reports: “‘We spoke a couple of times, as you probably remember,’ Trump cracked. … Zelensky, a comedian and television star before he was elected this year, also tried to keep the mood light by noting that ‘it’s better to be on TV than by phone.’ … Standing alongside Trump, Zelensky insisted Wednesday that ‘nobody pushed me’ to investigate. ‘I think you read everything,’ Zelensky said as he and Trump faced the cameras. ‘I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved’ in U.S. elections, Zelensky continued, as Trump smiled beside him. ‘No, you heard that we had, I think, good phone call. It was normal.’ Trump chimed in: ‘In other words, no pressure.’""

-- Trump called former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin a “very good” prosecutor.” But Shokin resigned in disgrace. David L. Stern reports: Shokin “became Ukraine’s prosecutor general in 2015 with promises to wage an unflinching battle against corruption after political upheavals dumped a pro-Russian president and brought in Western-looking leadership. At the time, it was a message heartily welcomed by major donors … Shokin, however, quickly faced questions of his own. Critics complained that he fell short on his pledges to peer deeply into Ukraine’s shadows. By the end of his 13-month tenure, Shokin was scorned by the Obama administration and others that had once praised his appointment.”

-- Trump boasted about U.S. aid to Ukraine. But America isn’t Kiev’s only friend, writes Ruby Mellen: “Although the United States is one of the country’s biggest foreign-aid benefactors, other countries have also sent significant assistance to Ukraine. The European Union and its financial institutions have provided more than $16.5 billion in grants and loans to support its reform process since 2014. In addition to those E.U. funds, Germany on its own has pledged millions of dollars in assistance, as has Britain. And Japan, meanwhile, has given $3.1 billion in assistance to Ukraine to the establishment of diplomatic relations in the early 1990s.”

-- “The U.S. tried to fix Ukraine’s government. We exported our corruption, instead,” laments Paul Musgrave, a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.

DOMESTIC POLITICAL FALLOUT:

-- During the Ukraine call, Trump revived a pervasive conspiracy theory about the hacking of the Democratic National Committee. Craig Timberg, Drew Harwell and Ellen Nakashima report: “For years cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike was a source of news, not a subject, as it unraveled some of the world’s most notorious hacks. … Ever since the company exposed Russian intrusions into [DNC] computers in 2016, … CrowdStrike has been a subject of allegations that rippled through conservative news sources, onto social media, into the criminal trial of longtime Trump friend Roger Stone and [into the president’s call].”

The nature of Trump’s reference to CrowdStrike in his call is not obvious in the White House’s memo, but, basically, the company has become a boogeyman of right-wing conspiracy theorists who have falsely claimed it helped Democratic leaders cover up what they insist was a breach by a party insider. In reality, Drew and Ellen explain, “the FBI felt it was not necessary to enter the DNC's premises and take custody of the affected servers, as agents were able to obtain complete copies of forensic images made by CrowdStrike.""

-- Trump claimed Hunter Biden got China to put $1.5 billion in a fund, an allegation that has been flatly denied by Biden’s lawyer. Michael Kranish reports: “Trump, who has made a similar allegation for months, is referencing information from a book by Peter Schweizer, ‘Secret Empires,’ that first detailed how Hunter Biden flew to China on Air Force Two with his father in 2013. … Trump on Wednesday put it this way: ‘When Biden’s son walks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund and the biggest funds in the world can’t get money out of China and he’s there with one quick meeting and he flies in on Air Force Two. I think that’s a horrible thing.’ … In bringing up the China episode, Trump did not provide any new evidence to back up his claims.

""Hunter Biden did travel with his father on Air Force Two to China on Dec. 4, 2013. Twelve days later, Hunter Biden joined the board of a just-formed investment advisory firm, known as BHR, whose partners included Chinese entities. Affiliates of the advisory firm said they planned to raise $1.5 billion. Some media reports over the past five years have described Hunter Biden as an owner of a private equity company that sought to raise that amount. However, George Mesires, lawyer for Hunter Biden, said in an interview earlier this year that his client’s role has been misconstrued. He said Hunter Biden was on the board of the advisory firm that did not directly invest, but instead advised those who did.”

-- Trump was fixated on attacking Biden long before his call with Zelensky, per Toluse Olorunnipa and Matt Viser: “He attacked Biden at the White House and at campaign rallies. He attacked Biden on Twitter and on Instagram. He attacked Biden in France and in Japan, during news conferences and official speeches, in phone calls and in interviews, on Air Force One and in the Rose Garden, during morning 'executive time' and in late-night tweet storms. … Trump’s advisers say the president has targeted Biden in recent months for several reasons: He has emerged as a front-runner in a crowded field of Democratic contenders, he has a long record in Washington that allows the president to position himself as an outsider and he has been leading Trump in polling in key swing states. Campaign aides previously had been wary of singling out any of the Democratic presidential candidates, opting instead to lump the group of more than 20 contenders together under the banner of ‘socialism.’”

-- “An impeachment investigation will also shape the Democrats’ choice of a nominee, potentially foreshortening the race and freezing the current standings in place,"" writes Karen Tumulty. ""Those who are struggling to break from the rear of a 19-person field will find it even harder — and maybe impossible — to make their voices heard in the din. ‘Candidates who have advantages now may see those advantages multiplied,’ says David Axelrod, who was Barack Obama’s chief strategist.”

-- Trump’s call with Zelensky is unlike anything scholars have heard before, reports Karen DeYoung: “‘This is nothing like a conversation between Richard Nixon or Henry Kissinger and a foreign leader,’ said Ken Hughes of the Miller Center at the University of Virginia, an expert on Nixon during the Vietnam War and Watergate. ‘Nixon had very detailed knowledge when he spoke to foreign leaders. He could be subtle in negotiations and still get his point across,’ Hughes said. But ‘when he wanted to dig up dirt on his political adversaries,’ Nixon did it at home, he said. Even President Lyndon B. Johnson, whose vulgarity and pressure tactics are well documented, ‘tended to be a cautious and careful communicator with world leaders and diplomats, not the gunslinger that he could be with Americans that he knew well,’ said Kent Germany of the University of South Carolina. ‘He was not going to go rogue and be Lyndon Johnson with these other leaders.’”

-- Before the transcript was released, former New Jersey governor and the onetime Trump transition chief Chris Christie ominously said that Trump would be in trouble if he said something like “do me a favor.” Hours later, it was revealed the president asked the Ukrainian president to “do us a favor.” (Mediaite)

-- The Wall Street Journal stands behind its reporting that Trump pressured Zelensky to work with Giuliani about eight times, despite claims from Trump allies and conservative media that it's wrong. The Journal notes the rough transcript is incomplete. There are also ellipses. (Erik Wemple)

NOTEWORTHY COMMENTARY:

-- Tuesday was Pelosi’s day, but Wednesday was Trump’s – for better or for worse, writes chief correspondent Dan Balz: “The impeachment inquiry is both an epic battle between the speaker and the president and, more fundamentally, a constitutional clash that will help define the limits on presidential power, and the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches. The outcome will shape, perhaps decisively, the 2020 campaign. Trump will either be out of office by January 2021 or he will have emerged victorious, reelected to a second term in large part because of what would then, inevitably, be interpreted as an enormous gamble by the speaker and the Democrats that went terribly wrong. The past two days have shown that there is no turning back.”

-- The Trump-Ukraine transcript contains evidence of a quid pro quo, writes National Review’s David French, a leading conservative attorney: “The transcript provides proof that Trump made a completely improper request that the president of Ukraine work with Trump’s personal counsel to investigate a political rival. It provides strong evidence that this took place in the context of a quid pro quo for desperately needed military aid.”

-- The Trump-Zelensky readout is a devastating indictment of our president, says The Post’s Editorial Board.

-- The rough transcript of the call is devastating. How could Trump not realize that? Max Boot wonders: “At least Richard Nixon had the good sense to resist releasing the ‘smoking gun’ tape until finally forced to do so by the Supreme Court. … Trump, by contrast, is so clueless — so lacking in even the most basic sense of right and wrong — that he could actually tweet this morning: ‘Will the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President?’”

-- Democrats had no idea Trump would hand them so much ammo, writes E.J. Dionne Jr.

-- The House doesn’t need an impeachment inquiry to confirm Trump’s wrongdoing. His corruption is hidden in plain sight – just look at his D.C. hotel, argues Dana Milbank: “As the call notes were being released, a joint House committee opened a hearing on Trump’s lease of the Old Post Office, now the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Trump has violated the plain language of the lease (it says no U.S. elected official can be part of or benefit from the lease), and the plain language of the Constitution (it says no U.S. officeholder can accept payments from any ‘foreign state’). But the General Services Administration found a novel way to avoid declaring that Trump had obviously violated both: It looked the other way.”

THE TRUMP AGENDA:

-- The administration announced an asylum deal with Honduras, which could force migrants into one of the world’s most violent nations. Nick Miroff reports: “Department of Homeland Security officials reached the accord with the government of President Juan Orlando Hernández, who is embroiled in allegations of government corruption and charges that he and others have been operating the nation as a criminal enterprise — Hernández has been named as a co-conspirator in a major U.S. drug trafficking case. The deal paves the way for the United States to take asylum seekers from the U.S. border and ship them to a nation with one of the highest murder rates in the world, a country with gang wars that have fueled waves of mass migration and multiple ‘caravans’ to the United States that became a major irritant to [Trump].”

-- The new deal comes just days after a man was brutally murdered in Honduras -- just hours after being deported from the United States. (La Prensa)

-- The Republican-controlled Senate voted for the second time to overturn Trump’s declaration of a national emergency at the southern border, but the body once again fell well short of the veto-proof, two-thirds majority needed to block the president from diverting military construction money to his pet project. (Erica Werner and Aaron Gregg)

-- Human rights groups demanded that ICE release all LGBTQ detainees and anyone with HIV in the agency’s custody. Robert Moore reports: “‘We know that lack of medical and mental-health care, including lack of HIV care, is the norm,’ Roger Coggan, director of legal services at the Los Angeles LGBT Center, told reporters Wednesday afternoon. ‘By the Department of Homeland Security’s own count, 300 individuals identifying as transgender have been in custody and at the mercy of ICE since October of 2018. These cruel incarcerations need to stop immediately.’ DHS officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the complaint. It is unclear how many LGBTQ people and people with HIV are detained by U.S. immigration officials.”

-- Trump's decision to move the Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service out of Washington will cause “significant delays” in vital research reports on which farmers depend. Politico reports: “ERS conducts research into areas such as climate change, nutrition, export data and the farm economy. Farmers also heavily rely on its outlook reports to make planting decisions. Crop markets can swing on the results of the numbers. ... USDA identified 38 specific reports that may be delayed because staff members have departed.""

­-- Income inequality has grown, including in heartland states. From the AP: “The nation’s Gini Index, which measures income inequality, has been rising steadily over the past five decades. The Gini Index grew from 0.482 in 2017 to 0.485 last year, according to the bureau’s 1-year American Community Survey data. The Gini Index is on a scale of 0 to 1; a score of ‘0’ indicates perfect equality, while a score of ‘1’ indicates perfect inequality, where one household has all the income.”

-- The Federal Aviation Administration disputed an independent watchdog’s finding that safety inspectors who worked on training requirements for Boeing’s 737 Max jets were underqualified. Ian Duncan reports: “Deputy FAA Administrator Daniel K. Elwell also rejected the watchdog’s finding that his agency had misled Congress over the issue, saying that was ‘not what happened,’ ... that making any connection between that problem and the 737 Max was ‘simply not accurate.’”

-- Trump’s Turnberry resort is the only hotel named by Glasgow Prestwick Airport in promotional materials distributed at private meetings with American military air crews. From The Scotsman: “The document, prepared by the Scottish Government owned airport and handed out at ‘closed’ meetings with US Armed Forces personnel, emphasizes the ‘five star’ status of the US president’s flagship Scottish property, even noting how it has been ‘newly refurbished.’ Two sources familiar with the gatherings said Prestwick staff also delivered presentations in which they offered to arrange rounds of golf at Turnberry for visiting US Air Force (USAF) crews as part of their layovers.”

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani addresses the United Nations General Assembly. (Craig Ruttle/AP)

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- The White House banned Iranian officials from entering the U.S. just hours after a failed attempt to renew diplomacy with President Hassan Rouhani during the U.N. General Assembly, per the Times: “Mike Pompeo said the United States was still open to talking to Iran, and hoped to tamp down inflamed tensions after leaders in the United States, Europe and Arab nations blamed Tehran for attacks on oil fields in Saudi Arabia this month.""

-- Shortly after, Rouhani warned the Persian Gulf is ""on the edge of collapse."" From the AP: ""Rouhani accused the United States of engaging in 'international piracy' against his country by re-imposing economic sanctions after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Tehran 'will never negotiate with an enemy that seeks to make Iran surrender with the weapon of poverty,' Rouhani said ... 'Stop the sanctions so as to open the way for the start of negotiations.' ... Rouhani said U.S. wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria had failed, with Washington 'unable to resolve the more sophisticated issues' plaguing the Middle East.""

-- Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, speaking about his role in journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s murder for the first time, said it was done without his knowledge. From Frontline: “‘It happened under my watch,’ the Saudi leader [said.] ‘I get all the responsibility, because it happened under my watch.’ But he insists that it was without his knowledge. … [bin Salman was pressed] on how the murder could have happened without him knowing about it. ‘We have 20 million people. We have 3 million government employees,’ Prince Mohammed responded. … ‘I have officials, ministers to follow things, and they’re responsible, they have the authority to do that,’ Prince Mohammed said.”

-- Israeli President Reuven Rivlin asked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to try forming a new governing coalition. Steve Hendrix and Ruth Eglash report: “Rivlin’s decision to offer Netanyahu the first go at forming a government came on the day that official results from last week’s election were finalized, showing that the prime minister’s Likud party had secured one seat fewer in the Knessett, Israel’s parliament, than the rival Blue and White party headed by Benny Gantz. Neither of the two main parties is close to a 61-seat majority. But a plurality of all the newly elected parliament members told Rivlin that they preferred Netanyahu, earning him the president’s nod.”

-- Returning to Westminster, Prime Minister Boris Johnson goaded opposition lawmakers to call a no-confidence vote or agree to a general election and bring the Brexit fight back to the people after the Supreme Court ruled his decision to suspend Parliament was illegal. William Booth and Karla Adam report: “Facing a chamber packed with hooting and jeering lawmakers, Johnson said Britain’s highest court was ‘wrong to pronounce on what is essentially a political question at a time of great national controversy.’ Rather than apologize to the queen and the country, as opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn demanded, Johnson went on the offensive, saying it was anti-Brexit forces in Parliament who were working against democracy, with their cunning maneuvers designed to sabotage a departure and thwart the will of the people.”

-- At least 70 countries have engaged in disinformation campaigns, according to a new report by researchers at Oxford University. From the NYT: “In Vietnam, citizens were enlisted to post pro-government messages on their personal Facebook pages. The Guatemalan government used hacked and stolen social media accounts to silence dissenting opinions. Ethiopia’s ruling party hired people to influence social media conversations in its favor. Despite increased efforts by internet platforms like Facebook to combat internet disinformation, the use of the techniques by governments around the world is growing … The researchers … found that the number of countries with political disinformation campaigns more than doubled to 70 in the last two years, with evidence of at least one political party or government entity in each of those countries engaging in social media manipulation. In addition, Facebook remains the No. 1 social network for disinformation, the report said. Organized propaganda campaigns were found on the platform in 56 countries.”

-- Military drones are now common in nearly 100 nations, a new report found. From the WSJ: “China is a top exporter of drones alongside Israel and the U.S., according to the report. Pentagon officials have expressed concern over Beijing’s dominance of the global market for small drones. There are at least 21,000 and probably more than 30,000 unmanned aerial vehicles in military service world-wide, the report says. It catalogs 171 types of drones in military inventories and 268 military-drone units established by 58 countries. Fifteen countries have training academies for drone operators, and seven maintain drone bases outside their own borders, according to the report.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Cindy McCain, widow of John McCain, criticized the GOP, saying it is no longer the party she and her husband belonged to. Kim Bellware reports: McCain, when asked to size up the political landscape heading into the 2020 election, “pointed to the local GOP in Arizona and assessed that ‘it’s not functioning well’ and excludes people who aren’t ‘walking the line.’ ‘That’s just not right,’ McCain said. ‘That’s not the party my husband and I belonged to.’ While those issues may have McCain feeling alienated from the party, she predicted they could also have consequences for Republicans in 2020. Speaking about the Arizona GOP, she noted how the party’s exclusionary views, as McCain described them, could fail to resonate with Arizona voters; the state’s demographics increasingly include younger voters, a politically organized — and vocal — Latino population and transplants from around the country. … ‘I can see [Arizona] going Democrat, I really can,’ McCain said. ‘I’m not saying I want that, but I can see it happening.’”

-- Elizabeth Warren is rising everywhere, per CNN: “The latest Quinnipiac University national poll ... has Warren at 27% to [Biden’s] 25%. Now, one poll doesn't mean much, and Quinnipiac's result is well within the margin of error, so there's no clear leader. ... The trendline is what is important here.""

-- A volunteer for Warren’s campaign was killed in a car crash in western Iowa. Zachary Crombie Presberg, 22, joined the campaign as a summer organizing fellow and had stayed on as a volunteer. (Des Moines Register)

-- More infighting: Top aides are privately questioning Bernie Sanders's strategy. From CNN: “The campaign's in-house production team recently began shooting its first television ads of the 2020 cycle in Iowa, likely quieting at least one source of dissent among some senior aides, who have been pushing for Sanders to get on the air. … Even if the senator and his staff have reason to believe the Iowa race is closer than the most recent polling indicates, interviews with two senior aides to Sanders revealed growing concerns that the Hawkeye State and New Hampshire could be at risk of slipping away. The twin sources of frustration and internal debate, both aides told CNN, was a schedule that too often takes Sanders away from the early voting states and a perception among staff, especially in Iowa, that the campaign has been wrong-headed in its decision to put off investing there in television ads.”

-- Biden’s brother James Biden touted his ties to the former vice president’s cancer initiative during an investment pitch to a health-care firm, according to Politico: James Biden “made the promise to executives at Florida-based Integrate Oral Care during a phone call on or around November 8, 2018, according to Michael Frey, CEO of Diverse Medical Management, a health-care firm that is suing James Biden. At the time, James Biden's business partners were pursuing a potential investment in Integrate, according to Frey and court records. Frey, who had a business relationship with James Biden and his associates, had introduced the group to Integrate. James Biden told the Integrate executives that he would get the Biden Cancer Initiative to promote an oral rinse made by the firm and used by cancer patients, Frey, [told Politico]. He added that James Biden directly invoked the former vice president on the call. 'He said his brother would be very excited about this product,' Frey said. A spokesman for James Biden disputed Frey's account.”

The whistleblower who sounded an alarm while others bit their tongues showed that. So did the inspector general who alerted Congress to his complaint when President Trump’s loyalists were trying to keep it secret. And the public got a glimpse during a House committee hearing on Thursday of how differently this scandal might have played out if Trump's previous pick to lead the nation’s intelligence community had been confirmed.

The temperamental contrast was stark between Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Tex.), the hyper-partisan congressman who wanted the job, and Joe Maguire, the decorated military hero who got it instead and seemed eager to show he’s no one’s toady. Democrats faulted Maguire, as the acting director of national intelligence, for checking in with the very entities who a CIA whistleblower had accused of wrongdoing, including Bill Barr’s Justice Department and Trump’s White House counsel’s office, to see if they wanted to claim executive privilege to prevent the disclosure of his allegations.

Maguire noted earnestly that he was new in the role and wanted to do the right thing. The retired admiral had been running the National Counterterrorism Center after 36 years in the Navy, including as commander of Seal Team 6. He said he’s sworn an oath to protect and defend the Constitution 11 times. “No one can take an individual’s integrity away,” Maguire explained. “It can only be given away.”

Ratcliffe’s questioning of Maguire – which was more of a monologue, really – offered a window into how he might have handled both the complaint and the hearing if he’d found himself in the hot seat. The congressman made the case that Trump prodding his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate former vice president Joe Biden was “lawful conduct.” He claimed without evidence that the whistleblower was “wrong in numerous respects” and dubiously compared the complaint to the “Steele dossier” in the Russia investigation. “The United States is allowed to solicit help from a foreign government in an ongoing criminal investigation, which is exactly what President Trump did in that conversation,” Ratcliffe declared.

Ratcliffe’s hopes of getting formally nominated went down in flames on Aug. 2 after Senate Republicans expressed concern about his qualifications and evidence that he had padded his résumé. The three-term congressman had impressed Trump in July with his hostile questioning of former special counsel Bob Mueller. When the president pulled his support just a week after announcing his intention to nominate Ratcliffe, reporters asked Trump why he put someone with such limited national security experience up for such an important job without fully vetting him. “I think he would’ve picked it up very quickly,” Trump replied. “I give out a name to the press and they vet for me. We save a lot of money that way.” Trump gave the job instead to Maguire, who had no idea he’d immediately be thrust into the center of an epic fight between the White House and Congress.

During the hearing, Ratcliffe also falsely insisted that the legal opinion from the Justice Department, which claimed that intelligence community officials didn’t need to turn over the whistleblower complaint because it was outside of their jurisdiction, was written by nonpolitical lawyers. “That's an opinion from the Department of Justice ethics lawyers – not political appointees, but career officials that serve Republicans and Democrats,” Ratcliffe said during the hearing.

In fact, that opinion – released publicly on Wednesday – was authored by Trump appointee Steven Engel. Engel earned a reputation as a highly partisan figure in George W. Bush’s Justice Department, which is why Democrats fought his confirmation to run the Office of Legal Counsel. He was confirmed by a vote of 51 to 47 in November 2017. As a former U.S. attorney, it seems inconceivable that Ratcliffe would not know the Office of Legal Counsel is led by a political appointee.

-- It’s also very revealing to contrast how Maguire and Trump talked about the whistleblower. The acting DNI testified that he does not know who wrote the document, but he said he doesn’t question the person’s motives. He added that he believes they “acted in good faith” and insisted that he is glad the information has finally come out. “I think the whistleblower did the right thing,” Maguire said. “I think he followed the law every step of the way.”

As Maguire was testifying, Trump declared that the whistleblower acted like “a spy” and suggested that the legally protected conduct was akin to “treason.” Speaking in New York at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, the president made clear that he’d also like to ferret out anyone else who provided evidence of his misconduct. “I want to know who’s the person that gave the whistleblower … the information because that’s close to a spy,” he said. “You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now.”

The Los Angeles Times published an audio recording of the closed-door speech, and The Post later obtained a video. “We’re at war,” Trump said in his ad-libbed remarks, referring to the scandal. “These people are sick. They’re sick. And nobody’s called it out like I do.”

-- Trump and his band of brothers have been leaning on the language of war this week. Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), the ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee, congratulated Democrats at the Maguire hearing on the “rollout of their latest information warfare operation against the president.”

Steve Bannon, Trump’s former White House strategist, compared Nancy Pelosi’s speech on Tuesday night to the start of the Civil War in 1861. “Pelosi’s announcement to begin a formal process at 5 p.m. was the shot at Fort Sumter,” Bannon said. “Now you cannot freelance, you cannot go rogue. You have to be disciplined. You have to be high and tight.”

-- Former DNI James Clapper likened the president’s comments about the whistleblower to “witness retaliation.” “What’s really bad about it is this is going to have a very chilling effect on any other potential whistleblowers,” the Trump critic said on CNN.

WHAT’S EMERGED ABOUT THE WHISTLEBLOWER:

-- “The whistleblower’s identity remains obscured, the details of his work for the CIA cloaked in secrecy. But the document he delivered reveals almost as much about the investigative mission he carried out in stealth as it does about the alleged abuses of power by the president,” Greg Miller reports. “[T]he CIA officer behind the whistleblower report moved swiftly behind the scenes to assemble material from at least a half-dozen highly placed — and equally dismayed — U.S. officials. He wove their accounts with other painstakingly gathered material on everything from the intervention of Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani in the U.S.-Ukraine relationship to alleged efforts by American diplomats sent to Kiev and attorneys in the Office of the White House Counsel to contain or suppress the accruing damage. …

“Six weeks later, the whistleblower has by some measures managed to exceed what [Mueller] accomplished in two years of investigating Trump: producing a file so concerning and factually sound that it has almost single-handedly set in motion the gears of impeachment. ‘In the course of my official duties,’ the whistleblower writes in the first sentence of his complaint, he learned that ‘the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.’”

-- The White House learned that a CIA officer had lodged allegations about Trump’s call even as the officer’s whistleblower complaint was moving through a process meant to protect him against reprisals, the New York Times reports: “The officer first shared information about potential abuse of power and a White House cover-up with the C.I.A.’s top lawyer through an anonymous process … The lawyer shared the officer’s concerns with White House and Justice Department officials, following policy. … But as White House, C.I.A. and Justice Department officials were examining the accusations, the C.I.A. officer who had lodged them anonymously grew concerned after learning that [CIA general counsel Courtney Simmons Elwood] had contacted the White House … While it is not clear how the officer became aware that Ms. Elwood had shared the information, he concluded that the C.I.A. was not taking his allegations seriously.”

“The whistle-blower was detailed to work at the White House at one point, according to three people familiar with his identity, and has since returned to the C.I.A.,” per Julian Barnes, Michael Schmidt, Adam Goldman and Katie Benner in the Times. “His complaint suggested he was an analyst by training and made clear he was steeped in details of American foreign policy toward Europe, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of Ukrainian politics and at least some knowledge of the law.”

-- The AP also reports that White House and the Justice Department learned about a CIA officer’s concerns about Trump “around the same time the individual filed a whistleblower complaint.” Eric Tucker, Michael Balsamo and Zeke Miller say that information about the whistleblower was already making its way through the administration:

“On Aug. 14, White House counsel John Eisenberg and a CIA official alerted the head of DOJ’s national security division about the original complaint to the CIA. John Demers, who leads the national security division, went to the White House the next day to review materials associated with the call. He then alerted people within the Justice Department, but it was unclear specifically who he told. In the following weeks, Demers had discussions with other Justice Department officials about how to handle the CIA complaint, according to the person familiar with the matter. It was during that period that the Justice Department also received a notification from the intelligence community’s inspector general about a whistleblower complaint.”

-- Responding to reader criticism, Times executive editor Dean Baquet defended their decision to publish information about the whistleblower and noted that the White House already knew he was a CIA officer. “We decided to publish limited information about the whistle-blower — including the fact that he works for a nonpolitical agency and that his complaint is based on an intimate knowledge and understanding of the White House — because we wanted to provide information to readers that allows them to make their own judgments about whether or not he is credible,” Baquet wrote. “The role of the whistle-blower, including his credibility and his place in the government, is essential to understanding one of the most important issues facing the country — whether the president of the U.S. abused power and whether the W.H. covered it up.”

-- The whistleblower emphasized in the complaint that he was not the only one worried. “The White House officials who told me this information were deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call,” he wrote in his complaint. “They told me there was already a ‘discussion ongoing’ with White House lawyers about how to treat the call because of the likelihood, in the officials’ retelling, that they had witnessed the President abuse his office for personal gain.”

NEW DETAILS ON WHAT RUDY WAS UP TO:

-- Giuliani spent months cultivating relationships with five current and former prosecutors in Ukraine to achieve a particular goal: Helping Trump win next year’s election by pursuing allegations damaging to his Democratic rivals. Paul Sonne, Michael Birnbaum, Rosalind S. Helderman and Josh Dawsey report: “Giuliani decried any scrutiny of his conduct in a long interview Thursday, saying that more attention was finally being paid to the Biden family. ... During those meetings, he said, he obtained information about Hunter Biden and what the former New York mayor has alleged was collusion between Democrats and Ukraine in the 2016 election. … Some of the Ukrainians Giuliani and his associates interacted with were banned from entering the United States. Giuliani blamed the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine for blocking the officials from coming to the United States to give him more information. … A former Ukrainian prosecutor said he believed the officials were angling to provide Giuliani with compromising information at least partly to advance their own careers — and win U.S. backing for their position within the often rough-and-tumble world of Ukrainian politics.”

-- A former top Ukraine prosecutor, whose allegations were at the heart of Giuliani’s dirt-digging effort, said Hunter Biden “did not violate anything.” Michael Birnbaum, David L. Stern and Natalie Gryvnyak report: “‘From the perspective of Ukrainian legislation, he did not violate anything,’ former Ukrainian prosecutor general Yuri Lutsenko told The Washington Post in his first interview since the disclosure of [the whistleblower's complaint] … ‘Hunter Biden cannot be responsible for violations of the management of Burisma that took place two years before his arrival,’ Lutsenko said. Lutsenko had earlier cast doubt on Hunter Biden’s actions in Ukraine, an effort that drew Giuliani’s notice last year. Lutsenko said that Giuliani tried to arrange a meeting with him two times before they finally managed to connect on the third try in January, ‘I took a vacation. I took my youngest son, I showed him New York and I met with Mr. Giuliani,’ Lutsenko said. ‘I had a long conversation with him. But this was only in the forum of exchanging information.’

""Lutsenko met with Giuliani again in Warsaw in mid-February, then for a third and final time ‘in Europe,’ he said, refusing to be more specific. Lutsenko did not fully explain the change of heart in May when he gave an interview to Bloomberg in which he said he believed Hunter Biden had not broken any Ukrainian laws. But Lutsenko said that if U.S. authorities were separately interested in Hunter Biden’s financial arrangements in Ukraine, Ukrainian law enforcement officials would be happy to comply.”

-- One of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky's political rivals in Kiev is demanding that he release the government's transcript of the call, as Zelensky finds himself in hot water across Europe for his criticisms of the French and Germans. Siobhán O’Grady and Rick Noack report: “In a Facebook post, [Ukrainian opposition lawmaker Oleksiy Goncharenko] called it ‘strange that the [Ukrainian] President’s Office did not publish this transcript simultaneously with the White House.’ … [In the call, Zelensky] praised Trump and went on to say he met both German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron and told them: ‘They are not working as much as they should work for Ukraine.’ Those comments were not well received in Europe. ‘To say that I consider this to be incomprehensible would perhaps be a mild way to put it,’ [said] Elmar Brok, who was recently appointed special adviser on Ukraine for outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.”

-- Conservative columnist John Solomon, executive vice president of the Hill newspaper, helped craft the flawed Ukraine narrative that would later be echoed by Trump, his son Don Jr., and Giuliani. Paul Farhi reports: “Back in March, the Hill newspaper published a series of stories and interviews that seemed, at the time, to be mainly of interest to foreign-policy wonks. [Solomon] interviewed Ukraine’s then-top prosecutor, [Lutsenko], who alleged a startling conspiracy: that law enforcement officials within his country had leaked damaging information in 2016 against Paul Manafort ... to help ... Clinton’s presidential campaign. … The story touched off a brushfire within the conservative media, in which Solomon is a prominent figure, but stayed largely out of mainstream view. On Thursday, however, Solomon’s work gained new attention — and raised new questions about its sourcing, credibility and motivation. In [the whistleblower's complaint], Solomon’s stories were cited as part of a narrative about the alleged effort by Trump and his allies to pressure Ukraine’s government into digging up dirt on Trump’s Democratic rivals.”

-- Trump appears to be counting on confusion over the complex Ukraine story to offer a fog of false claims and allegations to make it appear Joe Biden did something wrong. The Post’s Fact Checker team published a short guide this morning to Trump’s statements — and the truth.

-- And Philip Bump created a helpful timeline of the significant dates in the whistleblower’s complaint to provide more clarity on how Trump's and Giuliani’s efforts to get dirt on Biden unfolded.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meets Vice President Pence on Sept. 1 in Warsaw. (Petr David Josek/AP)

CASCADING FALLOUT FOR THE WHITE HOUSE:

-- Vice President Pence is trying to dodge the impeachment spotlight, but his Ukraine moves are attracting notice. Toluse Olorunnipa and Ashley Parker report: “Pence did not participate in [the July call] … But Pence’s name has emerged in several other contexts … The whistleblower complaint … said Pence canceled a planned trip to Ukraine at the direction of Trump, who was seeking to pressure the Ukrainians to help him politically. Three people familiar with the matter confirmed that Pence’s attendance had been requested at Zelensky’s inauguration and that his office had looked at dates for a visit to Kiev. … The vice president’s Sept. 1 meeting with Zelensky, and his discussions with Trump, will be key targets for House Democrats … Pence told reporters after the meeting that he had not discussed Biden with Zelensky but said that he had relayed Trump’s ‘great concerns about issues of corruption.’”

-- “The White House has taken extraordinary steps over the past two years to block details of Trump’s phone calls with foreign leaders from becoming public. Josh Dawsey and Carol D. Leonnig report: “The number of aides allowed to listen on secure ‘drop’ lines was slashed. The list of government officials who could review a memo of the call’s contents was culled. Fewer copies of transcripts went to agencies, and they were stamped with ‘EYES ONLY DO NOT COPY.’ And some officials who deliver call memos had to sign for the records to create a custody record if they were to leak … At one point in 2018, Defense Department officials were asked to send back transcripts of calls to the White House after Trump aides grew worried they could be disclosed, according to former senior administration officials. …

“The complaint said the transcript was ‘loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive level.’ According to the whistleblower, ‘one White House official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.’ … The July 25 call had roughly 12 to 13 people listening in. … Once the call concluded and copies were distributed to top officials in the White House, lawyers in the White House Counsel’s Office then directed that the document be moved to a code-word-protected secure computer network that is normally reserved for transcripts that contain national security secrets after officials raised concerns about Trump’s comments, according to the complaint.”

-- Lost in the controversy over Trump’s phone call is Zelensky's effort to curry favor with the president through his private business. Jonathan O’Connell and David Fahrenthold report: “‘Actually, last time I traveled to the United States, I stayed in New York near Central Park, and I stayed at the Trump Tower,’ Zelensky told Trump [according to the transcript of their July 25 call] ... Zelensky’s comments mark the first known example of an interaction Democrats and government ethics experts warned about when Trump took office: that foreign leaders would try to influence Trump by spending money at his properties and telling him abut it. … It remains unclear whether the stays were illegal. Zelensky may not have entered office at the time of his stay at Trump International Tower, overlooking Central Park in New York.""

THE POLITICS OF IMPEACHMENT:

-- House Democratic leaders are eyeing a fast-paced impeachment investigation that could lead to a vote around Thanksgiving. Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade report: “Multiple Democratic lawmakers and congressional aides said there is no formal timeline for the inquiry, but the ‘need for speed,’ as one aide put it, comes as [Pelosi] is under pressure from vulnerable freshmen to keep the investigation narrowly focused and disciplined. … Pelosi and other leaders huddled in a basement conference room Thursday evening with more than a dozen ‘front-line’ members representing the toughest districts for incumbent Democrats to discuss the fledgling probe and, in the words of multiple attendees, ‘get on the same page.’ Inside the room, the group urged the leadership to keep the messaging around impeachment on national security and the Ukraine probe being led by the House Intelligence Committee…

“Some senior Democrats are even arguing that other committees should forgo potentially explosive hearings that could distract from the intelligence panel’s work … ‘Very few hearings, if any,’ said a senior Democratic aide, who said the coming investigative work will largely take place in closed-door interviews. … But many of the moderate freshmen do not want to be seen as rushing to conclusions — whether on the Ukraine probe or any other aspect of potential presidential wrongdoing. … A senior Democratic aide familiar with discussions among the party’s moderate wing relayed concerns that a probe seen as moving too rapidly by the public could backfire. …

“One of the first credible polls to test the Democratic impeachment push following Pelosi’s Tuesday announcement found the public almost evenly split. An NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist Poll conducted Wednesday found Americans approving 49 percent to 46 percent of the House inquiry, with independents disapproving 50 percent to 44 percent.""

-- Pelosi explained to the New Yorker that impeaching Trump for “bad behavior” isn’t worth it. The difference now is the president, she contends, is undermining democracy and the electoral system. David Remnick writes up his interview: “When I asked Pelosi if she thought Trump knows, in this instance or any other, the difference between right and wrong, she replied, ‘He knows the difference between right and wrong, but I don’t know that he really cares. I do think his categorical imperative is what’s good is what is right for him. In the campaign, he told us who he was. He said that he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and nobody would care, that his supporters wouldn’t care. Well, he could violate our Constitution, the integrity of our elections, and dishonor his oath of office, as he did in this call, and think that nobody cares.’”

-- She’s back: Hillary Clinton is doing a media tour to express support for impeachment, starting with CBS and continuing with additional TV sit-downs next week. The former secretary of state called the man who beat her in 2016 a “corrupt human tornado” and an “illegitimate president.” HRC’s appearances probably aren’t helpful to the Democratic cause and make it look like they’re trying to relitigate the 2016 campaign.

-- Trump is writing the Republican playbook on impeachment, and he’s going with a scorched-earth strategy. Will it work? Robert Costa and Philip Rucker report: “Trump has acted impulsively and indignantly as he wages an all-out political war to defend himself from allegations that he abused his power to solicit foreign interference in his 2020 reelection bid. And in a testament to how completely he controls the Republican Party, many GOP officeholders and conservative media figures have followed Trump’s cues by joining his attempts either to attack the anonymous whistleblower, discredit the explosive accounts in their complaint, or malign the media for covering it. … Trump’s advisers said they envision a ‘split screen’ strategy in the coming weeks. The president is considering stepping up his fall schedule of campaign rallies at arenas across the country to galvanize his supporters outside of Washington and portray House Democrats as liberal insiders who are focused on impeachment instead of governing.”

-- Politico co-founder John Harris, who covered Bill Clinton’s impeachment for The Post, remembers that impeachment proceedings used to be news of unquestionable gravity: “The week showed it's just more fodder for the ideological and culture wars.”

THE (FEW) REPUBLICAN DEFECTIONS:

-- Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker endorsed an impeachment inquiry of Trump, joining fellow Republican governor Phil Scott of Vermont. ""It’s a deeply disturbing situation and circumstance and I think the proper role and responsibility for Congress at this point is to investigate it and get to the bottom of it,” Baker told reporters in the Bay State. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan’s office did not respond to requests for comment, per Reis Thebault.

-- Former Republican senator Jeff Flake said “at least 35” GOP senators would privately vote for Trump’s impeachment. The Arizonan, speaking at the Texas Tribune Festival, was responding to veteran Republican political consultant Mike Murphy's suggestion on MSNBC that 30 Republican senators would vote to impeach Trump if it was “a secret vote.” “That’s not true,” Flake said in Texas. “There would be at least 35.” (Fox News)

-- The president's leading advisers are concerned about the ""threat"" posed by Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and are ""trying to isolate him,"" Jonathan Martin reports in the Times: ""Mr. Romney’s public statements reflect what many in his party believe privately but are almost uniformly unwilling to say: that they are faced with damning revelations about the president that are difficult to explain away, and are unsure of whether there is more damaging material to come. … To Mr. Romney, who represents a state where he is beloved and is unlikely to seek another office, it is a moment where he believes country should trump party. ‘Each person should search their own heart and do what they think is right, which is just what I do,’ he said. … Mr. Romney said he was not attempting to steer a party he believes is overwhelmingly in Mr. Trump’s grip. But as Mr. Romney contemplates what he acknowledges will likely be his last period of public service, his friends say he is appalled by what he sees as the president’s win-at-all-costs immorality and his party’s willingness to remain quiet in the face of such misconduct.”

-- “Because Trump tests boundaries of morality and legality, his defenders are, in effect, calling on Americans to ratify those changes,” writes Michael Gerson, who served as chief speechwriter in George W. Bush’s White House. “By all the evidence, Trump believes that politics, stripped of pretense, is the dirty, unethical pursuit of power, which is properly used to destroy your enemies. Republicans who defend or excuse him are providing permission for his radical redesign of public life. This is perhaps the saddest result of Trump’s corruption: turning good men and women into the bodyguards of a petty, cruel, lawless, would-be autocrat. Because Trump has chosen to be transparently corrupt, congressional Republicans cannot dispute the facts of the case (as they did during [Mueller’s] investigation). They may still insist: No quid pro quo. But this is more of a rally chant than an argument.”

Gerson, a Trump critic, believes impeachment has become inevitable: “Impeachment may be inadvisable. It may apply a cheese grater to the nation’s partisan wounds. The process may be conducted foolishly. It may feed a Republican thirst for revenge against a future Democratic president. It may motivate Trump’s base to salivating enthusiasm. The broad, American middle may yawn and switch to ESPN. All of this matters, especially if it increases the chances of Trump’s reelection. But it matters like a fate, not like a choice.”

A RANGE OF VOICES FROM THE POST'S OPINION PAGE:

-- The whistleblower complaint strengthens the case that Trump offered Ukraine’s president a quid pro quo, inveighs the Editorial Board.

-- We sent aid to Ukraine to help it fend off Russia's ongoing occupation. By holding back American support, Trump helped Putin, writes Evelyn Farkas, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense during the Obama administration.

-- Trump’s impeachment need not be a long, drawn-out affair, writes liberal Eugene Robinson: “The nation has suffered this small, foolish, dangerous man long enough. Pelosi should damn the torpedoes and move full speed ahead.”

-- The whistleblower complaint doesn’t do the Democrats any favors, argues conservative Henry Olsen: “It offers little new information not already in the public domain. Furthermore, if it continues to be relied upon as evidence justifying impeachment, Democrats will have to make some hard choices about how to proceed.”

-- Democrats are sprinting ahead of the evidence, adds conservative Marc Thiessen, another former Bush speechwriter.

­-- The whistleblower and the vulnerable Democratic freshmen who backed an impeachment inquiry are profiles in courage, writes conservative Max Boot: “This week reminds us that there are some people in Washington who are not motivated solely by self-interest — that there are actually a few people in positions of public responsibility who care about the Constitution and are willing to run considerable risks to protect it.”

-- Americans have already seen enough for three articles of impeachment, argues Jennifer Rubin, a lawyer by training.

-- As alarming as the allegations are against Trump, impeachment is still not required, writes Princeton University professor Keith Whittington: “The House would not necessarily be failing to do its ‘constitutional duty’ if it did not pass articles of impeachment.”

THE DOMESTIC AGENDA:

-- The Trump administration slashed the number of refugees who will be admitted to the U.S. next year to a historic low of 18,000. David Nakamura, Maria Sacchetti and Seung Min Kim report: “The new limit represents a 40 percent drop from the 2019 cap and marks the third consecutive year that the administration has slashed the program since the United States admitted nearly 85,000 refugees in President Barack Obama’s final year in office. In addition, the Trump administration announced an executive order aimed at allowing local jurisdictions more leeway in rejecting refugees who are being resettled across the country, although experts said such powers are less relevant at a time when the number of refugees being admitted has dwindled sharply.""

A breakdown of who is being let in: ""Under the plan for fiscal 2020, which begins Oct. 1, the administration would allocate 5,000 refugee slots to people fleeing for religious reasons, 4,000 for Iraqis who assisted the United States and fall under the Refugee Crisis in Iraq Act of 2007, and 1,500 for nationals of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, according to senior administration officials. Another 7,500 slots would go to refugees not covered by these categories, including those referred to the program by U.S. embassies. Last year’s cap of 30,000 divided slots by region, including 11,000 refugees from Africa, the largest group, administration officials said. Latin America and the Caribbean had 3,000 slots last year.”

-- Matthew Albence, acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, once again took aim at “sanctuary cities” that refuse to help the feds deport undocumented immigrants. This time, he did so from the podium in the White House briefing room. Maria Sacchetti reports: “Albence criticized jurisdictions in several states after the agency arrested nearly 1,300 migrants during the past week via Operation Cross Check, a recurring immigration roundup of people convicted of crimes that include murder, manslaughter and child abuse. Nearly 200 of those arrested could have been taken into custody in a state prison or a local jail, he said. Instead, they were released after posting bail or at the end of their sentences, forcing ICE agents to track them down. … Albence was flanked by sheriffs from Texas, North Dakota and other states where Trump enjoys broad support.”

-- Organizations challenging Trump’s attempt to end protections for the Dreamers picked Ted Olson, a former Republican solicitor general and lawyer long associated with conservative causes, to argue their case before the Supreme Court. The choice might’ve been more surprising had Olson not played a similar role in the legal battle for same-sex marriage. (Robert Barnes)

­-- An undocumented man was killed when cops went to the wrong house in Southaven, Miss. Now, the city is fighting a civil rights lawsuit by arguing that, because of his immigration status, he wasn’t protected by the U.S. Constitution. Antonia Noori Farzan reports: “Attorneys for the small city near Memphis claim that because [Ismael] Lopez had no ‘legally recognized relationship’ with the United States, he had no rights under the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, or the 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection to all citizens. ‘If he ever had Fourth Amendment or Fourteenth Amendment civil rights, they were lost by his own conduct and misconduct,’ attorney Katherine S. Kerby wrote in a brief filed Sept. 4. ‘Ismael Lopez may have been a person on American soil but he was not one of the ‘We, the People of the United States’ entitled to the civil rights invoked in this lawsuit.’”

-- The Senate passed a stopgap spending bill that will keep the government open through Nov. 21. Erica Werner reports: “The 82-15 vote came days before the Sept. 30 deadline when government funding would expire if Congress didn’t act. The House passed the same measure last week, so the Senate’s passage of the short-term spending bill means it will now go to Trump for his signature. He is expected to sign it. The stopgap bill is aimed at giving lawmakers more time to finalize $1.4 trillion worth of full-year spending bills for fiscal 2020, which ends Sept. 30, 2020.”

-- The Senate also confirmed Eugene Scalia, the son of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, to succeed Alex Acosta as labor secretary. Felicia Sonmez and Eli Rosenberg report: “Scalia was confirmed Thursday on a 53-to-44 vote. Democrats have argued that Scalia’s record as a corporate lawyer has shown him to be ‘anti-worker.’ In remarks on the Senate floor Thursday morning, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) contended that Scalia fought to protect the interests of chief executives and the wealthy elite and opposed worker protections throughout his career, describing his nomination by Trump as a ‘disgrace.’”

-- And the Senate overwhelmingly confirmed Trump’s pick to become the second-highest-ranking military officer after a bruising nomination fight centering on allegations of sexual assault from a former aide. Missy Ryan and Karoun Demirjian report: “Senators voted 75 to 22 to confirm Air Force Gen. John E. Hyten, who has headed U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM), as the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) was the lone Republican to vote against Hyten, while all Democratic senators running for president either voted against him or were absent, save Michael F. Bennet of Colorado. Bennet voted in favor.”

-- The U.S. military’s suicide rate for active-duty troops has climbed over the past five years, a Pentagon report reveals. Dan Lamothe reports: “Some 541 service members died by suicide in 2018, including 325 active-duty troops, the report said. The active-duty suicide rate was about 24.8 per 100,000 service members, up from 21.9 in 2017 and 18.7 in 2013. … Service members who die by suicide continue to be mostly male, white and under the age of 30, said Karin Orvis, director of the Pentagon’s defense suicide prevention office. The Army and Marine Corps, the services with the highest suicide rates, also have the greatest percentage of men.”

-- Trump’s pick to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives faces growing Republican concerns over his commitment to gun rights. From the Journal: “Failing to confirm [Chuck] Canterbury would leave the ATF without a permanent, politically appointed director at a time when the law enforcement agency is at the forefront of the Trump administration’s fight against violent crime and as the White House and Congress continue to negotiate gun-control measures after several mass shootings in recent months. … Mr. Canterbury tangled in his July confirmation hearing with Republican senators who were frustrated that he wouldn’t clearly define his views on gun-control measures such as expanding background checks for prospective buyers and a ban on assault rifles. He was head of the FOP when it took positions supporting more-rigorous gun-control measures including an expansion of background checks. But he wouldn’t immediately say what stance he would take if confirmed to the ATF, only that he would consult with other Justice Department officials.”

-- The Environmental Protection Agency formally told California it is “failing to meet its obligations” to protect the environment. Juliet Eilperin, Brady Dennis and Josh Dawsey report: “Days after President Trump mocked Los Angeles and other big cities for their ‘tremendous pollution,’ EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler sent an oversight letter charging California officials with failing to meet federal health standards in numerous communities where large homeless populations litter the streets with trash, drug paraphernalia and human waste. … California has long led the nation in demanding stricter limits on pollution linked to climate change. Now, the Trump administration is arguing that the state’s focus on global warming has come at the expense of more basic environmental protections.”

-- Seeking to fill the void created by Trump's inaction, six U.S. governors gathered in Manhattan on the sidelines of the U.N. meeting to confer with presidents, prime ministers and other foreign leaders to press for action on climate change. Carol Morello reports: “The governors in the group, most of them Democrats, insist they are not conducting a form of shadow diplomacy. They say neither the White House nor the State Department, which typically conducts talks with foreign governments, has tried to deter their efforts. Their mission is to assure other countries that many of America’s leaders are still engaged in combating climate change, even if the United States formally drops out of the Paris agreement next year. ‘Every party looking at this should know there is still intelligent life in the United States taking action on climate change,’ Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), a co-founder of the Climate Alliance, said in a back-seat interview en route to a meeting with officials from the European Union. ‘It’s important to give the world confidence of movement, of dynamic actions being taken in America. And it’s succeeded. Not a single country has left the agreement. No one has followed Donald Trump over the cliff.’”

-- A federal judge denied a request by the news media to unseal grand jury records cited in the Mueller report. Spencer S. Hsu reports: “Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell of the District of Columbia said she was bound by the ruling, McKeever v. Barr, and that the petitioning party, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, did not qualify for other exceptions to grand jury secrecy rules.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Joe Biden’s advisers are weighing the introduction of a new tax on Wall Street now that the former vice president stands alone among the Democratic presidential front-runners in not backing a “wealth tax” on the richest Americans. Jeff Stein reports: “The plan under consideration from Biden’s advisers could tax financial transactions such as the sale of stocks and bonds ... Tax experts said Biden’s embrace of that idea would mark just how much more aggressive Democrats are now willing to be on taxes.”

-- Some anxious Biden supporters want him to embrace a super PAC. From the Times: “Several former staffers of Mr. Biden and political donors backing his candidacy have held conversations in recent weeks about moving ahead with a super PAC, and said Mr. Trump’s furious, and often unsubstantiated, allegations about the former vice president had convinced them it was imperative they act. ‘For me, this week puts everything into stark relief,’ said Larry Rasky, a former aide to Mr. Biden who is now a political fund-raiser and public relations executive. ‘And I was already thinking the campaign was being a little naïve about the resources we’d need to fight this.’”

-- Democratic donors from Wall Street are threatening to back Trump or sit out the 2020 campaign if Elizabeth Warren wins the nomination. From CNBC: “‘You’re in a box because you’re a Democrat and you’re thinking, ‘I want to help the party, but she’s going to hurt me, so I’m going to help President Trump,’’ said a senior private equity executive ... Some big bank executives and hedge fund managers have been stunned by Warren’s ascent, and they are primed to resist her. ‘They will not support her. It would be like shutting down their industry,’ an executive at one of the nation’s largest banks told CNBC, also speaking on condition of anonymity.”

-- White, college-educated voters are driving Warren's rise in the polls. Eugene Scott reports: “The lawmaker’s support grew from 25 percent in late August to 37 percent in late September with white college-educated voters, an influential group that largely voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.”

-- In a fundraising email, Julián Castro warned that his campaign will be over is he doesn’t qualify for the November debate. From the Texas Tribune: “The email sought donations for ads to help him reach the new polling threshold: 3% in four national polls or 5% in two surveys from the first four early voting states. Castro has already met the donor requirement of 165,000 individuals but hasn't met the polling requirement — or even come close.”

-- Sen. Kamala Harris, the former attorney general of California, said Giuliani should probably be disbarred. “We need to know if the personal lawyer of the president, Giuliani, was using government resources for political gain,” the Democratic presidential candidate told CNN’s Anderson Cooper. “And frankly, if there were any members of the State Department who were facilitating Rudy Giuliani’s private conversations on behalf of the president, there should be accountability and consequence for that.” (Politico)

-- Former congressman Darrell Issa is launching a primary challenge to embattled Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.), who faces an impending trial for using campaign funds to help facilitate several extramarital affairs. (John Wagner)

-- Former Health and Human Services secretary Tom Price, who resigned in disgrace, threw his hat in the ring to take over retiring Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson’s Georgia seat. From ABC News: “According to the Georgia governor's office, Price submitted his resume to be considered for replacing Isakson, who announced in August that he is resigning from his post in December due to various health issues. Isakson, 74, won a six-year term in 2016 and his term is due to end in 2022.”

-- A U.S. attorney whose office investigated interference in the 2018 midterm elections said he is certain Russia will try to meddle in the upcoming presidential race. Rachel Weiner reports: “‘They’re going to do the same thing,’ G. Zachary Terwilliger said Thursday afternoon at an event at George Mason University’s National Security Institute. ‘They’re going to do it. In an open setting like this there’s not a lot I can get into, but I think it wouldn’t be irresponsible for me to say they’re definitely going to try.’ … Terwilliger said he had heard from an administration official that ‘their big concern is deepfakes,’ or doctored images and videos. But he said he was also worried about the ‘actual physical infrastructure’ of election machines, while cautioning that the issue was outside his purview.""

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- The Pentagon authorized a modest air defense boost for Saudi Arabia after the attack on the kingdom’s oil industry. Missy Ryan and Dan Lamothe report: “Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper’s decision to authorize the deployment of an additional battery of Patriot missiles and four Sentinel radar systems, accompanied by 200 American troops, to shore up a key ally is a modest step that represents the administration’s desire, at least for now, to avoid additional escalation in U.S.-Iranian tensions. … Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said the deployment would ‘augment the kingdom’s air and missile defense of critical military and civilian infrastructure.’ ‘These steps are a demonstration of our commitment to regional partners, and the security and stability in the Middle East,’ he said in a statement.”

-- Iraq is trying to rein in its Iran-aligned militias as tensions boil in the Persian Gulf. Louisa Loveluck and Mustafa Salim report: “Iraqi officials are worried that their country could get sucked into the conflict, with concerns spiking after a May 14 drone strike on a pipeline in neighboring Saudi Arabia. The officials were embarrassed to learn that the attack had not come from Iran-backed rebels in Yemen, who had claimed responsibility for the strike, but from Iraqi territory, said lawmakers and Western officials who described the fallout. ‘The prime minister was very angry,’ said one lawmaker. … Iraqi lawmakers fear that attacks launched from their soil would not only inflame regional tensions but could provoke reprisals against targets inside their country, drawing Iraq into another ruinous conflict.”

-- Syrian government forces carried out a chlorine attack in May, a U.S. intelligence assessment found. From the Journal: “The episode took place on May 19 near the village of Kabana as President Bashar al-Assad’s forces sought to subdue resistance in Latakia province, a senior U.S. official said. … At least four people were wounded in the rocket strike, which was alleged at the time by the Syrian opposition but took months for U.S. intelligence to confirm. The Syrian government has denied the attack.”

-- The fiancée of Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi is demanding that Saudi Arabia be held accountable for his murder. Oct. 2 is the anniversary of his death. Hatice Cengiz spoke with NBC News on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly: ""His fellow journalists did their best that so no one could push this under the carpet,’ she said. ""Saudi Arabia was put under massive pressure, thanks to international media coverage … But at the end of the day, all of these efforts did not persuade world leaders to sanction Saudi Arabia. That is so sad.""

-- Trump’s privately held company, seeking to revive its money-losing golf course in Scotland, secured approval to build 550 luxury and holiday homes there, as well as a second golf course. Joshua Partlow reports: “The Aberdeenshire Council voted 38 to 24 to allow the Trump Organization’s residential development to move forward despite vocal opposition from many residents who fear it would crowd the roads and schools of their windswept village. By winning the council’s approval, the Trump Organization is poised for one of its most ambitious foreign projects of his presidency. It is also a rescue effort of sorts for Trump’s first golf course in Europe, which has lost money each year since it opened in 2012. … In a sign of its confidence in Wednesday’s vote, the Trump Organization had already begun marketing the homes as part of what it called the Trump Estate, with some homes priced at more than $1.5 million.”

-- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is facing extensive backlash after delivering a bombastic performance upon his return to Parliament. Karla Adam and William Booth report: “The widower of a murdered lawmaker and the sister of the prime minister joined a chorus of voices on Thursday saying [Johnson] has stepped over a line with his rhetoric in the debate over Brexit. But Johnson was refusing to change course on his language or his strategy. … Johnson drew particular fury over his remarks about Jo Cox, a Labour lawmaker and Brexit opponent who was murdered days before a June 2016 referendum by a far-right domestic terrorist who yelled ‘Britain first!’ before shooting and stabbing her to death. … Johnson [said] that the best way to honor Cox’s memory would be to ‘get Brexit done.’ … Rachel Johnson, the prime minister’s sister, an author and politician who opposes Brexit, called her brother’s remarks ‘tasteless.’”

-- Afghanistan's presidential election is this weekend, and voters are torn between fear, frustration and a sense of duty. From the AP: “The Taliban have relentlessly issued threats against Saturday’s vote. The insurgent group has sent suicide bombers to rallies and election offices, killing dozens and warning they will kill more. ... Afghan officials say security preparations have been elaborate. In an interview with The Associated Press, Minister of Interior Masoud Andarabi outlined an election security plan that he said has been more than eight months in the making. ... Despite the government’s best efforts, 431 polling centers will be closed Saturday because Andarabi, the interior minister, said they were too difficult to secure — either because they were under Taliban control or Taliban could threaten nearby villages.”

-- Concerns about fraud are also running high among the public and observers because it could trigger political chaos. The main challenger to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani warned of dire consequences if the polls are marred by fraud. Pamela Constable and Susannah George report: “Abdullah Abdullah, Afghanistan’s chief executive, did not say what he would do if massive fraud takes place, but he suggested in an interview that it would be up to Ghani to ‘act responsibly.’ ‘The results will not be accepted if there is clear evidence of fraud,” Abdullah said at his residence. ‘The signs are not good. . . . It is not an ideal situation for the country,’ he added, referring to warnings by opposition groups and leaders, including himself, that Ghani and his government will try to rig the polls.”

AD

“He sounds like a criminal,” Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a presidential hopeful, told MSNBC on Thursday night. “'Who snitched? Who gave up the goods? Let’s find out who gave up the goods on us and make sure there’s a consequence and it’s serious, and let that be a lesson to everybody else.'”

AD

She continued: “It sounds like it’s straight out of some bad drama, but the fact is this is the president of the United States.”

Harris was joined by fellow Democratic candidates Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke, and former housing and urban development secretary Julián Castro, who suggested that Trump’s comments could endanger the lives of the whistleblower and anyone else who aided in the complaint. Trump was also rebuked by some Republicans, including former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh and former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, who are challenging the president for the GOP nomination, and Rep. Will Hurd (R-Tex.).

AD

In a joint statement, the chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform Committees argued that Trump’s remarks amounted to “reprehensible witness intimidation and an attempt to obstruct Congress’ impeachment inquiry.”

AD

“We condemn the President’s attacks, and we invite our Republican counterparts to do the same because Congress must do all it can to protect this whistleblower, and all whistleblowers,” said the statement from Reps. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.). “Threats of violence from the leader of our country have a chilling effect on the entire whistleblower process, with grave consequences for our democracy and national security.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment early Friday.

AD

Trump’s statements came after the House released a nine-page version of the whistleblower’s complaint. According to the complaint and a rough transcript of a July 25 phone call, Trump repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political opponent, former vice president Joe Biden, offering assistance from the Justice Department and raising the possibility of a White House sit-down. The call took place after Trump had halted almost $400 million in military aid to Ukraine.

AD

As Democrats speed up their impeachment investigation, Trump and other Republican leaders have continued to attack the credibility of the whistleblower and the complaint, highlighting that many of the allegations rely on secondhand information from other U.S. officials.

Thursday’s private event, which was closed to the press, was intended to honor the staff and families of the U.S. delegation, but Trump took it as an opportunity to grouse about his enemies. During his speech, the president again went after Biden, the “crooked” media and the whistleblower’s complaint.

AD

“Basically that person never saw the report, never saw the call,” Trump said of the whistleblower on Thursday. “Heard something, and decided that he or she or whoever the hell it is — sort of like, almost, a spy.”

Then, the president appeared to suggest that the whistleblower and whoever may have supplied the person with information about the Ukraine call had behaved like spies. Trump also mentioned treason, which in the past has been punished by death.

AD

In an interview with MSNBC on Thursday, Booker said Trump sounded “more like a threatening thug than giving forth the ideals of a statesman” and accused the president of using rhetoric that “gives license to people to do dangerous things.”

AD

“It’s not surprising that Donald Trump doesn’t know the difference between patriotism and treason,” the New Jersey senator said. “If there’s any treasonous actions here, it is coming from the White House.”

Castro, who also appeared on MSNBC, called the president a “dictator.” In Castro’s view, Trump had suggested that the whistleblower “should basically be killed.”

Meanwhile, other presidential candidates took aim at Trump on Twitter, echoing criticisms that his comment constituted a threat.

“This is wrong and this is un-American,” Walsh tweeted about Trump’s attacks on the whistleblower. “And Congressional Republicans say nothing. Shameful. History is watching.”

Several politicians also defended the whistleblower, with some referencing federal laws protecting those who expose wrongdoing. There are specific guidelines for whistleblowers in the intelligence community, who are protected from retaliation so long as they follow proper protocol when submitting complaints.

“This person is not a spy,” Hurd said at an event in Austin on Thursday night, according to the Dallas Morning News. “Let me say that very clearly. This is clearly somebody who knew the consequences of what he or she was doing … and they shared it through the right mechanism.”

Harris expressed concerns that Trump was failing to uphold the law and respect the system created for whistleblowers.

“It should be the president of the United States, above all, who says that we welcome and will always protect people who are fighting for the integrity of our democracy,” she said on MSNBC.

In a video shared on Twitter, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) thanked the whistleblower for “an extraordinary act of courage.”

“Trump has used the word treasonous to describe this whistleblower,” Sanders said. “Well, let me tell you what I think treasonous activity is. It is a president who is trying to undermine the Constitution of the United States and a president who thinks he is above the law.”

In a surprise development that broke from its past precedent of limiting presidential debate fields to ten candidates on any one night, the Democratic National Committee has indicated that all 12 qualifiers for the next debate will on a single stage on October 15. Debate sponsor CNN had the story:

“To address several inquiries we have received we are writing to let you know that, pending a final decision after the certification deadline, it is the intention of the DNC and our media partners to hold the October debate over one night on Tuesday October 15th,” the DNC wrote in an email Friday morning.

The party’s fourth sanctioned primary debate will air live at 8 p.m. ET from the campus of Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, with CNN anchors Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooperand New York Times national editor Marc Lacey serving as moderators.

The October debate will include the ten September debaters (Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julián Castro, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O’Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Andrew Yang) plus two more recent qualifiers (Tulsi Gabbard and Tom Steyer). The qualifying window doesn’t end until Tuesday, October 1, but no other candidates are thought to be anywhere near making the combined polling and fundraising thresholds. It’s always possible some qualifiers will free up stage space by dropping out of the race before October 15, but it’s unlikely any will give up the free exposure and the long-shot possibility of a breakthrough performance that rallies the nation to her or his banner.

On the one hand, this means we can stop worrying about debate-night “draws” skewing the interaction by placing potentially colliding candidates on different nights. But there will be even more jockeying for time and attention than in earlier debates — and perhaps more clash since higher qualifying thresholds kick in for the November and subsequent debates.

Most excited by the one-night decision will be campaign operatives and journalists who won’t have to work really late on two consecutive weeknights. Here’s the viewing details for those who want to rev their engines and savor the anticipation:

The debate will air exclusively on CNN, CNN International, CNN en Español, and stream on CNN.com’s homepage and NYTimes.com’s homepage. In addition, the debate will be available across mobile devices via CNN’s and New York Times’ apps for iOS and Android, via CNNgo apps for Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Chromecast and Android TV, SiriusXM Channels 116, 454, 795, the Westwood One Radio Network and National Public Radio.

This is CNN’s second bite at the debate apple; it hosted the July debates as well.

Update, October 1: it’s official: the twelve candidate mentioned above are the qualifiers for the October 15 debate."

The closing days of a fundraising quarter are usually hectic for presidential candidates and their top-level staffers, who are tasked with pulling in every last dime they can find and figuring out what to do with the cash. This week — punctuated by the lightning-fast ramp-up of an official impeachment inquiry into the president — was different. By Tuesday, when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi formally announced the move, it was clear to aides of most of the 18 at-least-semi-serious remaining Democratic campaigns that, with the country’s attention squarely on Capitol Hill and the White House, they’d suddenly fallen further off the national radar than ever before. By Thursday, that attention was even more intensely focused, and a handful of campaign operatives began ringing internal alarm bells so loudly that their candidates had no choice but to start reckoning with the painful reality that no one cares about them right now. By the end of the week, in campaign offices scattered across the country, senior-level operatives finally sat down in small groups to discuss what the path forward now looks like for their campaigns — or, in some cases, whether they have realistic ones at all. A senior aide to one campaign described his team’s Friday gathering as “a ‘we’re fucked, what do we do?’ meeting.”

The big-picture strategic concern for every campaign now is that no one has any clue how long the impeachment process will take, what kind of attention it will command, or which way its politics will break. (See: Joe Biden’s team using Donald Trump’s lashing out as evidence of Biden’s electability — proving the president is most worried about the former vice-president in the general election — while much of the rest of the field quietly bets that the deluge of news about his son will sink Biden.) But the more immediate problem for almost everyone in the still-massive field not named Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, or Pete Buttigieg is money. Specifically, having enough of it to maintain real campaigns for the next few months.

That’s because impeachment, for this crowd, couldn’t have come at a more delicate time: the end of the final quarter before most pols believe the race gets serious, and therefore the exact moment they were banking on generating as much coverage and attention as possible, to raise as much money as possible — to keep afloat for as long as possible, or to finally make much-needed campaign hires and investments just as voters start paying serious attention. Take Cory Booker, whose campaign manager, Addisu Demissie, circulated a memo last Saturday morning ringing his own alarm. He wrote that if the senator didn’t raise $1.7 million in the final ten days of the quarter — which ends with September, on Monday — he would have to drop out, deprived of a “legitimate long-term path forward,” in Demissie’s words. This show of vulnerability (a classic Booker maneuver, to those who know him best and are used to his attention-grabbing tactics) seemed to work at first: Money poured in, setting him up to hit the stated mark. Other campaigns watched closely for clues as to how to replicate that success, since Demissie had simply stated out loud what a handful of other campaign managers would admit only in private about their finances. But Booker’s fundraising pace slowed as the week progressed, and as the impeachment inquiry comprehensively smothered attention to any other topic, including the Democratic primary and Booker’s push.

Booker may have raised enough in the first few days to survive. But the squeeze is now on.

“The media, prior to this, was already making it a three-to-five person race, and now there’s a solar eclipse of a story that will make it really, really difficult to drive any message,” says Glen Caplin, who was a senior advisor to Kirsten Gillibrand’s campaign. “The entire conversation now is going to be driven around Trump and impeachment, and it’s going to be a real challenge for candidates in the bottom five to get coverage, and even those in the top five to drive it on any given day.”

A senior aide to one candidate still in the race put it a little less delicately: “It sucks, actually. Impeachment’s gonna kill anyone who’s not a senator or in the top five. We’re fucked.”

The likely difficulty for candidates from El Paso to Minneapolis isn’t just an inability to break through in the saturated national media environment, though that is one concern. (“It’s been the most nationalized race I’ve ever seen, driven by nationalized media coverage,” said Caplin, who also worked for Hillary Clinton in 2016.) Instead, it’s the subsequent lack of cash that begets a long-term inability to build up infrastructure in early-voting states and to invest in paid advertising, which a consultant to a middle-tier campaign characterized as the “one way you can break through right now,” since ads aren’t dependent on the news cycle. And that doesn’t just determine whether candidates can make it to the next few debate stages, a necessary hurdle to long-term viability. In fact, “the choices that are going to be on the ballot in February and March are being set now,” said yet another senior aide helping lead a campaign struggling to stay afloat. “The main thing that is determining whether you can participate in that ultimate campaign is finances.”

Some candidates could raise money off their potential involvement in impeachment, most prominently the House members or the senators who could have a vote on Trump’s ultimate fate. (Supporters of Kamala Harris, for one, have been highlighting clips of her past questioning of Attorney General Bill Barr.) But this has, for now, proven an unconvincing pitch for potential supporters, according to people familiar with multiple candidates’ digital fundraising numbers.

So far, candidates are largely playing it safe and keeping their heads down — they’ll answer questions about impeachment when asked, and issue statements, but no campaign has yet reset its messaging to be all about Trump’s corruption or the investigation. Even billionaire Tom Steyer — who rose to national prominence in part by campaigning for Trump’s impeachment, and who doesn’t need to raise money but could use all the attention he can get — unveiled a new global climate plan on Friday, sticking to his pre-impeachment plan. Montana Governor Steve Bullock unveiled a public lands proposal. But as the week closed, some aides for other campaigns considered last-ditch direction changes at their “we’re fucked” meetings. “You basically have two choices: Say outlandish shit about impeachment, or do something so big that people have to pay attention. Hard to do at tier two or below,” said one top strategist for a candidate who will, at least, make the next debate stage.

And, as Julián Castro can attest, distinguishing oneself as especially aggressive on the investigations has little demonstrated upside for lower-tier contenders. The former Housing Secretary was the first candidate to call for Trump’s impeachment in April, but he saw little if any polling bump from it. Warren, on the other hand, jumpstarted her struggling campaign in part by making a similar call after Castro.

The best bet for some such hopefuls, then, might simply be hoping the pace of impeachment news slows, and that this week’s deluge proves atypical. “I’m not sure how long it’s gonna last,” said one strategist for a faltering campaign.

Castro, for one, appears to have a similar wish. And he needs all the help he can get. “I don’t say this lightly,” he wrote to supporters on Thursday. “If I don’t make the next debate stage, it will be the end of my campaign.”"

Are they simply marching, or are they politically engaged more generally? Here’s what I found.

Here’s how I did my research

AD

I collected data from participants at the Climate Strike in D.C. on Sept. 20. A 13-person research team (including me) snaked through the crowd as they lined up at John Marshall Park before they began marching, sampling every fifth person at designated increments to gather a field approximation of a random sample. In total, we collected data from 193 participants at the event, with a response rate of 79 percent.

AD

What we found is consistent with my findings from earlier research on the youth climate movement and on those with experience in what many have called the “resistance”: the broader movement that has been challenging President Trump’s administration and its polices since January 2017. Participants in the Climate Strike were predominantly female. The median age of the crowd was 22 years old. Three-quarters, or 76 percent, of the participants will be eligible to vote in the U.S. 2020 election. And their current levels of civic engagement strongly suggests they will vote.

As part of this survey, we asked participants the following question: “If the 2020 election were held today (no matter whether you are eligible to vote), who would you vote for?” Forty-one percent supported Elizabeth Warren, with by far the largest share. Bernie Sanders came in second with 20 percent of the support. Joe Biden was a distant third with 12 percent.

AD

Most participants in the Climate Strike identified as being on the political left, while 9 percent identified as politically moderate. Interestingly, those who identified themselves as “Very Left” on the political spectrum (24 percent of the crowd) also favored Warren (46 percent) over Sanders (33 percent).

AD

These activists are significantly more engaged in a range of political activities than the general American population: 46 percent reported contacting an elected official in the past year; 46 percent attended a public, town, or school meeting; and 44 percent engaged in consumer activism by boycotting or deliberately buying a certain product for political, ethical, or environmental reasons (“buycotting”).

Many report having been involved with more confrontational forms of political engagement as well. About a third of Climate Strikers, or 32 percent, reported participating in confrontational direct action in the past year.

AD

Given these levels of civic engagement and political experience, expect these new voices to make themselves heard in the upcoming elections. If the election’s outcome is not what they hoped for, don’t be surprised if there's more climate action in the streets. Based on the direct action we saw during ShutDownDC on Monday and Friday, as well as the other civil disobedience that took place around the U.S. this past week, these climate activists are willing to act.

AD

And if peaceful protest and political participation do not work, they still have other options.

7:40 p.m.: Amodei denies supporting impeachment after comments signaling openness to inquiry

Rep. Mark Amodei (R-Nev.) on Friday denied supporting impeachment after signaling openness to an inquiry earlier in the day.

Instead, he said, he agreed with Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto’s (D-Nev.) statement to local media that “we have to follow the facts and figure out what happened here.”

“In no way, shape, or form, did I indicate support for impeachment,” Amodei said in a statement.

AD

Amodei told reporters on a conference call Friday that he was not yet convinced Trump broke the law but said, “Let’s put it through the process and see what happens,” according to the Reno Gazette Journal.

“If it’s proven you were using government agencies to try to put your finger on the scale of an election, then I don’t care who the president is, I don’t think that’s right,” he added.

AD

Amodei said he has reviewed the White House readout of the July phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as well as the whistleblower complaint, and called the documents “something to discuss.”

“No part of my process will be political,” he said. “If you broke the law, there are consequences for that.”

AD

This is the closest a current House Republican has come to supporting the impeachment inquiry. Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), a frequent Trump critic who called for the president’s impeachment before he left the GOP on July 4, also supports the impeachment inquiry. Currently all but 11 Democrats in the House support the decision to move forward with the investigation.

Amodei took issue with the reactions to the Nevada Independent’s report that stated, “Rep. Mark Amodei supports the House’s inquiry into whether President Donald Trump should be impeached, but is withholding judgment on whether Trump has crossed the legal line.”

AD

“Anyone who reads Mr. [Humberto] Sanchez’s article and thinks that somehow there is a vote to convict before the process has played out — as called for by the resolution unanimously supported by everyone concerned — is simply, individual fantasy,” Amodei said in his statement Friday evening.

AD

Jon Ralston, the Independent’s editor, tweeted that he was not surprised media “leapt” on the paper’s story and called Amodei’s pushback “hypersensitivity.”

“Amodei wants the inquiry/investigation/probe to continue before he makes up his mind,” he wrote.

6:35 p.m.: Pelosi tells Democratic colleagues Trump’s actions indicate ‘disregard’ for national security, election integrity and oath of office

The House speaker told Democratic colleagues Friday evening that Trump’s much-scrutinized phone call with Zelensky indicated the president’s “disregard” for national security, the integrity of elections and his oath of office. Facts revealed this week call for an impeachment inquiry, she said.

“I have always said that any decision we make would be based on a review of the facts and the oath that we take,” Pelosi wrote. “I have also said that when the facts warranted it, we would be ready to proceed.”

The speaker lamented a “sad time for our country,” saying, “None of us has come to Congress to impeach a president.”

But Trump’s efforts to use his position to solicit foreign meddling in U.S. elections represent a “profound national security concern” because they put the president’s personal interests before those of the country and its closest partners, Pelosi wrote.

She pointed to the whistleblower complaint that led to public revelations about the phone call and acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire’s testimony that the intelligence community’s most important task is protecting the U.S. election system.

The Republican National Committee announced Friday it is launching a $10 million effort to run television and online ads targeting vulnerable House Democrats over their stance on launching an impeachment inquiry into President Trump.

One TV ad released by the committee attacks Rep. Max Rose (D-N.Y.), who unseated a Republican incumbent in 2018 in a district that voted for Trump in 2016, for siding with “the radicals for endless investigations of President Trump, wasting our tax dollars.”

The RNC has amassed a record-breaking war chest since Trump’s election, with the help of the president’s fundraising prowess.

4:20 p.m.: Top House committees subpoena Secretary of State Pompeo over Ukraine

Leaders of top House committees subpoenaed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Friday for documents related to their investigation into President Trump and his asking Ukraine to investigate a possible 2020 political opponent.

They also alerted Pompeo in a separate letter that they have scheduled depositions beginning next week with five State Department officials, beginning Tuesday with former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie “Masha” Yovanovitch, whom Trump disparaged during his phone conversation with the Ukrainian president in July.

The letters were signed by Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), Oversight Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) and Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.).

“The Committees are investigating the extent to which President Trump jeopardized national security by pressing Ukraine to interfere with our 2020 election and by withholding security assistance provided by Congress to help Ukraine counter Russian aggression,” the chairmen wrote.

Documents requested from Pompeo include a list of any State Department officials involved in the controversial July 25 call between Trump and the Ukrainian president as well as any correspondence since Trump’s inauguration about investigations that refer to Hunter Biden, Burisma Holdings — the natural gas company the former vice president’s son worked for, among others.

In addition to Yovanovitch, the chairmen have scheduled hearings with:

● Kurt Volker, U.S. special representative to Ukraine who met with Rudolph W. Giuliani and agreed to connect him with Andrey Yermak, a top aide to Zelensky.

● George Kent, a career Foreign Service officer, is deputy assistant secretary of state in the European and Eurasian Bureau, overseeing policy toward Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. He served as deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev from 2015 to 2018.

● T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, State Department counselor who was named in the whistleblower complaint as the State official who listened in on the Trump-Zelensky call.

● Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, who Giuliani said he briefed on his conversations with Ukrainians.

3:45 p.m.: Senate Republicans signal they’ll hold a trial if House votes to impeach

If at the end of the impeachment investigation the House votes to impeach President Trump, it will trigger a trial in the Senate to determine whether to convict the president.

Senate Republicans, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), have been critical of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s decision to move forward with impeachment, but no one has suggested that the Senate wouldn’t hold a trial.

“If they impeach, it has to be, we have to have a trial,” said Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.)

Asked if it’s possible that the Senate would seek to change the rules to eliminate a trial, Lankford said, “No one I’ve talked to has even implied to me at all, let’s go change the rules so we don’t have to deal with this.”

“I would not support just walking away saying let’s do a rule change so we don’t do this,” he added.

In March, McConnell told NPR that if the House impeached Trump he’d hold a trial in the Senate, but he hasn’t commented on that since Pelosi announced the inquiry on Tuesday.

“If it were to happen, the Senate has no choice,” McConnell said then. “If the House were to act, the Senate immediately goes into trial.”

When asked if McConnell stands by that, his spokesman Doug Andres said, “I have nothing to add to the Leader’s comments from March.”

3 p.m.: Schiff: ‘It’s going to be a very busy couple of weeks ahead.’

The House Intelligence Committee chairman wouldn’t offer details Friday about next steps for the impeachment inquiry, but he said committee members are going to be busy.

“I don’t want to comment about any specifics, but I can tell you it’s going to be a very busy couple of weeks ahead,” Schiff told reporters. “We’re going to be trying to schedule hearings, witness interviews. We’ll be working on subpoenas and document requests. We’ll be busy.”

If the White House stonewalls, he said, “they’ll just strengthen the case on obstruction.”

Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), who also sits on the Intelligence Committee, suggested a lot of work could get done in the next weeks. “The Speaker’s made it very clear that we are not to let momentum drop in these two weeks,” he said.

Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier (Calif.), another member of the panel, said next steps will include speaking to Rudolph W. Giuliani and the whistleblower as well as other people on the call.

“I think that we are going to want to interview persons that were engaged in what is clearly a scheme. This is not a one-off. This is not just a phone call. This is a scheme that was hatched some time ago, and you can see evidence of it dating back to 2018,” Speier said. “And I want to see us come up with that timeline, because this is a truly corrupt undertaking.”

But Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), asked whether the House will seek other transcripts that could be on the classified server beyond the Ukraine call, said he doesn’t know if that’s necessary for this investigation.

“Assume that if he’s acting shady with a Ukrainian president who was just elected, he’s probably acted shady in the long-standing relationships he’s had with Putin and MBS, particularly over Khashoggi,” Swalwell said, referring to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman by his initials. “He said he could shoot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue and get away with it. We have him holding the weapon now and it’s a question of whether he is right about who we are as Americans. I think he’s wrong, and I don’t think we need to go interview a thousand witnesses when he’s copped to it.”

2:30 p.m.: House committees request documents on delay of Ukraine military aid

Two powerful committees that oversee the federal budget and spending have requested from the White House a timeline and relevant documents that explain how the United States came to withhold almost $4oo million in military aid to Ukraine.

Central to the committees’ concerns are reports that the Office of Management and Budget was responsible for relaying to the State Department and the Pentagon President Trump’s order to hold back the funds to Ukraine.

“As reports continue to emerge, we have deepening concerns that OMB continues to demonstrate a pattern of impeding agencies’ ability to use their enacted appropriations,” wrote House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita M. Lowey (D-N.Y.) and House Budget Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), in a joint letter to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and OMB Acting Director Russell Vought.

The Democrats have asked OMB to answer a list of questions, including when the White House first instructed the other agencies to withhold the money, and to provide documentation showing “the factual, legal, and policy bases upon which these actions were taken.”

2:05 p.m.: Senate Democrats involve Trump judicial nominee in Ukraine controversy

Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats want one of Trump’s judicial nominees to the federal bench to disclose what he knew about Trump’s call with Zelensky and the subsequent whistleblower complaint.

Steven Menashi, a nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in New York, is currently working as White House associate counsel. During his confirmation hearing earlier this month he enraged Democrats and some Republicans by refusing to disclose basic details about his work at the White House.

The 10 Democrats on the panel, led by ranking member Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), sent a letter to Menashi on Friday requesting information about any work he’s done related to the Ukraine matter.

“We write to inquire about your knowledge of or involvement with any of the events related to a telephone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky on July 25, 2019, or a whistleblower complaint about that call and efforts to pressure Ukraine to interfere in the upcoming 2020 U.S. election,” they wrote.

1:35 p.m.: Schiff highlights statement signed by national security officials

Schiff took to Twitter on Friday afternoon to highlight the statement signed by more than 300 former U.S. national security and foreign policy officials warning that Trump’s actions regarding Ukraine are a “profound national security concern” and supporting an impeachment inquiry.

“The consensus of national security experts is clear: President Trump’s actions concerning Ukraine endanger America’s security,” Schiff said in his tweet. “By subjugating the national interest to his own political interest, Trump has shown he is incapable and unwilling to fulfill his oath of office.”

12:50 p.m.: White House hopeful Gabbard drops opposition to impeachment inquiry

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), the last of the 2020 Democratic White House hopefuls to oppose an impeachment inquiry, announced a change of position Friday.

“Up to this point, I have been opposed to pursuing impeachment because it will further divide our already divided country,” Gabbard said in a statement. “However, after looking carefully at the transcript of the conversation with Ukraine’s President, the whistleblower complaint, the Inspector General memo, and President Trump’s comments about the issue, unfortunately, I believe that if we do not proceed with the inquiry, it will set a very dangerous precedent.”

12:30 p.m.: Former senator Flake: ‘not a lot of love for this president’

Former senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) elaborated Friday on his claim a day before that at least 35 Republican senators would vote for Trump’s impeachment if they could do so privately.

“Anybody who has sat through two years, as I have, of Republican luncheons realizes that there’s not a lot of love for the president,” Flake said during an interview with NPR. “There’s a lot of fear of what it means to go against the president.”

Flake made his initial assessment Thursday at the Texas Tribune Festival.

Speaking to NPR, he added that he himself considers impeachment a bad idea.

“I’m not a fan of the president,” Flake said. “I hope that he’s not reelected next year. But I worry that this, in a very divided country, will divide it even further. So I’d rather defeat the president the old-fashioned way, at the ballot box.”

12:15 p.m.: Ukraine lawmakers seek new probes into allegations at ‘epicenter’ of U.S. political battles

Lawmakers in Ukraine are seeking to launch probes into some of the same allegations at the heart of the Trump administration’s dirt-digging efforts, including possibly reopening inquiries into the Ukrainian natural gas firm with connections to Hunter Biden.

The Ukraine push, however, could draw the country deeper into Washington’s whistleblower battles even as its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, tries to tread a careful path with one of its most important allies.

A separate probe by Ukraine also has the potential to add fuel to White House efforts to fire up President Trump’s base and lend legitimacy to his demands for Ukrainian prosecutors to look again at corruption allegations against Hunter Biden, despite no evidence of wrongdoing related to his work in Ukraine.

11:25 a.m.: Trump says all foreign leader calls are endangered

Trump returned to Twitter late Friday morning to argue that Democrats are jeopardizing all calls between U.S. presidents and foreign leaders.

“If that perfect phone call with the President of Ukraine Isn’t considered appropriate, then no future President can EVER again speak to another foreign leader!” he tweeted.

11:15 a.m.: House Intelligence Committee members plan to stay into recess

Members of the House Intelligence Committee said Friday that they plan to work during a scheduled two-week recess and left open the possibility that the panel would hold additional hearings.

“We’re expected to be here over the recess,” Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) told reporters, adding: “There could very well be hearings.”

Speier said Democrats feel a sense of urgency about investigating Trump’s call with Zelensky.

“This is not something we can wait around [for] and contemplate our navels,” she said.

Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), another member of the committee, said he also plans to spend much of the recess in Washington.

“I canceled a bunch of stuff in my district to be here,” he said.

Schiff told multiple media outlets that he plans to move expeditiously to issue subpoenas of officials with knowledge of Trump’s call with Zelensky and to take depositions.

10:30 a.m.: Cruz compares Pelosi TV appearance to a ‘hostage video’

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) likened an MSNBC interview of Pelosi on Friday morning to a “hostage video,” suggesting that she remains opposed to an impeachment inquiry but is responding to liberal lawmakers in her caucus who are “filled with rage.”

“I think Nancy understands that impeachment is a train wreck for the Democrats,” Cruz asserted during an appearance on Fox News. “She has been trying to hold back the hordes. And you know, watching her, it almost reminded me of a hostage video. I think she was blinking SOS.”

During the MSNBC interview, Pelosi said she supported an impeachment inquiry after the facts of the Ukraine call came to light.

“The facts changed the situation, and they cannot be ignored,” she said.

As of midmorning Friday, 222 House Democrats and one independent member had voiced support for at least opening an inquiry into whether the president committed “high crimes and misdemeanors.”

10 a.m.: Oregon congressman accuses Trump of ‘treason’

Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.), speaking on the House floor Friday morning, accused Trump of “treason.”

DeFazio referred to remarks Trump made at a private event where the president said the whistleblower’s actions were akin to being a spy or committing treason.

“Let’s see: Russia has invaded the Ukraine, Ukraine is dependent upon the United States for military assistance to defend itself, Trump is withholding the aid, at the same time asking them for dirt on his political opponent,” DeFazio said. “He’s jeopardizing the national security interests of the United States. If anybody is committing treason — and I believe that’s an impeachable offense — it’s the president of the United States, Donald Trump.”

The lawmaker presiding over the House reminded DeFazio not to engage in personal attacks against the president in the House chamber.

A little later, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said DeFazio crossed the line and asked that the Democrat be reminded that “such violation won’t be tolerated in the future.”

9:45 a.m.: Trump speculates ‘a leaker or a spy’ fed information to whistleblower

Trump speculated on Twitter on Friday morning that the whistleblower might have received information from “a leaker or spy” or a “partisan operative.” He offered no evidence for his suggestions.

“Sounding more and more like the so-called Whistleblower isn’t a Whistleblower at all,” the president tweeted. “In addition, all second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have even been somebody else, a leaker or spy, feeding it to him or her? A partisan operative?”

Earlier Friday, Trump personal attorney Jay Sekulow claimed that the whistleblower complaint wasn’t written by the whistleblower.

“Look at the phraseology, the endnotes and the footnotes,” Sekulow said during an appearance on Fox News’s “Fox & Friends. “This wasn’t drafted by this individual. This was written by a law firm.”

9:30 a.m.: Trump returns to Twitter, calls Schiff a ‘sick man’

Trump fired off midmorning tweets, once again claiming his conversation with Zelensky was “perfect” and taking aim again at Schiff.

“IT WAS A PERFECT CONVERSATION WITH UKRAINE PRESIDENT!” Trump said in one tweet written in all capital letters.

Shortly afterward, he renewed his call from earlier Friday for Schiff to resign for what Trump contended was embellishing Trump’s conversation with Zelensky during remarks during a hearing Thursday hearing with acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire.

“Rep. Adam B. Schiff totally made up my conversation with Ukraine President and read it to Congress and Millions,” Trump wrote. “He must resign and be investigated. He has been doing this for two years. He is a sick man!”

Following Thursday’s hearing, Schiff explained that his summary of Trump’s call “was meant to be at least part in parody.”

In his midmorning tweets, Trump also declared that, “The Democrats are now to be known as the DO NOTHING PARTY!”

9 a.m. Schiff responds to Trump’s call for his resignation

Schiff took to Twitter on Friday morning to respond to Trump’s call for him to resign for offering an embellished account of Trump’s phone conversation with Zelensky during Thursday’s House Intelligence Committee hearing.

“You engaged in a shakedown to get election dirt from a foreign country. And then you tried to cover it up,” Schiff tweeted. “But you’re right about one thing — your words need no mockery. Your own words and deeds mock themselves. But most importantly here, they endanger our country.”

Schiff said Thursday that his recounting of the Trump-Zelensky call was intended partly as parody, which Schiff said should have been obvious.

8:30 a.m.: New Yorker cover shows Trump and Giuliani killing Uncle Sam

The New Yorker revealed its cover art for next week’s magazine, which depicts Trump and his personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani as mobsters throwing Uncle Sam off a bridge to his death.

8 a.m.: Pelosi says she prays for Trump, asks that ‘God will illuminate him’

During a morning television appearance, Pelosi said she is praying for Trump and accused Barr of have “gone rogue” in his handling of the fallout from Trump’s call with Zelensky.

In the midst of a discussion about her decision to launch impeachment proceedings against Trump, Pelosi said: “I pray that God will illuminate him to see right from wrong. It’s very problematic.”

At other points during her appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Pelosi also accused Trump of “being disloyal to the oath of his office” and having used taxpayer dollars to “shake down” Zelensky.

Pelosi was referring to the fact that Trump had suspended military aid to Ukraine at the time of the phone conversation with Zelensky, in which he pressed for an investigation of the Bidens.

Trump has said repeatedly that there was “no quid pro quo.”

During the interview, Pelosi was also highly critical of Barr’s handling of the episode.

Barr’s Justice Department played a central role in holding up the disclosure of the whistleblower complaint to Congress.

As acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire testified Thursday, he consulted the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, which overruled the inspector general’s determination that the complaint was of “urgent concern,” a legal threshold that would have required disclosure to Congress within seven days.

“He’s gone rogue,” Pelosi said of Barr, adding: “I think where they’re going is a coverup of the coverup.”

“If by “going rogue” Speaker Pelosi means that the Department of Justice follows the law and long-established procedures, she is correct,” DOJ Spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said.

7:45 a.m.: Trump calls on Schiff to ‘resign immediately’

Trump on Friday called on Schiff to “immediately resign” following Thursday’s hearing in which the House Intelligence Committee chairman offered an embellished account of Trump’s conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

“Rep. Adam B. Schiff fraudulently read to Congress, with millions of people watching, a version of my conversation with the President of Ukraine that doesn’t exist,” Trump said in a tweet. “He was supposedly reading the exact transcribed version of the call, but he completely changed the words to make it sound horrible, and me sound guilty.”

“HE WAS DESPERATE AND HE GOT CAUGHT. Adam B. Schiff therefore lied to Congress and attempted to defraud the American Public,” Trump continued. “He has been doing this for two years. I am calling for him to immediately resign from Congress based on this fraud!”

Schiff explained later in the hearing what he had done.

“My summary of the president’s call was meant to be at least part in parody,” he said. “The fact that that’s not clear is a separate problem in and of itself.”

During an appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Pelosi said she was “so proud of Adam B. Schiff” for his handling of the hearing but did not allude to the episode in question.

7:15 a.m.: Trump takes swipes at the media in morning tweets

Trump took multiple swipes at the media in morning tweets, including complaining about punctuation used in a CNN report that mentioned a derogatory term he used for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.).

“To show you how dishonest the LameStream Media is, I used the word Liddle’, not Liddle, in describing Corrupt Congressman Liddle’ Adam B. Schiff,” Trump wrote on Twitter, misspelling describing. “Low ratings @CNN purposely took the hyphen out and said I spelled the word little wrong. A small but never ending situation with CNN!”

Trump in fact used an apostrophe, not a hyphen.

In another tweet, he took issue with a story by Peter Baker of the New York Times and declared that he “should not even be allowed to write about me.”

7 a.m.: White House spokesman decries those who gave information to whistleblower

White House spokesman Hogan Gidley denounced leaks coming from the White House, calling them “dangerous,” and questioned the motives of those who provided information to the whistleblower.

During an appearance on Fox News’s “Fox & Friends,” Gidley was asked about Trump’s remarks Thursday morning to the U.S. Mission to the United Nations in which he dismissed the complaint against him from the intelligence community whistleblower and suggested that the person’s actions made him or her “close to a spy.”

“He was talking about the people who actually gave the information to the whistleblower,” Gidley claimed.

The whistleblower said the complaint was based on information from more than a half dozen U.S. officials.

Gidley noted that transcripts of previous Trump calls with the leaders of Australia and Mexico had also been leaked to the press.

“These leaks are dangerous,” he said, adding that he was not sure why they have happened.

“Do they just want to bolster their own careers or get invited to the cocktail parties here in D. C.?” he asked.

During the same interview, Gidley insisted that no one in the White House is concerned about the revelations in the whistleblower report.

“No one I’ve talked to is concerned at all about this because there is nothing there,” he said. “No one in the White House is concerned about this because the president has done nothing wrong.”

6:45 a.m.: Democrats rip Trump’s ‘threatening’ comments against whistleblower

Someone laughed loudly during the closed-door speech President Trump gave at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations on Thursday. Other voices spoke in hushed murmurs.

Trump had just demanded to know who provided a whistleblower with information about his call with the Ukrainian president, describing that person as “close to a spy” and adding: “You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now.”

Trump’s comments, which were included in leaked video obtained by The Washington Post and others, have sparked intense backlash, with top Democrats decrying his words as “threatening” and defending the whistleblower at the center of a new push for impeachment.

“He sounds like a criminal,” Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a presidential primary candidate, told MSNBC on Thursday night. “‘Who snitched? Who gave up the goods? Let’s find out who gave up the goods on us and make sure there’s a consequence and it’s serious, and let that be a lesson to everybody else.’”

6:30 a.m.: Nearly 300 former officials call Trump’s actions concerning Ukraine ‘profound national security concern’

Nearly 300 former U.S. national security and foreign policy officials have signed a statement warning that Trump’s actions regarding Ukraine are a “profound national security concern” and supporting an impeachment inquiry by Congress to determine “the facts.”

“To be clear, we do not wish to prejudge the totality of the facts or Congress’ deliberative process,” said the statement, released Friday. “At the same time, there is no escaping that what we already know is serious enough to merit impeachment proceedings.”

The collection of signatures was set in motion by National Security Action, an organization founded and largely populated by officials from the Obama administration to call attention to Trump’s “reckless leadership.”

Many of the signers are former Obama officials. But the list includes others who served as career officials in both Democratic and Republican administrations, including Matthew Olsen, head of the Justice Department’s national security division under President George W. Bush and director of the National Counterterrorism Center under President Barack Obama.

6 a.m.: ‘Enough is enough with this guy,’ says Sen. Bernie Sanders

Echoing other Democratic White House hopefuls, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) lambasted Trump during an appearance Thursday night on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” during which he also called the president a “spoiled brat.”

“He’s probably the most corrupt president in the modern history of this country,” Sanders said, prompting applause from the studio audience. “I think this Ukrainian business — using national security money designed to protect the people of America and use that as leverage to try to get dirt on a political opponent, and then trying to cover that up — this is an outrage on top of an outrage. And I think this is kind of taking millions of people to say, ‘You know what? Enough is enough with this guy. ’ ”

Sanders went on to say that he doesn’t think Trump “knows the difference between lying and truth-telling.”"
173,Jenna Johnson,"PITTSBURGH Before hundreds crammed into a college-neighborhood burger joint, Sen. Amy Klobuchar assumed the tone of a stand-up comedian as she recounted taking a selfie with fellow Sens. John McCain and Bernie Sanders at President Trumps inauguration. A photo… [+8602 chars]",The Minnesota Democrat has tried to sell herself as an answer to the party’s upper-Midwestern woes — but has yet to find traction.,2019-09-27,The Washington Post,"For Sen.

Less funny, anonymity also has largely defined Klobuchar’s role in the Democratic presidential contest — even though she has been a senator from Minnesota for 12 years and serves in leadership, even though she passes more legislation each session than most Democrats, even though she’s regularly on cable news and is campaigning across the country.

AD

AD

At the beginning of the latest Democratic debate earlier this month, Klobuchar — who was stationed at the last lectern on the far left of the stage — embraced reality.

“I may not be the loudest person up here, but I think we’ve already got that in the White House,” she said, adding, “If you feel stuck in the middle of the extremes in our politics, and you are tired of the noise and the nonsense, you’ve got a home with me.”

The question for her campaign: In a primary driven by more combative activists, how many voters want that? And why her over other centrist candidates?

Klobuchar has seen a small bump in some polls since that debate, delighting her and her staff. A September Focus on Rural America poll of likely Iowa caucus-goers found her support at 8 percent, and a Des Moines Register-CNN-Mediacom Iowa poll released last weekend put her at 3 percent. Yet an average of national polls in September showed Klobuchar’s support around 1 percent.

AD

AD

She’s leaning on the fact that most voters say their support is fluid. Yet, for months she’s been overshadowed in the center by former vice president Joe Biden, who, like her, contends he’s a champion of working-class Midwestern voters and union members and knows how to work with Republicans to get legislation passed. And she has no clear strategy for changing that.

While most Democratic candidates have publicly challenged Biden — questioning his age and his comments on racial issues, among other things — Klobuchar largely has refrained and has even come to Biden’s defense. When asked why she thinks she would have a better shot at winning Rust Belt states than Biden, who grew up in Pennsylvania, Klobuchar says that she is “actually from the Midwest,” is a woman and is “in a new generation of politicians.” (At 59, she is 17 years younger than Biden.)

“A generation that actually has governed during the Trump era, which I think is key,” she said during a recent campaign stop in Philadelphia. “I was able to navigate this Congress during and before Donald Trump.”

AD

AD

Meanwhile, Klobuchar has repeatedly questioned and criticized policy ideas embraced by the two most prominent liberals in the race — Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts — that she says are too costly and would be paid for by the already strapped middle class. That includes Medicare-for-all, which Klobuchar calls “a bad idea” that would kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance plans, and making four-year colleges tuition free, which she says would force blue-collar workers to foot tuition bills of “rich kids.”

These sorts of ideas “are better left in the college faculty lounge,” Klobuchar said in Detroit last week — which sounded like a jab at Warren, a former law professor, although Klobuchar insisted it wasn’t. Klobuchar has said that although Warren has a plethora of plans, her own plans “have deadlines” and are more likely to be passed and implemented.

Via a small charter plane, Klobuchar recently took a whirlwind two-day trip through Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, three usually Democratic states that gave Trump the White House. During the trip, she made sure to note that in 2018 she won 42 Minnesota counties that voted for Trump two years earlier, when he came surprisingly close to winning her home state.

AD

AD

Klobuchar said that presidential candidates need to keep voters in these states in mind now — and that a more moderate candidate would have better success there during a general election.

During a visit to a carpentry-training center in Pittsburgh, Klobuchar often finished the sentences of her tour guides as they spoke of the dire need for welders and their frustration that some parents push their kids into four-year colleges when a trade school would be a better fit.

She said the government should double the amount of money given to students through Pell grants, increase the income cap to qualify for those grants and make one- and two-year-degree programs free.

AD

“We are so focused sometimes on one path to success and that’s not everyone’s path to success, and we need to make it easier for students to go to programs like this,” she said.

AD

The next day, she took artisanal doughnuts to United Auto Workers members striking outside a General Motors assembly factory in Detroit.

“I stand with you guys,” she told them. “You stood with the company when it was in trouble, right? Took a bunch of cuts, did things. And now the company is doing better, and you should share in that prosperity.”

Some responded positively.

“She said all the right things — which they do, but she seemed heartfelt and genuine, and you don’t usually get that from politicians,” said Meoshee Edwards, 47, who has worked at the plant for 23 years, likes Sanders and knew nothing about Klobuchar before she showed up. “She seems to know exactly what we’re fighting for and why we’re fighting for it. . . . I am going to research her now.”

AD

But Klobuchar wasn’t warmly embraced everywhere. During a tour of a dairy farm in rural Wisconsin — home to a young calf named “Amy” in her honor — a few of the local farmers who had gathered to meet her were upset that she spent more time talking to the media than to them. Later that day, she stopped by a training session in Milwaukee to share her ideas for expanding voting access with a group of African American activists and take a few questions about her time as a prosecutor. As she took a photograph with the group, one man declined to be included because he said she hadn’t taken enough questions and hadn’t fully answered the questions she was asked.

AD

Throughout the trip, Klobuchar made clear that to her, being a moderate isn’t just about policy — it’s also about her tone and approach. That’s meant focusing on issues and legislation that Republicans are willing to work on, even if it doesn’t excite a lot of Democratic primary voters. It has meant remaining calm and collected while questioning Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing. It has meant being the un-snazzy mom on the debate stage who scolds the others when they bicker.

“We need to not just change the policies in our country, but also change the tone of our politics,” Klobuchar said to cheers in a Milwaukee coffee shop last week.

AD

Sitting in the audience was Nancy Glissman, 59, who drove more than two hours with her husband from Illinois to be there. For many years, Glissman voted for Republicans for president but then voted for Barack Obama in 2012 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. With Trump in office, she is now firmly a Democrat.

AD

“I think Amy could lead us out of this without being divisive to our country,” said Glissman, who is retired. “We need somebody strong, but somebody that everyone can trust and get around. I think she’s that kind of person.”

Glissman sat with Brenda Dourseau, 60, a retired corrections officer who said the party needs to focus on reconnecting with young voters such as her grandchildren — and she wasn’t sure whether Klobuchar was the person to do that.

AD

“We need a candidate that can really touch these millennials. If they can lead them and get them excited, then [baby boomers] are going to follow, because we know that we have to get Trump out of there,” she said. Democrats “need to go to the younger voters. They truly do.”

Tom Glissman, Nancy’s husband, said that he would give Klobuchar more consideration if she were doing better in the polls. He is leaning toward Warren — although he wishes she would abandon her calls for Medicare-for-all and instead embrace offering a public option, as Klobuchar has done.

AD

“I love Elizabeth Warren, I really do, but she’s just a little too far left,” Dourseau said. “With all of the fire in the belly she has — if she was a little more moderate, she would be a shoo-in.”

All three agreed that they would vote for any Democrat in the general election.

“I can’t wait until this nightmare is over,” Glissman said. “I can’t wait until this Trump presidency is over. I will sleep better.”

“Me, too,” Dourseau said. “It’s a mess. The country is a mess.”"
174,Aaron Blake,"We now have a rough transcript of President Trumps phone call with the Ukrainian president, along with the whistleblower complaint. And despite plenty of very passionate arguments, neither contains an explicit quid pro quo.

Indeed, that history makes it very difficult not to see this as at least an implicit quid pro quo.

In the phone call, Trump makes multiple references to how good the United States is to Ukraine, and Zelensky then refers to buying U.S. military weaponry — “Javelins.” Trump then quickly launches into a “favor” he wants, an investigation related to the 2016 election, and then mentions another investigation, related to Joe and Hunter Biden. Judging by the rough transcript, what Trump hoped to get from the call was obvious.

AD

AD

But let’s try to suspend our disbelief for a minute. Let’s pretend it could just be some kind of amazing coincidence that Trump was talking about all the nice things he did for Ukraine just before asking a “favor.” Let’s ignore the power imbalance in their relationship and the fact that Trump had reportedly been withholding a meeting from Ukraine, and then appeared to grant it the moment Zelensky said he would pursue the investigations.

Even setting aside all that, Trump’s history speaks volumes.

His former personal attorney Michael Cohen explained in his testimony how Trump tells you to do problematic things.

“It would be no different than if I said: ‘That’s the nicest-looking tie I’ve ever seen. Isn’t it?’ What are you going to do? Are you going to fight with him? The answer is no,” Cohen said. “So you say, ‘Yeah, it’s the nicest-looking tie I’ve ever seen.’ That’s how he speaks.”

AD

AD

Cohen added: “He doesn’t give you orders. He speaks in code. And I understand the code because I’ve been around him for decades.”

Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s report includes other examples of Trump using just such a code. When he wants FBI Director James B. Comey to back off Michael Flynn, he doesn’t say it in so many words. He says, “I hope you can let this go,” according to Comey.

Mueller reasoned that Trump’s meaning was pretty clear:

A second question is whether the President’s statements, which were not phrased as a direct order to Comey, could impede or interfere with the FBI’s investigation of Flynn. While the President said he “hope[d]” Comey could “let[] Flynn go,” rather than affirmatively directing him to do so, the circumstances of the conversation show that the President was asking Comey to close the FBI’s investigation into Flynn.

Mueller adds that, “because the President is the head of the executive branch, when he says that he ‘hopes’ a subordinate will do something, it is reasonable to expect that the subordinate will do what the President wants.”

AD

Zelensky doesn’t report to Trump, but there is a similar power imbalance.

Trump’s alleged request for “loyalty” from Comey is also in this vein. Again, from the Mueller report:

AD

According to Comey’s account, at one point during the dinner the President stated, “I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.” Comey did not respond and the conversation moved on to other topics, but the President returned to the subject of Comey’s job at the end of the dinner and repeated, “I need loyalty.”: Comey responded, “You will always get honesty from me.” The President said, “That’s what I want, honest loyalty.” Comey said, “You will get that from me.”

The White House disputed this account, but Mueller found it to be credible and consistent. And it tracks with the idea that Trump knew that asking for “loyalty” was code for something else.

Another example involves Trump’s apparent repeated efforts to shutter the Mueller probe. At one point in August 2018, he tweeted, “This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further.”

AD

..This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further. Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 1, 2018

Then-White House press secretary Sarah Sanders would soon clarify that “the president is stating his opinion; it’s not an order.” Except then we found out that Trump did try to shut down the investigation — including by trying to get others to apply pressure on Sessions. Then-White House counsel Donald McGahn interpreted Trump’s entreaties as orders, and Trump aides Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn both declined to deliver messages to Sessions because they viewed them as problematic.

(Lewandowski, implausibly, explained in testimony this month that he had merely gone “on vacation” and never had the right forum to deliver the message. Mueller’s report says plainly that Lewandowski “did not want to deliver the President’s message personally” and that “Dearborn was uncomfortable with the task and did not follow through.”)

There are, of course, times when officials have interpreted Trump in a more friendly light. One of them is former National Security Agency director Michael Rogers. Again, from the Mueller report:

AD

On March 26, 2017, the day after the President called [then-Director of National Intelligence Daniel] Coats, the President called NSA Director Admiral Michael Rogers. The President expressed frustration with the Russia investigation, saying that it made relations with the Russians difficult. The President told Rogers “the thing with the Russians [wa]s messing up” his ability to get things done with Russia. The President also said that the news stories linking him with Russia were not true and asked Rogers if he could do anything to refute the stories. Deputy Director of the NSA Richard Ledgett, who was present for the call, said it was the most unusual thing he had experienced in 40 years of government service. After the call concluded, Ledgett prepared a memorandum that he and Rogers both signed documenting the content of the conversation and the President’s request, and they placed the memorandum in a safe. But Rogers did not perceive the President’s request to be an order, and the President did not ask Rogers to push back on the Russia investigation itself. Rogers later testified in a congressional hearing that as NSA Director he had “never been directed to do anything [he] believe[d] to be illegal, immoral, unethical or inappropriate” and did not recall ever feeling pressured to do so.”

Zelensky seems to be taking the Rogers approach, insisting this week that he didn’t feel pressured by Trump — and also adding that he never actually “push[ed]” his “independent” prosecutor general. He has every reason to leave that impression, of course, if for no other reason than to avoid alienating the very powerful U.S. president who has apparently been leaning on him pretty hard, and to make it look as if he’s not Trump’s stooge.

But if you look at the examples above, is it really at all ambiguous that Trump dances around problematic requests like this and clearly wanted to leave the impression that bad things could happen if Zelensky didn’t play ball?

Trump has exploited plausible deniability throughout his presidency; at some point, people who suspend their disbelief are truly doing so willfully.

The whistleblower who sounded an alarm while others bit their tongues showed that. So did the inspector general who alerted Congress to his complaint when President Trump’s loyalists were trying to keep it secret. And the public got a glimpse during a House committee hearing on Thursday of how differently this scandal might have played out if Trump's previous pick to lead the nation’s intelligence community had been confirmed.

The temperamental contrast was stark between Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Tex.), the hyper-partisan congressman who wanted the job, and Joe Maguire, the decorated military hero who got it instead and seemed eager to show he’s no one’s toady. Democrats faulted Maguire, as the acting director of national intelligence, for checking in with the very entities who a CIA whistleblower had accused of wrongdoing, including Bill Barr’s Justice Department and Trump’s White House counsel’s office, to see if they wanted to claim executive privilege to prevent the disclosure of his allegations.

Maguire noted earnestly that he was new in the role and wanted to do the right thing. The retired admiral had been running the National Counterterrorism Center after 36 years in the Navy, including as commander of Seal Team 6. He said he’s sworn an oath to protect and defend the Constitution 11 times. “No one can take an individual’s integrity away,” Maguire explained. “It can only be given away.”

Ratcliffe’s questioning of Maguire – which was more of a monologue, really – offered a window into how he might have handled both the complaint and the hearing if he’d found himself in the hot seat. The congressman made the case that Trump prodding his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate former vice president Joe Biden was “lawful conduct.” He claimed without evidence that the whistleblower was “wrong in numerous respects” and dubiously compared the complaint to the “Steele dossier” in the Russia investigation. “The United States is allowed to solicit help from a foreign government in an ongoing criminal investigation, which is exactly what President Trump did in that conversation,” Ratcliffe declared.

Ratcliffe’s hopes of getting formally nominated went down in flames on Aug. 2 after Senate Republicans expressed concern about his qualifications and evidence that he had padded his résumé. The three-term congressman had impressed Trump in July with his hostile questioning of former special counsel Bob Mueller. When the president pulled his support just a week after announcing his intention to nominate Ratcliffe, reporters asked Trump why he put someone with such limited national security experience up for such an important job without fully vetting him. “I think he would’ve picked it up very quickly,” Trump replied. “I give out a name to the press and they vet for me. We save a lot of money that way.” Trump gave the job instead to Maguire, who had no idea he’d immediately be thrust into the center of an epic fight between the White House and Congress.

During the hearing, Ratcliffe also falsely insisted that the legal opinion from the Justice Department, which claimed that intelligence community officials didn’t need to turn over the whistleblower complaint because it was outside of their jurisdiction, was written by nonpolitical lawyers. “That's an opinion from the Department of Justice ethics lawyers – not political appointees, but career officials that serve Republicans and Democrats,” Ratcliffe said during the hearing.

In fact, that opinion – released publicly on Wednesday – was authored by Trump appointee Steven Engel. Engel earned a reputation as a highly partisan figure in George W. Bush’s Justice Department, which is why Democrats fought his confirmation to run the Office of Legal Counsel. He was confirmed by a vote of 51 to 47 in November 2017. As a former U.S. attorney, it seems inconceivable that Ratcliffe would not know the Office of Legal Counsel is led by a political appointee.

-- It’s also very revealing to contrast how Maguire and Trump talked about the whistleblower. The acting DNI testified that he does not know who wrote the document, but he said he doesn’t question the person’s motives. He added that he believes they “acted in good faith” and insisted that he is glad the information has finally come out. “I think the whistleblower did the right thing,” Maguire said. “I think he followed the law every step of the way.”

As Maguire was testifying, Trump declared that the whistleblower acted like “a spy” and suggested that the legally protected conduct was akin to “treason.” Speaking in New York at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, the president made clear that he’d also like to ferret out anyone else who provided evidence of his misconduct. “I want to know who’s the person that gave the whistleblower … the information because that’s close to a spy,” he said. “You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now.”

The Los Angeles Times published an audio recording of the closed-door speech, and The Post later obtained a video. “We’re at war,” Trump said in his ad-libbed remarks, referring to the scandal. “These people are sick. They’re sick. And nobody’s called it out like I do.”

-- Trump and his band of brothers have been leaning on the language of war this week. Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), the ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee, congratulated Democrats at the Maguire hearing on the “rollout of their latest information warfare operation against the president.”

Steve Bannon, Trump’s former White House strategist, compared Nancy Pelosi’s speech on Tuesday night to the start of the Civil War in 1861. “Pelosi’s announcement to begin a formal process at 5 p.m. was the shot at Fort Sumter,” Bannon said. “Now you cannot freelance, you cannot go rogue. You have to be disciplined. You have to be high and tight.”

-- Former DNI James Clapper likened the president’s comments about the whistleblower to “witness retaliation.” “What’s really bad about it is this is going to have a very chilling effect on any other potential whistleblowers,” the Trump critic said on CNN.

WHAT’S EMERGED ABOUT THE WHISTLEBLOWER:

-- “The whistleblower’s identity remains obscured, the details of his work for the CIA cloaked in secrecy. But the document he delivered reveals almost as much about the investigative mission he carried out in stealth as it does about the alleged abuses of power by the president,” Greg Miller reports. “[T]he CIA officer behind the whistleblower report moved swiftly behind the scenes to assemble material from at least a half-dozen highly placed — and equally dismayed — U.S. officials. He wove their accounts with other painstakingly gathered material on everything from the intervention of Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani in the U.S.-Ukraine relationship to alleged efforts by American diplomats sent to Kiev and attorneys in the Office of the White House Counsel to contain or suppress the accruing damage. …

“Six weeks later, the whistleblower has by some measures managed to exceed what [Mueller] accomplished in two years of investigating Trump: producing a file so concerning and factually sound that it has almost single-handedly set in motion the gears of impeachment. ‘In the course of my official duties,’ the whistleblower writes in the first sentence of his complaint, he learned that ‘the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.’”

-- The White House learned that a CIA officer had lodged allegations about Trump’s call even as the officer’s whistleblower complaint was moving through a process meant to protect him against reprisals, the New York Times reports: “The officer first shared information about potential abuse of power and a White House cover-up with the C.I.A.’s top lawyer through an anonymous process … The lawyer shared the officer’s concerns with White House and Justice Department officials, following policy. … But as White House, C.I.A. and Justice Department officials were examining the accusations, the C.I.A. officer who had lodged them anonymously grew concerned after learning that [CIA general counsel Courtney Simmons Elwood] had contacted the White House … While it is not clear how the officer became aware that Ms. Elwood had shared the information, he concluded that the C.I.A. was not taking his allegations seriously.”

“The whistle-blower was detailed to work at the White House at one point, according to three people familiar with his identity, and has since returned to the C.I.A.,” per Julian Barnes, Michael Schmidt, Adam Goldman and Katie Benner in the Times. “His complaint suggested he was an analyst by training and made clear he was steeped in details of American foreign policy toward Europe, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of Ukrainian politics and at least some knowledge of the law.”

-- The AP also reports that White House and the Justice Department learned about a CIA officer’s concerns about Trump “around the same time the individual filed a whistleblower complaint.” Eric Tucker, Michael Balsamo and Zeke Miller say that information about the whistleblower was already making its way through the administration:

“On Aug. 14, White House counsel John Eisenberg and a CIA official alerted the head of DOJ’s national security division about the original complaint to the CIA. John Demers, who leads the national security division, went to the White House the next day to review materials associated with the call. He then alerted people within the Justice Department, but it was unclear specifically who he told. In the following weeks, Demers had discussions with other Justice Department officials about how to handle the CIA complaint, according to the person familiar with the matter. It was during that period that the Justice Department also received a notification from the intelligence community’s inspector general about a whistleblower complaint.”

-- Responding to reader criticism, Times executive editor Dean Baquet defended their decision to publish information about the whistleblower and noted that the White House already knew he was a CIA officer. “We decided to publish limited information about the whistle-blower — including the fact that he works for a nonpolitical agency and that his complaint is based on an intimate knowledge and understanding of the White House — because we wanted to provide information to readers that allows them to make their own judgments about whether or not he is credible,” Baquet wrote. “The role of the whistle-blower, including his credibility and his place in the government, is essential to understanding one of the most important issues facing the country — whether the president of the U.S. abused power and whether the W.H. covered it up.”

-- The whistleblower emphasized in the complaint that he was not the only one worried. “The White House officials who told me this information were deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call,” he wrote in his complaint. “They told me there was already a ‘discussion ongoing’ with White House lawyers about how to treat the call because of the likelihood, in the officials’ retelling, that they had witnessed the President abuse his office for personal gain.”

NEW DETAILS ON WHAT RUDY WAS UP TO:

-- Giuliani spent months cultivating relationships with five current and former prosecutors in Ukraine to achieve a particular goal: Helping Trump win next year’s election by pursuing allegations damaging to his Democratic rivals. Paul Sonne, Michael Birnbaum, Rosalind S. Helderman and Josh Dawsey report: “Giuliani decried any scrutiny of his conduct in a long interview Thursday, saying that more attention was finally being paid to the Biden family. ... During those meetings, he said, he obtained information about Hunter Biden and what the former New York mayor has alleged was collusion between Democrats and Ukraine in the 2016 election. … Some of the Ukrainians Giuliani and his associates interacted with were banned from entering the United States. Giuliani blamed the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine for blocking the officials from coming to the United States to give him more information. … A former Ukrainian prosecutor said he believed the officials were angling to provide Giuliani with compromising information at least partly to advance their own careers — and win U.S. backing for their position within the often rough-and-tumble world of Ukrainian politics.”

-- A former top Ukraine prosecutor, whose allegations were at the heart of Giuliani’s dirt-digging effort, said Hunter Biden “did not violate anything.” Michael Birnbaum, David L. Stern and Natalie Gryvnyak report: “‘From the perspective of Ukrainian legislation, he did not violate anything,’ former Ukrainian prosecutor general Yuri Lutsenko told The Washington Post in his first interview since the disclosure of [the whistleblower's complaint] … ‘Hunter Biden cannot be responsible for violations of the management of Burisma that took place two years before his arrival,’ Lutsenko said. Lutsenko had earlier cast doubt on Hunter Biden’s actions in Ukraine, an effort that drew Giuliani’s notice last year. Lutsenko said that Giuliani tried to arrange a meeting with him two times before they finally managed to connect on the third try in January, ‘I took a vacation. I took my youngest son, I showed him New York and I met with Mr. Giuliani,’ Lutsenko said. ‘I had a long conversation with him. But this was only in the forum of exchanging information.’

""Lutsenko met with Giuliani again in Warsaw in mid-February, then for a third and final time ‘in Europe,’ he said, refusing to be more specific. Lutsenko did not fully explain the change of heart in May when he gave an interview to Bloomberg in which he said he believed Hunter Biden had not broken any Ukrainian laws. But Lutsenko said that if U.S. authorities were separately interested in Hunter Biden’s financial arrangements in Ukraine, Ukrainian law enforcement officials would be happy to comply.”

-- One of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky's political rivals in Kiev is demanding that he release the government's transcript of the call, as Zelensky finds himself in hot water across Europe for his criticisms of the French and Germans. Siobhán O’Grady and Rick Noack report: “In a Facebook post, [Ukrainian opposition lawmaker Oleksiy Goncharenko] called it ‘strange that the [Ukrainian] President’s Office did not publish this transcript simultaneously with the White House.’ … [In the call, Zelensky] praised Trump and went on to say he met both German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron and told them: ‘They are not working as much as they should work for Ukraine.’ Those comments were not well received in Europe. ‘To say that I consider this to be incomprehensible would perhaps be a mild way to put it,’ [said] Elmar Brok, who was recently appointed special adviser on Ukraine for outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.”

-- Conservative columnist John Solomon, executive vice president of the Hill newspaper, helped craft the flawed Ukraine narrative that would later be echoed by Trump, his son Don Jr., and Giuliani. Paul Farhi reports: “Back in March, the Hill newspaper published a series of stories and interviews that seemed, at the time, to be mainly of interest to foreign-policy wonks. [Solomon] interviewed Ukraine’s then-top prosecutor, [Lutsenko], who alleged a startling conspiracy: that law enforcement officials within his country had leaked damaging information in 2016 against Paul Manafort ... to help ... Clinton’s presidential campaign. … The story touched off a brushfire within the conservative media, in which Solomon is a prominent figure, but stayed largely out of mainstream view. On Thursday, however, Solomon’s work gained new attention — and raised new questions about its sourcing, credibility and motivation. In [the whistleblower's complaint], Solomon’s stories were cited as part of a narrative about the alleged effort by Trump and his allies to pressure Ukraine’s government into digging up dirt on Trump’s Democratic rivals.”

-- Trump appears to be counting on confusion over the complex Ukraine story to offer a fog of false claims and allegations to make it appear Joe Biden did something wrong. The Post’s Fact Checker team published a short guide this morning to Trump’s statements — and the truth.

-- And Philip Bump created a helpful timeline of the significant dates in the whistleblower’s complaint to provide more clarity on how Trump's and Giuliani’s efforts to get dirt on Biden unfolded.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meets Vice President Pence on Sept. 1 in Warsaw. (Petr David Josek/AP)

CASCADING FALLOUT FOR THE WHITE HOUSE:

-- Vice President Pence is trying to dodge the impeachment spotlight, but his Ukraine moves are attracting notice. Toluse Olorunnipa and Ashley Parker report: “Pence did not participate in [the July call] … But Pence’s name has emerged in several other contexts … The whistleblower complaint … said Pence canceled a planned trip to Ukraine at the direction of Trump, who was seeking to pressure the Ukrainians to help him politically. Three people familiar with the matter confirmed that Pence’s attendance had been requested at Zelensky’s inauguration and that his office had looked at dates for a visit to Kiev. … The vice president’s Sept. 1 meeting with Zelensky, and his discussions with Trump, will be key targets for House Democrats … Pence told reporters after the meeting that he had not discussed Biden with Zelensky but said that he had relayed Trump’s ‘great concerns about issues of corruption.’”

-- “The White House has taken extraordinary steps over the past two years to block details of Trump’s phone calls with foreign leaders from becoming public. Josh Dawsey and Carol D. Leonnig report: “The number of aides allowed to listen on secure ‘drop’ lines was slashed. The list of government officials who could review a memo of the call’s contents was culled. Fewer copies of transcripts went to agencies, and they were stamped with ‘EYES ONLY DO NOT COPY.’ And some officials who deliver call memos had to sign for the records to create a custody record if they were to leak … At one point in 2018, Defense Department officials were asked to send back transcripts of calls to the White House after Trump aides grew worried they could be disclosed, according to former senior administration officials. …

“The complaint said the transcript was ‘loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive level.’ According to the whistleblower, ‘one White House official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.’ … The July 25 call had roughly 12 to 13 people listening in. … Once the call concluded and copies were distributed to top officials in the White House, lawyers in the White House Counsel’s Office then directed that the document be moved to a code-word-protected secure computer network that is normally reserved for transcripts that contain national security secrets after officials raised concerns about Trump’s comments, according to the complaint.”

-- Lost in the controversy over Trump’s phone call is Zelensky's effort to curry favor with the president through his private business. Jonathan O’Connell and David Fahrenthold report: “‘Actually, last time I traveled to the United States, I stayed in New York near Central Park, and I stayed at the Trump Tower,’ Zelensky told Trump [according to the transcript of their July 25 call] ... Zelensky’s comments mark the first known example of an interaction Democrats and government ethics experts warned about when Trump took office: that foreign leaders would try to influence Trump by spending money at his properties and telling him abut it. … It remains unclear whether the stays were illegal. Zelensky may not have entered office at the time of his stay at Trump International Tower, overlooking Central Park in New York.""

THE POLITICS OF IMPEACHMENT:

-- House Democratic leaders are eyeing a fast-paced impeachment investigation that could lead to a vote around Thanksgiving. Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade report: “Multiple Democratic lawmakers and congressional aides said there is no formal timeline for the inquiry, but the ‘need for speed,’ as one aide put it, comes as [Pelosi] is under pressure from vulnerable freshmen to keep the investigation narrowly focused and disciplined. … Pelosi and other leaders huddled in a basement conference room Thursday evening with more than a dozen ‘front-line’ members representing the toughest districts for incumbent Democrats to discuss the fledgling probe and, in the words of multiple attendees, ‘get on the same page.’ Inside the room, the group urged the leadership to keep the messaging around impeachment on national security and the Ukraine probe being led by the House Intelligence Committee…

“Some senior Democrats are even arguing that other committees should forgo potentially explosive hearings that could distract from the intelligence panel’s work … ‘Very few hearings, if any,’ said a senior Democratic aide, who said the coming investigative work will largely take place in closed-door interviews. … But many of the moderate freshmen do not want to be seen as rushing to conclusions — whether on the Ukraine probe or any other aspect of potential presidential wrongdoing. … A senior Democratic aide familiar with discussions among the party’s moderate wing relayed concerns that a probe seen as moving too rapidly by the public could backfire. …

“One of the first credible polls to test the Democratic impeachment push following Pelosi’s Tuesday announcement found the public almost evenly split. An NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist Poll conducted Wednesday found Americans approving 49 percent to 46 percent of the House inquiry, with independents disapproving 50 percent to 44 percent.""

-- Pelosi explained to the New Yorker that impeaching Trump for “bad behavior” isn’t worth it. The difference now is the president, she contends, is undermining democracy and the electoral system. David Remnick writes up his interview: “When I asked Pelosi if she thought Trump knows, in this instance or any other, the difference between right and wrong, she replied, ‘He knows the difference between right and wrong, but I don’t know that he really cares. I do think his categorical imperative is what’s good is what is right for him. In the campaign, he told us who he was. He said that he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and nobody would care, that his supporters wouldn’t care. Well, he could violate our Constitution, the integrity of our elections, and dishonor his oath of office, as he did in this call, and think that nobody cares.’”

-- She’s back: Hillary Clinton is doing a media tour to express support for impeachment, starting with CBS and continuing with additional TV sit-downs next week. The former secretary of state called the man who beat her in 2016 a “corrupt human tornado” and an “illegitimate president.” HRC’s appearances probably aren’t helpful to the Democratic cause and make it look like they’re trying to relitigate the 2016 campaign.

-- Trump is writing the Republican playbook on impeachment, and he’s going with a scorched-earth strategy. Will it work? Robert Costa and Philip Rucker report: “Trump has acted impulsively and indignantly as he wages an all-out political war to defend himself from allegations that he abused his power to solicit foreign interference in his 2020 reelection bid. And in a testament to how completely he controls the Republican Party, many GOP officeholders and conservative media figures have followed Trump’s cues by joining his attempts either to attack the anonymous whistleblower, discredit the explosive accounts in their complaint, or malign the media for covering it. … Trump’s advisers said they envision a ‘split screen’ strategy in the coming weeks. The president is considering stepping up his fall schedule of campaign rallies at arenas across the country to galvanize his supporters outside of Washington and portray House Democrats as liberal insiders who are focused on impeachment instead of governing.”

-- Politico co-founder John Harris, who covered Bill Clinton’s impeachment for The Post, remembers that impeachment proceedings used to be news of unquestionable gravity: “The week showed it's just more fodder for the ideological and culture wars.”

THE (FEW) REPUBLICAN DEFECTIONS:

-- Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker endorsed an impeachment inquiry of Trump, joining fellow Republican governor Phil Scott of Vermont. ""It’s a deeply disturbing situation and circumstance and I think the proper role and responsibility for Congress at this point is to investigate it and get to the bottom of it,” Baker told reporters in the Bay State. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan’s office did not respond to requests for comment, per Reis Thebault.

-- Former Republican senator Jeff Flake said “at least 35” GOP senators would privately vote for Trump’s impeachment. The Arizonan, speaking at the Texas Tribune Festival, was responding to veteran Republican political consultant Mike Murphy's suggestion on MSNBC that 30 Republican senators would vote to impeach Trump if it was “a secret vote.” “That’s not true,” Flake said in Texas. “There would be at least 35.” (Fox News)

-- The president's leading advisers are concerned about the ""threat"" posed by Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and are ""trying to isolate him,"" Jonathan Martin reports in the Times: ""Mr. Romney’s public statements reflect what many in his party believe privately but are almost uniformly unwilling to say: that they are faced with damning revelations about the president that are difficult to explain away, and are unsure of whether there is more damaging material to come. … To Mr. Romney, who represents a state where he is beloved and is unlikely to seek another office, it is a moment where he believes country should trump party. ‘Each person should search their own heart and do what they think is right, which is just what I do,’ he said. … Mr. Romney said he was not attempting to steer a party he believes is overwhelmingly in Mr. Trump’s grip. But as Mr. Romney contemplates what he acknowledges will likely be his last period of public service, his friends say he is appalled by what he sees as the president’s win-at-all-costs immorality and his party’s willingness to remain quiet in the face of such misconduct.”

-- “Because Trump tests boundaries of morality and legality, his defenders are, in effect, calling on Americans to ratify those changes,” writes Michael Gerson, who served as chief speechwriter in George W. Bush’s White House. “By all the evidence, Trump believes that politics, stripped of pretense, is the dirty, unethical pursuit of power, which is properly used to destroy your enemies. Republicans who defend or excuse him are providing permission for his radical redesign of public life. This is perhaps the saddest result of Trump’s corruption: turning good men and women into the bodyguards of a petty, cruel, lawless, would-be autocrat. Because Trump has chosen to be transparently corrupt, congressional Republicans cannot dispute the facts of the case (as they did during [Mueller’s] investigation). They may still insist: No quid pro quo. But this is more of a rally chant than an argument.”

Gerson, a Trump critic, believes impeachment has become inevitable: “Impeachment may be inadvisable. It may apply a cheese grater to the nation’s partisan wounds. The process may be conducted foolishly. It may feed a Republican thirst for revenge against a future Democratic president. It may motivate Trump’s base to salivating enthusiasm. The broad, American middle may yawn and switch to ESPN. All of this matters, especially if it increases the chances of Trump’s reelection. But it matters like a fate, not like a choice.”

A RANGE OF VOICES FROM THE POST'S OPINION PAGE:

-- The whistleblower complaint strengthens the case that Trump offered Ukraine’s president a quid pro quo, inveighs the Editorial Board.

-- We sent aid to Ukraine to help it fend off Russia's ongoing occupation. By holding back American support, Trump helped Putin, writes Evelyn Farkas, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense during the Obama administration.

-- Trump’s impeachment need not be a long, drawn-out affair, writes liberal Eugene Robinson: “The nation has suffered this small, foolish, dangerous man long enough. Pelosi should damn the torpedoes and move full speed ahead.”

-- The whistleblower complaint doesn’t do the Democrats any favors, argues conservative Henry Olsen: “It offers little new information not already in the public domain. Furthermore, if it continues to be relied upon as evidence justifying impeachment, Democrats will have to make some hard choices about how to proceed.”

-- Democrats are sprinting ahead of the evidence, adds conservative Marc Thiessen, another former Bush speechwriter.

­-- The whistleblower and the vulnerable Democratic freshmen who backed an impeachment inquiry are profiles in courage, writes conservative Max Boot: “This week reminds us that there are some people in Washington who are not motivated solely by self-interest — that there are actually a few people in positions of public responsibility who care about the Constitution and are willing to run considerable risks to protect it.”

-- Americans have already seen enough for three articles of impeachment, argues Jennifer Rubin, a lawyer by training.

-- As alarming as the allegations are against Trump, impeachment is still not required, writes Princeton University professor Keith Whittington: “The House would not necessarily be failing to do its ‘constitutional duty’ if it did not pass articles of impeachment.”

Refugees gather in front of the White House. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)

THE DOMESTIC AGENDA:

-- The Trump administration slashed the number of refugees who will be admitted to the U.S. next year to a historic low of 18,000. David Nakamura, Maria Sacchetti and Seung Min Kim report: “The new limit represents a 40 percent drop from the 2019 cap and marks the third consecutive year that the administration has slashed the program since the United States admitted nearly 85,000 refugees in President Barack Obama’s final year in office. In addition, the Trump administration announced an executive order aimed at allowing local jurisdictions more leeway in rejecting refugees who are being resettled across the country, although experts said such powers are less relevant at a time when the number of refugees being admitted has dwindled sharply.""

A breakdown of who is being let in: ""Under the plan for fiscal 2020, which begins Oct. 1, the administration would allocate 5,000 refugee slots to people fleeing for religious reasons, 4,000 for Iraqis who assisted the United States and fall under the Refugee Crisis in Iraq Act of 2007, and 1,500 for nationals of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, according to senior administration officials. Another 7,500 slots would go to refugees not covered by these categories, including those referred to the program by U.S. embassies. Last year’s cap of 30,000 divided slots by region, including 11,000 refugees from Africa, the largest group, administration officials said. Latin America and the Caribbean had 3,000 slots last year.”

-- Matthew Albence, acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, once again took aim at “sanctuary cities” that refuse to help the feds deport undocumented immigrants. This time, he did so from the podium in the White House briefing room. Maria Sacchetti reports: “Albence criticized jurisdictions in several states after the agency arrested nearly 1,300 migrants during the past week via Operation Cross Check, a recurring immigration roundup of people convicted of crimes that include murder, manslaughter and child abuse. Nearly 200 of those arrested could have been taken into custody in a state prison or a local jail, he said. Instead, they were released after posting bail or at the end of their sentences, forcing ICE agents to track them down. … Albence was flanked by sheriffs from Texas, North Dakota and other states where Trump enjoys broad support.”

-- Organizations challenging Trump’s attempt to end protections for the Dreamers picked Ted Olson, a former Republican solicitor general and lawyer long associated with conservative causes, to argue their case before the Supreme Court. The choice might’ve been more surprising had Olson not played a similar role in the legal battle for same-sex marriage. (Robert Barnes)

­-- An undocumented man was killed when cops went to the wrong house in Southaven, Miss. Now, the city is fighting a civil rights lawsuit by arguing that, because of his immigration status, he wasn’t protected by the U.S. Constitution. Antonia Noori Farzan reports: “Attorneys for the small city near Memphis claim that because [Ismael] Lopez had no ‘legally recognized relationship’ with the United States, he had no rights under the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, or the 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection to all citizens. ‘If he ever had Fourth Amendment or Fourteenth Amendment civil rights, they were lost by his own conduct and misconduct,’ attorney Katherine S. Kerby wrote in a brief filed Sept. 4. ‘Ismael Lopez may have been a person on American soil but he was not one of the ‘We, the People of the United States’ entitled to the civil rights invoked in this lawsuit.’”

-- The Senate passed a stopgap spending bill that will keep the government open through Nov. 21. Erica Werner reports: “The 82-15 vote came days before the Sept. 30 deadline when government funding would expire if Congress didn’t act. The House passed the same measure last week, so the Senate’s passage of the short-term spending bill means it will now go to Trump for his signature. He is expected to sign it. The stopgap bill is aimed at giving lawmakers more time to finalize $1.4 trillion worth of full-year spending bills for fiscal 2020, which ends Sept. 30, 2020.”

-- The Senate also confirmed Eugene Scalia, the son of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, to succeed Alex Acosta as labor secretary. Felicia Sonmez and Eli Rosenberg report: “Scalia was confirmed Thursday on a 53-to-44 vote. Democrats have argued that Scalia’s record as a corporate lawyer has shown him to be ‘anti-worker.’ In remarks on the Senate floor Thursday morning, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) contended that Scalia fought to protect the interests of chief executives and the wealthy elite and opposed worker protections throughout his career, describing his nomination by Trump as a ‘disgrace.’”

-- And the Senate overwhelmingly confirmed Trump’s pick to become the second-highest-ranking military officer after a bruising nomination fight centering on allegations of sexual assault from a former aide. Missy Ryan and Karoun Demirjian report: “Senators voted 75 to 22 to confirm Air Force Gen. John E. Hyten, who has headed U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM), as the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) was the lone Republican to vote against Hyten, while all Democratic senators running for president either voted against him or were absent, save Michael F. Bennet of Colorado. Bennet voted in favor.”

-- The U.S. military’s suicide rate for active-duty troops has climbed over the past five years, a Pentagon report reveals. Dan Lamothe reports: “Some 541 service members died by suicide in 2018, including 325 active-duty troops, the report said. The active-duty suicide rate was about 24.8 per 100,000 service members, up from 21.9 in 2017 and 18.7 in 2013. … Service members who die by suicide continue to be mostly male, white and under the age of 30, said Karin Orvis, director of the Pentagon’s defense suicide prevention office. The Army and Marine Corps, the services with the highest suicide rates, also have the greatest percentage of men.”

-- Trump’s pick to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives faces growing Republican concerns over his commitment to gun rights. From the Journal: “Failing to confirm [Chuck] Canterbury would leave the ATF without a permanent, politically appointed director at a time when the law enforcement agency is at the forefront of the Trump administration’s fight against violent crime and as the White House and Congress continue to negotiate gun-control measures after several mass shootings in recent months. … Mr. Canterbury tangled in his July confirmation hearing with Republican senators who were frustrated that he wouldn’t clearly define his views on gun-control measures such as expanding background checks for prospective buyers and a ban on assault rifles. He was head of the FOP when it took positions supporting more-rigorous gun-control measures including an expansion of background checks. But he wouldn’t immediately say what stance he would take if confirmed to the ATF, only that he would consult with other Justice Department officials.”

-- The Environmental Protection Agency formally told California it is “failing to meet its obligations” to protect the environment. Juliet Eilperin, Brady Dennis and Josh Dawsey report: “Days after President Trump mocked Los Angeles and other big cities for their ‘tremendous pollution,’ EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler sent an oversight letter charging California officials with failing to meet federal health standards in numerous communities where large homeless populations litter the streets with trash, drug paraphernalia and human waste. … California has long led the nation in demanding stricter limits on pollution linked to climate change. Now, the Trump administration is arguing that the state’s focus on global warming has come at the expense of more basic environmental protections.”

-- Seeking to fill the void created by Trump's inaction, six U.S. governors gathered in Manhattan on the sidelines of the U.N. meeting to confer with presidents, prime ministers and other foreign leaders to press for action on climate change. Carol Morello reports: “The governors in the group, most of them Democrats, insist they are not conducting a form of shadow diplomacy. They say neither the White House nor the State Department, which typically conducts talks with foreign governments, has tried to deter their efforts. Their mission is to assure other countries that many of America’s leaders are still engaged in combating climate change, even if the United States formally drops out of the Paris agreement next year. ‘Every party looking at this should know there is still intelligent life in the United States taking action on climate change,’ Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), a co-founder of the Climate Alliance, said in a back-seat interview en route to a meeting with officials from the European Union. ‘It’s important to give the world confidence of movement, of dynamic actions being taken in America. And it’s succeeded. Not a single country has left the agreement. No one has followed Donald Trump over the cliff.’”

-- A federal judge denied a request by the news media to unseal grand jury records cited in the Mueller report. Spencer S. Hsu reports: “Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell of the District of Columbia said she was bound by the ruling, McKeever v. Barr, and that the petitioning party, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, did not qualify for other exceptions to grand jury secrecy rules.”

2020 WATCH:

-- Joe Biden’s advisers are weighing the introduction of a new tax on Wall Street now that the former vice president stands alone among the Democratic presidential front-runners in not backing a “wealth tax” on the richest Americans. Jeff Stein reports: “The plan under consideration from Biden’s advisers could tax financial transactions such as the sale of stocks and bonds ... Tax experts said Biden’s embrace of that idea would mark just how much more aggressive Democrats are now willing to be on taxes.”

-- Some anxious Biden supporters want him to embrace a super PAC. From the Times: “Several former staffers of Mr. Biden and political donors backing his candidacy have held conversations in recent weeks about moving ahead with a super PAC, and said Mr. Trump’s furious, and often unsubstantiated, allegations about the former vice president had convinced them it was imperative they act. ‘For me, this week puts everything into stark relief,’ said Larry Rasky, a former aide to Mr. Biden who is now a political fund-raiser and public relations executive. ‘And I was already thinking the campaign was being a little naïve about the resources we’d need to fight this.’”

-- Democratic donors from Wall Street are threatening to back Trump or sit out the 2020 campaign if Elizabeth Warren wins the nomination. From CNBC: “‘You’re in a box because you’re a Democrat and you’re thinking, ‘I want to help the party, but she’s going to hurt me, so I’m going to help President Trump,’’ said a senior private equity executive ... Some big bank executives and hedge fund managers have been stunned by Warren’s ascent, and they are primed to resist her. ‘They will not support her. It would be like shutting down their industry,’ an executive at one of the nation’s largest banks told CNBC, also speaking on condition of anonymity.”

-- White, college-educated voters are driving Warren's rise in the polls. Eugene Scott reports: “The lawmaker’s support grew from 25 percent in late August to 37 percent in late September with white college-educated voters, an influential group that largely voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.”

-- In a fundraising email, Julián Castro warned that his campaign will be over is he doesn’t qualify for the November debate. From the Texas Tribune: “The email sought donations for ads to help him reach the new polling threshold: 3% in four national polls or 5% in two surveys from the first four early voting states. Castro has already met the donor requirement of 165,000 individuals but hasn't met the polling requirement — or even come close.”

-- Sen. Kamala Harris, the former attorney general of California, said Giuliani should probably be disbarred. “We need to know if the personal lawyer of the president, Giuliani, was using government resources for political gain,” the Democratic presidential candidate told CNN’s Anderson Cooper. “And frankly, if there were any members of the State Department who were facilitating Rudy Giuliani’s private conversations on behalf of the president, there should be accountability and consequence for that.” (Politico)

-- Former Health and Human Services secretary Tom Price, who resigned in disgrace, threw his hat in the ring to take over retiring Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson’s Georgia seat. From ABC News: “According to the Georgia governor's office, Price submitted his resume to be considered for replacing Isakson, who announced in August that he is resigning from his post in December due to various health issues. Isakson, 74, won a six-year term in 2016 and his term is due to end in 2022.”

-- A U.S. attorney whose office investigated interference in the 2018 midterm elections said he is certain Russia will try to meddle in the upcoming presidential race. Rachel Weiner reports: “‘They’re going to do the same thing,’ G. Zachary Terwilliger said Thursday afternoon at an event at George Mason University’s National Security Institute. ‘They’re going to do it. In an open setting like this there’s not a lot I can get into, but I think it wouldn’t be irresponsible for me to say they’re definitely going to try.’ … Terwilliger said he had heard from an administration official that ‘their big concern is deepfakes,’ or doctored images and videos. But he said he was also worried about the ‘actual physical infrastructure’ of election machines, while cautioning that the issue was outside his purview.""

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- The Pentagon authorized a modest air defense boost for Saudi Arabia after the attack on the kingdom’s oil industry. Missy Ryan and Dan Lamothe report: “Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper’s decision to authorize the deployment of an additional battery of Patriot missiles and four Sentinel radar systems, accompanied by 200 American troops, to shore up a key ally is a modest step that represents the administration’s desire, at least for now, to avoid additional escalation in U.S.-Iranian tensions. … Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said the deployment would ‘augment the kingdom’s air and missile defense of critical military and civilian infrastructure.’ ‘These steps are a demonstration of our commitment to regional partners, and the security and stability in the Middle East,’ he said in a statement.”

-- Iraq is trying to rein in its Iran-aligned militias as tensions boil in the Persian Gulf. Louisa Loveluck and Mustafa Salim report: “Iraqi officials are worried that their country could get sucked into the conflict, with concerns spiking after a May 14 drone strike on a pipeline in neighboring Saudi Arabia. The officials were embarrassed to learn that the attack had not come from Iran-backed rebels in Yemen, who had claimed responsibility for the strike, but from Iraqi territory, said lawmakers and Western officials who described the fallout. ‘The prime minister was very angry,’ said one lawmaker. … Iraqi lawmakers fear that attacks launched from their soil would not only inflame regional tensions but could provoke reprisals against targets inside their country, drawing Iraq into another ruinous conflict.”

-- Syrian government forces carried out a chlorine attack in May, a U.S. intelligence assessment found. From the Journal: “The episode took place on May 19 near the village of Kabana as President Bashar al-Assad’s forces sought to subdue resistance in Latakia province, a senior U.S. official said. … At least four people were wounded in the rocket strike, which was alleged at the time by the Syrian opposition but took months for U.S. intelligence to confirm. The Syrian government has denied the attack.”

-- The fiancée of Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi is demanding that Saudi Arabia be held accountable for his murder. Oct. 2 is the anniversary of his death. Hatice Cengiz spoke with NBC News on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly: ""His fellow journalists did their best that so no one could push this under the carpet,’ she said. ""Saudi Arabia was put under massive pressure, thanks to international media coverage … But at the end of the day, all of these efforts did not persuade world leaders to sanction Saudi Arabia. That is so sad.""

-- Trump’s privately held company, seeking to revive its money-losing golf course in Scotland, secured approval to build 550 luxury and holiday homes there, as well as a second golf course. Joshua Partlow reports: “The Aberdeenshire Council voted 38 to 24 to allow the Trump Organization’s residential development to move forward despite vocal opposition from many residents who fear it would crowd the roads and schools of their windswept village. By winning the council’s approval, the Trump Organization is poised for one of its most ambitious foreign projects of his presidency. It is also a rescue effort of sorts for Trump’s first golf course in Europe, which has lost money each year since it opened in 2012. … In a sign of its confidence in Wednesday’s vote, the Trump Organization had already begun marketing the homes as part of what it called the Trump Estate, with some homes priced at more than $1.5 million.”

-- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is facing extensive backlash after delivering a bombastic performance upon his return to Parliament. Karla Adam and William Booth report: “The widower of a murdered lawmaker and the sister of the prime minister joined a chorus of voices on Thursday saying [Johnson] has stepped over a line with his rhetoric in the debate over Brexit. But Johnson was refusing to change course on his language or his strategy. … Johnson drew particular fury over his remarks about Jo Cox, a Labour lawmaker and Brexit opponent who was murdered days before a June 2016 referendum by a far-right domestic terrorist who yelled ‘Britain first!’ before shooting and stabbing her to death. … Johnson [said] that the best way to honor Cox’s memory would be to ‘get Brexit done.’ … Rachel Johnson, the prime minister’s sister, an author and politician who opposes Brexit, called her brother’s remarks ‘tasteless.’”

-- Afghanistan's presidential election is this weekend, and voters are torn between fear, frustration and a sense of duty. From the AP: “The Taliban have relentlessly issued threats against Saturday’s vote. The insurgent group has sent suicide bombers to rallies and election offices, killing dozens and warning they will kill more. ... Afghan officials say security preparations have been elaborate. In an interview with The Associated Press, Minister of Interior Masoud Andarabi outlined an election security plan that he said has been more than eight months in the making. ... Despite the government’s best efforts, 431 polling centers will be closed Saturday because Andarabi, the interior minister, said they were too difficult to secure — either because they were under Taliban control or Taliban could threaten nearby villages.”

-- Concerns about fraud are also running high among the public and observers because it could trigger political chaos. The main challenger to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani warned of dire consequences if the polls are marred by fraud. Pamela Constable and Susannah George report: “Abdullah Abdullah, Afghanistan’s chief executive, did not say what he would do if massive fraud takes place, but he suggested in an interview that it would be up to Ghani to ‘act responsibly.’ ‘The results will not be accepted if there is clear evidence of fraud,” Abdullah said at his residence. ‘The signs are not good. . . . It is not an ideal situation for the country,’ he added, referring to warnings by opposition groups and leaders, including himself, that Ghani and his government will try to rig the polls.”

The closing days of a fundraising quarter are usually hectic for presidential candidates and their top-level staffers, who are tasked with pulling in every last dime they can find and figuring out what to do with the cash. This week — punctuated by the lightning-fast ramp-up of an official impeachment inquiry into the president — was different. By Tuesday, when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi formally announced the move, it was clear to aides of most of the 18 at-least-semi-serious remaining Democratic campaigns that, with the country’s attention squarely on Capitol Hill and the White House, they’d suddenly fallen further off the national radar than ever before. By Thursday, that attention was even more intensely focused, and a handful of campaign operatives began ringing internal alarm bells so loudly that their candidates had no choice but to start reckoning with the painful reality that no one cares about them right now. By the end of the week, in campaign offices scattered across the country, senior-level operatives finally sat down in small groups to discuss what the path forward now looks like for their campaigns — or, in some cases, whether they have realistic ones at all. A senior aide to one campaign described his team’s Friday gathering as “a ‘we’re fucked, what do we do?’ meeting.”

The big-picture strategic concern for every campaign now is that no one has any clue how long the impeachment process will take, what kind of attention it will command, or which way its politics will break. (See: Joe Biden’s team using Donald Trump’s lashing out as evidence of Biden’s electability — proving the president is most worried about the former vice-president in the general election — while much of the rest of the field quietly bets that the deluge of news about his son will sink Biden.) But the more immediate problem for almost everyone in the still-massive field not named Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, or Pete Buttigieg is money. Specifically, having enough of it to maintain real campaigns for the next few months.

That’s because impeachment, for this crowd, couldn’t have come at a more delicate time: the end of the final quarter before most pols believe the race gets serious, and therefore the exact moment they were banking on generating as much coverage and attention as possible, to raise as much money as possible — to keep afloat for as long as possible, or to finally make much-needed campaign hires and investments just as voters start paying serious attention. Take Cory Booker, whose campaign manager, Addisu Demissie, circulated a memo last Saturday morning ringing his own alarm. He wrote that if the senator didn’t raise $1.7 million in the final ten days of the quarter — which ends with September, on Monday — he would have to drop out, deprived of a “legitimate long-term path forward,” in Demissie’s words. This show of vulnerability (a classic Booker maneuver, to those who know him best and are used to his attention-grabbing tactics) seemed to work at first: Money poured in, setting him up to hit the stated mark. Other campaigns watched closely for clues as to how to replicate that success, since Demissie had simply stated out loud what a handful of other campaign managers would admit only in private about their finances. But Booker’s fundraising pace slowed as the week progressed, and as the impeachment inquiry comprehensively smothered attention to any other topic, including the Democratic primary and Booker’s push.

Booker may have raised enough in the first few days to survive. But the squeeze is now on.

“The media, prior to this, was already making it a three-to-five person race, and now there’s a solar eclipse of a story that will make it really, really difficult to drive any message,” says Glen Caplin, who was a senior advisor to Kirsten Gillibrand’s campaign. “The entire conversation now is going to be driven around Trump and impeachment, and it’s going to be a real challenge for candidates in the bottom five to get coverage, and even those in the top five to drive it on any given day.”

A senior aide to one candidate still in the race put it a little less delicately: “It sucks, actually. Impeachment’s gonna kill anyone who’s not a senator or in the top five. We’re fucked.”

The likely difficulty for candidates from El Paso to Minneapolis isn’t just an inability to break through in the saturated national media environment, though that is one concern. (“It’s been the most nationalized race I’ve ever seen, driven by nationalized media coverage,” said Caplin, who also worked for Hillary Clinton in 2016.) Instead, it’s the subsequent lack of cash that begets a long-term inability to build up infrastructure in early-voting states and to invest in paid advertising, which a consultant to a middle-tier campaign characterized as the “one way you can break through right now,” since ads aren’t dependent on the news cycle. And that doesn’t just determine whether candidates can make it to the next few debate stages, a necessary hurdle to long-term viability. In fact, “the choices that are going to be on the ballot in February and March are being set now,” said yet another senior aide helping lead a campaign struggling to stay afloat. “The main thing that is determining whether you can participate in that ultimate campaign is finances.”

Some candidates could raise money off their potential involvement in impeachment, most prominently the House members or the senators who could have a vote on Trump’s ultimate fate. (Supporters of Kamala Harris, for one, have been highlighting clips of her past questioning of Attorney General Bill Barr.) But this has, for now, proven an unconvincing pitch for potential supporters, according to people familiar with multiple candidates’ digital fundraising numbers.

So far, candidates are largely playing it safe and keeping their heads down — they’ll answer questions about impeachment when asked, and issue statements, but no campaign has yet reset its messaging to be all about Trump’s corruption or the investigation. Even billionaire Tom Steyer — who rose to national prominence in part by campaigning for Trump’s impeachment, and who doesn’t need to raise money but could use all the attention he can get — unveiled a new global climate plan on Friday, sticking to his pre-impeachment plan. Montana Governor Steve Bullock unveiled a public lands proposal. But as the week closed, some aides for other campaigns considered last-ditch direction changes at their “we’re fucked” meetings. “You basically have two choices: Say outlandish shit about impeachment, or do something so big that people have to pay attention. Hard to do at tier two or below,” said one top strategist for a candidate who will, at least, make the next debate stage.

And, as Julián Castro can attest, distinguishing oneself as especially aggressive on the investigations has little demonstrated upside for lower-tier contenders. The former Housing Secretary was the first candidate to call for Trump’s impeachment in April, but he saw little if any polling bump from it. Warren, on the other hand, jumpstarted her struggling campaign in part by making a similar call after Castro.

The best bet for some such hopefuls, then, might simply be hoping the pace of impeachment news slows, and that this week’s deluge proves atypical. “I’m not sure how long it’s gonna last,” said one strategist for a faltering campaign.

Castro, for one, appears to have a similar wish. And he needs all the help he can get. “I don’t say this lightly,” he wrote to supporters on Thursday. “If I don’t make the next debate stage, it will be the end of my campaign.”"

Are they simply marching, or are they politically engaged more generally? Here’s what I found.

Here’s how I did my research

AD

I collected data from participants at the Climate Strike in D.C. on Sept. 20. A 13-person research team (including me) snaked through the crowd as they lined up at John Marshall Park before they began marching, sampling every fifth person at designated increments to gather a field approximation of a random sample. In total, we collected data from 193 participants at the event, with a response rate of 79 percent.

AD

What we found is consistent with my findings from earlier research on the youth climate movement and on those with experience in what many have called the “resistance”: the broader movement that has been challenging President Trump’s administration and its polices since January 2017. Participants in the Climate Strike were predominantly female. The median age of the crowd was 22 years old. Three-quarters, or 76 percent, of the participants will be eligible to vote in the U.S. 2020 election. And their current levels of civic engagement strongly suggests they will vote.

As part of this survey, we asked participants the following question: “If the 2020 election were held today (no matter whether you are eligible to vote), who would you vote for?” Forty-one percent supported Elizabeth Warren, with by far the largest share. Bernie Sanders came in second with 20 percent of the support. Joe Biden was a distant third with 12 percent.

AD

Most participants in the Climate Strike identified as being on the political left, while 9 percent identified as politically moderate. Interestingly, those who identified themselves as “Very Left” on the political spectrum (24 percent of the crowd) also favored Warren (46 percent) over Sanders (33 percent).

AD

These activists are significantly more engaged in a range of political activities than the general American population: 46 percent reported contacting an elected official in the past year; 46 percent attended a public, town, or school meeting; and 44 percent engaged in consumer activism by boycotting or deliberately buying a certain product for political, ethical, or environmental reasons (“buycotting”).

Many report having been involved with more confrontational forms of political engagement as well. About a third of Climate Strikers, or 32 percent, reported participating in confrontational direct action in the past year.

AD

Given these levels of civic engagement and political experience, expect these new voices to make themselves heard in the upcoming elections. If the election’s outcome is not what they hoped for, don’t be surprised if there's more climate action in the streets. Based on the direct action we saw during ShutDownDC on Monday and Friday, as well as the other civil disobedience that took place around the U.S. this past week, these climate activists are willing to act.

When Holly Rigby got back to school last week, she received a special reception from her colleagues. They had seen her on the news, and wanted to congratulate her. A grassroots campaign committed to abolishing private schools, one she helped create just months ago, was officially endorsed by Labour — Britain’s main opposition party, the same that took the U.K. to war in Iraq alongside George W. Bush. Moreover, the party conference endorsed the most radical version of the proposal that her group, “Labour Against Private Schools,” put forward: The motion stipulates that all the endowments and property from elite schools like Eton (which educated Princes William and Harry, as well as a huge portion of the political class — like the current prime minister, Boris Johnson) be taken and “redistributed democratically and fairly across the country’s educational institutions.”

Then Rigby, 30, got back to work, teaching Romeo and Juliet to teenage students at a cash-strapped public school in Newham, East London. On her lunch break, she checked Twitter, and got another surprise. A campaign that her partner, William Stronge, created also got the approval of Party delegates and union members meeting in Brighton: The Labour Party officially committed to moving the United Kingdom to a four-day work week within a decade, and mentioned approvingly Stronge’s small think tank, which is inspired by an Italian anti-authoritarian Marxist tradition.

It was a lot for one day. “It’s all surreal,” said Rigby, who joined Labour to vote for Corbyn as party leader in 2015. This was all reverberating nationally as she taught in a school that uses a hallway as a makeshift classroom, in a neighborhood perhaps best known for a grime duo. The commentariat was already attacking the moves as lunacy, or maybe, somehow or another, comparable to fascism. But the activists had expected that, maybe even hoped for it. “If you take on the establishment, you expect to see the full force of the establishment fighting back against you.”

If conservatives in Britain didn’t already have enough reasons to believe that Labour had walked off the deep end of Brighton Pier, radical policy kept coming. The Party approved a plan for an ambitious, socialist “Green New Deal” that would make the U.K. carbon-neutral by 2030. Party leader Jeremy Corbyn committed to a state-owned drugs manufacturer to undercut Big Pharma, and declared that under a Labour government, workers would own 10 percent of large companies, all to raucous applause and the “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn” chant (set to the guitar line from the White Stripes’ extraordinarily popular jock jam, “Seven Nation Army”).

But everyone knows these moments of left-wing euphoria are to be short-lived. U.K. politics is a mess at the moment, largely because of the never-ending and endlessly confusing death spiral caused by Brexit (technically scheduled for Halloween next month), and Corbyn is very unpopular, even more so than Boris Johnson, despite an impressive record of failures the new prime minister has racked up in just a few weeks. In a likely election later this year, the left has a steep uphill battle if they want to come anywhere close to being able to implement these policies. But, ironically, some of the most dispiriting aspects of their current moment may have created the space for radical policy innovation.

The Labour Party approved a set of very radical policies last week for two reasons. First, leftist activists like Rigby around the country, supported by the pro-Corbyn Momentum campaign group, made a concerted effort to get a number of motions onto the Conference floor, where regional party delegates and unions (not elected politicians) vote on policy. Each year, around 10,000 or more people attend the Labour Party Annual Conference, which is technically the supreme, democratic decision-making body for Labour. Under Corbyn, the body of delegates and unions voting on motions has become much more radical than it was in the “New Labour” days of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. And secondly, party strategists believe that the more an upcoming election is fought over social policy, rather than Brexit, the better chance they have. Labour campaigned to remain in the European Union, and therefore lost the Brexit vote three years ago; even worse, the issue split their traditional working-class base. In an apparent attempt to keep together a shaky coalition of Leave and Remain voters, Corbyn has taken positions which many people find weak or confusing, contributing to his unpopularity.

“An election which is fought about public services and social policy would be vastly more advantageous to the Labour Party,” said Anthony Wells, director of political and social opinion polling at the YouGov agency. “But as it stands, it looks like it will take place entirely under the shadow of Brexit.”

In 2017, Corbyn started his general-election campaign far behind then-Prime Minister Theresa May, but after a radical policy manifesto featuring things like nationalizing energy, water, and railway infrastructure and putting workers on company boards, he caught up enough to deny May an outright parliamentary majority. These proposals, which are now popular with the electorate, remain party policy, and the addition of bold, even provocative socialist ideas this year, Labour members think, could be their best chance at repeating that modest success.

A snap YouGov poll after Rigby’s successful campaign showed that 50 percent of the country now opposes “banning private schools,” with only 22 percent supporting. But the campaigners say that over the next few months, they’ll be able to explain that they want to gradually “integrate” private schools into the public system, not just delete them off the face of the Earth, and they relish the opportunity to have that conversation — rather than talk about Brexit. The first step in the plan is to remove the special tax status granted to private schools, and that one is already popular. If it’s framed right, Labour’s new education policy won’t necessarily hurt them with voters at all, said Wells at YouGov.

Brexit was never supposed to happen, at least as far as its creator was concerned. Before former Prime Minister David Cameron ran for office in 2015, he promised anti-E.U. forces in his Conservative Party (also known as the Tories) a referendum on the European Union. It was a political calculation: a perfunctory vote that would pacify E.U. skeptics and rid him of the issue forever. Instead, Tories like Boris Johnson campaigned to Leave by painting a rosy picture of Brexit that many experts consider very misleading — and then won.

Whether Brexit as presented to the public in 2016 is even possible, the attempt to implement it has claimed two prime ministers so far, and may even take a third. David Cameron resigned, giving his successor, Theresa May, a few years to negotiate an exit deal with the European Union, which Parliament then rejected. More voices on the right began calling for a “no-deal” Brexit, the take-no-prisoners position that could mean unpredictable disruptions all across the country, from chaos at ports to shortages of some foods and medicine. Theresa May resigned in May after a vote of no-confidence in her government, and the confidently sloppy Johnson took over, walking into a stunning set of losses in Parliament, which entirely rejected his Brexit strategy. Johnson lost his first six votes in the House of Commons, and his casually patrician new House leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, went viral for lying down on the front bench. Rees-Mogg, who also attended Eton and campaigned in his 20s with his nanny alongside him, later said taking that particular position was a mistake. Johnson no longer has a coalition majority in Parliament, meaning he’s lost the power to actually govern, and on Tuesday the Supreme Court ruled he broke the law by asking the Queen to “prorogue,” or temporarily suspend, Parliament. Another election looks likely soon, maybe later this year.

“The Johnson camp are currently laying the groundwork for an election campaign framed chiefly around ‘the people’ on one side, and Parliament, or ‘the Establishment’ on the other,” said Matthew Goodwin, professor of politics at Kent University, who noted polls indicate there are plenty of people who seem comfortable with this approach. “That [campaign strategy] is aimed at unifying the Leave electorate,” split between the Tories and the Brexit Party created by Nigel Farage — until a few years ago, a fringe right-wing figure, but now a major player in U.K. politics.

One might expect that the main opposition party, which governed the U.K. successfully from 1997-2010, would benefit so much from years of Conservative flailing that they’d be way ahead in the polls. But it has not been so with Labour under Corbyn. In the 1970s, he was against joining the European Union in the first place, and while officially pro-Remain in 2016, he was not a very enthusiastic campaigner. Many suspected his heart wasn’t in it. Remain campaigners said be didn’t show up nearly enough to speak for their cause, and he told the BBC in 2016 he was “seven out of ten” on staying in the bloc. His current position is that if he is elected prime minister, Labour will negotiate a better deal with the E.U., then put that agreement to the electorate, which could also vote at that point just to stay in Europe. It’s a position critics call a fudge; one that leaves some hardcore Remainers unsatisfied and a swathe of the general public unsure of what it means.

Corbyn’s election as party leader was itself a shock to the establishment, since he is far to the left of the Labour leaders who won elections in the 1990s and 2000s, and it’s obvious many in the center and even center-left of institutions like Parliament and the media have never been excited about the idea of a radical Labour government. Even many of his ardent supporters admit, off the record or in bars at the spirited Labour Conference after-parties, that the aloof-seeming Corbyn hasn’t been effective in rallying the country in opposition to the Tories. And the scandal of anti-Semitism within his party has further damaged his reputation. A recent poll indicated he is the least popular opposition leader since the 1970s. In this rather bleak scenario, pushing good old-fashioned class warfare may be more likely to help than hurt.

“Corbyn himself is not popular,” said Goodwin. “But Corbynomics is more popular than many of his critics realize.”

In Brighton, much of the left-wing ebullience, as well as the pressure on the Party, came from “The World Transformed” (TWT), a radical festival backed by Momentum and several other organizations that takes place outside the main Conference. Founded in 2016, the year after Corbyn was elected party leader, the event now comprises hundreds of speeches, workshops on radical politics, and at least one event that could be called a rave.

For three years, the mostly younger attendees have literally surrounded official Party proceedings with leftist ideas. But there’s also back-and-forth between Corbyn’s Labour and the more radical elements. John McDonnell, Shadow Chancellor (the man who would run the economy), attended an event in a nightclub this year put on by Novara Media. Taking the stage with Ash Sarkar, who last year gained popularity after telling Piers Morgan, “I’m literally a communist, you idiot,” McDonnell was forced to play a tongue-in-cheek game of radical Wheel of Fortune, spinning for things like “Amazon,” “Buckingham Palace,” and “Grindr,” then answering which ones he would nationalize. At Conference, McDonnell said the U.K. should share green technologies with developing countries for free, as reparations for Britain’s colonial past.

While left-wing groups at TWT had discussed and dreamed about even more radical turns for the last three years, the Momentum campaign group decided this year to officially back policy motions, including the four-day week, banning private schools, the Green New Deal, and an end to immigration detention centers, which also passed. This meant working with activists to get motions up through the party bureaucracy and through the complicated negotiating process, gaining the backing of unions and party members from around the U.K.’s four countries (England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland).

“Our organization has been evolving for years, to the point where we could now put forward policies, and demonstrate we could have a bridge between the party and wider social movements,” said Laura Parker, Momentum’s national coordinator. She said radical policies are needed to win an upcoming election, especially because of international push for action on climate change. “We’re in a time of crisis — economic environmental crisis, and now, political crisis — and people have had enough.”

In Brighton, there was also a bridge to other countries, including the United States. Labour for a Green New Deal campaign co-director Clare Hyner said they chose the “New Deal” framing after seeing the success it had when pushed by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the United States, even though the New Deal itself is a very American historical reference. Representatives from Justice Democrats, which endorsed candidates like AOC and Ilhan Omar, as well as the Bernie Sanders campaign, spoke at TWT. But most of the policies discussed here — and indeed, endorsed by Labour — are far to the left of anything in the Democratic Party.

Not everyone at The World Transformed was thinking primarily about electoral politics. Paddy Bettington, one of the organizers of the four-day-week campaign, got involved after experiences in his own life. Bettington, 33, works for a company that produces stage equipment. While preparing for the London 2012 Olympics, he felt badly overworked. So after the Games, he managed to cut down his working week by a day. By freeing up just a little time for other things — including political education and activism — he said his life improved immensely.

“We have a very narrow idea of what politics is, largely because we’re used to a form of politics that hasn’t really changed since Reagan and Thatcher. This campaign is about broadening that understanding, and discussing more long-term, ambitious goals,” Bettington said. Like many of the campaigners who won this year, he also joined Labour in 2015 in order to elect Corbyn leader. He didn’t have a ticket to the main Labour Conference event, so he watched in shock from a red and white circus tent with a beer as they approved his motion. “The five-day week is just one example of something that is very easy to assume is natural, or unchangeable. But we could do things in an entirely different way.”"

“I do think things have changed. . . . You have to recalibrate based on the fact that Trump’s attacks on you are going to be at the center of these impeachment hearings,” said Larry Rasky, a longtime ally of Biden who had senior roles in his two previous presidential campaigns. Rasky said he worries Biden’s campaign has been naive about the amount of resources needed to counter Trump.

The new demand that Biden simultaneously run a general-election matchup with Trump and a primary campaign against several formidable Democratic challengers risks straining a campaign that started later and has organized more slowly than some of his rivals’ efforts.

Biden’s campaign for now seems to have settled on an approach similar to the one Democrats used in the 2018 midterms, trying to ignore Trump as much as possible to focus instead on issues they believe are more resonant with voters.

Biden, who has insisted his election would return the country to normalcy, has over the past several days largely sought to avoid the political spasm in which he is now a central figure. His campaign has sent out daily statements on health care and other issues, as if leaning toward predictability in a highly unpredictable time. He has only sporadically talked about Trump’s attacks on him and his son Hunter.

At a fundraiser Saturday in Park City, Utah, the host, Barry Baker, called Trump a “lying, narcissistic traitor, cheater,” while Biden over the course of a 20-minute speech did not mention impeachment or the president’s dealings with Ukraine.

“This isn’t about me. . . . It’s a tactic that’s used by this president to try to hijack an election so we do not focus on the issues that matter in our lives,” Biden said last week.

AD

AD

Biden has sent out a string of fundraising emails — which his campaign says resulted in its best donation week since early in the campaign — and some longtime confidants hope he can avoid getting dragged into Trump’s bombastic antagonism. They have called or messaged Biden and urged him to avoid getting into a bitter back-and-forth with the president, reminding him that the political landscape is littered with foes whose character Trump has dirtied.

“For Joe Biden to get down in the mud with this guy, whatever stank on him will run off on Joe,” said Dick Harpootlian, a Democratic state senator from South Carolina and a longtime Biden supporter. “He’s handling it the way he should — with restraint I could not handle on my best day. I mean, [Trump] is coming after his family. In my part of the country, there would be fisticuffs over this.”

“Trump is goading him,” he added. “But if you want a Democratic Donald Trump who screams and yells and lies, then you need to vote for someone else. Because that isn’t Joe Biden.”

Already the Trump onslaught has had an impact on the Democratic side of the presidential race, overshadowing efforts by Biden and others to more pointedly put Warren on defense on a host of issues.

Yet the benefit to Biden, as some of his advisers see it, is the possibility that Democrats will view his response as statesmanlike and rally behind him amid attacks they see as unfair. So far they say the approach is providing dividends.

“Joe Biden, Donald Trump and Nancy Pelosi are the three most important people in American politics right now,” said Sean Bagniewski, chairman of the Polk County Democrats in Iowa, who is neutral in the race. “It propels him to the limelight in ways that other folks don’t get. It seems everybody else is playing catch-up; they are trying to get the limelight back.”

The impeachment proceedings underway in the House followed revelations that Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden and his son. The administration had previously held up congressionally approved aid to Ukraine, which is in the midst of a conflict with Russia after its invasion of the Ukrainian territory Crimea.

Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner earlier came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.

Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.

AD

AD

Trump has delved into exaggeration and falsehoods in his fusillade of accusations against Biden. Yet the episode also has raised the uncomfortable question for Biden about whether he should have allowed his son to make money from a Ukrainian company at the same time he was overseeing the Obama administration’s efforts to crack down on corruption there. Already, several of Biden’s presidential foes have obliquely engaged on that topic.

Ed Rendell, former Pennsylvania governor and a top Biden supporter, said he thought Biden has handled the issue “just perfectly” so far, but he quickly added that it’s hard to tell whether the accusations will have a lingering impact.

“I don’t think Democrats will think there’s any truth to the attack,” Rendell said. “But some might worry that if Biden gets elected, there will be all sorts of grand juries, and Republicans will look into this stuff. . . . Not that Democrats believe Joe would do anything corrupt, but just that it would be charge and countercharge.”

AD

AD

The episode has crystallized an existing sense of anxiety among some of Biden’s top donors and longtime supporters about his campaign. Some allies have been expressing concerns for weeks that Biden doesn’t seem to be the happy warrior he had been in previous campaigns. They have urged him and the campaign to adopt a more assertive and focused message, one that puts the middle class front and center.

Some of those worries have led to preliminary discussions, in Chicago and Washington, over whether to launch a pro-Biden super PAC. Biden’s campaign has publicly discouraged any outside assistance, which could open him to attacks from Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) that he is being bankrolled by wealthy interests. Those discussions, first reported by the New York Times, are ongoing.

Among those involved have been Rasky; former Biden staffer Mark Doyle; Julianna Smoot, a Democratic fundraiser who led Barack Obama’s campaign finance team in 2008 and was deputy campaign manager in 2012; and Democratic consultant Mark Riddle.

In a sign of what Biden is up against, the Trump campaign announced Friday the $10 million ad campaign focused on Biden, his son and Ukraine. It includes a video snippet of Biden saying the United States would withhold a $1 billion loan guarantee if Ukraine did not fire the corrupt prosecutor.

“But when President Trump asks Ukraine to investigate corruption, the Democrats want to impeach him,” the narrator says. “They lost the election. Now they want to steal this one. Don’t let them.”

The Biden campaign has attempted to reassure donors and has sent out talking points to allies to encourage a public response to Trump.

“We’re in a battle for the soul of this nation, and Donald Trump just revealed to the entire world how terrified he is that he’ll lose it to Joe Biden,” Andrew Bates, a campaign spokesman, said in a statement. “That’s because the contrast between the vice president and Donald Trump couldn’t be more powerful.”

On Sunday, two top Biden campaign officials sent a letter to the heads of major news and cable networks, urging them not to book Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani. “By giving [Giuliani] your air time, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation,” the letter from Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield reads.

While conceding that they are in a highly unpredictable environment, Biden advisers say their candidate will ultimately benefit from contrasts with Trump over issues and leadership.

“A lot of us who know Joe Biden think it’s incredibly unfair,” said Tom Vilsack, a former Iowa governor who served as agriculture secretary in the Obama administration. “And it’s a tactic some folks have used in the past to gain political advantage, and . . . we shouldn’t allow that. As voters, we should say, ‘Hell no, we’re not going to do that.’ ”

Vilsack, who remains uncommitted in the Democratic primary, said voters should focus on how Biden has avoided getting caught up in personal attacks. He added that the current environment is showcasing what a general election between the two men would look like — which could calm voters.

“The Biden campaign seems to be able to handle the attacks,” he said. “We really don’t know what the attacks about these other candidates are going to be.”

Some Biden allies privately draw a contrast with Warren and Trump’s assault over her past claims of Native American heritage. Afterward, she dropped rapidly in the polls; she has risen steadily over the past six months at a time when Biden was bearing the brunt of Trump’s criticism.

Alan Feirer, the party chairman in Madison County, Iowa, has expressed some skepticism of Biden in the past but said he is impressed by how he handled the past week.

“We’ve been reminded what a statesman he is because he hasn’t risen to the bait of what Trump was presenting over the past few days,” said Feirer, who is staying neutral. “I don’t think it’s instilled doubt or anything. If anything, it’s instilled more confidence and reminded people why they like him. He’s been classy.”"

Indeed, that history makes it very difficult not to see this as at least an implicit quid pro quo.

In the phone call, Trump makes multiple references to how good the United States is to Ukraine, and Zelensky then refers to buying U.S. military weaponry — “Javelins.” Trump then quickly launches into a “favor” he wants, an investigation related to the 2016 election, and then mentions another investigation, related to Joe and Hunter Biden. Judging by the rough transcript, what Trump hoped to get from the call was obvious.

AD

AD

But let’s try to suspend our disbelief for a minute. Let’s pretend it could just be some kind of amazing coincidence that Trump was talking about all the nice things he did for Ukraine just before asking a “favor.” Let’s ignore the power imbalance in their relationship and the fact that Trump had reportedly been withholding a meeting from Ukraine, and then appeared to grant it the moment Zelensky said he would pursue the investigations.

Even setting aside all that, Trump’s history speaks volumes.

His former personal attorney Michael Cohen explained in his testimony how Trump tells you to do problematic things.

“It would be no different than if I said: ‘That’s the nicest-looking tie I’ve ever seen. Isn’t it?’ What are you going to do? Are you going to fight with him? The answer is no,” Cohen said. “So you say, ‘Yeah, it’s the nicest-looking tie I’ve ever seen.’ That’s how he speaks.”

AD

AD

Cohen added: “He doesn’t give you orders. He speaks in code. And I understand the code because I’ve been around him for decades.”

Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s report includes other examples of Trump using just such a code. When he wants FBI Director James B. Comey to back off Michael Flynn, he doesn’t say it in so many words. He says, “I hope you can let this go,” according to Comey.

Mueller reasoned that Trump’s meaning was pretty clear:

A second question is whether the President’s statements, which were not phrased as a direct order to Comey, could impede or interfere with the FBI’s investigation of Flynn. While the President said he “hope[d]” Comey could “let[] Flynn go,” rather than affirmatively directing him to do so, the circumstances of the conversation show that the President was asking Comey to close the FBI’s investigation into Flynn.

Mueller adds that, “because the President is the head of the executive branch, when he says that he ‘hopes’ a subordinate will do something, it is reasonable to expect that the subordinate will do what the President wants.”

AD

Zelensky doesn’t report to Trump, but there is a similar power imbalance.

Trump’s alleged request for “loyalty” from Comey is also in this vein. Again, from the Mueller report:

AD

According to Comey’s account, at one point during the dinner the President stated, “I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.” Comey did not respond and the conversation moved on to other topics, but the President returned to the subject of Comey’s job at the end of the dinner and repeated, “I need loyalty.”: Comey responded, “You will always get honesty from me.” The President said, “That’s what I want, honest loyalty.” Comey said, “You will get that from me.”

The White House disputed this account, but Mueller found it to be credible and consistent. And it tracks with the idea that Trump knew that asking for “loyalty” was code for something else.

Another example involves Trump’s apparent repeated efforts to shutter the Mueller probe. At one point in August 2018, he tweeted, “This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further.”

AD

..This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further. Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 1, 2018

Then-White House press secretary Sarah Sanders would soon clarify that “the president is stating his opinion; it’s not an order.” Except then we found out that Trump did try to shut down the investigation — including by trying to get others to apply pressure on Sessions. Then-White House counsel Donald McGahn interpreted Trump’s entreaties as orders, and Trump aides Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn both declined to deliver messages to Sessions because they viewed them as problematic.

AD

(Lewandowski, implausibly, explained in testimony this month that he had merely gone “on vacation” and never had the right forum to deliver the message. Mueller’s report says plainly that Lewandowski “did not want to deliver the President’s message personally” and that “Dearborn was uncomfortable with the task and did not follow through.”)

There are, of course, times when officials have interpreted Trump in a more friendly light. One of them is former National Security Agency director Michael Rogers. Again, from the Mueller report:

AD

On March 26, 2017, the day after the President called [then-Director of National Intelligence Daniel] Coats, the President called NSA Director Admiral Michael Rogers. The President expressed frustration with the Russia investigation, saying that it made relations with the Russians difficult. The President told Rogers “the thing with the Russians [wa]s messing up” his ability to get things done with Russia. The President also said that the news stories linking him with Russia were not true and asked Rogers if he could do anything to refute the stories. Deputy Director of the NSA Richard Ledgett, who was present for the call, said it was the most unusual thing he had experienced in 40 years of government service. After the call concluded, Ledgett prepared a memorandum that he and Rogers both signed documenting the content of the conversation and the President’s request, and they placed the memorandum in a safe. But Rogers did not perceive the President’s request to be an order, and the President did not ask Rogers to push back on the Russia investigation itself. Rogers later testified in a congressional hearing that as NSA Director he had “never been directed to do anything [he] believe[d] to be illegal, immoral, unethical or inappropriate” and did not recall ever feeling pressured to do so.”

Zelensky seems to be taking the Rogers approach, insisting this week that he didn’t feel pressured by Trump — and also adding that he never actually “push[ed]” his “independent” prosecutor general. He has every reason to leave that impression, of course, if for no other reason than to avoid alienating the very powerful U.S. president who has apparently been leaning on him pretty hard, and to make it look as if he’s not Trump’s stooge.

But if you look at the examples above, is it really at all ambiguous that Trump dances around problematic requests like this and clearly wanted to leave the impression that bad things could happen if Zelensky didn’t play ball?

Trump has exploited plausible deniability throughout his presidency; at some point, people who suspend their disbelief are truly doing so willfully.

Good luck with that.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/09/29/biden-campaign-wants-rudy-giuliani-off-tv-news-good-luck-with-that/,"The request comes after Giuliani made his usual Sunday rounds to push Trump’s interests. On ABC’s “This Week,” he defended his scandal-mongering on behalf of the president over Ukraine, the center of a full-blown scandal that crystallized over the past week. Giuliani has attempted to convince the country that when Joe Biden served as vice president, he sought and secured the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor — Viktor Shokin — who was pursuing a case against an energy company, Burisma Holdings, where his son Hunter Biden served on the board of directors. As the New York Times reported in May — and other outlets have confirmed — there’s no evidence to that effect. In fact, the reporting points in the other direction — that Joe Biden was acting in accordance with an international consensus, not to mention a well-cemented position within the U.S. government and that Shokin wasn’t actively pursuing Burisma at the time in any case.

As Giuliani put forth his arguments, ABC News’s George Stephanopoulos tried to confine him to the facts. That was hard. Example:

STEPHANOPOULOS: OK, you -- you've gotten those charges out there. Let’s talk about -- GIULIANI: No, no, I haven’t gotten them out there. STEPHANOPOULOS: But you have gotten them out there. GIULIANI: No, I haven’t.

Whether it’s Cuomo or Stephanopoulos or CBS News’s Margaret Brennan, all of Giuliani’s interviewers prepare themselves for his tacks, his evasions, his falsehoods. On this front, the Biden campaign’s letter credits the news organizations: “While you have been aggressive in pushing back on him in real time, it is well known that the dedicated liar always has the advantage, pushing out outlandish falsehoods and disinformation in the knowledge that it is hard for the corrections to catch up,” notes the letter from the Biden campaign.

In this vein, the Biden letter merges with a million pleas from social media users dating to the onset of the Trump presidential period. This crowd pleaded with cable-news networks, particularly CNN, to scale back live broadcasts of Trump’s 2016 campaign rallies; they spoke up again over Sean Spicer’s lie-heavy White House briefings, as well as those of his successor, Sarah Sanders; they shouted down the falsehoods so routinely spouted by Trump surrogates wherever they popped up on television. And, of course, they spoke up about the president himself, whose penchant for lies and stray falsehoods outpaced the frantic efforts of well-meaning journalists scouring source documents.

None of it has worked. The commitment of mainstream news outlets to shop for input from both sides — no matter the ethical failings of one — is decades old. Executives in TV news have grown gray swearing by this maxim, one that had never been meaningfully challenged before the accession of Trump. The perils of this approach, by contrast, are just a few years in the making. Though the Trump period feels old and tired and rote, its core challenge to journalism is still fresh.

The Biden campaign letter is a well-phrased appeal that will in all likelihood go nowhere. Interviews with Giuliani, after all, begin with viral potential that most segments don’t pack. Cuomo’s tete-a-tete with the Trump lawyer this month, for example, will fit nicely into his career highlights. Swearing off a guest of this sort won’t happen just because he befouls your network’s air. To take a quote from the Biden campaign letter: “Giuliani is not enlightening your viewers in any way. He’s not offering a unique or informed perspective.”

As if those have ever been booking criteria for TV news outlets.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) recently delivered impassioned remarks on unions but tacked on a statement about impeachment beforehand after consulting with aides. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) fielded questions about Medicare-for-all at a town hall last week, then faced inquiries from reporters on impeachment. Former vice president Joe Biden spent a few minutes discussing impeachment at a recent stop before turning to an abbreviated version of his usual speech.

“It definitely throws a monkey wrench into everybody’s talking points,” said Rep. Matthew Cartwright (D-Pa.), who supports Biden and endorsed an impeachment inquiry for the first time last week. “It’s something extra that they have to talk about.”

While leading Democrats increasingly demand forceful statements on Trump’s actions, many voters and activists are urging candidates not to stop talking about how they would provide health insurance to more Americans, shrink the gap between rich and poor, and combat climate change. Some bluntly warn that devoting too much attention to impeachment could be a costly mistake.

“Impeachment is an afterthought for a lot of people,” said Elesha Gayman, chair of the Scott County Democratic Party in Iowa. “I appreciate them coming out with a statement, but that’s about where it needs to end. I think the most important thing to carry forward for the Democrats is going to be having a message and a vision for what they are going to bring to the table.”

She added, “I think, especially in the Democratic Party, we lose elections when we make it about ‘we’re better than the other guy’ and we don’t lay out a vision.”

What’s clear is that the furor in Washington injects another huge dose of uncertainty, at a critical moment, into a contest that was already highly fluid. The field is likely to winnow soon, and the impeachment focus threatens to take even more oxygen from hopefuls who already had limited time to make an impact.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) took the rare step of beginning impeachment proceedings against Trump last week after he acknowledged urging the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Many Democrats say dislodging Trump from office is unlikely, given the strong support for him in the Republican-controlled Senate, where a two-thirds vote is needed for removal.

Nevertheless, the Democratic presidential field has largely lined up behind Pelosi, endorsing her inquiry and vocally condemning Trump’s conduct. A whistleblower complaint at the center of the controversy alleges that Trump misused his office for personal gain and that unidentified White House officials took improper actions to keep it a secret. Trump has said he did nothing wrong.

Some voters expressed concerns about the Democrats forging ahead on impeachment. Diana Kroeger, 52, an independent from Hollis, N.H., who stood in line for a photo with Warren after her Friday town hall event there, said “I’m worried” about the process, fearing it will further divide the country.

Will Norona, an autoworker from Flint, Mich., who walked a picket line in front of a GM plant in Detroit last week with Sanders, said he worried that focusing on impeachment could take attention away from other issues.

“Our focus is on this,” said Norona, 43, speaking of the autoworkers’ strike.

But other Democrats, believing Trump to be increasingly vulnerable, want to see the candidates call him out more aggressively than ever.

“They’ve got to keep the focus on Trump while hot lights are on him,” said Gilda Cobb-Hunter, president of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators and a veteran South Carolina Democrat.

Shawana Love, 42, an undecided voter who also joined the picket line in Detroit, said seeing the Democrats take steps toward impeaching Trump gets her more excited about the election. “Impeach his a--!” Love said.

The fast-moving developments and clashing voter sentiments are prompting many of the candidates to dedicate valuable time at campaign events — and devote space on their social media pages — to responding to the latest Trump news with outrage.

But they are taking different tacks.

Warren has been pointing out that she advocated impeachment proceedings long before the recent revelations about Trump’s conversation with the Ukrainian president. Warren has been rising in the polls, and some of her rivals have begun criticizing her policies, but the impeachment furor could make that harder with so much attention focused on Trump.

“The way to hold this president of the United States accountable is to impeach him,” Warren told reporters after Friday’s town hall. “So I hope we go forward with care and deliberation, but that we do it quickly. I think it’s important. The American people are counting on us.”

AD

AD

Some Warren allies say she is well-suited to talk about the issue because it is in line with one of her core campaign themes: tackling corruption.

“For Elizabeth Warren, it’s right in the middle of the bull’s eye,” said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Warren. “Assuming this keeps going, I would be surprised if she didn’t integrate it more and more into her stump speech.”

Still, the current landscape presents the paradox that if Trump were to be removed — a remote prospect at the moment — the Democratic nominee would presumably be running against Vice President Pence, not the figure they’ve been railing against for months.

AD

Sanders has been more cautious about the prospect of impeachment. While he also supports an inquiry, a point he has emphasized repeatedly in recent days, he has long focused on policy, and he warned Democrats not to abandon work on other important issues.

AD

“The Congress of the United States must show the American people that it can walk and chew gum at the same time,” Sanders said last week in Davenport, Iowa.

Warren, Sanders and the four other senators in the race have to keep another variable in mind: They would effectively become jurors in a Senate trial if the House votes to impeach Trump and Senate leaders move ahead with a judicial proceeding.

AD

“Let’s have that trial in the United States Senate,” Sanders said in Plymouth, N.H., on Sunday. “I will do my best to look at the facts as objectively as I can.”

Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) has sought to use the impeachment inquiry to remind voters of her experience as a prosecutor and a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Harris canceled a recent fundraiser in Los Angeles to fly back to Washington for a meeting of the Senate Intelligence Committee, to which she also belongs.

AD

Biden is tethered to the situation more directly than any other candidate. During a July 25 phone call, Trump requested that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky investigate Biden, according to a rough transcript of the conversation that the White House released. Biden’s son Hunter had served on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power. Hunter Biden was not accused of wrongdoing.

AD

As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who many Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.

Despite the centrality of his role, Biden has been more reticent than some of his rivals when it comes to impeachment.

AD

At a recent fundraiser in Southern California, Biden said that he and his family had done nothing wrong and accused Trump of trying to “hijack an election so we do not focus on the issues that matter in our lives.” He added, “This is not about me.”

Rufus Gifford, a former ambassador to Denmark who has donated to Biden and other candidates this year, said he sees both opportunity and peril for the former vice president.

“It’s very much a double-edged sword. On one hand, anyone kind of wants to be mano a mano with Trump right now,” said Gifford, who was finance director for Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign. At the same time, Gifford said, it could prompt some Democrats to question whether the Ukraine situation would be a vulnerability for Biden — chipping away at his assertion that he’s the most electable Democrat — and “those questions have to be answered.”

In the meantime, the drama set to unfold in coming weeks — likely to feature explosive congressional hearings, angry partisan debates, bitterly contested votes on the House floor and possibly further revelations about Trump — adds a daunting, unpredictable dynamic that, even more than the campaign so far, is outside the candidates’ control.

As South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said recently, “Nobody knows what the political consequences of impeachment are.”"

But something deeper is happening.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/09/30/democrats-have-moved-left-taxes-something-deeper-is-happening/,"While Sanders may be still be on the left of the Democratic Party, the economic proposals this campaign is producing show how much the conversation around the economy has changed among Democrats, even those who are ostensibly more moderate.

Here’s what Sanders is proposing:

Under Sanders’s plan, the government would increase a firm’s corporate tax rate if its highest-paid employee earns more than 50 times what its average worker does — an attempt to encourage companies to distribute their profits more equitably. The plan would apply only to companies with more than $100 million in annual revenue.

So if the median employee makes $40,000 a year and the CEO makes more than $2 million a year, the corporation would have to pay a higher tax rate.

AD

I’m a bit skeptical about this as a policy solution, since it seems more likely that if it were in place a company would find ways to reduce its chief executive’s pay to avoid the tax rather than raising the pay of employees, which ought to be the primary goal.

AD

But there’s no question that the gap between CEO pay and workers’ pay is obscene. In 2018, according to the Economic Policy Institute, the ratio of CEO to median worker’s pay at top corporations last year was a remarkable 278 to 1 (or 221 to 1 depending on which measure you use to account for stock options). At some large corporations, the ratio is over 1,000 to 1. Over the past 40 years, while worker pay has only grown by 12 percent in inflation-adjusted terms, CEO pay has grown by more than 1,000 percent.

Sanders’s approach to this problem is a kind of outside-in one: Tell the companies they’ll be punished if the outcome of their pay reflects this glaring inequality, and then let them figure out how to fix it.

AD

Warren, in contrast, has a proposal that is in many ways more fundamental. She would mandate that large corporations serve the interests of all stakeholders (including their workers and the communities where they’re located), not just their shareholders. And she would require that 40 percent of the seats on corporate boards be filled by people elected by employees. “Codetermination” systems are in place in other countries, most notably Germany, where they seem to produce less short-term thinking (and lower CEO pay) without sacrificing economic success.

AD

But what’s striking about these kind of proposals is that they’re intended to question some of the basic premises on which our economic system has been operating for decades — and that’s now mainstream thinking in the Democratic Party. Even Joe Biden, who’s running as a moderate, is considering proposing a financial transactions tax on Wall Street, which used to be something advocated only by progressives like Warren and Sanders.

To see what an extraordinary change this is, let’s recall the tax policies of the two most recent Democratic presidents. In 1993, Bill Clinton passed a budget that included, among other things, an increase in the top income tax rate from 31 percent to 39.6 percent. At the time, Republicans predicted that this would immediately plunge the United States into an outright economic cataclysm. Of course, the opposite happened: We experienced a dramatic boom, just one of the many times that reality has proved Republicans’ economic predictions to be 180 degrees wrong.

AD

But the point is that even though it raised plenty of revenue and helped lead to a balanced budget, Clinton’s tax increase was relatively modest. Just seven years before, the top rate had been 50 percent.

AD

Then after George W. Bush cut the top rate to 35 percent, Barack Obama eventually negotiated a deal whereby the Bush cuts would be retained for all but the wealthiest, bringing the top rate back to 39.6 percent — an even smaller increase than Clinton’s. In 2016, Hillary Clinton offered an intricate tax proposal that would have raised taxes on the top 1 percent of earners by about 5 percent.

So while Democrats have wanted to raise taxes on the wealthy pretty much since they were dramatically lowered under Ronald Reagan, up until now the ideas have been mostly about tweaking things around the edges. While it’s not inaccurate to say the party has “moved left” in the time since, what has really happened is that Democrats have decided that it’s politically safe to advocate for things that they probably supported years ago but worried wouldn’t fly with the electorate.

AD

And they still might not. But with inequality at unprecedented levels and polls consistently showing that wide majorities of Americans believe the biggest problem with the tax system is that corporations and wealthy people get away without paying their fair share, the last thing Republicans probably want is to have an argument about whether we should be tougher on corporations and the wealthy.

AD

But that is indeed the argument we’re going to have in 2020.

When Holly Rigby got back to school last week, she received a special reception from her colleagues. They had seen her on the news, and wanted to congratulate her. A grassroots campaign committed to abolishing private schools, one she helped create just months ago, was officially endorsed by Labour — Britain’s main opposition party, the same that took the U.K. to war in Iraq alongside George W. Bush. Moreover, the party conference endorsed the most radical version of the proposal that her group, “Labour Against Private Schools,” put forward: The motion stipulates that all the endowments and property from elite schools like Eton (which educated Princes William and Harry, as well as a huge portion of the political class — like the current prime minister, Boris Johnson) be taken and “redistributed democratically and fairly across the country’s educational institutions.”

Then Rigby, 30, got back to work, teaching Romeo and Juliet to teenage students at a cash-strapped public school in Newham, East London. On her lunch break, she checked Twitter, and got another surprise. A campaign that her partner, William Stronge, created also got the approval of Party delegates and union members meeting in Brighton: The Labour Party officially committed to moving the United Kingdom to a four-day work week within a decade, and mentioned approvingly Stronge’s small think tank, which is inspired by an Italian anti-authoritarian Marxist tradition.

It was a lot for one day. “It’s all surreal,” said Rigby, who joined Labour to vote for Corbyn as party leader in 2015. This was all reverberating nationally as she taught in a school that uses a hallway as a makeshift classroom, in a neighborhood perhaps best known for a grime duo. The commentariat was already attacking the moves as lunacy, or maybe, somehow or another, comparable to fascism. But the activists had expected that, maybe even hoped for it. “If you take on the establishment, you expect to see the full force of the establishment fighting back against you.”

If conservatives in Britain didn’t already have enough reasons to believe that Labour had walked off the deep end of Brighton Pier, radical policy kept coming. The Party approved a plan for an ambitious, socialist “Green New Deal” that would make the U.K. carbon-neutral by 2030. Party leader Jeremy Corbyn committed to a state-owned drugs manufacturer to undercut Big Pharma, and declared that under a Labour government, workers would own 10 percent of large companies, all to raucous applause and the “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn” chant (set to the guitar line from the White Stripes’ extraordinarily popular jock jam, “Seven Nation Army”).

But everyone knows these moments of left-wing euphoria are to be short-lived. U.K. politics is a mess at the moment, largely because of the never-ending and endlessly confusing death spiral caused by Brexit (technically scheduled for Halloween next month), and Corbyn is very unpopular, even more so than Boris Johnson, despite an impressive record of failures the new prime minister has racked up in just a few weeks. In a likely election later this year, the left has a steep uphill battle if they want to come anywhere close to being able to implement these policies. But, ironically, some of the most dispiriting aspects of their current moment may have created the space for radical policy innovation.

The Labour Party approved a set of very radical policies last week for two reasons. First, leftist activists like Rigby around the country, supported by the pro-Corbyn Momentum campaign group, made a concerted effort to get a number of motions onto the Conference floor, where regional party delegates and unions (not elected politicians) vote on policy. Each year, around 10,000 or more people attend the Labour Party Annual Conference, which is technically the supreme, democratic decision-making body for Labour. Under Corbyn, the body of delegates and unions voting on motions has become much more radical than it was in the “New Labour” days of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. And secondly, party strategists believe that the more an upcoming election is fought over social policy, rather than Brexit, the better chance they have. Labour campaigned to remain in the European Union, and therefore lost the Brexit vote three years ago; even worse, the issue split their traditional working-class base. In an apparent attempt to keep together a shaky coalition of Leave and Remain voters, Corbyn has taken positions which many people find weak or confusing, contributing to his unpopularity.

“An election which is fought about public services and social policy would be vastly more advantageous to the Labour Party,” said Anthony Wells, director of political and social opinion polling at the YouGov agency. “But as it stands, it looks like it will take place entirely under the shadow of Brexit.”

In 2017, Corbyn started his general-election campaign far behind then-Prime Minister Theresa May, but after a radical policy manifesto featuring things like nationalizing energy, water, and railway infrastructure and putting workers on company boards, he caught up enough to deny May an outright parliamentary majority. These proposals, which are now popular with the electorate, remain party policy, and the addition of bold, even provocative socialist ideas this year, Labour members think, could be their best chance at repeating that modest success.

A snap YouGov poll after Rigby’s successful campaign showed that 50 percent of the country now opposes “banning private schools,” with only 22 percent supporting. But the campaigners say that over the next few months, they’ll be able to explain that they want to gradually “integrate” private schools into the public system, not just delete them off the face of the Earth, and they relish the opportunity to have that conversation — rather than talk about Brexit. The first step in the plan is to remove the special tax status granted to private schools, and that one is already popular. If it’s framed right, Labour’s new education policy won’t necessarily hurt them with voters at all, said Wells at YouGov.

Brexit was never supposed to happen, at least as far as its creator was concerned. Before former Prime Minister David Cameron ran for office in 2015, he promised anti-E.U. forces in his Conservative Party (also known as the Tories) a referendum on the European Union. It was a political calculation: a perfunctory vote that would pacify E.U. skeptics and rid him of the issue forever. Instead, Tories like Boris Johnson campaigned to Leave by painting a rosy picture of Brexit that many experts consider very misleading — and then won.

Whether Brexit as presented to the public in 2016 is even possible, the attempt to implement it has claimed two prime ministers so far, and may even take a third. David Cameron resigned, giving his successor, Theresa May, a few years to negotiate an exit deal with the European Union, which Parliament then rejected. More voices on the right began calling for a “no-deal” Brexit, the take-no-prisoners position that could mean unpredictable disruptions all across the country, from chaos at ports to shortages of some foods and medicine. Theresa May resigned in May after a vote of no-confidence in her government, and the confidently sloppy Johnson took over, walking into a stunning set of losses in Parliament, which entirely rejected his Brexit strategy. Johnson lost his first six votes in the House of Commons, and his casually patrician new House leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, went viral for lying down on the front bench. Rees-Mogg, who also attended Eton and campaigned in his 20s with his nanny alongside him, later said taking that particular position was a mistake. Johnson no longer has a coalition majority in Parliament, meaning he’s lost the power to actually govern, and on Tuesday the Supreme Court ruled he broke the law by asking the Queen to “prorogue,” or temporarily suspend, Parliament. Another election looks likely soon, maybe later this year.

“The Johnson camp are currently laying the groundwork for an election campaign framed chiefly around ‘the people’ on one side, and Parliament, or ‘the Establishment’ on the other,” said Matthew Goodwin, professor of politics at Kent University, who noted polls indicate there are plenty of people who seem comfortable with this approach. “That [campaign strategy] is aimed at unifying the Leave electorate,” split between the Tories and the Brexit Party created by Nigel Farage — until a few years ago, a fringe right-wing figure, but now a major player in U.K. politics.

One might expect that the main opposition party, which governed the U.K. successfully from 1997-2010, would benefit so much from years of Conservative flailing that they’d be way ahead in the polls. But it has not been so with Labour under Corbyn. In the 1970s, he was against joining the European Union in the first place, and while officially pro-Remain in 2016, he was not a very enthusiastic campaigner. Many suspected his heart wasn’t in it. Remain campaigners said be didn’t show up nearly enough to speak for their cause, and he told the BBC in 2016 he was “seven out of ten” on staying in the bloc. His current position is that if he is elected prime minister, Labour will negotiate a better deal with the E.U., then put that agreement to the electorate, which could also vote at that point just to stay in Europe. It’s a position critics call a fudge; one that leaves some hardcore Remainers unsatisfied and a swathe of the general public unsure of what it means.

Corbyn’s election as party leader was itself a shock to the establishment, since he is far to the left of the Labour leaders who won elections in the 1990s and 2000s, and it’s obvious many in the center and even center-left of institutions like Parliament and the media have never been excited about the idea of a radical Labour government. Even many of his ardent supporters admit, off the record or in bars at the spirited Labour Conference after-parties, that the aloof-seeming Corbyn hasn’t been effective in rallying the country in opposition to the Tories. And the scandal of anti-Semitism within his party has further damaged his reputation. A recent poll indicated he is the least popular opposition leader since the 1970s. In this rather bleak scenario, pushing good old-fashioned class warfare may be more likely to help than hurt.

“Corbyn himself is not popular,” said Goodwin. “But Corbynomics is more popular than many of his critics realize.”

In Brighton, much of the left-wing ebullience, as well as the pressure on the Party, came from “The World Transformed” (TWT), a radical festival backed by Momentum and several other organizations that takes place outside the main Conference. Founded in 2016, the year after Corbyn was elected party leader, the event now comprises hundreds of speeches, workshops on radical politics, and at least one event that could be called a rave.

For three years, the mostly younger attendees have literally surrounded official Party proceedings with leftist ideas. But there’s also back-and-forth between Corbyn’s Labour and the more radical elements. John McDonnell, Shadow Chancellor (the man who would run the economy), attended an event in a nightclub this year put on by Novara Media. Taking the stage with Ash Sarkar, who last year gained popularity after telling Piers Morgan, “I’m literally a communist, you idiot,” McDonnell was forced to play a tongue-in-cheek game of radical Wheel of Fortune, spinning for things like “Amazon,” “Buckingham Palace,” and “Grindr,” then answering which ones he would nationalize. At Conference, McDonnell said the U.K. should share green technologies with developing countries for free, as reparations for Britain’s colonial past.

While left-wing groups at TWT had discussed and dreamed about even more radical turns for the last three years, the Momentum campaign group decided this year to officially back policy motions, including the four-day week, banning private schools, the Green New Deal, and an end to immigration detention centers, which also passed. This meant working with activists to get motions up through the party bureaucracy and through the complicated negotiating process, gaining the backing of unions and party members from around the U.K.’s four countries (England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland).

“Our organization has been evolving for years, to the point where we could now put forward policies, and demonstrate we could have a bridge between the party and wider social movements,” said Laura Parker, Momentum’s national coordinator. She said radical policies are needed to win an upcoming election, especially because of international push for action on climate change. “We’re in a time of crisis — economic environmental crisis, and now, political crisis — and people have had enough.”

In Brighton, there was also a bridge to other countries, including the United States. Labour for a Green New Deal campaign co-director Clare Hyner said they chose the “New Deal” framing after seeing the success it had when pushed by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the United States, even though the New Deal itself is a very American historical reference. Representatives from Justice Democrats, which endorsed candidates like AOC and Ilhan Omar, as well as the Bernie Sanders campaign, spoke at TWT. But most of the policies discussed here — and indeed, endorsed by Labour — are far to the left of anything in the Democratic Party.

Not everyone at The World Transformed was thinking primarily about electoral politics. Paddy Bettington, one of the organizers of the four-day-week campaign, got involved after experiences in his own life. Bettington, 33, works for a company that produces stage equipment. While preparing for the London 2012 Olympics, he felt badly overworked. So after the Games, he managed to cut down his working week by a day. By freeing up just a little time for other things — including political education and activism — he said his life improved immensely.

“We have a very narrow idea of what politics is, largely because we’re used to a form of politics that hasn’t really changed since Reagan and Thatcher. This campaign is about broadening that understanding, and discussing more long-term, ambitious goals,” Bettington said. Like many of the campaigners who won this year, he also joined Labour in 2015 in order to elect Corbyn leader. He didn’t have a ticket to the main Labour Conference event, so he watched in shock from a red and white circus tent with a beer as they approved his motion. “The five-day week is just one example of something that is very easy to assume is natural, or unchangeable.

Both are ardent critics of the glut of money in politics, and because of their self-imposed limits, both say their campaigns are “100 percent” funded by grass-roots donors.

These identical claims got our interest.

Sanders and Warren have raised most of their campaign money this year from small-dollar donations. Yet both also have tapped millions of dollars left over from previous campaigns — from a time when they had not yet adopted the strict fundraising practices they currently follow. That complicates their claim to “100 percent” grass-roots purity.

AD

It’s a good example of how the complexities of the campaign finance system sometimes get blurred in the service of an appealing talking point. Let’s dig in.

The Facts

Sanders had raised $46.3 million by the end of the second quarter, according to Federal Election Commission records. That includes $10.1 million transferred from previous campaigns.

AD

When not counting transfers, 77 percent of Sanders’s fundraising this year came from donations of $200 or less. That’s the highest share of small-dollar donations relative to total fundraising among all major candidates. When counting transfers, the share of small-dollar donations is 60 percent.

Warren had raised $35.6 million by the end of the second quarter, FEC records show. That includes $10.4 million transferred from her 2018 Senate campaign.

When not counting transfers, 67 percent of Warren’s fundraising this year came from donations of $200 or less. When counting transfers, the proportion is 48 percent.

AD

“Grass-roots funding” has no formal definition. Sanders and Warren seem to define it in terms of the money they won’t accept.

AD

Sanders doesn’t hold closed-door fundraisers to solicit high-dollar contributions and doesn’t accept money from corporate PACs or super PACs, or from fossil fuel, drug or insurance companies. Warren doesn’t hold closed-door fundraisers to solicit high-dollar contributions and doesn’t accept money from federal lobbyists or PACs, or fossil fuel or pharmaceutical executives.

Considering these restrictions, it’s plausible to describe all the money Sanders and Warren have raised directly this year as grass-roots funding.

But there’s another piece of the pie here. As noted, Sanders and Warren each have transferred nearly $10 million from previous campaigns to their 2020 presidential committees.

AD

AD

In Sanders’s case, FEC records show he had transferred $4.6 million from his 2016 to 2020 presidential campaign committee as of the end of the second quarter.

In his previous presidential campaign, Sanders had somewhat looser fundraising restrictions in place. News reports show he held at least a few events in 2015 where he sought high-dollar donations.

Time magazine reported in December 2015: “Sanders has hosted at least nine medium- to high-dollar, closed-door fundraisers in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere to directly fund his own presidential campaign. Even though Sanders’ efforts sometimes have a proletarian flair — he held one $200-per-ticket fundraiser at a dive bar near a grungy Seattle park — some aspects of the Democratic insurgent’s fundraising are similar to the candidates he condemns.”

The New York Times reported in October 2015: “Mr. Sanders was cheered at a fancy campaign fund-raiser at the Hollywood home of Syd Leibovitch, a high-end real estate agent, and his wife, Linda, on Wednesday night. Tickets for the event sold for a minimum of $250. Those who spent the maximum, $2,700, or who raised $10,000, were invited to a ‘pre-event reception,’ according to the invitation.”

Sanders spokeswoman Sarah Ford said: “In 2016, we held zero closed-door fundraisers with high-dollar donors and accepted no donations from corporate PACs, corporate lobbyists or super PACs.”

When we asked about the high-dollar fundraising in 2015, though, a Sanders aide said, “We do not plan to transfer the amount of money from the 2016 account that came from fundraisers with high-dollar donors in attendance.”

AD

The Sanders aide added that, for the 2020 campaign, grass-roots fundraisers “run alongside the senator’s schedule at public venues and are live-streamed on social media.” The aide added: “They are open to the public and tickets start at $27.”

In Warren’s case, FEC records show she jump-started her presidential campaign this year with a $10.4 million transfer from her 2018 Senate committee. The infusion allowed her to build a campaign apparatus early in the race.

For her 2018 Senate reelection campaign, Warren raised money at events with high-dollar donors. A search of her FEC records showed max contributions of $5,400 from the chief executives of DreamWorks and Yelp, media mogul Haim Saban, philanthropist Alexander Soros, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, hedge fund owners and wealthy investors, and some donors who have given millions to the Democratic Party. Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, film director Steven Spielberg and actress Barbra Streisand each donated $2,700 to Warren’s Senate campaign. (The contribution limit for individuals is $2,700 per race, but they can give that amount for both a primary and general election.)

AD

AD

Warren also benefited from some PAC donations when she ran for Senate, though it was a small share of her fundraising, as we explained in this fact check.

Warren raised $6 million in donations of $1,000 or more to her 2018 Senate campaign, a spokesman said. That’s about 23 percent of her total $25.8 million fundraising for that race. According to OpenSecrets, Sanders raised nearly $28 million in donations of $1,000 or more to his 2016 presidential campaign, a little more than 10 percent of his total $232 million haul for that race.

“The open secret of Ms. Warren’s campaign is that her big-money fund-raising through 2018 helped lay the foundation for her anti-big-money run for the presidency,” the Times reported this month, noting “trips to Hollywood and Silicon Valley, Martha’s Vineyard, and Philadelphia — all with fundraisers on the agenda.”

AD

AD

The Warren campaign in response to our questions said the average contribution to her Senate campaign in 2018 was $29.45, a sign of broad appeal among grass-roots donors.

Warren also “raised or donated $11 million to Democrats running for office and state parties in all 50 states,” a spokesman said.

“Elizabeth’s schedule is filled with town halls and selfie lines, not closed-door fundraisers with millionaires and billionaires, because she believes that to take back the White House we need to build a grassroots movement,” Warren spokesman Chris Hayden wrote in an email. “When we made the decision to run the campaign this way, the players in the usual money-for-influence game dismissed it as naive and said it would never work and it would kill the campaign. We're pleased that our grassroots strategy has been so effective that they're now threatened enough to be attacking us for it.”

AD

The Pinocchio Test

Sanders and Warren say they’re running presidential campaigns funded “100%” by grass-roots donors. It’s a big claim with no wiggle room.

Money is fungible, so it’s an artifice to claim that money from wealthy donors last time around isn’t being used this time around.

The key here is that Sanders and Warren define their presidential campaigns as entirely grass-roots-funded because of their self-imposed restrictions: no hobnobbing with rich donors in closed events and no PAC money, for example.

But Warren held high-dollar fundraisers for her 2018 Senate run and then transferred $10.4 million from that campaign account to her presidential committee. Her Senate run raised $6 million from donors who gave $1,000 or more, and she also took some PAC contributions.

Sanders in 2015 sought and received big checks from wealthy donors. Sanders’s 2020 committee so far has gotten $4.6 million from his prior presidential campaign.

These are omissions worthy of Two Pinocchios. As a share of total fundraising, however, Sanders was less dependent than Warren on high-dollar contributions in his previous campaign.

On September 23, the United Nations opened its Climate Action Summit here in New York, three days after the Global Climate Strike, led by Greta Thunberg, swept through thousands of cities worldwide. To mark the occasion, Intelligencer is publishing “State of the World,” a series of in-depth interviews with climate leaders from Bill Gates to Naomi Klein and Rhiana Gunn-Wright to William Nordhaus, interrogating just how they see the precarious climate future of the planet — and just how hopeful they think we should all be about avoiding catastrophic warming. (Unfortunately, very few are hopeful.)

With his book-length essay The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable, the Indian-born novelist Amitav Ghosh became something beyond the renowned author of Sea of Poppies — perhaps the most penetrating cultural critic of a new age defined by climate change and the strange, inadequate, and often self-deluding ways we process its transformations in our storytelling. His new novel, Gun Island, is a climate-change epic, one that fulfills many of the failings and missed opportunities he identified in the dizzying essay. In early September, we spoke about both books and what’s changed in between them.

You wrote The Great Derangement in 2016, diagnosing a broad failure in literature, but also in our political culture, to face up to this story that we were all living in and yet unable to really process properly. Putting aside for a moment the subject of climate change itself and the changing nature of climate politics, how do you see climate storytelling having changed since you wrote that book?

I think since 2016 there’s been a dramatic change. And, well, your article was the inflection point. Before that, it wasn’t that the studies didn’t — or that people didn’t — try to tell these stories. It’s almost as much to do with the reception. How often did you see a book about climate fiction in The New York Times Book Review? Or The New York Review of Books. Almost never. They were just treated as marginal. I do think that Richard Powers’s Overstory was a major turning point — not just because it is a great book, which it is, but because it was taken seriously by the literary mainstream.

What do you think explains that?

I think in part it’s just his own personal reputation. But it’s not just that. Because if you look at the response to Barbara Kingsolver’s Flight Behavior, it’s quite instructive. Look at the reviews, it’s “Why is she doing this? It doesn’t match up to the other books.”

And she’s a giant, too.

By the time The Overstory was published the ground had somewhat seriously shifted.

So what did change? Is it because the public has learned to think of this as a front-and-center story, rather than a fringe concern?

Going back to 2016 and Bernie Sanders saying right then that this is a major existential crisis, and then that voice being amplified. Extinction Rebellion has been a very major turning point. Greta Thunberg has been a very major turning point. The Sunrise movement. Just the fact that you know the activists could force the democratic party to actually agree to this CNN debate.

Seven hours.

Seven hours. Unbelievable. I think some sort of threshold has been crossed, but it’s not just any one thing. I mean, you just look like an idiot if you just deny the reality.

I think the California wildfires were a major turning point.

Yeah. But I don’t think anybody did a very good job actually of telling the Paradise story. These perfectly ordinary people, waking up in the morning, getting their kids ready for school … And how long did it take, a half hour?

Horrifying.

And we can all identify with it.

You could imagine it being a great Paul Greengrass movie, in the line of United 93.

Another turning point was that movie about the priest.

First Reformed.

I can’t say I was such a fan of it.

It’s funny, I had a list of books and movies to ask you about — The Overstory was one, First Reformed was another. What didn’t you like about it?

It sort of brings the whole thing down to a personal crisis. I feel that that’s not really a productive way of doing it. But, look, it’s a minor criticism compared to how glad one feels that it’s there. And that it will do something, it will be in the mainstream. It will be watched.

And reviewed. Even more than being watched. It was written about a lot.

It was being reviewed. That’s it, that’s it. See, that’s the thing. When these films start being taken seriously in that way, that’s what marks an inflection point. The work has to be made. But then also the work has to be read and received in a certain way.

In The Great Derangement, you seem to want to see fiction that treats nature as a protagonist — that tells the story not just of a single character but of how the natural world is an active force in the lives of those characters.

I think that’s exactly what Overstory is. That’s to me what is really so exciting about the book. Climate change is such a vast thing. It can be approached in thousands of ways. But in a literary sense this is the real challenge that it poses: How do you give voice to the nonhuman? The Overstory poses it in a very interesting way, though I think in a way he’s not able to bring himself to face the true implications of what he’s posing.

What would that mean?

Look, you know, an interesting thing about Richard Powers’s imagination, and Barbara Kingsolver’s, and for that matter Annie Proulx — I was talking to her — is that for them nature is science. In a sense it’s exhausted by science.

This comes from the fact that they’ve been brought up in and have always lived in a society in which science is exhaustive of nature — in which nature exists almost exclusively for scientists. So in both books, and I’m a great admirer of both books, but what you can see is that they can only ventriloquize nature through the scientists. But Richard Powers takes a step further than Barbara Kingsolver. You can see him straining at the very limits of what is possible for him.

I found it interesting actually to see his YouTube videos. Because he often says that you know, “I’ve done as much as I can. I wish I could be an animist. But I can’t bring myself to cross that line.” He’s brought himself to vitalism. But he can’t cross the border beyond that. And that’s an interesting thing for me, because I’m very much deep within the scientific literature, too, but I wasn’t brought up in this world. I was brought up as a pantheist.

And how would you define your worldview now?

You know, all of that comes back to me now. For me, nature has never been dead. It’s filled with voices. It’s filled with agency. It’s filled with the uncanny. And you know, I think, actually, that is the case for most people. It’s just that they can’t find ways of articulating it. You think of, say, Japan, and the part that the supernatural plays in the Japanese world. They’re so hypermodern, and so hypertechnological. But that aspect of the agency of the nonhuman is constantly present among them.

They’re producing, on the one hand, all these horror movies, but at the same time I think they have always produced very interesting work about human agency. You must know that great book about cats. The speaking cat.

The Traveling Cat Chronicles. And in the U.S., they have to reduce all of our horror movies to fables about human action. Or it’s like some retribution for some sin created in the past. Even the supernatural is reduced to the human in the sort of meaning package delivered at the end. We’re really uncomfortable with the idea of a messy or truly inhuman supernatural.

But it’s interesting — you pick up a newspaper in the U.S. and you look for the bestseller lists, and there are so many supernatural books. But most of all you look at the films. They’re all about zombies, and vampires, and werewolves. But as you say all of those are ultimately tied to some idea of an extrahuman agency. Not a nonhuman agency.

When I look at the climate crisis, I see it both ways. I mean, I’m able to think, Of course, there are now things going on which beguile and terrify us and which are beyond our control. And I think thorough, comprehensive understanding of what’s unfolding requires some perspective that puts that natural uncanny at the center. On the other hand, and this may be just the American in me, I also think it is ultimately a story about human behavior in the sense that we have kicked off these cascading changes. Some of them are now unfolding beyond our control, but from a narrative perspective I also revert back to seeing it as something that we’ve created.

You know, I think it’s not that simple. And that’s really the point. When you wake, let’s say, a sleeping tiger, you’ve woken him. You haven’t created him.

Right.

The tiger has its agency and it’s going to come after you. That’s what you have to recognize. That you have no control over it. And that’s what’s so interesting even about the science. The science is always one step short. It’s almost a meme: Scientists are surprised. Scientists are puzzled. Models didn’t predict. So what you can see there is that, in fact, it’s like we were watching Gulliver. We were Lilliputians watching Gulliver, you know, and watching him wake up and trying to describe him in some kind of language, without recognizing the agency of Gulliver. So we haven’t created it. We just, as it were, spurred something into motion, which is now violently striking back at us.

Yeah. I saw a headline the other day, something like, a string of unprecedented hot days strikes the American Southwest, comma, puzzling scientists. And I think, What’s the puzzle?

It really is a meme. You encounter it constantly.

On the other hand, I think there is something sort of useful narratologically — to be signaling to people all the time that this is unprecedented.

Yeah, absolutely. But in terms of this whole idea of nonhuman agency, I think actually some of the most interesting work that’s being done on that is being done in nonfiction by historians, anthropologists, and so on.

Who were you thinking of?

Well, I don’t know if you read Bathsheba Demuth’s new book?

No.

She’s this young historian at Brown University. She did, I must say, what was to me I think the most brilliant talk I’ve ever heard. She grew up with intuits in Bering Strait. And she’s a very highly trained historian, fluent in Russian. So in this talk especially she demonstrated that in the mid 19th century, when whalers started going after whales in this region, the whales responded. How intelligently they responded. How they crafted their withdrawals. But even more interesting than that is how among all hunting and gathering people, the belief is always that you don’t kill the animal, the animal gives itself to you. And she actually charts it. She gives examples of how she’s been with these Inuit whale hunters and one after another the bullhead whales will come out, they look at the boat, they look at the harpoonist, and then they go away. But one will stay, and it will wait until it’s harpooned.

Or Anna Tsing’s The Mushroom at the End of the World. It’s amazing. A truly heartbreaking and amazing book. But she’s working with these Matsutake mushrooms — these huge complex organisms that underlie forests. She’s looking at how they allow trees to communicate — the whole ensemble communicates, you know. But what is interesting is that, in Western thought, the whole idea of agency is tied to your idea of history — who has the history-making power? That’s how you judge agency. And she shows you that forests have this agency.

In a certain sense, with climate change we’ve given them even more power to shape our history.

If you think about it, all of this idea that emerges in the first place, out of this mechanistic theorizing, but most of all in the late 18th century — this Hegelian idealism that human beings all have spirits and we’re advancing to a world where we disappear into spirit and God, divinity, and so on. How deeply rooted this idea has become in western thinking! It’s something to really, truly marvel at. Because you know, you think about poetry and we’re always told about the romantics and how much Wordsworth loved nature and so on. But you know the iconic poet of that age was not Wordsworth, it was Tennyson. I remember as a child in India being made to learn Tennyson. And Tennyson, in one work, he basically says, for man to move upward toward spirit, the tiger and ape must wither and die.

Can you imagine? It’s almost impossible for us to imagine today a poet calling for the extinction of tigers and apes.

On the other hand, our culture is sort of calling that into being collectively.

Exactly. And in a sense, what is this whole idea of Kurzweil’s, escaping into the singularity? Essentially that idea. You escape the bonds of earth.

Do you see a more sophisticated understanding of these systems evolving in the U.S., or do you think we’re still largely stuck in an inappropriate and insufficient paradigm that still foregrounds the individual and the human?

I think it’s impossible to generalize. Because within the U.S. there are so many people who have alternate faith systems, belief systems. And we’ve seen in the U.S. most of all a sort of rebellion, an inchoate rebellion against a mechanistic modern. But that inchoate rebellion has never had anywhere proper to go. They go from New Age to something else to something else. But it is a rebellion.

But those people — are they necessarily able to change attitudes toward the world? I don’t know. Because if you look at the people who wield power, if you look at the industrial, intellectual, cultural elite, I think it’s impossible to imagine that they can ever take on the full burden of climate change. It affects everything they know. Everything they stand for is wrong. And it’s they who led us down this path.

I can both see the total inadequacy of our existing elite in addressing and reckoning with this problem, and also just have a really hard time seeing that elite being toppled at the same time.

It won’t be; it can’t be. They’re much more prepared than their adversaries. I mean, they’re completely prepared. The idea that the elites deny climate change, I think it’s just a complete red herring. You think someone like Peter Thiel doesn’t work out climate change? Is he really quietly buying a place in New Zealand? You think Steve Bannon doesn’t know about climate change? He was one of the funders of that eco project …

Biodome.

We shouldn’t kid ourselves. They know perfectly well. Does Trump not know? Why’s he buying insurance? Of course he knows.

Or wanting to buy Greenland.

What they’re saying is that our systems are caught up in this, we have too much wealth involved in this, so let other people suffer.

That’s not really climate denial.

If I were to think of a catchy phrase for this, I would say it’s the climate unsayable. Because you can’t, within the constraints of common public discourse today, say “let them die.” It’s not sayable. But it is implicit.

Do you think we can stop warming before we get to that point? I don’t think that it’s possible that we stop before 1.5 degrees.

I’m afraid two is optimistic. In India, the public discourse is all greenwashing, but what they’re actually doing is opening up the forests, doing away with regulations, funding Adani’s coal mine in Australia. And Australia is in the grip of major climate denialism, if you like.

India’s place in this story is harrowing to me, as an outsider. How do you think about it?

It’s really overwhelming. I just can’t bring myself to think about the worst aspects of it, really. Because it’s not just that it’s going to happen in the future — in fact it’s happening right now. For example, the dead zones in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. Literally hundreds of thousands of fisher folk have already been displaced. They’ve had to abandon their traditional occupations. They’re moving inland into other kinds of occupations. Some are just escaping as well.

There was a point a couple of years ago when this huge megadrought gripped Central India. When it was really at its worst, there’s this region called Bundelkhand, a very water-stressed region, where close to a million people were leaving every week. The Indian parliament was in session. They held only one debate on the drought. Not even a tenth of the MPs showed up.

So I think of India as both a parable and a principle. What it shows us most effectively is the complete failure of modern government. That is to say, post-19th century institutional government. Just completely and catastrophically failing. And we see more and more evidence of this every single day. But it’s not just the government. It’s the entire civic culture if you like. Indian newspapers hardly pay any attention to this. Within the media it’s hardly spoken of, within literature it’s hardly spoken of. And the idea that this can be solved in the U.S. or in the West is an illusion. That boat has sailed. Fundamentally, this is going to be decided in Asia and in Africa. But the minister of environment in India recently said that these droughts had nothing to do with climate change. What can you say? At that point it’s not even irresponsibility or anything. It just means they’re living in some other alternative universe.

Do you think of them like you think of Thiel and Bannon, that they understand but choose not to address it?

I think a large number of them are exactly like that. The other aspect of it is just throughout Asia and Africa, the climate issue is completely subordinate to the narrative of development.

Which gives a kind of postcolonial or anticolonial cast as well.

What they will say to you straight away is, “Let them give up their cars.”

Well, which is a perfectly defensible position morally.

But it was not Gandhi’s position. I think one always has to remember that. It was not Gandhi’s position. And that such a position was possible then is a truly miraculous thing. He was able to say that I would rather that my country be poor than that we destroy the world. Today such a position would be … Any politician with such a position would be hounded to death.

Let’s talk about your novel, Gun Island. Is it possibly true that you didn’t begin writing this until after The Great Derangement?

You know, once you start thinking about these issues, they’re never absent, you can’t put them away, they’re just there. So I guess it didn’t begin necessarily as a book about all that’s in it right now. But it was impossible that it wouldn’t impress those things, simply because they were so urgent to me.

Does that mean you think all of your future books will be shaped by those concerns too?

Absolutely. They’ll always be present. Because it’s what’s present.

I think of this as being a book about reality. That’s really what it is. It’s a book about reality.

But the book also involves some kind of mythological, magic realist elements too. How did you sort of come to deploying those? Or did they seem to you just similarly a way of depicting reality?

Exactly that. Because I think we are living in a reality that is, in itself, fundamentally uncanny. I think it’s impossible. I mean by the time I finished writing The Great Derangement, there were two or three things that were clear to me about the only ways we can write about today’s world. They cannot be these individual stories of adventure. That they cannot be local. And they have to confront the aspect of the uncanny in a literary sense really. That is our great resource, the uncanny, which somehow has come down to us even through the 19th century.

You also have to remember this frog-in-the-boiling-water analogy. And one sees evidence for that all the time. Young fisherman no longer know what their grandfathers used to catch. So they think this is normal to get tiny little fish 200 miles out. They just don’t remember. Farmers don’t remember.

I come at this from a different perspective from really thinking about it in terms of nonfiction storytelling primarily, but I just think it’s both the case that we’re likely to normalize and adapt beyond what today we might believe is possible. And yet at the same time, the suffering is still going to likely be so much more intense than we imagine.

I think it’s probably going to be much worse than we expect. That’s certainly clear. And it’s not just in relation to climate. You know how scientists speak about climate sensitivity? I think we should also start talking about social and political sensitivity for climate.

But the fact that 50 or 70 years from now civilization probably will not have totally collapsed, is not an argument against alarmism. In fact, it’s sort of an argument for the urgency of raising the alarm now because if we wait until 2050 to be thinking about what life is going to be like in 2060 we’ll have already normalized so much additional suffering that we won’t be able to see the next ten years of suffering as horrifying, as it should be by any moral logic.

That is the difference between nonfiction and fiction. Fiction about something more than just telling. Because in fiction also there is consolation. It also provides meaning. It can suggest to you forms of meaning that might emerge out of you. And when you say suffering, yes you’re right. But really if you think about ways in which people have thought about the world, it’s only in the sort of modern era that people have come to think of suffering of being extraneous to life."

You have to recalibrate based on the fact that Trump’s attacks on you are going to be at the center of these impeachment hearings,” said Larry Rasky, a longtime ally of Biden who had senior roles in his two previous presidential campaigns. Rasky said he worries Biden’s campaign has been naive about the amount of resources needed to counter Trump.

The new demand that Biden simultaneously run a general-election matchup with Trump and a primary campaign against several formidable Democratic challengers risks straining a campaign that started later and has organized more slowly than some of his rivals’ efforts.

Biden’s campaign for now seems to have settled on an approach similar to the one Democrats used in the 2018 midterms, trying to ignore Trump as much as possible to focus instead on issues they believe are more resonant with voters.

Biden, who has insisted his election would return the country to normalcy, has over the past several days largely sought to avoid the political spasm in which he is now a central figure. His campaign has sent out daily statements on health care and other issues, as if leaning toward predictability in a highly unpredictable time. He has only sporadically talked about Trump’s attacks on him and his son Hunter.

At a fundraiser Saturday in Park City, Utah, the host, Barry Baker, called Trump a “lying, narcissistic traitor, cheater,” while Biden over the course of a 20-minute speech did not mention impeachment or the president’s dealings with Ukraine.

“This isn’t about me. . . . It’s a tactic that’s used by this president to try to hijack an election so we do not focus on the issues that matter in our lives,” Biden said last week.

Biden has sent out a string of fundraising emails — which his campaign says resulted in its best donation week since early in the campaign — and some longtime confidants hope he can avoid getting dragged into Trump’s bombastic antagonism. They have called or messaged Biden and urged him to avoid getting into a bitter back-and-forth with the president, reminding him that the political landscape is littered with foes whose character Trump has dirtied.

“For Joe Biden to get down in the mud with this guy, whatever stank on him will run off on Joe,” said Dick Harpootlian, a Democratic state senator from South Carolina and a longtime Biden supporter. “He’s handling it the way he should — with restraint I could not handle on my best day. I mean, [Trump] is coming after his family. In my part of the country, there would be fisticuffs over this.”

“Trump is goading him,” he added. “But if you want a Democratic Donald Trump who screams and yells and lies, then you need to vote for someone else. Because that isn’t Joe Biden.”

Already the Trump onslaught has had an impact on the Democratic side of the presidential race, overshadowing efforts by Biden and others to more pointedly put Warren on defense on a host of issues.

Yet the benefit to Biden, as some of his advisers see it, is the possibility that Democrats will view his response as statesmanlike and rally behind him amid attacks they see as unfair. So far they say the approach is providing dividends.

“Joe Biden, Donald Trump and Nancy Pelosi are the three most important people in American politics right now,” said Sean Bagniewski, chairman of the Polk County Democrats in Iowa, who is neutral in the race. “It propels him to the limelight in ways that other folks don’t get. It seems everybody else is playing catch-up; they are trying to get the limelight back.”

The impeachment proceedings underway in the House followed revelations that Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden and his son. The administration had previously held up congressionally approved aid to Ukraine, which is in the midst of a conflict with Russia after its invasion of the Ukrainian territory Crimea.

Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner earlier came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.

Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.

Trump has delved into exaggeration and falsehoods in his fusillade of accusations against Biden. Yet the episode also has raised the uncomfortable question for Biden about whether he should have allowed his son to make money from a Ukrainian company at the same time he was overseeing the Obama administration’s efforts to crack down on corruption there. Already, several of Biden’s presidential foes have obliquely engaged on that topic.

Ed Rendell, former Pennsylvania governor and a top Biden supporter, said he thought Biden has handled the issue “just perfectly” so far, but he quickly added that it’s hard to tell whether the accusations will have a lingering impact.

“I don’t think Democrats will think there’s any truth to the attack,” Rendell said. “But some might worry that if Biden gets elected, there will be all sorts of grand juries, and Republicans will look into this stuff. . . . Not that Democrats believe Joe would do anything corrupt, but just that it would be charge and countercharge.”

The episode has crystallized an existing sense of anxiety among some of Biden’s top donors and longtime supporters about his campaign. Some allies have been expressing concerns for weeks that Biden doesn’t seem to be the happy warrior he had been in previous campaigns. They have urged him and the campaign to adopt a more assertive and focused message, one that puts the middle class front and center.

Some of those worries have led to preliminary discussions, in Chicago and Washington, over whether to launch a pro-Biden super PAC. Biden’s campaign has publicly discouraged any outside assistance, which could open him to attacks from Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) that he is being bankrolled by wealthy interests. Those discussions, first reported by the New York Times, are ongoing.

Among those involved have been Rasky; former Biden staffer Mark Doyle; Julianna Smoot, a Democratic fundraiser who led Barack Obama’s campaign finance team in 2008 and was deputy campaign manager in 2012; and Democratic consultant Mark Riddle.

In a sign of what Biden is up against, the Trump campaign announced Friday the $10 million ad campaign focused on Biden, his son and Ukraine. It includes a video snippet of Biden saying the United States would withhold a $1 billion loan guarantee if Ukraine did not fire the corrupt prosecutor.

“But when President Trump asks Ukraine to investigate corruption, the Democrats want to impeach him,” the narrator says. “They lost the election. Now they want to steal this one. Don’t let them.”

The Biden campaign has attempted to reassure donors and has sent out talking points to allies to encourage a public response to Trump.

“We’re in a battle for the soul of this nation, and Donald Trump just revealed to the entire world how terrified he is that he’ll lose it to Joe Biden,” Andrew Bates, a campaign spokesman, said in a statement. “That’s because the contrast between the vice president and Donald Trump couldn’t be more powerful.”

On Sunday, two top Biden campaign officials sent a letter to the heads of major news and cable networks, urging them not to book Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani. “By giving [Giuliani] your air time, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation,” the letter from Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield reads.

While conceding that they are in a highly unpredictable environment, Biden advisers say their candidate will ultimately benefit from contrasts with Trump over issues and leadership.

“A lot of us who know Joe Biden think it’s incredibly unfair,” said Tom Vilsack, a former Iowa governor who served as agriculture secretary in the Obama administration. “And it’s a tactic some folks have used in the past to gain political advantage, and . . . we shouldn’t allow that. As voters, we should say, ‘Hell no, we’re not going to do that.’ ”

Vilsack, who remains uncommitted in the Democratic primary, said voters should focus on how Biden has avoided getting caught up in personal attacks. He added that the current environment is showcasing what a general election between the two men would look like — which could calm voters.

“The Biden campaign seems to be able to handle the attacks,” he said. “We really don’t know what the attacks about these other candidates are going to be.”

Some Biden allies privately draw a contrast with Warren and Trump’s assault over her past claims of Native American heritage. Afterward, she dropped rapidly in the polls; she has risen steadily over the past six months at a time when Biden was bearing the brunt of Trump’s criticism.

Alan Feirer, the party chairman in Madison County, Iowa, has expressed some skepticism of Biden in the past but said he is impressed by how he handled the past week.

“We’ve been reminded what a statesman he is because he hasn’t risen to the bait of what Trump was presenting over the past few days,” said Feirer, who is staying neutral. “I don’t think it’s instilled doubt or anything. If anything, it’s instilled more confidence and reminded people why they like him. He’s been classy.”"

Good luck with that.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/09/29/biden-campaign-wants-rudy-giuliani-off-tv-news-good-luck-with-that/,"The request comes after Giuliani made his usual Sunday rounds to push Trump’s interests. On ABC’s “This Week,” he defended his scandal-mongering on behalf of the president over Ukraine, the center of a full-blown scandal that crystallized over the past week. Giuliani has attempted to convince the country that when Joe Biden served as vice president, he sought and secured the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor — Viktor Shokin — who was pursuing a case against an energy company, Burisma Holdings, where his son Hunter Biden served on the board of directors. As the New York Times reported in May — and other outlets have confirmed — there’s no evidence to that effect. In fact, the reporting points in the other direction — that Joe Biden was acting in accordance with an international consensus, not to mention a well-cemented position within the U.S. government and that Shokin wasn’t actively pursuing Burisma at the time in any case.

As Giuliani put forth his arguments, ABC News’s George Stephanopoulos tried to confine him to the facts. That was hard. Example:

AD

AD

STEPHANOPOULOS: OK, you -- you've gotten those charges out there. Let’s talk about -- GIULIANI: No, no, I haven’t gotten them out there. STEPHANOPOULOS: But you have gotten them out there. GIULIANI: No, I haven’t.

Whether it’s Cuomo or Stephanopoulos or CBS News’s Margaret Brennan, all of Giuliani’s interviewers prepare themselves for his tacks, his evasions, his falsehoods. On this front, the Biden campaign’s letter credits the news organizations: “While you have been aggressive in pushing back on him in real time, it is well known that the dedicated liar always has the advantage, pushing out outlandish falsehoods and disinformation in the knowledge that it is hard for the corrections to catch up,” notes the letter from the Biden campaign.

In this vein, the Biden letter merges with a million pleas from social media users dating to the onset of the Trump presidential period. This crowd pleaded with cable-news networks, particularly CNN, to scale back live broadcasts of Trump’s 2016 campaign rallies; they spoke up again over Sean Spicer’s lie-heavy White House briefings, as well as those of his successor, Sarah Sanders; they shouted down the falsehoods so routinely spouted by Trump surrogates wherever they popped up on television. And, of course, they spoke up about the president himself, whose penchant for lies and stray falsehoods outpaced the frantic efforts of well-meaning journalists scouring source documents.

AD

AD

None of it has worked. The commitment of mainstream news outlets to shop for input from both sides — no matter the ethical failings of one — is decades old. Executives in TV news have grown gray swearing by this maxim, one that had never been meaningfully challenged before the accession of Trump. The perils of this approach, by contrast, are just a few years in the making. Though the Trump period feels old and tired and rote, its core challenge to journalism is still fresh.

The Biden campaign letter is a well-phrased appeal that will in all likelihood go nowhere. Interviews with Giuliani, after all, begin with viral potential that most segments don’t pack. Cuomo’s tete-a-tete with the Trump lawyer this month, for example, will fit nicely into his career highlights. Swearing off a guest of this sort won’t happen just because he befouls your network’s air. To take a quote from the Biden campaign letter: “Giuliani is not enlightening your viewers in any way. He’s not offering a unique or informed perspective.”

As if those have ever been booking criteria for TV news outlets.

But neither Sanders (I-Vt.) nor his campaign offered details about how serious his condition was, leaving open the question of how soon he would reemerge and whether voters would lose confidence in his ability to serve as president.

AD

The episode also brought new attention to a Democratic field that is dominated by three septuagenarians: Sanders, 78; former vice president Joe Biden, 76; and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), 70 — each of whom would be the oldest president ever to take office.

AD

“I think anybody’s health is of concern when it comes to that high office,” said Jeremy Dumkrieger, chairman of the Woodbury County, Iowa, Democratic Party, who supported Sanders in 2016 but is neutral so far this year. “You know, if the person was 40 and was having some issues, I’d have concerns about it, too.”

Sanders headed home Saturday to Burlington, Vt., with no word on how long he would stay there. Jane Sanders said before his release that he would rest a “few days” but would take part in the Oct. 15 Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio.

AD

The campaign’s decision to wait three days to reveal that Sanders had suffered a heart attack conjured images of Hillary Clinton’s collapse in 2016 at a memorial service for the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Clinton, at the time the Democratic presidential nominee, had been diagnosed with pneumonia two days earlier, but her campaign did not reveal that fact until many hours after she had fainted.

AD

Sanders aides revealed Wednesday that he had experienced chest pains at a campaign event Tuesday and had undergone a stent procedure to clear an artery blockage.

After he left the hospital Friday, his campaign released a statement from his doctors saying Sanders was diagnosed with a myocardial infarction — a heart attack. “His hospital course was uneventful with good expected progress. He was discharged with instructions to follow up with his personal physician,” said his treating physicians, Arturo E. Marchand Jr. and Arjun Gururaj.

AD

But Sanders’s campaign declined to offer much detail about how serious his heart attack was. On Saturday, the campaign declined a request to speak directly with his doctors about his condition.

Asked Friday why they waited to announce the diagnosis, Sanders campaign spokesman Mike Casca said, “We just wanted to wait until he was discharged to give out the information all at once.”

AD

A heart attack occurs when a portion of the heart muscle is permanently damaged from a lack of blood flow, said Quinn Capers IV, an interventional cardiologist and professor of internal medicine at Ohio State University. In an interview Saturday, Capers said, “The most important thing that dictates how well somebody will do after a heart attack is how much of the heart muscle was permanently damaged.”

AD

Capers said the length of Sanders’s hospital stay suggests a small or moderate heart attack, after which patients can live long and healthy lives — though he cautioned that he could not know for sure because he did not treat the candidate.

Age can also be a factor in recovery, Capers said.

Health issues have dogged presidential candidates in a number of past elections. After Clinton’s fainting episode, detractors spread unsubstantiated claims of underlying illness.

AD

Sanders hasn’t faced the same scrutiny, in part because he’s struggling to gain momentum in the Democratic primary contest. Sanders doesn’t have a “strong path to the nomination,” said Chris Wilson, a Republican pollster. “So it’s less of a story all around.”

AD

In 1999, just weeks before the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, then-Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley underwent treatment for an irregular heartbeat, prompting headlines such as “Bradley’s heart ailment injects health as campaign issue.” Although he’d managed the condition for four years and experts described it as “more nuisance than danger,” his campaign never gained traction against the eventual nominee, Al Gore.

The Sanders campaign has sought to project a business-as-usual attitude as the senator takes time away from his hectic schedule. A trio of top surrogates fanned out to campaign in Iowa, South Carolina and New Hampshire over the weekend. And a $1.3 million TV ad buy the campaign had put off will start Tuesday in Iowa.

AD

Campaign aides have said unequivocally that Sanders will attend the Oct. 15 debate, but his campaign schedule shows no other events before then.

AD

Capers said that if Sanders were his patient, he would probably recommend seven to eight hours of sleep a night, healthy meals and time for stress release. Getting back for the debate “seems like a challenge,” Capers said, adding that if a patient told him he had to be there, he would recommend no additional activity before then.

Sanders aides have pointed to his strong fundraising as a sign of enthusiasm for his candidacy, even as he sits in third place in many polls behind Biden and Warren. Sanders raised $25.3 million in the third quarter of the year, an impressive sum that topped all his Democratic rivals. His campaign said late Friday that it has $33.7 million in his account, a sizable war chest that could sustain campaign operations for months.

AD

It was unclear how news of Sanders’s heart attack would affect his fundraising and his future campaign strategy. Before his heart attack, Sanders campaigned more aggressively than most, if not all, of his rivals. He often held multiple events per day, sometimes in more than one state.

AD

Whether the heart attack would shift his standing in the race was also an open question. A handful of Sanders’s Democratic rivals sidestepped questions about Sanders’s health on Saturday. In recent weeks, Warren has been rising in the polls, drawing large crowds and winning plaudits from prominent Democrats.

“I think she’s running a better campaign at this point than Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders,” said veteran Democratic strategist Mark Longabaugh, an architect of Sanders’s 2016 campaign. “And obviously, Sanders has had a very unfortunate incident that has pulled him off the trail. Biden has been pulled into the impeachment debate. Both demonstrate how unpredictable politics can be and how external events can upset the race.”

Maybe we’re being haunted for our sins. The 2016 Democratic primary ought to be over, but it looks alive, or at least undead. Occasionally it moans: Medicare for All just isn’t reasonable and heartland voters love Aetna as they would a god. It usually shows up on Twitter, where all cursed thoughts go to holler. There, it recently sensed bait. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, and (probably) Rashida Tlaib have endorsed Bernie Sanders for president, and behold:

Eisner, who is the academic director of the Columbia Journalism School, appears to have deleted her tweet. But her comment still breathed new life into a familiar old phantom. In the most literal sense, Bernie Sanders is not running against Hillary Clinton this year. But the acrimony generated by their contest lingers. It is palpable in Eisner’s failure to understand why Ocasio-Cortez and Omar would endorse Sanders, a man who, since he is also old and white, superficially has little in common with them. In Eisner’s reckoning, it’s as if identity operates on a points-based system, and whoever had the most points automatically wins voters who look most like them — policies be damned.

But policy matters. It mattered in 2016, too, despite a common pretense to the contrary. There was generally a push from the Clinton camp to present their candidate as the sensible but progressive alternative to Sanders. At their most dogmatic, Clinton surrogates spoke of Sanders as if he were the antithesis to identity politics and as if support for him betrayed feminism itself. “We can tell our story of how we climbed the ladder, and a lot of you younger women think it’s done. It’s not done. There’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other!” Madeleine Albright said of female Sanders supporters in 2016. Stupid, but still preferable to Gloria Steinem’s apparent belief that young women picked candidates based on who they wanted to bone. “When you’re young, you’re thinking: ‘Where are the boys? The boys are with Bernie,’” she mused.

But the girls weren’t traitors, and they didn’t just want to get laid. They wanted Medicare for All. It was never that complicated. Anyone who picks their allegiances based on their community’s interests displays a form of identity politics. But on its own, the simple fact of shared identity does not an ally make. There is a vast gulf, politically, between Sarah Palin and Senator Elizabeth Warren. The gulf between the progressive Warren and a centrist like Amy Klobuchar is smaller, but real. Authentically practiced, identity politics do not mean that a person will rally around a member of their group. In 2016, many women believed their specific interests would be better served by a different theory of change. They had no time to wait on Clinton’s incrementalism, and no reason to trust her to take them where they needed to go. That’s still true now. Clinton’s centrism outlasted her political career: Its new avatars are Klobuchar and Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg.

The perspective Eisner aired had already shown signs of unholy new life. “I actually overheard someone saying, that I thought was an interesting point, that basically at this point if you are still supporting Sanders as opposed to Warren, it’s kind of showing your sexism,” Democratic strategist Emily Tisch Sussman recently said on MSNBC. It’s not. Even if Warren is far closer to Sanders than she is to Clinton, Sanders’s supporters have substantive reasons to prefer the senator from Vermont over his friend from Massachusetts.

Applied to the congresswomen in particular, this apolitical grasp of identity is uniquely inadequate. On the stump and in comments to reporters, the two refer often to their backgrounds — to their gender, their ethnicities, their experiences with economic precariousness and, in Omar’s case, with war. Even if they wanted to forget who they are, Donald Trump wouldn’t let them. His attacks on the two congresswomen, and on their frequent allies Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib, reveal his specific antipathy for immigrants and Muslims and women. Trump doesn’t just want them to shut up, he wants them to “go back” to “the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.” When Trump went to Minnesota for a recent rally, he didn’t just attack Omar and her politics. He attacked the state’s Somali community, to which Omar belongs, by name.

It’s a strange notion, the idea that ideology and identity sit in separate boxes to be picked up or set down as someone sees fit. But they aren’t separate, which means they aren’t opposing forces, and one is never subservient to the other. Ideology and identity are wrapped up in each other, they shape each other, and this is as true for right-wing men as it is for left-wing women.

The congresswomen have explained this in their own words, over and over and over again. In the aggregate, they have probably explained their views more often than most politicians; that is the price of being an insurgent. Americans are so unused to leftists in office that the political philosophies of both women remained topics of national debate long after they’d finished their campaigns. Anyone curious about their presidential endorsement could at least defer to their own words and deeds. Ocasio-Cortez volunteered for the Sanders campaign and describes herself as a democratic socialist, like the senator. She’s ably explained her ideology on multiple occasions. “I’m an educator, I’m an organizer, and I believe that what we’re really seeing is just a move for health care, housing, and education in the United States,” she told NBC’s Chuck Todd in a key 2018 interview. “An important part of my strategy in winning was building a broad-based coalition of people. So while there’s a focus on this one aspect of the coalition. The definition of democratic socialism to me again is the fact that in a modern, moral, and wealthy society, no American should be too poor to live.”

Omar isn’t a member of DSA, even if Trump did just call her an “America-hating socialist.” But politically she aligns herself closely with Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders, with whom she recently introduced a sweeping bill to cancel student-loan debt. She stated her rationale quite clearly on Tuesday, when she announced her endorsement. In a video released by the Sanders campaign, Omar describes the senator as “the only candidate that has built a movement and continues to build a movement that transcends gender, ethnicity, religion.”

“There was an America that I dreamed about,” she added. “There is an America that most people believe in. It is an ideal. It’s not a reality yet.” The dream is everything. That’s why she and Ocasio-Cortez endorsed Sanders. The goal isn’t a world where identity no longer matters, but one where it doesn’t hold anyone back."

Two weeks ago, Bernie Sanders’s 2020 campaign looked seriously unwell — and then, so did Bernie Sanders. As of October 1, the Vermont senator’s support in national polls had been stagnating for months, while his standing in surveys of early states had been declining. For a newcomer to presidential politics, boasting a lock on third place four months before Iowa would be auspicious. But for a candidate who already enjoyed near 100 percent name recognition among the party faithful, it seemed the opposite; especially as Elizabeth Warren moved steadily further ahead of her fellow left-wing New Englander in the polls.

And then the 78-year-old socialist had a heart attack. And in one of his first interviews after the health scare, an understandably fatigued-looking Bernie suggested he would have to “change the nature of the campaign.” A thousand obituaries for “the political revolution” were prewritten.

But Sanders’s showing Tuesday night will keep them unpublished. At the Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio — his first major campaign event since taking ill — Bernie wasn’t just his old, bizarrely sharp and energetic-for-a-septuagenarian self. He was better, crisper, and funnier than before. The hoarse voice that plagued Sanders on the last episode of this (wretched) TV show was gone. A new perspective on the fragility of this life — and the preciousness of every opportunity to mitigate the suffering of other human beings — had, presumably, taken its place. Or maybe Bernie just got a good night’s sleep Monday. Either way, he turned in his finest debate performance of the cycle thus far.

In the (apparently, legally mandatory) early back-and-forth on the horrors of replacing private-insurance premiums with payroll taxes, Sanders benefited from the greater clarity of his position relative to Warren’s (he is comfortable copping to the necessity of tax hikes, she prefers to avoid the T-word), and his rivals’ greater interest in damaging the race’s new front-runner.

Later, he delivered a rousing defense of his desire to expropriate Tom Steyer’s wealth; interrupted Joe Biden to crack a joke amusing enough to earn him an impromptu embrace from the former vice-president; and still managed to stick a shiv between Uncle Joe’s ribs when the time was ripe:

.@BernieSanders to @JoeBiden: ""You got the disastrous war in Iraq done, you got the bankruptcy bill which is hurting millions..., you got trade agreements like NAFTA and PNTR with China done which have cost us 4 million jobs"" pic.twitter.com/aBjCAPjNnK — Saagar Enjeti (@esaagar) October 16, 2019

Finally, Sanders closed out the night by demonstrating that he isn’t actually incapable of indulging the press’ bottomless appetite for pleasing pablum about bipartisan cooperation, and the evils of divisiveness. Asked to describe a friendship that transcended partisan lines, the senator reminded America of a fact some of his loudest online supporters often elide — Bernie is capable of playing nice with Republican colleagues, and pursuing incremental progress over ideological purity, as he did when partnering with John McCain on reforms to veterans’ health care.

Meanwhile, in the face of heavy incoming fire, Warren’s answers often came off as less crisp and self-assured versions of Sanders’s (which had not, in my infinitely objective view, been the case at previous debates). The Massachusetts senator put up a solid performance. But the combination of Sanders’s vitality, and Warren’s incessant obligation to play defense, made Bernie look like the more effective messenger for the party’s left flank (at least, for this evening).

And then, minutes after the debate was done, the Sanders campaign won the endorsement of the most charismatic congresswoman in the United States: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez revealed that she will be lending Bernie 2020 her considerable star power at a rally in Queens on Saturday. AOC’s fellow “squad” members, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, will also reportedly be joining the political revolution.

Whether any of this will actually matter is unknowable. There isn’t much evidence that any of the previous Democratic debates made a durable impact on the polls. To the extent that Sanders needs to improve his standing with older voters, and Democrats who subscribe to conventional notions about “electability,” AOC’s rubber stamp isn’t going to help. But the senator’s mission Tuesday night was to keep the political obituarists at bay. There’s no question he accomplished that much."

Bernie Sanders had heart surgery Tuesday night after experiencing pain in his chest at a campaign event earlier in the day, senior adviser Jeff Weaver said in a statement Wednesday. The 78-year-old Sanders had a blockage in one artery and had two stents inserted. He is now “conversing and in good spirits,” the statement said. All of his events and appearances have been canceled until further notice, and the campaign has reportedly begun canceling ad buys in Iowa, where it was due to begin airing its first TV ads of the campaign.

Sanders was hospitalized in Las Vegas, where he was due to appear at a gun-violence forum hosted by March for Our Lives and the Giffords group. He was due to visiting California later this week, followed by a trip to Iowa this weekend, the Times reported.

The oldest candidate in the race, Sanders was recently asked by Stephen Colbert about voters who may have concerns over his age. “I’m in good health and running a vigorous campaign,” he said after knocking on Colbert’s desk.

The full statement from Weaver reads: “During a campaign event yesterday evening, Sen. Sanders experienced some chest discomfort. Following medical evaluation and testing he was found to have a blockage in one artery and two stents were successfully inserted. Sen. Sanders is conversing and in good spirits. He will be resting up over the next few days. We are canceling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates.”

After news of Sanders’s procedure, his fellow Democratic candidates sent their well wishes.

In a tweet, Joe Biden sent his best wishes, adding, “Anyone who knows Bernie understands what a force he is. We are confident that he will have a full and speedy recovery and look forward to seeing him on the trail soon.”

Elizabeth Warren tweeted: “Bruce, Team Warren, and I are sending all our best wishes for a speedy recovery to @BernieSanders. I hope to see my friend back on the campaign trail very soon.”

Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Andrew Yang, and others also tweeted their well wishes for the Vermont senator. So too did Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign’s communications director. “All of us at @TeamTrump offer @BernieSanders,” he tweeted.

On Wednesday afternoon, Sanders tweeted that he’s “feeling good,” and underscored a central campaign message, reiterating his call for Medicare for All.

Thanks for all the well wishes. I'm feeling good. I'm fortunate to have good health care and great doctors and nurses helping me to recover.



None of us know when a medical emergency might affect us. And no one should fear going bankrupt if it occurs. Medicare for All! — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 2, 2019

On Thursday, the campaign confirmed that Sanders will participate in the debate on October 15, and released an update stating that “there has been no need for additional procedures” following the initial surgery.

Intelligencer staffers Gabriel Debenedetti and Benjamin Hart discuss the possible ramifications of Bernie Sanders’s heart procedure and temporary campaign suspension.

Ben: Bernie Sanders’s campaign revealed today that the 78-year-old Vermont senator underwent a procedure for a blocked artery after experiencing tightness in his chest Tuesday evening. His wife, Jane Sanders, says he is doing “really well,” and there is no indication that more serious health problems are involved. But this is obviously news his supporters don’t want to hear. Do you have an initial sense of how the incident will affect his campaign?

Gabriel: We have no idea how this will affect the campaign, and I’m not sure the campaign does yet, either. In terms of the short-term mechanics, we know Sanders has canceled his upcoming events, and his campaign has postponed its big recent ad buy in Iowa, which was supposed to be a big moment for it. Obviously this isn’t good, but I’d caution against drawing too many conclusions here.

Purely in terms of political momentum, you clearly don’t want your candidate off the trail and off the air at an important moment. But I’m pretty sure most Democratic voters understand the circumstances.

Ben: Voters may understand that Bernie is old, but Joe Biden is the candidate whose age has been more front and center as a possible drawback. Bernie, while older than Biden, has maintained a breakneck campaign schedule and has appeared not to lose a step in the process. Won’t this put a pretty major dent in that image?

Gabriel: What I meant isn’t that voters understand his age, but that they understand there’s a completely understandable reason for his absence from the trail. I don’t want to speculate too much on the potential political fallout here because we just don’t have any idea what the prognosis is, what Sanders’s plan is, or, really, anything. I’d love more information, but clearly the people around him are being very cautious, and that’s extremely understandable. I’m happy to engage more directly with part of the question, though. Not only has Sanders had a breakneck campaign schedule in 2019, he’s had a basically insane schedule since late 2015. He’s been traveling the country more or less nonstop, and his stamina on the trail has always impressed his aides and the reporters who follow him.

Ben: Indeed, I’ve seen some testaments to that on Twitter.

Gabriel: I can attest to it personally!

Ben: Elizabeth Warren tweeted: “My friend @sensanders has always been a strong partner in the Senate. Wishing him a speedy recovery so he can get back in the fight.” Presumably rival candidates will tread extremely carefully around this news.

Gabriel: Of course. I’ve seen similar tweets or statements from Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Cory Booker, Beto O’Rourke, Andrew Yang, Julián Castro, Tom Steyer, Amy Klobuchar, Michael Bennet, Marianne Williamson, Tim Ryan, Joe Sestak, Tulsi Gabbard, and John Delaney. And, by the way, Trump’s reelection communications director Tim Murtaugh, too. There’s no realistic world in which candidates try to make political hay out of this moment."

Vermont senator Bernie Sanders is hosting a major rally in Queensbridge Park in Long Island City on Saturday, which not only marks the Democratic presidential candidate’s return to the campaign trail after suffering a heart attack in early October, but in which he’ll be joined for the first time by his new big-name endorser, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. As Intelligencer’s Gabriel Debenedetti noted in his preview of the event, with a little over three months remaining before voters begin weighing in on the Democratic primary race, the Sanders campaign hopes the “Bernie’s Back” rally will not only help counteract concerns about his health, but act “as a triumphant return to the trail just in time for the campaign to get serious.”

Below are updates and images from the rally, which got started at 1 p.m., and, according to Sanders, surpassed the 20,000-person limit the campaign was allowed on their permit.

Sanders Celebrates AOC’s Impact, Declares “I am Back”

Sanders referenced Ocasio-Cortez several times during his speech on Saturday. After she introduced him, he praised the congresswoman and the speed in which she has become influential. “I’ve been around politics a few years,” the candidate explained, “and it is hard to believe the degree to which in less than one year, this woman, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress — it is hard to believe the degree to which she has transformed politics in America.”

""For 45 years, there has been a class war waged against working families by the billionaire class and the corporate elite,"" @BernieSanders says.



He calls @AOC an ""inspiration"" to millions of ""young people"" and says he will travel with her throughout the country — Ross Barkan (@RossBarkan) October 19, 2019

Later Sanders said that he looked forward to “traveling with [AOC] all over this country.”

It came as no surprise that Sander’s also emphasized how ready he was to keep campaigning after taking more than two weeks off following his heart attack.

“I am happy to report to you that I am more than ready, more ready than ever to carry on with you the epic struggle that we have today,” Sanders told his supporters. “I am more than ready to assume the office of President of the United States. I am more than ready to take on the greed and corruption of the corporate elites and their apologists.”

“To put it bluntly, I am back.”

Another theme throughout Sanders speech was diversity, which clearly reflects one of the ways his campaign hopes to build more support in the coming months.

Sanders' closing remarks from his #BernieIsBackRally in Queens, NY:

He also criticized — at least generally — some of his moderate rivals for how they had painted his (and Elizabeth Warren’s) policy proposals as unrealistic at last week’s debate.

Ocasio-Cortez Shared Her Sanders-Centered Origin Story

Before an enthusiastic hometown crowd, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made her first official appearance in support of Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign, or at least as a congresswoman and left-liberal icon. Ocasio-Cortez worked as an organizer for Sanders’s campaign in 2016, and explained how — thanks to Sanders and that experience — a “sexually harassed waitress in downtown Manhattan” became an elected member of the U.S. Congress.

“It wasn’t until I heard of a man by the name of Bernie Sanders that I began to question and assert and recognize my inherent value as a human being that deserves health care, housing, education and a living wage,” she told rallygoers. She also noted that Sanders’s 2016 campaign provided a model for her own, adding that she was “proud to say the only reason I had any hope in launching a long-shot campaign for Congress is because Bernie Sanders proved you can run a grassroots campaign and win in an America where we almost thought it was impossible.”

Ocasio-Cortez challenged and defeated longtime New York City congressman Joe Crowley in 2018 (but did not receive an endorsement from Sanders in that race).

“The halls of Congress are no joke,” the freshman Democrat insisted on Saturday. “Standing up to corporate power, and established interests is no joke. It’s not just about standing up and saying these things, but behind closed doors, your arm is twisted, the vise of political pressure gets put on you, every trick in the book, psychological, and otherwise is to get us to abandon the working class.” Understanding that dynamic firsthand, she continued, has made her “appreciate the enormous, consistent, and nonstop advocacy” Sanders offers even more.

Nina Turner Knocks Warren and Biden

Ohio Democrat, progressive organizer, and Sanders campaign national co-chair Nina Turner deployed some criticism at Sanders’s main rivals, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden.

But Turner also falsely said that Sanders was the only candidate who was asked about age during Tuesday’s debate — Biden and Warren were also asked to respond to concerns about their age.

Michael Moore Offers His Support

If you paid close attention to the Democratic presidential debate last week, you noticed something that Democrats might find disturbing. The two leading candidates — Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden, probably in that order — both faced tough questions that could damage them in the general election. And neither appears prepared to defend themselves against what is coming.

Let’s begin with Biden, who has a simple problem with no clear solution. His son Hunter traded on his father’s name. In Ukraine, Hunter accepted a lucrative position on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company. Burisma surely believed hiring the vice-president’s son would give it political juice with the United States government. It did not. Joe Biden’s positions as vice-president did not benefit Burisma. He advocated the good-government line that everybody else in the Obama administration and the (small-D) democratic world took, pushing out that country’s corrupt prosecutor. His substantively correct stance did not benefit Burisma in any form.

Yet this does not fully absolve either Joe or Hunter. The latter was implicitly selling access to his father, and the fact that he did not deliver it means that he essentially conned Burisma. At a minimum, the arrangement marginally spent down the moral capital of the American government and economy by promoting the perception that official favor can be purchased through family members of powerful officials.

Trump, of course, has degraded that moral capital a million times over with his open nepotism and self-dealing. The problem Biden faces is that it is difficult to communicate the nuance of his position. How do you simultaneously say: (1) Hunter Biden was wrong to take that job, and I was wrong to let him; (2) I did not take any official action that benefited his family; and (3) Trump is using this minor corruption as cover to enable oligarchical corruption several orders of magnitude greater?

Biden’s response to this dilemma has been to elide it completely. At the debate, he simply insisted he and Hunter had done nothing wrong while deflecting the inquiry:

Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine. And that’s what we should be focusing on.

And what I wanted to make a point about — and my son’s statement speaks for itself. He spoke about it today. My son’s statement speaks for itself. [Changes subject to Trump.]

When the moderator pointed out that he was dodging, Biden merely repeated the refrain (“My son’s statement speaks for itself”). For human and understandable reasons, Biden is obviously reluctant to scold his troubled son in public. Yet the fact remains that his son’s behavior is an albatross for the father, and all indications suggest that if Biden wins the nomination, the damage from this relationship will only become more extensive.

Warren, for her part, faced yet another round of criticism over her refusal to acknowledge the financing mechanism of the health-care plan she has endorsed. The political weak point of Bernie Sanders’s Medicare for All plan is that it would move 157 million Americans out of employer-sponsored insurance and onto Medicare. In theory, this should work out great. (I would be happy to trade my employer insurance for Medicare.) In practice, this requires persuading half the country to swap their current insurance for a government plan and to convert their health-care premiums (which are nontransparent and remitted directly by their employer, reducing their wages only indirectly) into taxes (which are paid directly). Poll after poll shows that both these changes turn the abstractly popular notion of broader coverage upside down.

Warren’s strategy is to dodge both objections. She has, in the past, avoided the question of people losing their employer insurance by saying nobody likes their insurance company. (That’s not true: People tend to express satisfaction with their current coverage.) On taxes, she changes the question to total cost and refuses to acknowledge that taxes will go up in the swap.

Warren’s admirers consider this dodge to be clever, but the most recent debate shows just how politically damaging it could become. The problem is that Sanders, who wrote the damn bill, openly admits taxes would go up. “I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up,” he conceded, while noting that “for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less — substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expansions.” The contrast between one Medicare for All supporter honestly admitting how the plan would work and the other refusing to admit it did not make her look good. It gave her opponents an opening to cast her as shady, which they seized.

Pete Buttigieg pointed out that Warren’s response was “a yes-or-no question that didn’t get a yes-or-no answer.” Biden said, “It’s important to be straightforward with them,” and Amy Klobuchar added, “At least Bernie’s being honest here.” This is not merely a problem of Warren being associated with an unpopular policy. It is a question that is corroding her reputation for honesty, which is the foundation of her outsider, truth-telling brand.

As will Biden, Warren will find the reality that Trump is orders of magnitude worse to be of little value. Republicans have a party-controlled mass-media apparatus that has trained its rank and file to support liars, but the Democrats do not.

Warren painted herself into this corner by making an elementary mistake: She outsourced her policy position to a rival candidate. Sanders doesn’t care if he takes positions that poll horribly among the electorate as a whole — either he is genuinely invested in a magical-thinking theory of “political revolution” that sweeps away all electoral and legislative constraints or he’s running a message candidacy that isn’t even trying to win at all. By endorsing Sanders’s health-care plan, she gave him control of her message on the issue.

If Biden wants to beat Trump, he needs to put more distance between himself and his son. If Warren wants to beat Trump, she needs to ditch Bernie’s health-care plan and come up with one that doesn’t have political poison pills. The question with both candidates is, what steps are they willing to take to win?"

It’s been a sub-rosa issue throughout the earliest phases of the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination competition. But aside from a not-very-clear generational challenge by Eric Swalwell in the very first debate to Joe Biden to “pass the torch,” and a snide comment by Julián Castro in the September debate that suggested Biden had experienced a senior moment, the age issue hasn’t come up all that much.

It took a Bernie Sanders heart attack to make the age and health of candidates an issue that moderators would raise and that debate viewers would have to think about in an informed way. Citing the candidate’s current age (78), Erin Burnett asked Sanders how he would reassure voters he was up to the job. As the Los Angeles Times reported, that led to a frank exchange involving the septuagenarians in the race:

“Well, let me invite you all to a major rally we’re having in Queens, N.Y.,” Sanders said, before promising a special guest and touting his website. “We are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country that … I think can reassure the American people.”

Turns out Sanders was alluding to an endorsement he’s about to get from a progressive icon from the other end of the generational spectrum:

at @BernieSanders's Queens rally, and is expected to support him for president.🚨https://t.co/H1I9woghzG — Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) October 16, 2019

As someone who has openly worried for a long time that Sanders and Biden might be too old to serve as viable challengers to Donald Trump, I’d observe that Sanders was very effective in this debate — possibly more effective than the old pre-heart attack Sanders who tended to shout ever more loudly in events like this one. But Burnett asked the question to the other seniors in the field:

“One of the reasons I’m running is because of my age and experience — with it comes wisdom,” Biden said, adding that he would release his medical records before the first voting occurred in February.

And she also asked Warren, whose age (70) may have come as a surprise to people who hadn’t heard about it:

Warren, who is frequently seen sprinting to the stage at her events, added that age was less important than providing an ambitious plan to attract the American electorate. But she also pointed to her vigor. “I will outwork, out-organize, and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence, or whoever the Republicans get stuck with,” Warren said.

This rare reference to the possibility that Trump could be removed from office or might resign was striking. And when Tulsi Gabbard was brought in as a representative of younger candidates (at 38, she’s a bit older than Pete Buttigieg), she trained her fire on the incumbent’s age and unfitness. So nobody got damaged by the age issue in this debate, and nobody got in a telling dig, either.

What’s unclear is whether viewers (who may not know how old the candidates actually are) had eyebrows raised by this high-profile airing of the subject, and could have second thoughts about their preferences. Let’s hope it doesn’t take another candidate’s health crisis to get voters thinking about, and becoming comfortable with, the risks associated with eliminating the sort of informal age cap that before Ronald Reagan kept candidates below the retirement age more or less out of the presidential sweepstakes, unless they were already in the White House."

Despite all the attention that has been given to the competition (mostly between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren) for the love and support of progressive activists during the early stages of the 2020 Democratic presidential contest, there’s an arguably even more important struggle underway for labor movement backing. Yes, union ranks have been steadily diminished in recent decades, and unions have been subjected to a sustained and often successful campaign of demonization by employees, shadowy dark money groups, conservative ideologues and black-robed judicial cheerleaders for corporations. But as my colleague Sarah Jones has pointed out, labor is feeling its oats in 2020:

[L]abor is seizing its moment. In a Wednesday morning speech in Milwaukee, the president of the Service Employees International Union outlined sweeping expectations for candidates who want the union’s endorsement. Mary Kay Henry praised Democrats for releasing policy plans to raise taxes on corporations and the rich, but made it clear that those plans are an inadequate substitute for releasing detailed, union-specific proposals. “The wealthy will find a way to protect their wealth, often at any cost. That’s why we need to put working people in charge. Because when workers organize, we can make bigger change, and we can make it stick,” Henry told assembled workers.

She then called for remedies that would increase union power and raise the nation’s rates of union membership. SEIU, she said, expects candidate proposals to meet four basic standards. They should prioritize union membership as a way to reduce economic inequality, and call for sectoral bargaining, where workers employed by different companies in the same industry could bargain collectively for a universal contract. They should also urge states to treat federal labor law as a floor, and not a ceiling, for labor rights, and ensure that federal workers and contractors make at least $15 an hour and have a chance to form a union if they choose. “If candidates can’t commit to these four things, they can’t count on our support,” she said, “and let’s face it, these candidates need our support.”

It’s probably no coincidence that fast-rising candidate Elizabeth Warren released her latest “plan” focused on labor rights the day before SEIU’s pre-endorsement presidential forum. And Vox’s Alexia Fernandez Campbell adjudges it as the “most ambitious” of the campaign so far. It’s certainly the longest, weighing in at 14 pages, and clearly meeting all of SEIU’s criteria. Bernie Sanders anticipated Warren’s action in August with his own “Workplace Democracy Plan.” As Campbell says, though, Warren’s is more detail-oriented:

In many ways, Warren’s ideas mirror some of Sen. Bernie Sanders’s proposals, like making it easier for workers to go on strike and letting unions bargain on behalf of an entire industry. But Warren also focuses on the minutiae — the little tweaks and changes that could make a real difference for working Americans.

About a month ago Campbell also characterized the leading candidates as a whole as falling into two groups:

Reading the labor platforms for each of the 10 candidates who qualified for the third Democratic primary debate next week, two groups emerged: the labor reformers and the labor supporters. Most of the frontrunners fall into the first category — Beto O’Rourke, Buttigieg, and Sanders have all put out astonishingly detailed proposals that would shift the balance of power from businesses to workers. Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar, and Andrew Yang are in the second group. They seem to see themselves more as allies to workers and labor unions than true change-makers.

More recently, veteran labor reporter Steven Greenhouse gave candidates letter grades for their labor proposals, with Sanders and Warren earning an A; Pete Buttigieg an A-minus; Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Julián Castro, Kamala Harris, and Beto O’Rourke a B; Amy Klobuchar a B-minus; and Andrew Yang a C+. (To provide context, Greenhouse awarded Donald Trump an F-plus). It’s interesting that in almost all assessments of the field, Warren rated well even before she issued her “plan” because of deep appreciation for her trade policy proposals, which some union officials told Greenhouse were “by far the best and most sophisticated they’ve ever seen from a lawmaker.” She had also made a mark earlier with her Accountable Capitalism Act, guaranteeing workers 40 percent of corporate board positions, and her early support for California’s new legislation restoring wage, benefit, and union rights to “gig economy” workers.

Whatever endorsements individual unions make (and most are being cautious this year after too many piled onto the Hillary Clinton bandwagon early in the 2016 cycle), their memberships have a host of concerns just like any other voters, including health care (e.g., Medicare for All, which some fervently embrace while others fear as disruptive of generous health plans won at the bargaining table), specific industry concerns related to energy and the environment, women’s and minority rights, and of course electability. Any of the Democrats would be considered far superior to Trump and the party he leads. It’s notable that the pol most often singled out as representing the GOP’s bright and diverse post-Trump future, Nikki Haley, once told corporate investors they weren’t welcome in South Carolina if they brought along “union jobs.” Now more than ever, presidential general elections are a holy war for the labor movement, and its organizational muscle and enthusiasm will be valued assets for the eventual Democratic nominee."

That the American political system has recently been characterized by intense partisan polarization is hardly breaking news. It’s not entirely news, either, since it has been underway since the two parties began realigning ideologically in the 1960s, mostly because of the civil-rights revolution. The fact that we are in an era of (mostly) close partisan parity matters too; that raises the stakes of elections and drives sharp partisan differentiation.

Still, there’s “partisan polarization,” and then there’s the kind of bitter division normally associated with things like the Spanish Civil War. The latest edition of the American Values Survey from the Public Religion Research Institute shows pretty clearly that partisans subscribe to extremist characterizations of what makes the other side tick. Putting aside whether these are true (we’ll return to that topic later), it’s amazing how little Democrats have in common with Republicans, and vice versa, in how they view the other party.

The survey asks whether the Democratic Party is “trying to make capitalism work for the average American” or “has been taken over by socialists.” Self-identified Democrats agree with the former description over the latter by an 83-15 margin, but self-identified Republicans agree with the latter over the former by an 82-17 margin. This probably isn’t just a vestige of the era of Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, by the way; you may recall there was a serious effort ten years ago to get the Republican National Committee to constantly refer to the Donkey Party as the “Democrat Socialist Party” shortly after the centrist Barack Obama took office.

Meanwhile, the PRRI survey asked if the GOP is “trying to protect the American way of life against outside threats” or “had been taken over by racists.” Republicans chose the former characterization by a 94-5 margin, while Democrats chose the latter by an 80-17 margin.

Some may object that to some extent these findings simply reflect the tendency of partisans to choose less-disreputable labels for themselves and more-disreputable labels for the Other Team. But still: The extreme disconnect in perceptions has to mean something.

And that leads one back to objective reality and the need to resist the temptation to see partisan polarization through the lens of false equivalence. Have Democrats really been “taken over by socialists?” Well, all I know is that the currently preeminent lefty candidate for president embraces the capitalist label regularly and enthusiastically — as do all but one of her nomination-contest rivals, not to mention the vast majority of Democrats in Congress and in statehouses around the country. Even the nation’s most prominent self-identified “democratic socialist,” Bernie Sanders, stands for an ideological tradition borrowed mostly from FDR, not from some alien anti-capitalist tradition.

Now it’s true that most Republicans strongly resist the racist label too. But it’s also true that the maximum leader they adore has embraced racist expressions for most of his career. And the same PRRI survey that documents partisan polarization also shows that 69 percent of self-identified Republicans agree that “discrimination against whites has become as big a problem as discrimination against blacks and other minorities.” You probably need to be at least a wee bit racist to believe that howler.

False equivalence aside, these findings add to our understanding that the 2020 elections are going to represent an apocalyptic clash of cultures and perceptions. Taking perceptions of the opposition as they exist and ratcheting them up into the insane level they are likely to achieve when the deal goes down is going to make this feel like a fight between the Klan and Commies. And unlike some political systems, ours has no mechanism to create a coalition government. It will be all or nothing for both sides, at least when it comes to the executive branch and the judicial branch the president’s party will dominate via appointments — and perhaps the legislative branch shaped by straight-ticket voting.

In a post yesterday on Joe Biden’s meh third-quarter fundraising haul, I suggested that its significance really depended on how the candidate nipping at his heels, Elizabeth Warren, did. Today we found out she did quite well, as NBC News reports:

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has raised $24.6 million during the past three months, her campaign said Friday, beating her last quarter haul of $19.1 million and quadrupling her $6 million total from the first quarter of the year.

The announcement comes as Warren, who has eschewed high-dollar events in favor of targeting small-dollar donations — continues to solidify her place at or near the top of the Democratic presidential field in both polling and fundraising. She was outpaced only by fellow progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders — who leads the pack with $25.3 million raised in the third quarter — and dwarfed the fundraising totals announced Thursday by former Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign. Biden raised $15.2 million in the third quarter.

Warren’s campaign also reported she had over $25 million in cash on hand at the end of September, and was making its first paid ad buys of the cycle in the early states.

All in all, it validates the gamble Team Warren made in taking the big $10 million surplus she transferred from her Senate campaign account (which, for the record, she was able to raise without the no-big-dollar restrictions she’s placed on herself in her presidential fundraising) and investing it in expensive but vital field staff in the early states, in hopes that she would be able to pay for its maintenance and expansion as new money rolled in. At the moment, it’s all working for the Massachusetts senator, whose campaign seemed to be stalled earlier this year. The most recent polls from Iowa, New Hampshire, and even California and the latest big national poll (from Monmouth) all show her taking the lead. And aside from showing her overall financial strength, the third-quarter numbers indicate she’s keeping pace with Bernie Sanders’s small-dollar money machine, even as she has largely eclipsed him in the polls.

At the moment, you could say the Democratic race remains dominated by the Big Three of Warren, Biden, and Sanders (in whatever order you choose to rank them), with fundraising dominated by a Big Four (those three plus Pete Buttigieg, who raised $24 million in the second quarter and $19 million in the third). Everyone trailing these candidates in either metric needs to make a move soon as voters prepare to vote."

The brouhaha over Bernie Sanders’s hospitalization for heart disease and his brief surgery to install two stents to deal with a blockage created a lot of confusion. And a lot of the talk was less about Sanders’s heart trouble than about his age, and how the incident might remind journalists and voters alike of the septuagenarians (Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren as well as Sanders) occupying the first, second, and third positions in all the national polls.

But for the record, it’s important to understand that this is hardly the first time someone on the path toward, or occupying, the White House has had a heart attack or some equally serious health condition. Two complicating factors are the evolving treatments that have made some once-feared diseases manageable, or at least non-life-threatening, and, just as important, how easy it used to be for candidates and presidents alike to hide health problems. John F. Kennedy, to cite one well-known example, was diagnosed with Addison’s Disease in 1947, an ailment that can cause acute pain and involve dangerous medications. That was five years before his first statewide campaign and 13 years before his presidential campaign. As the Los Angeles Times noted a few years ago, it was kept a secret at least until after he was inaugurated:

Hard though it is to believe these days – when a celebrity’s smallest sneeze is analyzed – Kennedy’s family and advisors were able to keep his medical history virtually secret. Kennedy, at 43 the youngest president ever elected, was portrayed as healthy and vibrant. In reality, he suffered various problems controlled by a daily regimen of steroids and other drugs.

Kennedy’s predecessor, Dwight D. Eisenhower, had a lot of serious health issues, as Healthline explains:

Eisenhower instructed his press secretary to inform the public of his condition after his heart attack in 1955. Six months before the election of 1956, Eisenhower was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease and underwent surgery, from which he recovered. One year later, the president had a mild stroke, which he was able to overcome.

And Lyndon Johnson had what was by all accounts a severe heart attack the same year as Ike’s, in 1955, when he was only 47. Despite his duties as Senate Majority Leader, Johnson was hospitalized for more than a month and didn’t return to Washington for several months after that. He had at least two more heart attacks, the last one fatal, after leaving the White House.

Dick Cheney, who never ran for president but was on the campaign trail twice as George W. Bush’s running mate and was, as the saying goes, a “heartbeat from the presidency” for eight years, had a history of heart disease even more extensive than Johnson’s, suffering his first heart attack at 37 in 1978, and three more before becoming vice-president. He subsequently had another heart attack shortly after leaving office, and then had a heart transplant in 2012.

Only one president died of heart disease while in office: Warren G. Harding.

But a number of presidents have had heart problems shortly after leaving office, including most recently Bill Clinton (quadruple-bypass surgery) and George W. Bush (a stent).

Other presidents have had other deadly ailments, ranging from the paralytic strokes that debilitated Woodrow Wilson during his second term to the prostate and skin cancers for which Ronald Reagan underwent operations during his second term. Unlike these, some medical conditions were well known at the time, most obviously the polio that confined Franklin D. Roosevelt to a wheelchair long before he ran for president.

As the FDR example illustrates, sometimes a successful battle against health conditions can become a symbol of courage and perseverance. Transparency about such conditions definitely helps: A previously hidden history of mental-health treatments suddenly destroyed the 1972 vice-presidential candidacy of Thomas Eagleton practically before it started. Indeed, that experience led to what has become an ever-more-elaborate vetting process for presidential and vice-presidential candidates in the ensuing years.

How voters might react to a serious health condition might also depend on the factors usually lumped under the term “lifestyle choices.” When LBJ had his first heart attack, he was a three-pack-a-day cigarette smoker. He quit coffin nails after nearly dying but never shed being a workaholic and fried-food addict. Given today’s diagnosis and treatment advances, a mild heart attack and a couple of stents should hardly be alarming, but the more a candidate can reassure voters he or she isn’t working or playing him- or herself into the grave, the better."

They also fret that the two other top-ranking candidates, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), are too liberal to win a general election. Other candidates have had moments to shine, but none yet have fully transformed that into anything approaching momentum.

Oprah Winfrey, an early backer of Barack Obama who was initially enthusiastic about former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke, has repeatedly begged Disney chief executive Bob Iger to jump into the race. Hillary Clinton, according to two people close to her, has not ruled out jumping in herself, a sign that she is hearing similar dissatisfaction.

“You can imagine much stronger candidates,” said Elaine Kamarck, a Democratic National Committee member. She pines for Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who declined to run, or an outsider such as retired Adm. William H. McRaven, who oversaw the 2011 raid that killed al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.

John Coale, a major donor to both Bill and Hillary Clinton, was more blunt. “They don’t have anybody who can win the general [election],” he said.

In conversations with 17 state and national party leaders, nearly all expressed some level of unease with where the field stands and a deepening concern that, even as Trump suffers through one of the darkest phases of his presidency, the leading presidential contenders would struggle mightily in a one-on-one contest with him. For all of his challenges, Trump commands a gigantic operation that has vacuumed up unprecedented sums of money, an unparalleled megaphone to lure in voters and a lock on most of the Republican Party. Democrats face the possibility of a long primary fight that could cleave the party along ideological and generational lines and leave the nominee campaigning against an incumbent whom Democrats see as simultaneously weak and hard to beat.

AD

AD

The unpredictable nature of the race so far has contributed to Democrats’ unease. Candidates who at first seemed to combine crowd-pleasing star power with center-left appeal, such as O’Rourke and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), faded quickly. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has commanded attention on the debate stage but been unable to appeal to black voters, a concern underscored Tuesday by a leaked memo detailing a focus group of black South Carolina voters who expressed discomfort with him being gay.

Others moderates, such as Sens. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Michael F. Bennet (Colo.) and Gov. Steve Bullock (Mont.), linger toward the bottom of the polls.

That has helped propel speculation about Hillary Clinton, the 2016 party nominee, although aides say the likelihood of her seeking a rematch with Trump remains slim. Those close to Clinton, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment on her behalf, say she has felt vindicated over the past few weeks as Trump’s political difficulties have deepened. That sentiment was reinforced this week when the State Department announced its probe into emails sent to a private server, a major complication of her 2016 campaign, found no evidence of deliberate mishandling of classified information by department employees .

“Ultimately, it’s unlikely she would do it,” said one person who has spoken with her. “But put it this way: It ain’t zero. And does she think about it all the time? Absolutely.”

Allies have passed around an op-ed that appeared in the San Francisco Chronicle, written by former San Francisco mayor Willie Brown, with the headline, “Who should run against Trump? How about Hillary Clinton?”

Supporters say she has been glued to the Democratic primary contest and has spoken with some frequency with Warren and Biden, among others. Now selling a book written with her daughter, Chelsea, she has been a constant public presence of late, engaging in a days-long spat with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and repeatedly trolling Trump on his favorite communications platform, Twitter.

AD

A late entrance under any circumstances would be difficult, with Clinton’s former aides and fundraising network dispersed among many current campaigns. But her supporters have discussed whether she could helm a slimmed-down campaign operation and whether she would be able to maintain the less cautious, more freewheeling persona she has adopted since her loss in 2016.

AD

“Her view is: I ran against this guy, I know how to do this,” said one of those close to her. “She has battle scars to prove it.”

The chatter has made it out to the campaign trail. Asked about Clinton by reporters at a Des Moines high school on Monday, Warren parried: “Do you have a question about education?” Asked later what role Clinton should play in 2020, she replied, “I do not have any comment on that.”

AD

Views about Clinton vary widely, however, and in part mirror the ideological and generational schisms that have fed the current anxiety. More seasoned leaders who have seen Democrats lose big have tended to prefer a safer, middle-road candidate more palatable to a wide range of voters. Those newer to the process are attracted to the vibrant and passionate candidates who can entice the base.

The push for liberal purity is one that raises warning flags for the Rev. Joseph A. Darby Jr., an influential black pastor in South Carolina. He said he fears a repeat of the “McGovern situation,” referring to the 1972 presidential election that pitted liberal Sen. George McGovern against incumbent Republican Richard Nixon.

He “was the great white hope,” Darby said. “He was the one that everyone went with because he was so wonderfully progressive, and he got his butt beat at the polls. I don’t want to see a repeat of that.”

AD

But he’s also bothered by Biden’s poor fundraising.

“I don’t know if it’s a lack of hustle or what, but it’s a concern,” Darby said. “Running for office ain’t cheap these days.”

Some of the more moderate and lower-polling candidates, such as former Maryland congressman John Delaney, fault the Democratic National Committee for creating a system in which candidates who are already well known or have base-pleasing views have a massive advantage.

AD

The party set a high threshold for grass-roots donors that candidates had to meet to make it on the debate stages, an incentive system that he said rewards far-left views.

Moderate candidates lose out if the DNC process trumps the traditional vetting role that voters in Iowa and New Hampshire have long played, he said.

Biden, he said, hasn’t offered enough new ideas for younger Democrats to embrace him. And Sanders and Warren, he said, are too far to the left to win.

“You need to run on things that half the country agrees with you,” he said.

A key problem with many candidates, particularly the liberal ones, according to nearly all of the party leaders interviewed, is their support for ending the private health insurance industry via a Medicare-for-all plan.

Kamarck, the DNC member, said it’s a “trap” in which Warren, in particular, now finds herself stuck.

AD

Warren has been criticized for weeks for refusing to say how she’d fund the massive program, eventually saying Sunday that she would release a detailed funding plan in the next few weeks. But the next day she remained uncomfortable discussing ­Medicare-for-all — insisting five times that reporters should focus on her education plan.

AD

Warren, whose stock has risen more than any other candidate this year, growing steadily as Biden, Sanders and Harris have faltered, also faces a renewed challenge from the left. Her main competition on that front, Sanders, has revived his campaign since suffering a heart attack three weeks ago, posting impressive fundraising numbers and hosting the biggest rally of the election cycle, featuring an endorsement from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).

As she works to build a national campaign, Warren also has faced criticism from Iowa Democrats concerned about her absences.

AD

“I don’t know what her strategy is. I don’t know why she’s not here, but people have noticed,” said Steve Drahozal, the chairman of the Dubuque County Democratic Party, who said he has appealed to the Warren campaign several times for the candidate to visit.

Buttigieg is matching Warren’s formidable ground game in Iowa, according to county Democratic chairs. Klobuchar also has increasingly pinned her campaign on a strong showing there.

A USA Today/Suffolk poll this week showed Biden and Warren tied in Iowa, with Buttigieg a few points behind, feeding worry among party leaders that the race could remain unsettled for a long while, as Trump whales on the Democratic field. Coale and others raised the prospect of an undecided convention, which he likened to “a Geraldo show where chairs are flying.”

Other seasoned party hands noted that it’s normal for Democrats to fret.

“Democrats characterologically worry about everything,” said Steven Grossman, a former Democratic Party chairman who is supporting Buttigieg. “We have that quality and characteristic, but I’m not one of those people. I believe that whoever emerges from the primary process will be battle tested.”"

FiveThirtyEight’s Perry Bacon Jr. posed a question this week that might have chilled the bones of progressives while thrilling centrists. It’s one that is asked of presidential candidates from both parties if an approaching general election is perceived as highly competitive, as 2020’s is expected to be:

Several of Joe Biden’s top rivals in the 2020 Democratic primary are presenting themselves as more liberal on policy issues than the former vice-president. But if Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, or Kamala Harris were to win the nomination, would they reposition themselves to appeal to more centrist voters in a general election?

It’s a question that in the not-too-distant past would have been answered affirmatively by most Democrats and some Republicans (the latter being more circumspect about arousing the suspicions of conservative ideologues forever trying to identify and purge RINOs, or Republicans In Name Only). No one would be as blatant as 2012 Mitt Romney communications director Eric Fehrnstrom:

[W]hen Mr. Fehrnstrom on Wednesday reached for a word to describe how Mr. Romney might pivot to the general election, the one that came tumbling from his mouth was “Etch A Sketch,” the children’s drawing toy in which nothing is ever permanent.

“Everything changes,” Mr. Fehrnstrom, 50, said on CNN, with a slight smirk that suggested he believed he was about to use a clever line. “It’s almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up and restart all over again.”

Conservatives who thought most of their policy positions came down from the Founders, if not from God Almighty, were not amused, and it exacerbated Romney’s reputation for being an unprincipled opportunist. And it’s the sort of thing Democratic progressives might fear in an ideologically anodyne candidate like Kamala Harris or Pete Buttigieg. In their struggle to challenge Elizabeth Warren’s progressive credentials, you can imagine Bernie Sanders supporters fanning fears that the Massachusetts senator might “move to the center” if nominated. She is, after all, a Democrat, not a Democratic Socialist, the self-identification that pretty much precludes any “move to the center” by Bernie if it involves changing policy positions (many of which he’s had for decades).

But as Bacon observes, a nomination winner’s efforts to expand her base of support heading into a general election can be accomplished in ways other than changing policy positions or adopting new ones designed to appeal to “centrists” or “swing voters.”

[L]ike with past nominees, it will be easier for these candidates to present themselves as more moderate in a general election through shifts in tone and their vice-presidential picks rather than moving right on policy.

They can also, I would add, emphasize a different mix of the positions, or biographical features, that they already possess to appeal to voters who aren’t in the party’s “base.” And that sometimes means forgetting about the increasingly dubious idea that swing voters are “centrist.” If you think about it for a minute, a party nominee might best emphasize his most popular policy ideas, which may be “centrist” but could just as easily be “progressive” by conventional terms; examples of the latter include free college, expanded Social Security benefits, wealth taxes, and nationalist trade policies. Indeed, a smart general-election strategy for a Bernie Sanders or an Elizabeth Warren might be to choose policies and messages that rev up progressives but at the same time appeal to swing voters. Those do exist.

The base-energizing factor speaks to another issue of general-election strategy: Campaigns must calculate to what extent their winning strategy depends on mobilization as opposed to persuasion. A lot of progressives believe non-voters skew heavily in their direction, on the theory that under-voting demographic groups like millennials are disproportionately progressive, and/or haven’t viewed the two-party choice as sufficiently clear. So creating an ideologically polarized general-election atmosphere will boost turnout among both the partisan base and previous non-voters, without any “moving to the center” at all.

Now something Democrats may have to contend with is the very high probability that the Trump 2020 campaign and the GOP will campaign against the nominee as an infanticide-supporting, anti-American, business-hating socialist, forcing Democrats into the false choice of either implicitly confirming those characterizations or pushing off them in a way that may discourage the Democratic base. A GOP campaign of insane negativity and unprincipled smears would be the perfectly predictable Trump M.O., and it also could work, as Hillary Clinton’s overconfident 2016 campaign learned.

How different candidates plan to deal with that challenge is a legitimate issue for primary voters, along with their plans to deal with a still-powerful Republican Party if they win. Everything we know about Sanders and his supporters suggests that he intends to overwhelm Trump by mobilizing a hidden majority that’s been waiting to support a progressive “political revolution” all along. Warren and other left-bent candidates may be more strategically flexible. And Biden, of course, has hitched his wagon to the older idea of “moving to the center” as a way to persuade swing voters. Even if you think (as I do) that this is an outmoded way of thinking that sacrifices too much ideological turf, if a majority of Democratic primary voters think that way, it could lift the former veep to the nomination, if not the presidency."

With all the buzz this week over polling on impeachment, you may have missed some trends in the 2020 Democratic presidential contest. For the first time, it may be appropriate to refer to Joe Biden as the “former front-runner” or at least as “the co-front-runner.” The most-quoted source of polling averages, RealClearPolitics, has had Biden at the top of its Democratic presidential list since it began compiling such averages in December 2018 (five months before he formally entered the race). Today its two-week averages show Elizabeth Warren overtaking the former veep in national surveys with 26.6 percent to his 26.4 percent. Bernie Sanders is a distant third at 14.6 percent, and, of the other candidates, only Pete Buttigieg (5.6 percent) and Kamala Harris (4.4. percent) are above three percent. Only Biden’s 12-point lead in the increasingly outlier-like Politico/Morning Consult tracking poll is keeping him more or less in sync with Warren.

Warren is also leading Biden in the RCP polling averages for Iowa, though Biden remains slightly ahead of the field in New Hampshire and Nevada (where Sanders is second) and more impressive in South Carolina. Biden retains his lead in head-to-head general-election trial heats against Trump in the RCP averages with a 7.4 percent lead compared to 5.2 percent for Sanders, 4.5 percent for Warren, two percent for Buttigieg and one percent for Harris. In the very latest trial heat from Quinnipiac, Warren has moved into second place, leading Trump by 8 percent, with Biden still ahead of her at 11 percent and Sanders just behind her at 7 percent."

After the last Democratic presidential-candidates debate in Houston on September 12, I adjudged the event as having little impact on the dynamics of the race. Sure, some candidates may have marginally helped themselves (Elizabeth Warren, as always, and probably Pete Buttigieg, Cory Booker, and Beto O’Rourke) and others may have hurt themselves (Julián Castro and Kamala Harris). But the overall dominance of the field by the Big Three (Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Warren) was undisturbed.

In part, the lack of drama in Houston was attributable to the lack of friction between Biden and Warren during their long-awaited first debate appearance on the same stage. Yes, Bernie Sanders was aggressively hostile to Biden’s criticisms of Medicare for All (the topic that debate moderators appear to find endlessly fascinating, at the expense of all others). But no one seemed to exude a sense of urgency about the competition, and so needles did not move.

Or did they? Whether or not the last debate made any difference, the dynamics have changed thanks to Warren’s steady rise in the polls and other indicators of candidate strength. On the day of the Houston debate, Biden had a ten-point lead over Warren in the RealClearPolitics national polling averages, and Warren was virtually tied with Sanders. Now Warren is virtually tied with Biden, with Sanders more than ten points back. On the fundraising front, Warren, like Sanders, is relying on small-dollar contributions, and like Sanders did very well in the quarter than ended on September 30 (Sanders reported $25.3 million raised, and Warren $24.6 million; Biden was significantly behind at $15.2 million). And probably most importantly, Biden’s perceived electability advantage may be eroding, as Warren is doing much better than before in head-to-head trial heats against Trump (Biden’s average lead over Trump is now 6.9 percent; Sanders’s is 5.3 percent; and Warren’s is 5.2 percent). There’s really not a lot of distance separating the Big Three — or, if you prefer, the two co-front-runners — on this particular measure of electability. And Warren’s favorability ratio among Democrats is now, according to the Morning Consult tracking poll, at 68/14; Biden’s is 73/20, and Sanders’s is 73/19.

Add in the fact that Warren now leads in the polling averages for the first two contests, in Iowa and in New Hampshire, and you can see why she rather than Biden may have a bull’s-eye on her back in the fourth debate. Reinforcing that possibility is the fact that Biden is in such a delicate position thanks to the central role he and his son Hunter are playing in the impeachment drama that has gripped Washington. His campaign has already pointedly warned rivals not to bring up the subject in the next debate. And if they (or more likely the moderators) do “go there,” then the former veep may chew scenery as the victim of a Trump smear, or as the candidate so terrifying to Trump that he risked impeachment to promote the smear.

So all in all, if anyone is to become a target in Ohio, it may be Warren. But she won’t be an easy target. For one thing, she is a skillful debater (none of the other candidates, so far as I know, went to college on a debate scholarship) who manages to convey passion without attacking other candidates, and is steadily improving her already strong ability to get wonky while remaining relatable to regular folks. And she’s pretty good at generating zingers, as she showed at the most recent multi-candidate forum (as reported by The Guardian):

During the CNN forum on LGBT issues on Thursday, Morgan Cox, the chair of the Human Rights Campaign board of directors, asked Warren how she would react to a supporter who said: “I’m old-fashioned and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.”

Warren replied: “Well, I’m going to assume it’s a guy who said that. And I’m going to say, then just marry one woman. I’m cool with that. Assuming you can find one.”

That’s already gone viral.

Another problem with going after Warren is that the most savage GOP talking points about her are not about things Democrats are likely to touch with a ten-foot pole. Yes, she received extensive progressive criticism late last year for the DNA test she took the rebut conservative claims she had faked a Native American identity. But at this point, raising the subject just reinforces Trump’s interminably offensive “Pocahontas” labeling of Warren. The latest pseudo-scandal about Warren, a dubious claim that she made up an incident where she was “shown the door” as a teacher when she was pregnant, has aroused a some sympathy for her, particularly among women. No Democrat will bring that up, either, and if moderators do, then other candidates may well leap to her defense.

Perhaps one of the more “moderate” candidates who are lagging in the polls, such as Buttigieg, O’Rourke, or Amy Klobuchar, could bring out the old shillelagh of “too far left” for Warren or “too expensive” for her policy proposals. But they have to be careful about sounding like they are repeating Republican talking points. And such talk could tempt moderators into yet another endless discussion of Medicare for All and its effect on private insurance and tax rates — a discussion likely to give Warren and Sanders a disproportionate share of debate time.

Speaking of Bernie Sanders, no candidate’s standing is more threatened than his by Warren’s recent good fortune. And clearly, some of his supporters would like him to take her down a notch. But so far, both of these candidates have resisted various pressures to get them at odds with each other. And in the Ohio debate, Sanders may be less focused on Warren than on projecting sound health and renewed determination after his recent heart attack.

So to come full circle, could the real clash in Ohio be between Warren and Biden after all? As the candidate for whom everything’s coming up roses lately, Warren would seem to have little to gain by going on the attack at this point. And as noted above, Biden may have other fish to fry in dealing with — or perhaps exploiting — the impeachment saga. But sometimes unexpected things can happen in debates, particularly if a moderator springs a surprise or skillfully foments a fight. But all in all, the strongest debater in the field is the least likely to stumble, and stumbles by others could continue to frustrate those dismayed for one reason or another by Warren’s success."

Bernie Sanders spent lots of time talking on the phone during his two weeks off the campaign trail post–heart attack earlier this month. There were the uneventful well-wishing calls he and his wife Jane got from his rivals in the 2020 presidential race, and from some political allies. (Harry Reid, for one, visited in person while Sanders was still hospitalized in Las Vegas.) There were some more eventful ones, like the “I’m going to endorse you” call he got from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, routed through his campaign manager Faiz Shakir. And, once it pretty quickly became clear to Sanders’s aides in both Las Vegas and Washington that he would be able to resume campaigning, and that they should map out next steps, there were the reassurance calls.

No one, after all, knew what to expect from the 78-year-old, who had just suffered his first heart attack. At his campaign headquarters in D.C., for example, Sanders’s staff gathered three times to hear formal updates while news trickled out from Nevada, then Vermont. Sanders himself called in once to speak with, and rally, the assembled operatives. They’d just come through a long summer that included some undeniably rough patches, politically speaking, both internally and because of the rise of Elizabeth Warren. The campaign had remained mostly quiet in the early days of Sanders’s hospitalization, holding off for days before confirming late on a Friday that he’d suffered a heart attack. But its few informal public communications were starting to shape a message — the day Sanders was discharged and returned to Vermont, senior adviser Josh Orton tweeted a link to a video of “Willy Wonka’s Grand Entrance” and titled it “NEW footage of Bernie leaving the hospital.” Sanders’s top aides now wanted the full staff in on the plan: Sanders would remain at home, recovering, for two weeks until the next debate, but they were to push ahead as hard as ever. The voters needed reassuring, too.

So while Sanders met with his inner circle back in Burlington and began prepping in his backyard for the debate the same way he always did — a casual back-and-forth, not a formal mock session — his campaign began putting out new formal policy proposals (with Sanders weighing in over the phone). It resumed an Iowa television ad buy that it had temporarily suspended, and it advertised a wave of surrogate campaign events in early-voting states. With uncertainty about Sanders’s health circulating, it announced he would participate in a march “to end corporate greed” in Des Moines next month, and it distributed a video Sanders filmed to thank supporters for their messages. He sat for a pair of TV interviews. His teams in the states pushed the “full steam ahead” message, too: In Nevada, they said they’d now attempted over one million voter contacts and rolled out a slate of new community leader and educator endorsements; in New Hampshire, they announced campaign co-chairs; and in South Carolina, they opened an office in Florence County.

And they announced that on Saturday he’d be holding a major rally at Queensbridge Park, titled “Bernie’s Back.” Before long, they started teasing that there’d be a “special guest” there as well.

Still, some nerves lingered in Burlington as the senior brass prepared for Tuesday’s debate in Ohio. They knew Sanders would get a health question, but even if he was ready for that, this three-hour session would still be his return to the full-speed fray.

Yet by the time the candidate walked offstage and asked his aides how he did on Tuesday night, as he always does immediately after leaving debate stages, their mood had shifted considerably. Not only did Sanders exceed his skeptics’ expectations, the public now knew about the endorsements from Ocasio-Cortez and her fellow “Squad” member Ilhan Omar. (These endorsements were supposed to be rolled out later, but the news broke early.) The campaign’s attention was already shifting to Saturday, when Ocasio-Cortez would join Sanders onstage for the first time this year, a moment that had been in the making since she’d flown to Vermont late last month and sat with Bernie, Jane Sanders, Shakir, and one of her own aides for what Shakir called a meeting of “two ideological compatriots who see each other, who understand one another.”

Sanders’s advisers describe this moment now as a triumphant return to the trail just in time for the campaign to get serious. “November is exactly when we want to be going up, showing momentum,” said Shakir, describing Ocasio-Cortez’s presence onstage as “the kind of movement that shakes” the hard-to-mobilize voters Sanders needs by his side. The senator’s team is in talks with the congresswoman’s about a trip to Iowa, too, Shakir said. Longtime Sanders adviser Jeff Weaver said he expects the candidate to soon return to something like his typical breakneck campaign speed: “Obviously the health incident raised some immediate questions, and it was obviously important to demonstrate what was the case — which was he was on the road to recovery and will be campaigning vigorously.” The political revolution, in this telling, is back on track.

The truth is that this is, indeed, an inflection point for Sanders, but a far more delicate one than he or his allies readily admit. In fact, how the candidate handles the next month could determine the rest of his trajectory in the race.

Sanders, who has yet to release promised medical information, and who has switched his primary campaign message from Medicare for All to electability and back multiple times, is reemerging just as more voters are watching the race more closely than ever, and just as Warren, the newly minted front-runner, faces centrist fire for the first time, and just as his campaign brain trust hopes his 2016 supporters come home to him.

Notorious among his allies for his resistance to talk about his personal life, Sanders is hoping to move on from the health question. At earlier stages of his political career, he’s bristled when asked about his health.

It was never a campaign issue in 2016, after Hillary Clinton ally David Brock floated the idea of calling for Sanders to release his medical records early in the primary, only to face a huge internal backlash. Still, Sanders liked making a point of taking it off the table. During that campaign, some of his early ads included shots of him running during his student days and playing baseball as an adult, and he enjoyed playing basketball in front of the cameras. In the lead-up to the 2020 race, he participated in multiple long marches — once, when a CNN anchor asked Weaver about Sanders’s health following such a campaign event in Indiana, Weaver shot back that the reporter was struggling to keep up with the hearty Sanders. Sanders told New York that week, “I thank God, you know, I can’t remember the last day — honestly — when I missed work.” He continued, “What people have a right to know: Is the candidate healthy? Does he or she have the energy to do what is a very stressful and difficult job?” On the debate stage this week, he pointed to his Saturday rally when asked about his heart.

Now, though, he’s tasked with moving past these questions just when he has to catch back up to Warren and eclipse Joe Biden. He lost ground over the summer, and entering the fall, he tossed out and rebuilt parts of his Iowa team and completely overhauled his operation in New Hampshire, a must-win state for him where he is now polling third.

And while polling since his heart attack has been scant, the early indications haven’t been good: The most recent national Quinnipiac poll showed Sanders’s support dropping over the course of the previous week, including significant drops among non-college-educated white voters and very liberal voters — two groups he can ill afford to lose. Meanwhile, a HuffPost/YouGov survey had just 28 percent of Democrats assessing Sanders as being in adequate physical condition for four years of the presidency.

The imperative for a blockbuster return to the scene, then, is strategically obvious. It started with the debate, continued with the rollout of Omar’s endorsement video the next morning, and will peak with Saturday’s rally with Ocasio-Cortez, one of the party’s biggest stars. Soon Sanders will appear with Rashida Tlaib, another “Squad” member, in Michigan, ahead of another expected endorsement.

The question, really, is what comes after that, once he returns to typical campaign events.

Some of Sanders’s close aides were delighted when the senator’s first comments after his hospitalization were about the need to implement a Medicare for All system, and they expect him to lean back into that signature plan as the centerpiece of his campaign. “We will ratchet it up on Medicare for All,” said longtime labor leader Larry Cohen, a veteran Sanders adviser who chairs the board of the Sanders-spawned Our Revolution outside group. Others see merit in a punchy tack that directly takes on Biden, specifically over the health-care question. Already, on Thursday, Sanders issued a statement decrying Biden’s use of “the talking points of the insurance industry to attack Medicare for All,” and a Friday fundraising email from the campaign echoed this line.

What they all agree on now is that Sanders is intent on digging back in for the long haul, not transitioning to a new kind of campaign, as he’d hinted, then walked back, in recent weeks. The Saturday rally isn’t just about reenergizing his base and bringing in new voters, said Cohen. It’s also a signal of a long slog ahead. That’s because in his telling, it’s a statement of intent about the New York primary.

That contest is likely to be the final opportunity for candidates who are still standing to pick up large numbers of delegates. And it’s not for another six months."

Biden’s move came amid growing anxiety among Biden’s supporters that he is unprepared to handle the dual challenges of running a general-election campaign against Trump while simultaneously facing an intensifying Democratic primary contest.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) has started to eclipse him in several polls, and Biden last week reported raising only $15.2 million during the last quarter — nearly $10 million less than Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Biden’s supporters also have bridled that Democrats have been slow to rush to Biden’s defense.

Biden’s campaign on Saturday night distributed a memo to reporters from deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield. The subject of the memo highlighted the twin challenges that one of the leading candidates has faced: “Biden Campaign Will Hammer Donald Trump While Focusing On The Issues.”

AD

“This campaign will continue to focus on the issues that impact people’s lives while simultaneously hammering Donald Trump for his unprecedented abuse of power and correcting the record on the mountain of lies Trump and his allies continue to spread about Joe Biden,” Bedingfield wrote.

She outlined three strategies that the campaign is attempting to employ: calling out inaccuracies in Trump’s charges, fighting back against Trump, and talking about issues they believe voters care most about.

AD

Biden and his campaign have struggled over the past two weeks amid a flurry of developments that have launched a House impeachment inquiry in which Biden is a central player. Biden has alternated between pushing back on Trump and seeming unsure of how to handle a situation that has placed the focus on his son Hunter.

AD

For several days at a time, he had few public events, the only responses coming from his remarks at fundraisers at which a handful of reporters are allowed inside. But even then, he has openly ruminated about Trump in various directions.

Biden on Thursday night in San Francisco talked about the allegations, then quickly shifted to say, “This isn’t about me, it’s about you.” His focus then turned back toward himself, as he noted how he was the one who defeated Trump in most polls.

He then went on to talk about his son, making light of a false allegation by Trump that Hunter Biden had made $1.5 billion in China.

“I wonder where the hell that money is, man, because I’ve got to pay tuitions,” Biden said. “God bless me!”

Then he said aloud that he couldn’t get into the “mosh pit” with Trump because the focus should be on issues like climate change and guns. After devoting several minutes to that, he said, “I don’t want to get sucked into this, what he likes to do.”

Biden’s Post op-ed attempted to focus both on Trump’s latest attacks, as well as a broader indictment of his presidency. He criticized the president on climate change and for not doing more to stand up for the rights of protesters in Hong Kong.

“Our first president, George Washington, famously could not tell a lie,” Biden wrote. “President Trump seemingly cannot tell the truth — about anything. He slanders anyone he sees as a threat. That is why is he is frantically pushing flat-out lies, debunked conspiracy theories and smears against me and my family, no doubt hoping to undermine my candidacy for the presidency.”

Biden has bet that voters are familiar with his long tenure in public life, which he hopes will make him more resilient to Trump’s attacks than earlier presidential targets.

“Please know that I’m not going anywhere,” he wrote, addressing Trump. “You won’t destroy me, and you won’t destroy my family. And come November 2020, I intend to beat you like a drum.”

Ben: At yesterday’s debate, Elizabeth Warren drew the kind of incoming fire from other candidates that mark her as the one to beat. Post-debate, rivals like Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden have kept up their attacks — the former said that Warren had been “more specific and forthcoming about the number of selfies she’s taken” than her Medicare for All plan; the latter accused her and Bernie Sanders of trying to “con the American people” into thinking a health-care overhaul would be easy. How risky is this kind of strategy for candidates who have previously chosen the high road?

Gabriel: Well they’re coming at it from different places, so their approaches have different risks. Buttigieg, for one, is trying to become the young Biden alternative, but he’s built up his image without going negative, and now he’s betting this is the way to be taken super-seriously — and, crucially, that voters are ready for these “let’s get serious”-style contrasts, and won’t rebel at the negativity. (See my story this morning on this very topic!) Biden is trying to maintain his position, and probably feels like he doesn’t have much of a choice but to draw these contrasts. Obviously neither Biden nor Buttigieg is missing the obvious fact that Sanders+Warren has more supporters, right now, than Buttigieg+Biden, which says something, but obviously not everything, about the shape of the electorate this cycle. But they’ve both picked their lane.

Ben: Warren clearly does not want to answer the question about whether her plan will raise taxes on the middle class. Some have criticized journalists for repeatedly bringing it up, arguing that their framing is misleading. But given her waffling, she seems destined to be hit with it again and again. Why do you think she doesn’t simply say, “Yes, taxes will go up, but the huge drop in health-care costs will make the tradeoff worth it,” the way Bernie Sanders does? What’s the political calculation there?

Gabriel: She’s already been asked it again and again … immediately after the debate last night! It’s probably the single question she’s been asked most over the last few weeks. But she’s clearly calculating that (a) she doesn’t want a clip out there, either in the primary or the general, of her talking about raising middle-class taxes, and (b) that she’s refused to answer this framing of the question for long enough that she’s not going to cave now and deal with all the coverage of that. But you can also see in her response how frustrated she is with the framing. She’s trying to make a specific point when she responds, not to dodge for dodging’s sake.

Ben: Do you get the sense that this is viewed as an actual potential problem, or more as something journalists are obsessed with?

Gabriel: Depends on who’s doing the viewing. There are definitely some candidates not named Elizabeth Warren who are worried about this — Buttigieg’s team, for example, loves pointing to a recent Des Moines Register poll suggesting Medicare for All is a general-election problem for Democrats. But Warren’s allies see this as little more than a gotcha that’s captivated journalists until they find their next thing.

Ben: As many have noted, Joe Biden sort of faded into the background for large stretches of the night, as candidates went after Warren instead. He also announced last night that he had only $9 million in cash on hand, significantly less than his top-tier rivals. There’s a definite narrative going on now that Biden’s long-awaited self-implosion is happening, and that he’s yesterday’s news. But he still polls very well nationally, and quite well in early states. Are we seeing more of the disconnect between what pundits expect to happen and what’s actually happening that we saw crop up earlier in this primary cycle, when his staying power came as a surprise to a lot of people?

Gabriel: I think this is a case where both can be true! He’s clearly no longer the strong front-runner, but you’d think by now that the pundit class would be a bit more careful about predicting doom for Biden. He’s shown in the last few hours alone that he’s going to turn up his contrasts a notch, clearly because he sees a problematic trend in his campaign. But he’s still polling first in many surveys and second in others. Hardly time for a massive panic, though the fundraising is a real problem.

One of the reasons Biden’s fundraising numbers are an issue, of course, is his reliance on big-dollar, in-person fundraisers rather than grassroots donations. He can’t go back to his donors and ask for more money like other candidates, because his relatively small number of donors have largely already given the legal maximum.

Ben: Amy Klobuchar had a pretty strong debate, but is right now not on track to qualify for the next one, in November, thanks to weak poll numbers. Do you think her performance could single-handedly put her on track to at least stay in the race longer?

Gabriel: I think there’s a reasonable case to be made that she did the most of any of the four onstage last night who still hadn’t qualified for November’s debate. She’s clearly made a similar calculation to Buttigieg (see above), and got a ton of speaking time out of it. Obviously, we’ll find out soon … and we’ll see how many polls there even are between now and the deadline!

Ben: Bernie Sanders did very well, especially coming off his heart attack. And he announced that AOC will be endorsing him, which is something of a coup, since some people expected her to pick Elizabeth Warren. Do you think either of these things will meaningfully boost his campaign?

Gabriel: He’s obviously at the center of attention again, and that’s been a major concern for him, so in that sense he’s already gotten a boost. We’ll see whether he’s able to stop his polling slide and start gaining new (or regaining old?) voters. But Sanders’s team was thrilled with how last night went, for good reason."

Fundraising numbers for the third quarter, which ended on September 30, won’t be reported by the Federal Election Commission until after the October 15 reporting deadline. So we’re learning about money hauls from the campaigns themselves, and it’s something of a chess match as to who announces what and when.

Clearly Bernie Sanders’s campaign was excited to announce his boffo $25.3 million quarter, whether or not it had any inkling that the candidate was about to be hospitalized. Pete Buttigieg too had to be pleased with his $19.1 million raised. Even though it fell short of the $24.9 million he brought in during the second quarter, it was still very good for a candidate who’s not in the top three in national and early-state polls. Andrew Yang should be proud of the $10 million he raised; he’s definitely outperforming expectations and the polls once again. Cory Booker professed to be happy with his $6 million-and-change totals, after he told supporters he might have to fold his tent if they didn’t cough up some more dough. And given her campaign’s recent struggles, Kamala Harris could express quiet satisfaction with raising $11.6 million, just short of her second-quarter contributions.

Another number dropped today, for the candidate perceived to have been the front-runner for most of the cycle, Joe Biden, and it’s not going to blow anyone’s socks off: He raised $15 million, or so he said at a fundraising event (his campaign may have been surprised he had said that and initially declined to comment before confirming the number as $15.2 million). That’s not quite like the $22 million he reported in the previous quarter, except for the fact that he again trailed Mayor Pete. Looking at it from another angle, Biden still did 50 percent better than Yang, but I’m guessing the leader of the Gang has a much slimmer payroll to meet.

Biden’s fundraising totals will fully be placed in perspective only when Elizabeth Warren, for whom nearly everything has been coming up roses, reports her third-quarter numbers. Her heavy-on-field-staff campaign has been fueled by the $10 million she was able to transfer from her Senate campaign account and then a solid $19.2 million second quarter. If she moves ahead of Biden in fundraising now, much as she has been moving ahead of, or at least toward him, in polls, it could be significant, particularly since she has been much choosier in how and from whom she raises money. (We’ll probably have to await the FEC reports to find out details like each campaign’s cash on hand, too.)

Biden’s clearly not going to have to tell his staff to work without pay anytime soon, but, as in many other respects, he’s a presidential candidate flying around without much of a net."

It is big, offering more choices than ever. It is experienced, with candidates from every level of government and beyond. It includes more women and minorities than ever at a time when their voices are redefining the party. It is generationally and geographically diverse.

Yet, to date, there’s been little that has given Democrats the confidence that their nomination process will produce a challenger strong enough, appealing enough and politically skilled enough to withstand what will be a brutal general election against a weakened and vulnerable president. Trump’s campaign is already running a general election loaded with cash and with months of time to try to shape voters’ perceptions of Democrats negatively before their nominee is even selected.

For Democrats, almost everything about the past week should be grounds for optimism about the shape of the political landscape. The litany of things that happened to or were done by the president in just a few days is beyond comprehension, starting with the case that Trump used the powers of his office to try to damage a political opponent that is at the heart of the House impeachment inquiry in the House.

That case against the president appeared to gain strength, with closed-door testimony on Capitol Hill, and it was helped when acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said there was a quid pro quo involving military aid. Mulvaney later retracted the statement, but the damage was done.

That came on the same day that it was announced that Trump had awarded next summer’s Group of Seven meeting to his Doral resort in Florida, boldly using the powers of his office to enhance his own business fortunes. After intense criticism from Republicans as well as Democrats, however, he tweeted Saturday that Trump National Doral Miami would no longer host the summit.

AD

AD

Then there is the mess made by the Trump’s hasty decision to withdraw U.S. forces in northern Syria, which allowed Turkey to begin an assault on Kurdish forces, once U.S. allies in the fight against the Islamic State.

In one attempt to undo the damage, Trump sent a letter to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatening to inflict harm to Turkey’s economy if Erdogan kept going. The language sounded as if it had been written by a make-believe tough guy rather than the president of the United States.

A fragile cease-fire agreement later brokered with Erdogan by Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo brought some respite in the fighting but also gave Turkey much of what it was seeking.

AD

“Like two kids in a lot, you have got to let them fight, and then you pull them apart,” Trump said at a Texas rally. Earlier he had dismissed the fighting as of no particular concern to the United States. Syria has “got a lot of sand,” he said. “So there’s a lot of sand they can play with.”

AD

Among those strengthened in the Middle East were the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. A meeting in the White House called with congressional leaders to discuss Syria turned into a showdown between an angry president and a resistant house speaker, Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif). He called her a “third-grade politician.” She bristled and wondered why, with Trump and his policies, “all roads lead to Putin.”

By week’s end, Trump’s Syria missteps had been denounced in a critical Washington Post op-ed written by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).

AD

So almost everything about the week was grounds for optimism for Democrats — except for one event, which was the fourth Democratic debate, held in Westerville, Ohio. That debate quickly faded from view, swept aside by the tidal forces of a president on the defensive. For some Democrats, the three-hour session simply added to questions about the party’s fitness to win a general election.

AD

Much of this is a result of the continued debate performances by former vice president Joe Biden. He has been effective at times. But the sum of Biden on the stage against his rivals has been underwhelming at best, disappointing to those who see him as the most capable of winning a general election.

His poll numbers are holding up, but he has failed to consolidate the advantages he brought into the race. He has been unable to quiet questions about his readiness as a candidate.

AD

Into this vacuum has stepped Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). That she was the target for much of Tuesday’s debate was all anyone needed to know about how her standing is perceived by her rivals. For others working to win the nomination, she is the person to stop but also someone they see as having vulnerabilities to exploit.

AD

Warren is a skilled and disciplined candidate, which is why she has risen while Biden has been static at best. She knows what she thinks and has a theory of how to get to the White House. Her agenda — which includes big, structural change — the cost and complexity of her proposed policies, and her unwillingness to say how it all adds up give many Democrats pause about her ability to win in November 2020.

There are other choices, obviously. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), unabashed in his democratic socialist agenda, has the support of Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), three of the most liberal new members of Congress. Some polls show him beating Trump in key states, though many Democrats are skeptical.

AD

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg is young and heartland-based, a candidate who speaks eloquently in debates, interviews and in question periods with voters. He enjoys support from those in the party who are white and well-educated, but not yet with other voters that past nominees have needed to win the nomination, particularly African Americans.

AD

Biden, Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg are four of the 18 candidates still in the race. Could someone farther down in the pack, someone who isn’t even qualifying for the debates, capture the nomination? It’s not out of the question and surprises are always a part of the pre-Iowa, pre-New Hampshire campaign season. The hope for all those who are being ignored is to build quietly in Iowa and New Hampshire and get hot when the weather is at its coldest.

One small measure of the restlessness among at least some Democrats was a Sept. 28 tweet by Oprah Winfrey, which includes a short video clip of her talking with Bob Iger, chief executive of Walt Disney Co.

AD

“This is the man I wish was running for President of the USA,” she tweeted. In the video, she tells Iger that, if he were running, “I would be canvassing in Iowa right now. I would be going door-to-door … I wish … more than ever, every day, that you had done it.”

AD

Put aside the question of whether Iger could win a Democratic nomination, let alone the presidency, or Winfrey’s skills as a political handicapper. Her enthusiasm for someone not even in the biggest field of candidates ever assembled speaks to the degree to which the declared candidates have yet to capture imaginations, despite high levels of intensity among voters.

Because these kinds of concerns have happened before, and with some regularity, there is no reason to overstate the problem. Once voters check in and contests are held and someone begins to win primaries and caucuses decisively or consistently, perceptions of their strengths will change.

AD

But the campaign to date has produced questions that will demand answers. Can Biden step up and show something more than he has? Can Warren demonstrate that her proposals and campaign machine are enough to overcome reservations about her general election viability? Can a slipping Sanders rebound? Can Buttigieg or someone else who is less liberal than Warren or Sanders displace Biden?

Trump might look like a weakened candidate, but he will be a tenacious campaigner, willing to do anything he can to demonize and defeat his challenger. Democrats have many choices but are anxiously wondering which one of them will get the party to the White House in 2021."

But the new reporting gets closer to confirming it.

AD

The key revelation is that Mulvaney was the official who carried out Trump’s directive to freeze the funds. This came a week before Trump’s July 25 call, in which he pressured Zelensky to carry out “investigations” designed to undercut the fact of Russian sabotage of the 2016 election, and to manufacture smears of potential 2020 opponent Joe Biden.

AD

As the Times puts it, Trump “directed” Mulvaney “days ahead of the call to place a hold on the aid.”

But did Mulvaney know why Trump had done this? The Times answers that question as follows:

Mr. Mulvaney has told associates that the administration paused the aid to try to push Ukraine to more robustly fight corruption, not in connection with pressuring Ukraine to uncover dirt on of Mr. Trump’s political rivals.

This is supposed to be exonerating, but it’s an important concession. If true, Mulvaney has privately acknowledged a direct link between the freeze of the military aid and Trump’s pressure on Ukraine to fight “corruption.”

AD

Mulvaney is still maintaining that he didn’t understand Trump’s demand to investigate “corruption” as a demand to carry out the political scheme Trump had hatched.

But there is already extensive evidence out there on the public record that renders this highly implausible.

The public statements

First, there are the multiple public statements from Trump lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani — and Trump himself.

AD

In early May, Giuliani laid out the whole plot in an interview with the Times. Giuliani confirmed he planned to urge Zelensky to pursue investigations designed to fortify a conspiracy theory undercutting the fact of Russian interference, and to push a false narrative involving the role of Biden’s son on the board of Ukrainian company Burisma.

AD

Giuliani claimed these things would be “very helpful to my client,” i.e., Trump. And at the time, Giuliani repeatedly tweeted demands that Ukraine investigate Biden. Trump himself railed on Fox in May about the invented narrative of Biden corruption in Ukraine.

All that occurred before Mulvaney carried out Trump’s directive to freeze the aid. It deeply strains credulity that Mulvaney would not have known about these things, or would not have understood their relevance to Trump’s subsequent demands for an investigation of Ukraine “corruption.”

AD

The texts

Second, there are the texts released by Democrats. They show that just before the July 25 call, Ambassador Kurt Volker told an aide to Zelensky that the White House had indicated Zelensky could get a White House meeting — if he did an investigation that would uncover the supposed truth about 2016.

AD

That confirms that just after the military aid was frozen, the White House and Volker were communicating that Trump’s demand for investigations of “corruption” was actually a demand to fortify Trumpworld’s favorite conspiracy theory about 2016 — a key Trump political demand.

And in multiple subsequent texts, Volker and Ambassador Gordon Sondland, who was operating at Trump’s direction, worked to get what Sondland called the “deliverable,” a statement from Ukraine pledging to investigate Burisma, the fabricated tale about Biden. Sondland is expected to testify Thursday that for months before the call, he was working to secure that commitment from Ukraine — to investigate Biden.

AD

In these particular cases, the quid pro quo discussed was for the meeting. But what all this also confirms is that, by “investigate corruption,” Trump really meant, “investigate Biden.” Indeed, Ambassador William Taylor twice objected to what was happening on precisely those grounds.

AD

Mulvaney almost certainly knew of all of this.

Mulvaney’s role in meetings

Underscoring that further, The Post reports that Mulvaney was directly involved in numerous discussions with Sondland about the evolving plot, and sat in on meetings between Trump and Giuliani at precisely the time Giuliani was explicitly pushing for the Ukrainian investigation of Biden.

In this larger context, Mulvaney’s private admission that the freeze in military aid was tied directly to Trump’s demand for an investigation of “corruption” becomes a lot more important. Because Mulvaney surely knew what “investigate corruption” really meant, it strongly suggests Mulvaney knew that for Trump, the military aid — which Mulvaney himself froze — also turned on whether Zelensky carried out the politically-motivated investigations Trump wanted.

AD

AD

For this not to be true, Mulvaney would have had to be unaware of numerous public statements from Giuliani and Trump. He would have had to be clueless about what Sondland, Volker, Giuliani — and, of course, Trump — really wanted after being involved in multiple discussions with them that directly concerned how to make Trump happy with what Ukraine was doing for him.

That seems unlikely at best. And it suggests we’ll be learning more soon enough — perhaps confirming that Sanders got the bigger story exactly right.

Now that Tulsi Gabbard has ended her boycott threat, we know that there will be 12 Democratic presidential candidates on the debate stage in Westerville, Ohio, tonight, a record crowd (yes, there were 20 debate qualifiers in June and July, but they were deployed over two nights). But it’s probably more surprising that there are seven other active candidates legitimate enough to make major media lists who will not be on the stage — and are very unlikely to meet the tougher criteria for the November and subsequent debates — who are nonetheless still in the field.

Now the term “active” is questionable for some of these birds:

Wayne Messam is reporting he raised $5 in Q3 and spent $0. Has $31k on hand https://t.co/RgeCQXFhLm — Tarini Parti (@tparti) October 15, 2019

Messam hasn’t even made some lists and has been on others because, well, he’s an elected official, not some random schmo claiming to run for president to advertise his dry-cleaning business or whatever. The city of which he is mayor, Miramar, Florida, is actually larger that Pete Buttigieg’s South Bend. But he hasn’t come within a mile of a debate stage. Nor has former congressman and retired admiral Joe Sestak, who has been in the race since June but hasn’t made much of an impression.

There are five others, though, who did make the June and July debates, but none since then, and haven’t dropped out. Of these, author and self-help guru Marianne Williamson has shown some grassroots fundraising chops (she met the donor threshold for tonight’s debate, but only had one qualifying poll); she raised a non-negligible $3.1 million in the third quarter, double her second-quarter haul. There are two barely surviving candidates with fine résumés and theoretical paths to the nomination if Joe Biden ever crashed and burned: the self-styled moderates Colorado senator Michael Bennet and Montana governor Steve Bullock. Congressman John Delaney is kind of sui generis: His personal wealth makes fundraising for anything other than debate qualification largely unnecessary, but he’s been in the race longer than anyone and had one debate (in July) in which he got lots of exposure — yet still is in nowheresville in terms of measurable support. He’s said he’ll stay in until Iowa no matter what.

When Ohio congressman Tim Ryan suspended his campaign in the wake of the Dayton shootings in August, a lot of people figured he’d be formally out of the race before long. But he hasn’t dropped out, technically, though he’s simultaneously running a House reelection campaign.

Ryan’s willingness to do that separates him from four of the six candidates (I won’t even count insta-in, insta-out Richard Ojeda) who have indeed already dropped out: Eric Swalwell and Seth Moulton quit the presidential trail to head off challenges to their House seats; Jay Inslee decided to run for reelection as governor of Washington; and John Hickenlooper finally got talked into running for the Senate. Kirsten Gillibrand basically ran out of money, and it’s probably fair to say that her fellow New Yorker Bill de Blasio was laughed out of the race.

So looking at the slow-bleeding survivors, it seems none of them (other than the aforementioned Ryan) face any choices of other things to run for in 2020 (Bullock, like Beto O’Rourke, has made it abundantly clear he’s not going to go Hickenlooper’s path of down-shifting to a Senate race). Bennet, Williamson, and Delaney have enough money to keep puttering along. And Messam and Sestak don’t really have campaigns visible enough to shut down, so why bother?

This is pure speculation, but you also have to figure the recent instability of the political climate could be a factor in keeping marginal candidacies alive. Bernie Sanders’s heart attack and the sudden focus of an impeachment inquiry on Trumpian misconduct related to claims of Biden corruption may have some campaigns pausing on the threshold of the exit door, waiting to see if the field gets turned upside down. And in the end, there’s no accounting for what happens to people when they keep seeing the next president of the United States in the mirror. Surely others will see it eventually, won’t they? — so reason those who refuse to be winnowed."

Ben: Who do you think had a really good night tonight?

Sarah: Bernie. Warren, too. But Bernie was really impressive tonight. Sharp, clear, consistent.

Zak: Agreed. And not long after a heart attack, too. You’d have trouble getting me out of bed, let alone subject myself to this.

Ben: As others have pointed out, he was slightly toned down — which made him seem more effective.

Zak: I was never that put off by his ranting-granddad vibe, but it’s true that toning things down made his arguments seem less like insistent diatribes and more like reasonable presentations of commonsense ideas, at least superficially.

Sarah: Bernie’s tone never bothered me, to be honest. I never found him to be particularly shouty, and in any case, his unvarnished affect seems to be part of his appeal. So my takeaway isn’t really that Bernie succeeded because he toned it down. His answers were tight, his comments were critical when they needed to be, and he ably defended his policies from attack.

Zak: And I’ll echo Sarah on Warren’s good night. She weathered the attention that comes with being the front-runner way more smoothly and graciously than Biden. Less rattled, better able to lucidly stay on message, and never seemed to take anything personally.

Ben: Unlike in some past debates, the central target of the also-rans wasn’t Joe Biden, but the newly appointed front-runner, Warren. In an early exchange, she once again did not say whether she would raise taxes to fund Medicare for All, earning some criticism from Pete Buttigieg and others. Did this, or any of the other attacks against her, draw any blood?

Zak: I think her refusal to answer that question on those particular terms is a reasonable gamble. It risks her coming off as evasive, but I think pushing people to think more about overall costs versus just taxes is a net positive and has the potential to shift the terms of the discussion in a way that helps her cause. Plus the accusation themselves just aren’t that meaty. We know what her answer is going to be, and at a certain point it starts feeling like the people to whom it’s most scandalous are the reporters who insist on asking it knowing what the answer will be.

Sarah: I’d like for her to develop a more detailed answer on Medicare for All but overall I think she handled herself well. She’s made her wealth tax such a centerpiece of her campaign that the typical “but how will you pay for it” line that always gets lobbed at left-wing candidates falls a little flat. One other thing I appreciate about Warren (and Sanders, for that matter) is that she has little patience for gotcha questions, and I think that trait’s been useful to her in the debates.

Ben: Pete Buttigieg was considerably more combative in this debate than in previous affairs. He challenged Elizabeth Warren directly on her refusal to say she’d raise taxes with her health-care plan. He told Beto O’Rourke that “I don’t need lessons from you on courage” during an exchange on gun laws. In an effort to break into the top tier, he’s positioning himself as a moderate who will not hesitate to criticize those to his left. Is this working for him or coming off as arrogant? Or something in between?

Zak: There’s always something so incongruous to me about being extremely combative in defense of moderation. It’s especially off-brand for Buttigieg because we’ve come to expect this pragmatic levelheadedness and desire to stay above the fray and discourage in-fighting and all of a sudden he’s scolding everybody.

Sarah: It didn’t work for him. Look, Sanders and Warren have a clear message. Everyone knows who they are and what they represent. It’s difficult to say the same of Buttigieg. His alternative to Medicare for All sounds like a joke people would make on Twitter, and the “I’m just a sensible man from the heartland” routine is a bit rich coming from a Harvard-educated Rhodes scholar whose father was a Marxist professor at the University of Notre Dame. When Buttigieg speaks, I don’t hear anything that resembles the concerns of actual voters; I hear a wonk. And while that’s partly because I’m a socialist and have different politics, I don’t think Buttigieg’s smarm is entirely a figment of my imagination.

And I agree with Zak. I think the notion of a pugnacious moderate is a bit of contradiction in terms.

Ben: Why didn’t anyone (or almost anyone) attack Joe Biden? It seems that people have crowned Warren as the obvious front-runner — but he’s still doing very well in national polls and many state polls, too.

Zak: Probably reserved about the broader implications of fueling Trump’s attacks. There seems to be a tacit agreement among Democrats not to admit openly that the Hunter business is shady, paired with a willingness to take a “wait and see” approach to how it affects Biden’s campaign moving forward.

Sarah: Trump’s complicated that a bit by going after Hunter. I actually think there’s plenty to criticize about Hunter’s business dealings, and would’ve liked to see someone press Biden on the cronyism, but nobody wants to look as if they’re aligned with Trump. I think, too, that candidates do recognize that Biden has a healthy base of support, and they’re wary of alienating those voters. Perhaps they think that Biden will self-immolate, given enough time.

Ben: That has been the conventional wisdom with him for a while and it keeps not happening — though he has faded a bit in recent weeks.

Sarah: Yes, and I think that’s due partly to his performance in the debates. He’s incoherent much of the time.

Ben: What’s up with Kamala Harris? She went from dominating the first debate to having an extended exchange where she tried to “gotcha” Elizabeth Warren by accusing her of not being onboard with banning President Trump from Twitter. That was weird.

Zak: I think she isn’t sure what she stands for and is throwing a lot of different things at the wall to see what sticks.

Sarah: I don’t think she really knows why she’s running for president?

Ben: We’ve all been there.

Sarah: Haha.

Ben: Any other candidates you thought shone or did the opposite of that?

Sarah: Why was Tom Steyer onstage? I mean, I know why, but he has no business being there.

Ben: He did not talk much.

Sarah: Right, and when he did talk, he did not do himself any favors.

Zak: Tom Steyer was like the amalgamation of every white man who’s dropped out so far. Plus Howard Schultz. I like to think they all just jumped into the same body and put it on a plane to Ohio.

Sarah: This is a terrible Transformers movie.

Zak: I was gonna say I pitched this as a Being John Malkovich sequel. No takers so far, but I’m shopping it.

Ben: Haha.

What was the most glaring absence in terms of topics? Gotta be climate, right?

﻿Zak: I think so, especially in the wake of the strikes and U.N. testimonies.

﻿Sarah: Climate, yes. But housing, too. Kind of shocking that we’ve yet to get a single question about the housing crisis.

Ben: Lastly, we’ve all noticed that the debates don’t tend to change the underlying dynamics or numbers of the race all that much. Is there anything about this one that people will remember and that will really make an impression?

Sarah: No.

Zak: Nope.

Ben: So that’s a yes?

Zak: That’s a no, Ben."

With a fourth Democratic candidates’ debate in the books, and many observers becoming impatient about some of the remaining 19 White House aspirants dropping out, guessing games will ensue about who will drop out next. At least one candidate, Julián Castro, has invited that sort of scrutiny with a fundraising appeal linked to a threat to quit:

News: Julián Castro's campaign says he will drop out if he doesn't make November debate. Campaign sets goal at $800,000 needed by Oct. 31



(Castro has secured needed 165,000 grassroots contributions, campaign needs to meet polling threshold and says $$$ needed to get there) — Steadman™ (@AsteadWesley) October 21, 2019

This sort of gambit worked for Cory Booker in September, so maybe Castro can get his loyalists to cough up some more dough in time to make the next stage. But soon some candidates who haven’t been doing well may calculate that they might as well stick around until voters start voting, at which point denying the obvious will become vastly more difficult. Later this week we’ll hit the 100-day milepost before the February 3 Iowa caucuses. So instead of trying to figure out who ought to quit earlier than that — today, or maybe even yesterday — a more useful exercise is to project which candidates cannot credibly survive a bad showing in the very first contest. It’s a variation on the old “how many tickets are there out of Iowa?” puzzle that the chattering classes have played for decades.

The “Big Three” Should Be All Right Unless They Totally Fall Apart

The candidates who have dominated the early going in Iowa and elsewhere, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders, all have strong national followings, distinct identities, and good fundraising operations. Short of some horrid mistake that produces a free fall in support in Iowa and elsewhere, they all have enough of a national base and a plausible path to the nomination that a post-Iowa comeback is possible even if they underwhelm a bit in the caucuses. It’s also possible, of course, that one of the Big Three will decide winning Iowa is the ball game and will empty the bank account trying to do so. That’s what Hillary Clinton did in 2008. And her third-place showing in Iowa might have finished her had she not pulled a shocking upset win in New Hampshire just five days later.

Mayor Pete Really Needs Some Iowa Magic

Recent polling in Iowa has shown Pete Buttigieg doing quite well, consistently running third or fourth. But given the nature of his base of support, he absolutely needs to do quite well in both Iowa and New Hampshire; later on, his struggle to win over minority voters could become fatal to his candidacy if he hasn’t already established himself as viable. Since his current strategy appears to be to position himself as the “moderate alternative” to Joe Biden, Mayor Pete’s best path to the nomination is to beat Biden in Iowa and then begin to make himself the strongest moderate in the race, particularly if Warren and Sanders continue to fight it out for supremacy among progressive voters.

Bennet, Beto, Booker, Bullock, Klobuchar, and Probably Harris Are Iowa-or-Bust Candidates

There are quite a few White House aspirants who will likely have to (or need to) drop out if they don’t finish really well in Iowa. The most obvious is Amy Klobuchar, whose proximity to the First-in-the-Nation Caucus State has been central to her candidacy all along. Like fellow Minnesotans Tim Pawlenty and Michele Bachmann (briefly viable in 2012 on the Republican side) and Wisconsin governor Scott Walker (who dropped out in 2016 after polling poorly in Iowa), Klobuchar isn’t going to convince voters anywhere else she’s worth considering if she can’t win over her neighbors.

Colorado senator Michael Bennet and Montana governor Steve Bullock are also from relatively near Iowa and have spent significant time there. They also have in common that they are part of the crowd of candidates (along with Buttigieg, Klobuchar, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris) who have been auditioning to become moderate alternatives to Joe Biden. Since neither has been on a debate stage since July, it’s hard to imagine their highly theoretical rationales for candidacy surviving a poor or even meh showing in Iowa.

The same is likely true of Beto O’Rourke, whose early fundraising and high name ID, and then a modest revival after the gun massacre in his hometown, have given him more staying power. But once voters vote, his long-standing “potential” may be used up.

Booker built one of the strongest early organizations in Iowa, and given the fact that he has no other states to fall back on if he falters there, he, too, should be good or gone after February 3. And you can make a strong case that Harris, briefly a world-beater after a strong first-debate performance, has to finish in the money in Iowa as well, after she decided to focus her entire candidacy on an Obama-style breakthrough there. Conversely, Biden can clear out a lot of potential moderate-lane and African-American competition if he badly beats all these rivals in Iowa, which is a good reason for him to keep spending time there despite having stronger support elsewhere.

Steyer and Yang May Be Impervious to a Bad Showing

Tom Steyer, I am sure, wants to do well in Iowa as much as anyone else. But he has the resources to survive a poor finish there, and in quite a few other states as well, so long as he doesn’t become too discouraged to go on. Andrew Yang is a niche candidate who has already exceeded every reasonable expectation, without raising those expectations above what he can accomplish. He’s raising money pretty well, too, and has no particular geographical base, so why should he drop out after Iowa?

Perhaps Tulsi Gabbard is a niche candidate, too: sort of the Dennis Kucinich of the 2020 cycle, with an ideological positioning that probably secures a hard kernel of support. But it’s unclear whether she has the appetite for that kind of quixotic run. As for Castro, his path to the nomination depends on making it to Nevada, where he could in theory draw on support from fellow Latinos, but it’s doubtful he can survive until then.

Candidates Who Are Going Nowhere Anyway Can Meander On After Iowa

Some of the above candidates, of course, and several others who have made less of a mark on the contest, can keep going on a sort of energy-saver mode after doing poorly in Iowa because they don’t need a lot of money or support to hang around and/or don’t have time-consuming day jobs. The model for this kind of sort-of candidacy is provided by Miramar, Florida, mayor Wayne Messam, who is not raising or spending much of anything. A livelier version of the eternal candidate may be Marianne Williamson, who has pretty good name ID and some fundraising ability, along with no discernible path to the nomination that she can screw up with a poor performance in Iowa or anywhere else. If she wants to stick around, she can. The very wealthy John Delaney is a sort of Tom Steyer with less money and a lot less support. And who knows why Tim Ryan is still in the race (though focusing most of his attention on his real campaign, the one for reelection to the House) — or Joe Sestak?

So to get back to the perennial question, how many tickets out of Iowa are there likely to be, counting only candidates who are truly viable? The traditional answer has always been three. For the reasons cited earlier, there will probably be four tickets out of Iowa this time around: the Big Three plus some lucky dark horse aiming for Biden’s vote, minority voters, or some sweet spot in the center of the party."

For Democrats bolstered by a sturdy primary field, consistently strong disapproval ratings of the president, and the early momentum of an impeachment inquiry, Republican fundraising totals for the third quarter are a reminder that a long and dogged fight awaits the candidate who survives for the general. From July 1 to September 30, the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee raised $125 million; this year alone, they’ve pulled in over $300 million.

To put that into perspective, Trump’s 2016 campaign committee and associated PACs raised a little less than $450 million for the 2016 race. Trump’s totals after the third quarter are more than double what President Obama and the Democratic Party had this time in 2011, and the Democrat with the largest announced Q3 numbers is Bernie Sanders, with $25.3 million.

Not all of that cash will be sent Trump’s way: An RNC official speaking with NPR said that the committee has staff on the ground in 19 states prepared to defend the White House and attack House Democrats in swing districts they consider vulnerable due to impeachment. Last week, the RNC also announced a $2 million TV ad buy condemning the impeachment inquiry, and another $8 million to go after Joe Biden. The RNC is also out-raising the Democratic National Committee: According to the most recent disclosure forms from the end of August, the RNC had $53.8 million in cash on hand, compared to the DNC’s $8.2 million.

The Trump campaign has three fundraising factors going for them — the first being that they’re, more or less, the only game in town. (For the second quarter, the top five Democrats raised almost $96 million, compared to the Trump campaign’s $54 million.) Another component is the campaign’s willingness to accept corporate donors aligned with the president’s aggressive deregulation. As part of the Democratic Party’s shift leftward, Democrats have largely abstained from this cash — though the crowded field is proving that true abstinence is tough. And don’t forget the MAGA merch, which is big business for the president: One consultant estimates that 30 percent of campaign contributions in the midterm cycle came from supporters buying stuff like red hats and political novelty items."

Even as contestants prepare for next week’s 12-candidate Democratic debate at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, the November event is beginning to come together as well, NBC News reports:

MSNBC and The Washington Post will co-host the fifth Democratic presidential primary debate in Georgia next month, MSNBC announced Tuesday.

The debate will take place in prime time on Nov. 20, and will air live on MSNBC and Radio One. It will also stream on MSNBC.com and the Post’s website, as well as across mobile devices via NBC News and the Post’s mobile apps and Urban One’s digital platforms.

The specific location, venue, format and moderators will be announced at a later date.

The Democratic National Committee toughened the polling and fundraising thresholds for this fifth debate, as I noted last month:

The thresholds for “grassroots fundraising” didn’t change that much: Candidates must now show they have at some point in the cycle raised money from 160,000 donors (as opposed to 130,000, previously) with at least 600 (previously 400) in 20 states …

Nor will the new polling requirements (3 percent in four specified national or early state polls, or 5 percent in two early state polls, beginning with polls taken last week and running until seven days before the November debate) represent a problem for the stronger candidates, who almost always poll above three percent (a group that currently includes Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, and Kamala Harris. But some next-tier hopefuls could experience some problems.

At this point, eight candidates have qualified for the November stage: the aforementioned five polling champs, plus Cory Booker, Tom Steyer, and Andrew Yang (who got his fourth qualifying poll just today). Others have until November 13 to make the cut. As Politico reports, it’s looking a bit dicey for some, including four who will be on the stage in Ohio next week:

Currently, more than a dozen candidates are still short of the qualification thresholds, including four who will be on stage next week in Ohio: Julián Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O’Rourke. Those four have all said they’ve cleared the 165,000 donor threshold required for the debate, but each needs at least three more 3-percent polls to qualify.

It would be a good time for the October debaters who are November non-qualifiers to make a splash."

Tuesday, October 15, marked the deadline for presidential candidates to submit third-quarter fundraising reports to the Federal Election Commission. Some got out ahead of the deadline by releasing their fundraising hauls early. Others, such as Wayne Messam, the little-known Democratic mayor of Miramar, Florida, and for some reason also a presidential candidate, did not.

But with the deadline comes full reports from all of the candidates and a clearer picture of where they stand, money-wise, 110 days before the Iowa caucuses. The top-line figure is total money raised and Bernie Sanders led in the third quarter by bringing in $25.2 million. His Senate colleague, Elizabeth Warren, was not far behind with $24.6 million. Pete Buttigieg surprised with $19.1 million, Joe Biden disappointed with $15.7 million, and Kamala Harris rounded out the top five with $11.7 million.

There are some other noteworthy nuggets buried in these reports, including:

Wayne Messam raised just $5.

You could have watched every minute of every presidential debate so far and never known that Messam is running for president. But he is. The mayor of Miramar, which is bigger than South Bend, reported raising just $5 in the third quarter. On the plus side, that’s five more dollars than he spent.

Joe Biden’s bank account is dwindling.

The former vice-president doesn’t just trail Senators Sanders and Warren in fundraising, he trails them in amount of money on hand. With $8.98 million in his bank account, Biden is also lagging behind Buttigieg and Harris.

Politico explains that the problem is tied to Biden’s reliance on big-money donors:

As Biden’s campaign spending picked up over the summer, his reliance on maximum donors — who can give only once and are not a renewable campaign resource — meant that his fundraising could not keep pace. More than one-third of Biden’s contributions came from maximum donors in the second quarter, and max-out donors composed a similar portion of a smaller pie for Biden this quarter.

That could also explain why Biden was underwater in the third quarter, spending nearly $2 million more than he brought in.

Ten candidates spent more than they brought in.

It’s never good when you spend more money than you make, and that’s what ten candidates did last quarter. But the candidate whose numbers were the most mismatched is Amy Klobuchar. The Minnesota senator spent $7.8 million and brought in $4.8 million. That’s good for a 162 percent burn rate.

Tom Steyer is his own biggest fan.

The California billionaire spent big in the third quarter after getting into the race in early July, dropping a staggering $47 million, a sum that the L.A. Times says “places him on track to join the biggest self-funding political candidates in American history.” The $47 million is nearly all of the $49.6 million that Steyer brought in during the third quarter. Who did the money come from? Nearly $1.5 million from small donors, a half million from large donors, and $47.6 million from Steyer himself."

Most weeks, New York Magazine writer-at-large Frank Rich speaks with contributor Alex Carp about the biggest stories in politics and culture. Today, Donald Trump’s frantic attempts at an impeachment defense, efforts by Bill Barr and Mike Pompeo to protect themselves from Ukraine fallout, and Bernie Sanders’s health issues.

A week in, Trump’s defense to the growing impeachment proceedings seems to be tantrums and denial. Is there a cost to failing to develop a more focused plan, or will this strategy help him slip out of trouble, as it has in the past?

We can safely assume that even Trump’s most ardent fans would not put him and “focused plan” or “strategy” in the same sentence. His brand is chaos, and his default position is human (or more often inhuman) wrecking ball. That will never change, nor does he want it to change. The question is less whether Trump’s malevolence will allow him to escape impeachment than whether American governance, already on the ropes, will tumble into a coma before he leaves office and allow opportunistic American enemies like Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un to pounce. An ancillary question is whether Trump will in fact leave the Oval Office voluntarily if he is convicted in an impeachment trial or defeated in the election that’s now 13 months away. A president who finds new constitutional norms to violate daily can hardly be counted upon to respect the verdicts of either Congress or the voters.

A third question is his sanity. Even by his standards, yesterday’s #TrumpMeltdown was wild. The nation saw him tossing around a jockstrap insult (aimed at Adam Schiff) in an ornate White House setting as the Finnish president trapped beside him tried, with mixed results, to maintain a poker-faced dignity. We watched Trump in desperation cite abject GOP lapdogs like Lindsey Graham, Rick Scott, and Rob Portman as character witnesses. We watched him lie with his usual heedlessness and velocity, but as often as not his fictions undermined his own craven self-interest: By referring to the White House’s readout of his fateful July 25 call with the Ukrainian president as a “word-for-word, comma-for-comma” transcript, he was attempting to further the cover-up in plain sight. All you need is eyes to see that this document is not labeled a “transcript” and is too brief to be the entirety of what was officially listed as a 30-minute presidential conversation. (Interns in the office of one senator, Angus King of Maine, read the released version aloud and clocked it at roughly ten minutes.) Not to mention that the “comma-for-comma” White House readout contains ellipses — which may yet prove to be tantamount to the notorious 18-and-a-half-minute gap on an incriminating Nixon White House tape.

Trump retains enough animal cunning to know he’s in jeopardy. New Deep Throats are surfacing in the press (especially at the Washington Post) daily. The polls are starting to shift. Members of Congress are home talking to their constituents over recess. Even Mitch McConnell budged a tiny bit, letting the release of the whistle-blower complaint proceed without senatorial interference and going on record that he cannot prevent impeachment from being taken up by his chamber. At the height of yesterday’s #TrumpMeltdown, the Dow was plummeting 500 points on trade-war fears. And Trump is running low on rhetorical ammunition to fight back. His repeated characterization of the July 25 phone conversation as “perfect” and “beautiful” is not just false but adjectivally weird. Writing “BULLSHIT” in a tweet attacking his opponents is an indicator of desperation as well as his usual vulgarity. Running out of words, he is more dependent than ever on the feedback loop of Fox News for fresh gambits: His new claim to be the victim of a “coup” originated there, as did his threat that his impeachment would lead to “civil war.”

Could he and his country sink even lower while impeachment is adjudicated? Quite possibly; there seems to be no bottom. If this historical moment echoes Watergate in some regards, it also echoes the rise of toxic anti-government rhetoric and right-wing American terrorist militias and cults in the period leading up to the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995. Back then it was the likes of NRA chief Wayne LaPierre who were railing against “jack-booted government thugs.” Now it’s the president of the United States who is doing so, relentlessly suggesting that Schiff, the whistle-blower, and members of the press (among others) be punished for committing treason. And he is doing so in a society that is, if anything, even more gun-crazy and gun-saturated now than it was in the 1990s.

Let’s be clear here: As he retreats more and more into his bunker, Trump is not being careful about what he wishes for, and what he is wishing for is violence. Yet the Vichy Republicans — even those senators up for reelection like Susan Collins and Cory Gardner — remain silent. Be assured that they’ll be among the first to offer their thoughts and prayers on camera if this dam breaks.

Ukraine-related questions have continued to grow around Attorney General Bill Barr and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, both of whom seem to be doing everything they can to sidestep direct questioning. Will their stonewalling protect them?

No. Nor will stonewalling protect the increasingly implicated Mike Pence. Pompeo, the cagiest of the three, has started to figure this out — probably because he realized he would fail in his attempt to stop former State Department officials like the special Ukraine envoy Karl Volker and the summarily fired U.S. ambassador to the Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, from talking to investigators. That’s why it took only days for Pompeo to go from lying and dissembling about what he knew about the Ukraine call and when he knew it to conceding he was present. This is surely a smarter legal strategy than Pence’s; as Jonathan Chait has pointed out, the vice-president is claiming essentially that he was too stupid to understand what was going on all around him, even when he was participating in the White House’s Ukrainian plot. As for Barr, he continues hobnobbing all over the world to do both Trump and Putin’s bidding in pursuing a crackpot conspiracy theory that would clear Russia of 2016 election interference and implicate Ukraine instead. One could argue that even Rudy Giuliani has more sense than Barr does: This week he recruited a former Watergate prosecutor to represent him in impeachment proceedings.

Bernie Sanders announced that he has been hospitalized with a heart issue, and had two stents inserted. Do health concerns change his standing in the Democratic primary?

Assuming that the public diagnoses by cardiologists hold up, the answer is no. Sanders will return to the stump after a fairly brief break, and only if he stops shouting upon return should he or his supporters start to worry.

What’s more interesting is that there are few signs that Trump’s anti-Biden jihad is shaking up the Democratic primary either, despite the president referring to him and his son as “stone-cold crooked” and such antics as today’s, in which he publicly urged China to investigate them. Both Sanders and Biden have been slipping in polls while Elizabeth Warren is gaining, but neither is tanking, and both are very much in what’s still a fluid race. Biden’s decision to employ some rare reticence in handling Trump’s baseless charges against his son may be his shrewdest move so far in the campaign."

A specter is haunting “pro-business Democrats” — the specter of change they can’t believe in.

With just over three months until Iowa gets caucusing, Elizabeth Warren is their party’s front-runner. She’s running neck and neck with Joe Biden in the polls — and Biden’s campaign is living hand-to-mouth. The former “senator from MBNA” is losing to a democratic socialist at the fundraising game. And time seems to be depleting Biden’s (always limited) verbal skills even faster than it’s draining his campaign coffers. Meanwhile, the most viable alternative for “Leave Billionaires Alone” Democrats seems to be a college-town mayor with fewer black supporters than Donald Trump. As of this writing, betting markets now put the odds of blue America nominating either Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders in 2020 at over 50 percent.

Davos Democrats are nonplussed. Each night, consultants of a certain age toss and turn through dreams of George McGovern. Now, many are succumbing to magical thinking. As the New York Times reports:

When a half-dozen Democratic donors gathered at the Whitby Hotel in Manhattan last week, the dinner began with a discussion of which presidential candidates the contributors liked. But as conversations among influential Democrats often go these days, the meeting quickly evolved into a discussion of who was not in the race — but could be lured in.

Would Hillary Clinton get in, the contributors wondered, and how about Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor? One person even mused whether Michelle Obama would consider a late entry, according to two people who attended the event, which was hosted by the progressive group American Bridge.

Bloomberg is reportedly mulling a run, but could never win. Michelle Obama could win, but would never run. Hillary Clinton is almost certainly not delusional enough to throw her hat in the ring. And none of the other names floated by the Whitby diners — Deval Patrick, Eric Holder, John Kerry, and Sherrod Brown — have any obvious advantage over the standard-issue Dems already in the race. If Kamala Harris and Cory Booker aren’t connecting, why would a slapdash Patrick or Holder campaign hit the mark? And what does Brown offer that Klobuchar doesn’t (beyond the opportunity to squander a precious Senate vote)?

The idea that the primary electorate would eagerly support a garden-variety moderate Democrat (who boasts no special connection to Barack Obama) if only they had more than a dozen such candidates to choose from, is manifestly absurd. But the Whitby crowd’s longing for some kind of 2020 “do over” is entirely understandable.

Centrist Democrats entered this cycle with a fairly strong hand. Polls consistently found a majority of Democratic voters saying they preferred a maximally electable nominee over an ideologically ideal one. What’s more, in some surveys, a plurality of the primary electorate evinced a preference for a return to Obamaism over big structural change. To be sure, if progressives consolidated their votes behind a single standard-bearer — one with at least a modicum of appeal to African-Americans in the South — they could still pose a real threat. But the looming left-on-left battle between two light-skinned New Englanders seemed to nullify that risk. Everything was coming up incrementalism.

So, how did center-left Democrats end up in a position so desperate, the concept of “John Kerry 2020” strikes them as cause for consideration instead of laughter?

There are probably an infinite number of (partially) correct answers to that question. But if I had to limit myself to three:

1. Kamala Harris doesn’t have “it.” The California senator may be too liberal for some corporate donors, but she certainly doesn’t unnerve the party’s Wall Street wing the way Warren and Sanders do. And Harris began the 2020 race with a significant amount of Establishment buy-in. For a brief period after her campaign launch, she polled near the top of the pack. But the spotlight exposed Harris’s relative inexperience on the national stage. Her desire to have it both ways on Medicare for All put her in the worst of both worlds — boasting a health-care plan too radical for centrists’ taste, and too craven for the progressive faithful. Her attack on Biden’s busing record earned short-term accolades, but no durable gains with African-American voters. And then Warren began eating into her share of the #Resistance vote (for lack of a better term). Harris’s campaign isn’t quite dead — she’s still only a hair behind Mayor Pete in national polls. But her failure to launch pushed a lot of Establishment actors into Biden’s corner.

2. Joe Biden is losing it (and much too slowly). The former vice-president’s resilient appeal among a wide swath of the Democratic rank and file blunted what little momentum Harris had, and prevented the party’s moderate factions from consolidating behind any other candidate. But Biden also appears incapable of speaking in complete sentences for longer than a few minutes at a time. Cognitively and physically, he looks like a man in decline. His campaign schedule is light, and debate performances often cringeworthy. And yet, for all the turbulence Biden’s senescence has generated, his campaign has stayed aloft. Uncle Joe is still slightly ahead in the national polling average and in the early states of Iowa and Nevada. If South Carolina’s primary election were held today, meanwhile, Biden would collect nearly all of the Palmetto State’s delegates. Biden’s advantage over Warren has gone from commanding to essentially nonexistent. But he remains formidable enough to leave other moderates with little room for growth. Especially since …

3. The outsize role of money in politics now puts corporate Democrats at a disadvantage (in Democratic presidential primaries, anyway). This point may be controversial (and a little premature). But small-dollar online fundraising seems to have radically changed the political economy of presidential campaigns. Twitter is not “real life”; there are fewer highly engaged, ideologically committed progressive voters in the primary electorate than your social-media feed would suggest. But there are still way more progressive ideologues in this world than there are pro-choice financiers who are willing to donate the maximum $2,800 to a Democratic presidential campaign. Meanwhile, progressive Democrats don’t just tweet more than moderate ones — they also spend more of their disposal income on politics. Thus, candidates who command the enthusiasm of progressive news junkies now have a much easier time making payroll than those who don’t. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren aren’t just out-raising their rivals, they’re doing so without having to expend precious time and energy on ritzy fundraisers. Amy Klobuchar’s “no we can’t” message may have its virtues, but it doesn’t open all that many wallets. Which means as long as the big-dollar donors hedge their bets, our “broken” campaign-finance system has the effect of marginalizing pro-business voices (if only in the uniquely high-visibility context of a Democratic presidential primary).

All of which is to say, the Whitby Democrats’ fantasies of a Michelle Obama candidacy may be delusional, but this delusion is an understandable response to a grim reality. Their faction has unintentionally placed all of its bets on an old, increasingly lame horse who was infamous for mounting lousy presidential runs when he was in his prime. Some moderate donors are still telling themselves Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, or Amy Klobuchar have a chance. But the available evidence suggests those candidates’ prospects are only slightly better than those of Michael Bloomberg, John Kerry, and Deval Patrick. Biden is (almost certainly) the Establishment’s only hope.

And that’s good news for Democrats who are hoping for “big, structural change.”"

Joe Biden has a dire warning for voters who’ve been seduced by single-payer advocates’ sweet nothings: In Bernie Sanders’s socialist dystopia, the typical American worker would see a small percentage of her income deducted from each paycheck, so as to finance her health-insurance coverage.

The Biden campaign disseminated this harrowing prophecy over Twitter, during Tuesday night’s Democratic debate:

Photo: @JoeBiden/Twitter

Biden’s framing certainly makes Medicare for All sound prohibitively expensive. But let’s follow the former vice-president’s lead, and put this matter in perspective.

In 2018, Canada spent roughly 11 percent of its GDP on health care. Under its single-payer insurance model, that investment was enough to provide every Canadian with premium, free access to the world’s 14th-highest-performing health-care system.

That same year, the United States spent 18 percent of its GDP on health care — which, under our system, was inadequate to provide any form of insurance to nearly 30 million Americans, nor to prevent 50 percent of our people from delaying or forgoing medical care due to affordability concerns. For these reasons, among others, America’s exorbitant investment in its medical sector has bought us the world’s 29th-ranked health-care system. That places the wealthiest country in human history just behind the Czech Republic on the small matter of caring for its ill.

Unlike Canadian citizens, Americans do not have to pay taxes to support a universal public insurance system. But that 18 percent of GDP doesn’t come from nowhere. The vast majority of U.S. adults see health insurance as a mandatory expense. As a practical matter, their private insurance premiums function as de facto taxes — obligatory payments deducted from their paychecks to finance a form of social protection. As a legal matter, meanwhile, U.S. federal law still mandates that all Americans secure insurance coverage (although the penalty for not doing so has been set to zero). Thus, in both an essential and technical sense, the typical American worker is compelled by government policy to fork over a hefty percentage of their wages to private insurers.

If Biden acknowledged this reality — which is to say, if he ignored the superficial distinction between payroll taxes and premium payments — he would find (presumably, to his horror) that the U.S. already taxes labor income at one of the highest rates of any country in the OECD. As Matt Bruenig of the People’s Policy Project has shown, the “compulsory payment rate” for a married U.S. worker with two kids was 43.2 percent in 2017; for an analogous Canadian, that rate was 11.5 percent.

No honest observer can look at this data and conclude that single-payer health-care systems are inherently more expensive and inefficient than America’s existing model. Which means that the eye-popping price tag of Bernie Sanders’s Medicare for All plan does not reflect the steep price of socialized medicine, per se. Rather, it reflects the fact that America’s aberrant refusal to impose price controls on its health-care industry has enabled the sector to extract an ever-higher share of national income. Americans spend several times more than their peers in other developed countries on health-care administration, pharmaceuticals, and physicians’ salaries. Although the existing Medicare for All proposals would create some cost savings, they would not fully rectify our overspending problem in the near term. This is, in part, because bringing our payment rates all the way down to the international median in one fell swoop would risk hospital closures and other economic disruptions (and spur massive resistance from powerful and respected interest groups). For these reasons, any plausible proposal for shifting all of America’s health-care costs onto Uncle Sam’s books is bound to look fiscally extravagant. But leaving those costs off the government’s ledger doesn’t make them disappear.

As the right-wing Mercatus Center (accidentally) revealed last year, under one plausible model, Bernie Sanders’s Medicare for All plan would cost the U.S. $32.6 trillion over a decade — while simply maintaining our existing health-care system would cost $34.65 trillion. Which is to say, establishing single-payer would save us $2 trillion in national income, while guaranteeing all Americans affordable health care. But it would also require U.S. workers to make compulsory social insurance payments to the government rather than to private insurers.

And for Joe Biden, that’s apparently a deal-breaker.

At this week’s debate in Ohio, Biden and other moderate Democrats hammered Elizabeth Warren for refusing to state explicitly that her Medicare for All plan would require raising taxes on the middle class. The Massachusetts senator did not deny that her proposal would involve such tax hikes. But she refused to utter the T-word. Instead, she merely promised that she would never sign a health-care bill that didn’t lower the middle-class’s overall costs.

It was more than fair for the debate moderators to press Warren on her evasiveness. Journalists should always work to expose the trade-offs inherent in politicians’ proposals. But Warren’s caginess was rooted in the media’s failure to apply such scrutiny universally. Democrats campaigning on plans that would retain America’s redundant insurance bureaucracies were not asked how they could justify such an extravagance. Under the norms of mainstream political journalism, costs imposed on the American people by the private sector require no justification or defense; only costs imposed by the public sector do. If you are committed to abetting the meteoric rise of private health-insurance premiums, a debate moderator will not ask you to level with the American people about how much your approach to health-care policy will cost them. If you are committed to reducing overall health-care costs by expanding the public sector’s role in medical provision, you will be ritually scolded for the extraordinary (and extraordinarily decontextualized) fiscal price of your program.

As the party that favors higher levels of taxation and public provision, Democrats have an interest in contesting this norm. Biden’s agenda may be less ambitious than Sanders or Warren’s. But he still (officially) aims to raise taxes and increase spending by trillions of dollars. A political discourse that treats taxation as presumptively suspect (even as it treats private rentierism as presumptively legitimate) will not be a favorable one for any Democratic president. Amy Klobuchar, who criticized Warren for her secret middle-class tax hike Tuesday night, is a co-sponsor of the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act, which would finance an entitlement to paid family leave with a small increase in payroll taxes. When the Klobuchar administration pushes for that law’s passage, it will want its policy to be judged on the basis of its impact on the median family’s overall costs, not their overall tax bill. And yet, in attacking single-payer Tuesday night, Klobuchar implicitly endorsed the opposite criterion. Equating support for middle-class families with opposition to increasing their tax rates is a conservative project. There is no reason for any Democratic candidate to be advancing it — no matter their position on single-payer.

There are arguments against the existing Medicare for All proposals that do not involve demonizing the very concept of tax-financed social programs. Some of these are logistical (Sanders has neglected to detail various aspects of his transition plan). The most compelling, though, is purely political. At present, there are 14 votes in the U.S. Senate for Bernie’s single-payer bill. In the best-case scenario, Jon Tester will be the pivotal vote in the upper chamber in 2021. Given these facts, there is little basis for believing that Medicare for All will be legislatively viable in the medium-term future, no matter who wins the 2020 election. After all, six-year terms, sky-high renomination rates, and an avalanche of industry cash will insulate anti-single-payer Senate Democrats incumbents against popular pressure in support of the proposal.

And there’s no guarantee that popular pressure would be forthcoming. The vast majority of available polling indicates that a public option is much more popular with voters than single-payer. One can reasonably attribute this result to the aforementioned biases in our political discourse. But no Democratic nominee will be able to eradicate those biases next summer.

If Medicare for All is not legislatively viable and a public option is more electorally expedient, then there is a case for the Democratic nominee to campaign on the latter. After all, the stakes of denying Donald Trump a second term are extremely high. How one calculates the potential electoral cost of running on a somewhat less popular health-care policy — let alone how one weighs that cost against the potential long-term benefits of popularizing single-payer (a more efficient and just mode of health-care provision) — is inescapably subjective. But given the balance of forces in the Senate, deferring to public opinion on health care so as to maximize the probability of Trump’s eviction from the White House next year, strikes me as a choice a genuinely progressive politician could make.

There is no electoral argument, however, for engaging in anti-tax demagoguery. Biden could emulate his old boss and endorse single-payer in principle, but insist that the country is not yet ready for it. Or he could steal Mayor Pete’s line, and say that he trusts the American people to eventually discover the superiority of publicly provided insurance, once they’re given the option. Instead, he’s opted for a needlessly reactionary mode of attack that will damage Warren or Sanders electorally, should they win the nomination, and undermine any future Democratic president legislatively, should the party regain the chance to govern."

Ben: This week, Elizabeth Warren said that she would forgo high-dollar fundraisers in a general-election campaign against President Trump. She had previously maintained that she would drop this rule, which she has been following during the primaries, if she won the nomination, saying that she is not a fan of “unilateral disarmament.” Will her change of heart put her at a disadvantage?

Josh: I don’t think we know. The argument against doing this, obviously, is that these fundraisers can bring in a lot of money, some of which she won’t collect if she doesn’t do them. And it’s not just money for her own campaign, but for the Democratic National Committee and for state Democratic Parties, which use the funds to support Democratic efforts more broadly.

But there are empirical questions we don’t have answers to: How much money actually won’t be donated, which she would have managed to raise if she did these appearances like other nominees typically have? Can she use a promise not to do such fundraising to generate more grassroots money, or will she be rewarded for it by voters? And — I think most importantly — how will she spend the time that is freed up by avoiding the time suck that is high-dollar fundraising?

Eric: Yes. There’s also the question of whether money lost from holding such fundraisers will just be diverted into pro-Warren super-PACs. On the one hand, given the meteoric rise of online fundraising — and the eagerness of the Democrats’ (increasingly deep-pocketed) base to fight Trumpism with their wallets — it isn’t that hard to see Warren keeping her coffers full without meeting and greeting big-dollar donors.

Josh: I’m confused about why declining to engage in glad-handing would lead to more money in super-PACs.

Eric: The super PACs could hold glitzy fundraisers even if the Warren campaign doesn’t.

Josh: The DNC and the state parties can hold the glitzy fundraisers, too, and they will. The question is whether donors, who expect to be able to come see the candidate and, with a high enough ticket price, talk with the candidate, will be willing to write the checks if they don’t get to do that. I think one point in favor of Warren’s strategy is: Why do people write large checks to political campaigns and parties? If they’re writing the checks because they hope to get access, they may already be sour on Warren, which makes this sort of stuff a less efficient use of her time than it would be for another nominee. And if they’re writing the checks just because they are ideologically motivated, her rule may allow her to collect that money more efficiently: Those donors might like face time with the candidate, but if they know nobody is getting it, maybe they will still send their checks anyway.

Ben: Matt Yglesias tweeted this morning that one of the problems with Warren’s approach is that “every time Warren has a second- or third-degree interaction with a donor it will be reported as a hypocrisy story while Trump continues to collect bribes through his hotels on a daily basis with no reaction.” What do you make of that argument?

Josh: What I lay out there is an argument for why it might (might! not saying it is) be a good decision for her to choose to continue not spending time on this during a general election. That doesn’t mean she needs to make a public commitment to it.

Eric: I feel like those kind of stories would be written about Warren either way.

Josh: I tend to think, in general, campaign-finance issues move very few voters, especially in general elections. So I’m not sure it matters if Warren gets attacked over that later.

Eric: I think one potentially awkward aspect of Warren’s stance is that lower-profile, down-ballot Democrats can’t afford to emulate her example. So if Warren effectively equates glad-handing with corruption, then she’ll be tacitly accusing virtually every other Democrat of that sin.

Josh: On the other hand, if Warren doesn’t spend her time courting high-dollar donors, those donors might divert more of their donations toward down-ballot candidates who are willing to attend fundraisers.

Eric: True. Or potentially true.

Josh: I think people are looking too hard for a general principle here, and I think it’s quite possible that Warren has good reasons to adopt this strategy that aren’t necessarily generalizable. I think people are looking at it too much as an ideological decision and not enough as a tactical one.

Eric: Do you think announcing this pledge now has tactical value in the primary?

Josh: I don’t know how much it matters in the primary — presumably, if it helps that’s because it covers her left flank. You’re probably better positioned to get inside the head of a Bernie voter than I am.

Eric: I can see the argument that this sort of gesture isn’t going to win over Bernie diehards, even as it risks feeding concerns about electability (though I sorta doubt it’ll have much impact whatsoever).

Josh: I do have an idea about “why now” though: She’s had another eight months of experience campaigning, and the campaign has a better sense of how it can raise money, and might be more confident it can honor the pledge.

Ben: She did raise the second most of any primary contender last quarter, trailing only Bernie Sanders, who also shuns big donors.

Josh: And she has dry powder. A lot of those Establishment figures who wrote max-out checks to Joe Biden will end up writing checks to her if she is the nominee,

whereas I don’t know how many of her grassroots donors will give to Biden if he is nominated.

Ben: To what extent do you think a Democratic nominee who DOES attend some glitzy galas will depress donations among small donors? is this something most voters care that much about?

Josh: In a general election, I don’t think so. I understand fighting over it in a primary — you’re trying to figure out which candidate is MOST committed to your values, and how they raise money is a signal of that. In a general election, I don’t see how this creates daylight versus Donald Trump.

Eric: I sorta doubt it. I think the benefit is probably going to come more in the form of saved time than more grassroots funding.

Josh: Yeah, I think people really underrate that aspect — this frees up a ton of time.

Eric: Another point that Sean McElwee raised on Twitter: In recent presidential history, these closed-door events have tended to produce monumental gaffes. The deplorables remark, cling to your guns, the 47 percent — all came when candidates let their hair down in front of their favorite rich people.

Josh: Oh god, yes. I’d put it slightly differently: Candidates direct their comments to the interests of an audience, and these audiences have different interests than the electorate. Whether that’s harsher economic messages (“47 percent”) or excessively contemptuous cultural messages (“deplorables”).

Now, a disciplined candidate should be careful about that. This comes up in other situations too: You shouldn’t say something to an activist group you wouldn’t want in the paper, either. But yeah, it’s one less venue to screw up in."

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) recently delivered impassioned remarks on unions but tacked on a statement about impeachment beforehand after consulting with aides. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) fielded questions about Medicare-for-all at a town hall last week, then faced inquiries from reporters on impeachment. Former vice president Joe Biden spent a few minutes discussing impeachment at a recent stop before turning to an abbreviated version of his usual speech.

“It definitely throws a monkey wrench into everybody’s talking points,” said Rep. Matthew Cartwright (D-Pa.), who supports Biden and endorsed an impeachment inquiry for the first time last week. “It’s something extra that they have to talk about.”

While leading Democrats increasingly demand forceful statements on Trump’s actions, many voters and activists are urging candidates not to stop talking about how they would provide health insurance to more Americans, shrink the gap between rich and poor, and combat climate change. Some bluntly warn that devoting too much attention to impeachment could be a costly mistake.

“Impeachment is an afterthought for a lot of people,” said Elesha Gayman, chair of the Scott County Democratic Party in Iowa. “I appreciate them coming out with a statement, but that’s about where it needs to end. I think the most important thing to carry forward for the Democrats is going to be having a message and a vision for what they are going to bring to the table.”

She added, “I think, especially in the Democratic Party, we lose elections when we make it about ‘we’re better than the other guy’ and we don’t lay out a vision.”

What’s clear is that the furor in Washington injects another huge dose of uncertainty, at a critical moment, into a contest that was already highly fluid. The field is likely to winnow soon, and the impeachment focus threatens to take even more oxygen from hopefuls who already had limited time to make an impact.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) took the rare step of beginning impeachment proceedings against Trump last week after he acknowledged urging the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Many Democrats say dislodging Trump from office is unlikely, given the strong support for him in the Republican-controlled Senate, where a two-thirds vote is needed for removal.

Nevertheless, the Democratic presidential field has largely lined up behind Pelosi, endorsing her inquiry and vocally condemning Trump’s conduct. A whistleblower complaint at the center of the controversy alleges that Trump misused his office for personal gain and that unidentified White House officials took improper actions to keep it a secret. Trump has said he did nothing wrong.

Some voters expressed concerns about the Democrats forging ahead on impeachment. Diana Kroeger, 52, an independent from Hollis, N.H., who stood in line for a photo with Warren after her Friday town hall event there, said “I’m worried” about the process, fearing it will further divide the country.

Will Norona, an autoworker from Flint, Mich., who walked a picket line in front of a GM plant in Detroit last week with Sanders, said he worried that focusing on impeachment could take attention away from other issues.

“Our focus is on this,” said Norona, 43, speaking of the autoworkers’ strike.

But other Democrats, believing Trump to be increasingly vulnerable, want to see the candidates call him out more aggressively than ever.

“They’ve got to keep the focus on Trump while hot lights are on him,” said Gilda Cobb-Hunter, president of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators and a veteran South Carolina Democrat.

Shawana Love, 42, an undecided voter who also joined the picket line in Detroit, said seeing the Democrats take steps toward impeaching Trump gets her more excited about the election. “Impeach his a--!” Love said.

The fast-moving developments and clashing voter sentiments are prompting many of the candidates to dedicate valuable time at campaign events — and devote space on their social media pages — to responding to the latest Trump news with outrage.

But they are taking different tacks.

Warren has been pointing out that she advocated impeachment proceedings long before the recent revelations about Trump’s conversation with the Ukrainian president. Warren has been rising in the polls, and some of her rivals have begun criticizing her policies, but the impeachment furor could make that harder with so much attention focused on Trump.

“The way to hold this president of the United States accountable is to impeach him,” Warren told reporters after Friday’s town hall. “So I hope we go forward with care and deliberation, but that we do it quickly. I think it’s important. The American people are counting on us.”

AD

AD

Some Warren allies say she is well-suited to talk about the issue because it is in line with one of her core campaign themes: tackling corruption.

“For Elizabeth Warren, it’s right in the middle of the bull’s eye,” said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Warren. “Assuming this keeps going, I would be surprised if she didn’t integrate it more and more into her stump speech.”

Still, the current landscape presents the paradox that if Trump were to be removed — a remote prospect at the moment — the Democratic nominee would presumably be running against Vice President Pence, not the figure they’ve been railing against for months.

AD

Sanders has been more cautious about the prospect of impeachment. While he also supports an inquiry, a point he has emphasized repeatedly in recent days, he has long focused on policy, and he warned Democrats not to abandon work on other important issues.

AD

“The Congress of the United States must show the American people that it can walk and chew gum at the same time,” Sanders said last week in Davenport, Iowa.

Warren, Sanders and the four other senators in the race have to keep another variable in mind: They would effectively become jurors in a Senate trial if the House votes to impeach Trump and Senate leaders move ahead with a judicial proceeding.

AD

“Let’s have that trial in the United States Senate,” Sanders said in Plymouth, N.H., on Sunday. “I will do my best to look at the facts as objectively as I can.”

Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) has sought to use the impeachment inquiry to remind voters of her experience as a prosecutor and a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Harris canceled a recent fundraiser in Los Angeles to fly back to Washington for a meeting of the Senate Intelligence Committee, to which she also belongs.

AD

Biden is tethered to the situation more directly than any other candidate. During a July 25 phone call, Trump requested that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky investigate Biden, according to a rough transcript of the conversation that the White House released. Biden’s son Hunter had served on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power. Hunter Biden was not accused of wrongdoing.

AD

As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who many Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.

Despite the centrality of his role, Biden has been more reticent than some of his rivals when it comes to impeachment.

AD

At a recent fundraiser in Southern California, Biden said that he and his family had done nothing wrong and accused Trump of trying to “hijack an election so we do not focus on the issues that matter in our lives.” He added, “This is not about me.”

Rufus Gifford, a former ambassador to Denmark who has donated to Biden and other candidates this year, said he sees both opportunity and peril for the former vice president.

“It’s very much a double-edged sword. On one hand, anyone kind of wants to be mano a mano with Trump right now,” said Gifford, who was finance director for Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign. At the same time, Gifford said, it could prompt some Democrats to question whether the Ukraine situation would be a vulnerability for Biden — chipping away at his assertion that he’s the most electable Democrat — and “those questions have to be answered.”

In the meantime, the drama set to unfold in coming weeks — likely to feature explosive congressional hearings, angry partisan debates, bitterly contested votes on the House floor and possibly further revelations about Trump — adds a daunting, unpredictable dynamic that, even more than the campaign so far, is outside the candidates’ control.

As South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said recently, “Nobody knows what the political consequences of impeachment are.”"

Politics, like nature, abhors a vacuum. And so it makes sense that in the course of a Democratic presidential nominating contest in which a vast army of observers wait with bated breath for the long-delayed but perhaps inevitable collapse of support for Joe Biden, at least one of his lower-tier rivals is auditioning to become his successor in the affections of self-consciously “moderate” voters.

Sahil Kapur has noticed Pete Buttigieg’s look-me-over pitch to this large element of the Democratic electorate in Iowa:

Pete Buttigieg is pitching himself as an alternative to moderate Democrats who might not be sold on Joe Biden.

On a recent bus tour of Iowa, Buttigieg framed his argument, emphasizing the need to “re-center our politics” and recapture the notion of freedom and faith from conservatives who he says use those terms to “club people over the head.”

Mayor Pete is not, to be clear, a member of some formal ideological faction of the Democratic Party, like Bill Clinton was a member of the aggressively centrist Democratic Leadership Council. He’s more like Barack Obama, who eschewed ideological labels but deployed messaging (and, as president, policies) that appealed to voters and opinion leaders wary of the kind of anti-corporate “populism” that has consistently animated the labor-left elements of the party. Buttigieg’s status as the first viable openly gay (and married) presidential candidate serves to broaden his appeal in nonideological ways, just like Obama’s African-American identity. But Kapur offers examples of the South Bend mayor’s centrist messaging:

His “re-centering” message is designed to counter Republican caricatures of Democrats — he told Iowans that “freedom” isn’t just about businesses having fewer regulations, it’s about being free of crippling health care costs; and he says big government should get out of the way of women making reproductive choices.

More conspicuously, Mayor Pete touts his record as a military veteran with service in Afghanistan (an increasingly rare credential for politicians of either party), and he is both religiously observant and more than willing to blast the Christian right for its arrogant claims to speak for the Almighty while peddling its entirely secular conservative agenda. These are thematics that voters don’t hear from the economics-focused Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. And while Buttigieg tries to be a bit subtle about it, the 37-year-old candidate emulates the Bill Clinton of 1992 by offering a generational critique of older pols as caught up in ancient ideological conflicts that don’t lead to solutions. This shot at Elizabeth Warren is characteristic:

“She and I are after the same goals,” he said of Warren. “But her pitch has a lot more to do with fighting — she’s more interested in the fighting part of it. I’m more interested in outcomes.”

Buttigieg’s policy stances also echo past centrist preoccupations, including a Clintonesque push for national service and, more famously, a “Medicare If You Want It” health-care proposal that is a lot like the original Obamacare plan in offering a choice between public and private insurance. His national-security agenda is more conventionally liberal-internationalist than that of most of his rivals, and his team of national-security advisers is led by Doug Wilson, an Obama Pentagon official and a former political director at the DLC (where I was one of his colleagues, for the record). When Buttigieg criticized Biden for representing a failed ideology of neoliberalism, lefty critics hooted derisively, calling Buttigieg the authentic neoliberal candidate. He hasn’t really triangulated against this sort of criticism from Team Democratic Socialist, but he might in the near future.

Obviously enough, this turn-to-the-center gambit by Buttigieg won’t work unless Biden finally begins to fade. And he has another problem, too: Democratic moderates have dominated the party in the past via a strong African-American voting base. That was true of Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Al Gore (in his less progressive phase), Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama. It was even true to some extent of John Kerry in 2004, who did surprisingly well among black primary voters while appealing to electability-focused voters worried about Howard Dean’s alleged radicalism.

The black-moderate alliance is fundamental to Biden’s continuing strength, of course. And unfortunately for Mayor Pete, and despite stout efforts (e.g., his Douglass Plan for racial justice), you could currently fit his black support base comfortably within one of those Iowa diners he has visited recently.

There are various explanations for Buttigieg’s exceptionally honkified following: his cerebral, multilingual “wine track” rhetoric, which tends to appeal to more affluent and college-educated white voters; his sexual orientation, with which we are told many African-Americans (particularly those who belong to Evangelical churches) are still uncomfortable; and above all, his history of conflict with black activists in South Bend unhappy with how he has handled police-brutality complaints — most recently after a fatal police shooting of an apparently innocent black man in June. Indeed, this may be the only aspect of his mayoral tenure in South Bend that has gained widespread national attention.

Mayor Pete’s problems with black voters aren’t particularly important to the categorical imperative he shares with others candidates to make a very good showing in lily-white Iowa. He is pouring his considerable resources (his second- and third-quarter fundraising hauls have been extremely impressive; his total contributions are at $51 million for the year) into the first-in-the-nation caucus state, where the RealClearPolitics polling average has him virtually tied with Bernie Sanders for third place. Aside from positioning him to exploit any Biden weakness (which the impeachment drive’s focus on a Ukraine scandal in which Uncle Joe’s last name is going to be mentioned a lot may exacerbate) — and Biden’s already struggling in Iowa — a strong Iowa showing could fatally undermine the viability of other possible pretenders to the mantle of Biden Alternative for Moderates, such as Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, and Cory Booker. In the recent gold-standard Selzer Iowa Poll for the Des Moines Register, CNN, and Mediacom, Buttigieg held 9 percent as compared to Harris’s 6 percent and Klobuchar’s and Booker’s 3 percent.

If Buttigieg does have something of an Iowa breakthrough — and particularly if the two major African-American candidates immediately fade — then he can hope minority voters give him a second look. It wouldn’t hurt his midwestern white-working-class appeal to get off the “wine track,” either. But understandably, he’s putting first things first, and surviving Iowa is job one."

The operation demonstrated a sophisticated understanding of the schisms within the Democratic Party as it labors to choose a nominee to face Trump in 2020. One Russian account, which portrayed itself as a black voter in Michigan, used the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag to hammer Biden for gaffes about racial issues. Some of the accounts boosted one of his rivals on the left, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).

The Russian network was the subject of one of four takedowns Facebook announced Monday; it also disabled three misleading campaigns originating in Iran. Researchers said the efforts demonstrated how those seeking to interfere in U.S. politics continue to exploit radioactive topics, including racial and religious fault lines. And they said it offered fresh evidence that foreign actors are pursuing new platforms that rely on a steady stream of images, making detection more difficult despite Facebook’s heightened investments in election security.

“We are seeing again that the aim of the Russians is not exclusively to favor one candidate over another but to create divisiveness within the electorate overall,” said Paul M. Barrett, deputy director of New York University’s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. “The reason that networks of phony accounts are drawn to Instagram is because disinformation is increasingly visual in nature, and that’s what Instagram specializes in.”

The disclosure from Facebook served as more evidence of what Trump has repeatedly questioned — that Russian actors not only interfered in the 2016 election but are continuing their efforts to interfere in American democracy. The task of safeguarding U.S. elections from interference by Russia and other foreign actors has been a source of tension in the Trump administration, with the president repeatedly calling the allegations of Russian involvement in 2016 a “hoax” and top security officials being forced to tiptoe around the issue.

Multiple U.S. investigations have confirmed the extent of Russia’s attempt to interfere in the 2016 presidential race. Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III obtained multiple indictments last year of individuals affiliated with the Internet Research Agency. This month, a bipartisan report produced by Senate investigators concluded again that the Russian effort sought to boost Trump and undermine Clinton in the eyes of social media users.

Speaking to The Washington Post last week, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said the problem posed by disinformation has worsened since 2016, and he attributed that in part to a poor initial response by the U.S. government to the threat. “Unfortunately, the U.S. did not have a particularly strong response to Russia after 2016,” he said, “so it sent the signal to other countries that they could get in on this, too.”

Facebook’s announcements came two days before Zuckerberg is set to appear on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are likely to press him on the company’s work to safeguard U.S. elections from foreign manipulation. Members of Congress have upbraided the tech giant for missing key warning signs of Russian interference before the 2016 election, then failing to acknowledge the Kremlin’s activities immediately after the fact.

Zuckerberg said in an interview last week that Facebook is in a “much better place now” to stop disinformation campaigns, citing the company’s investments in tens of thousands of new staff hires and artificial intelligence that can spot fake accounts and dubious posts in real time. The company further fine-tuned its policies Monday, pledging to more prominently alert users when viral content is determined to be false. Announcing the changes, Zuckerberg stressed he now has “some confidence our systems here are working.”

“Elections have changed significantly since 2016,” he told reporters, “and Facebook has changed, too.”

Researchers said Facebook — in spotting and disclosing the Russian network Monday faster than it had in the past — demonstrated it had improved its digital defenses. Companies such as Facebook are “building muscle memory around understanding malicious actors on their platform,” said Graham Brookie, the director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab.

But Brookie said Facebook’s takedown showed that Russia’s tactics would continue to evolve as well. “To steal a phrase, a picture is worth a thousand words, and meme-based content is still extremely effective and much harder to detect,” he said.

The Biden campaign applauded Facebook for disabling the fake accounts but said Trump’s penchant for falsehoods posed just as great a challenge for the company, which has refused to fact-check political advertising placed by the president’s reelection campaign.

“Unfortunately, like the Kremlin, Donald Trump continues to benefit from spreading false information, [and] all the while Facebook profits from amplifying his lies and debunked conspiracy theories on their platform,” TJ Ducklo, a Biden campaign spokesman, said in a statement. “If Facebook is truly committed to protecting the integrity of our elections, they would immediately take down Trump’s ads that attempt to gaslight the American people.”

Facebook described the Russian network as a “well-resourced operation” focused on the United States and reliant on sophisticated steps to conceal the identity and location of those behind the fake accounts. It comprised 50 accounts on Instagram and one on Facebook, all of them created this year.

The network appeared still to be in an audience-building phase when it was removed by Facebook: 246,000 accounts followed one or more of the inauthentic Russian accounts, which had collectively made just fewer than 75,000 posts, according to a report from Graphika, a social media analysis firm that examined the operation for Facebook. Only one account, which addressed environmental themes, had more than 20,000 followers.

AD

Much of the content lacked text, consisting only of memes, and the posts often drew from viral content first posted by American actors, including news organizations and prominent political figures, such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).

The accounts had not yet developed their own voice, which analysts say is critical to achieving a mass following.

“These accounts were trying really hard to hide,” said Ben Nimmo, Graphika’s director of investigations. “The more you try to blend in, the less you stand out. And the less you stand out, the less you’re going to attract an audience. It looks like these accounts were sacrificing engagement for security. That’s a very defensive strategy.”

AD

Nimmo said Facebook’s action was at least the fourth takedown since 2017 of operations targeting the United States that seemed to bear links to the Internet Research Agency. The apparent connection to the St. Petersburg company and “troll farm,” owned by an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, went beyond overlap with the thematic focus and targets of past Kremlin-backed campaigns. Some of the accounts taken down Monday had posted memes already attributed to previous IRA efforts — but had sought to rebuild them from scratch, rather than simply reposting them, and had made attempts to remove the original IRA watermarks.

AD

A minority of the posts focused explicitly on the 2020 election, according to Graphika’s analysis. Among the accounts posing as backers of political and social causes in the United States, the largest cluster was conservative and in support of Trump. Numerous accounts aimed their fire at Democratic candidates — namely Biden but also Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.). Other issues included racial activism, Confederate pride, gun rights, LGBT issues, feminism, Islam and Christianity.

Nearly half of the accounts claimed to be based in swing states, with a specific focus on Florida.

AD

Biden came under attack from accounts that positioned themselves on both sides of the political spectrum. One account reposted a tweet from a right-wing political commentator parroting a Trump rebuke of Biden, while another posted a meme showing a road diverging and a car swerving to choose the path representing “Bernie 2020” over “Joe Biden.” Four years earlier, Russian-backed Facebook accounts similarly promoted Sanders during the Democratic primary against Clinton, according to Senate investigators."

Most weeks, New York Magazine writer-at-large Frank Rich speaks with contributor Alex Carp about the biggest stories in politics and culture. Today, what last night’s debate tells us about the Democratic field.

Last night was the first Democratic primary debate since Congress opened its official impeachment inquiry of Donald Trump. Did that change anything?

The opening question, a softball about impeachment, allowed every last one of the 12 candidates on the overcrowded stage to tell us what we already know: They are all for it! So the advent of the impeachment inquiry per se didn’t change anything. But once we moved beyond that dull panorama of like-mindedness, this turned out to be a clarifying debate. By that I don’t mean it was an exciting debate, or an inspiring debate, or a debate that would draw in those Americans (most of them) who don’t want to think about 2020 politics before we get to 2020. But the shape of the Democratic field now seems crystal clear. Tuesday night seemed like a death knell for seven of the dozen candidacies on stage, including Joe Biden’s. It’s time for the actual contenders to go at it on a less cluttered field.

Among the seven also-rans, the low-hanging losers are Beto O’Rourke, Julián Castro, Andrew Yang, Tulsi Gabbard, and Tom Steyer (we hardly knew ye), the billionaire vanity candidate whose main attribute is that at least he is not Howard Schultz. Their time to gain traction in this cycle has come and gone. Obviously O’Rourke and Castro are future prospects, though it may take a while for some Democrats to forgive O’Rourke for his vainglorious decision to run for president rather than to challenge the incumbent John Cornyn in next year’s Texas Senate race.

Cory Booker and Biden, two candidates who’ve always looked highly plausible in theory but repeatedly fail to deliver, are more complicated cases.

Booker is sunny and personable — as unobjectionable as an easy-listening radio host. His upbeat, why-can’t-we-all-get-along shtick is surely sincere, but it’s part of the reason why he’s never risen in the polls: It comes off as empty bombast — cheery bombast, to be sure, but no substitute for substance. In a dark time, voters are not looking for a “politics of joy,” to recall the thesis of Hubert Humphrey’s ill-fated campaign in 1968. And they aren’t looking for rage, a market that has been cornered by Trump in any event. What they are looking for is fight. Booker has yet to show that he has much of that, despite his periodic pumping up of his mellifluous voice to simulate fisticuffs.

In last night’s debate, he also revealed just how hard it is for him to depart from his over-polished prefab scripts. It was somewhat embarrassing when, in an obviously planned bit of grandstanding, he (politely) chastised his rivals for neglecting to talk about how much women’s reproductive rights are under attack — only moments after Kamala Harris had made the exact same point, and stirringly so. Booker’s attempt to concede that she’d upstaged him was awkward (a patronizing “God bless Kamala!”) as was his effort to draw a distinction by congratulating himself on being a man who cares about women’s reproductive rights. (It was just grating enough to recall his mortifying “I am Spartacus” gambit during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings.) In another demonstration of his lack of intellectual agility, he glowingly quoted the former Trump defense secretary, Jim Mattis, while making no reference to Mattis’s recently much-discussed cowardice in failing to speak up about the White House horrors that are at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.

Biden also lacks that intellectual agility. He didn’t repeat the viral glitches of the previous debates. But that’s a low bar to rise above. Like Booker, he seems incapable of the improvisational moves necessary to take on Trump. He ducked a question about why it was okay for Hunter Biden to trade on his name for cushy foreign paydays, however lawfully, and instead repeated an anodyne soundbite three times (“My son’s statement speaks for itself”). This was a lost opportunity because Biden might have joined other Democrats in denouncing the nepotistic follies of his hypocritical Republican critics, notably Donald Trump Jr., Rand Paul, and Liz Cheney. And he might have passionately lit into the criminal White House conspiracy to strongarm foreign governments to soil him and his son. After all, Trump’s assault on the Bidens is the best argument for his candidacy — it makes the case that Joe Biden is the candidate Trump fears the most. But unaccountably Biden has made only fitful use of this political gift horse in the weeks since the Ukraine scandal became front-page news — even as his campaign’s fundraising has wilted.

There were other examples of his lack of improvisational skills as well. After delivering a meaty tirade against the outrage of Trump’s surrender to Erdogan and Assad, he ducked the question of whether he’d send American troops back into the region. He couldn’t stop himself from repeating more than once his newly favored shtick (intended as a stab at Warren) trumpeting himself as the only candidate who’s gotten anything done. That claim is not only false, but is wielded as a dodge to avoid any treacherous policy question. Worse, it left him open to this memorable riposte from Bernie Sanders: “You got the disastrous war in Iraq done.” Sanders damaged Biden in a less explicit way as well. Post–heart attack, he seemed looser, sharper, and less programmed than he did pre–heart attack. He seems younger than Biden though in fact he’s two years his senior. Who would have ever imagined that Bernie Sanders could be a comeback kid?

Among the others still left standing, Kamala Harris remains an enigma. She’s a sharp and tireless prosecutor (as she never hesitates to remind us), capable of real fire when she’s passionate about the subject at hand. But she’s just as often studied and cautious, and you have to wonder about her political acuity when she marshals her considerable resources to push such a marginal, Bay Area–centric crusade as calling upon Twitter to suspend Trump’s account.

As nearly everyone has noted, the two who did themselves the most good last night were Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, who seized the initiative and poked holes in the best-laid Medicare for All plans of front-runner Elizabeth Warren. Their blows, respectful but firm, landed.

For the first time in a debate, Warren occasionally seemed defensive and misspoke. She will not be able to get away indefinitely with stonewalling Buttigieg’s “yes or no question” about whether her health plan mandates tax increases. At another point, she could be found self-righteously claiming that “everyone else on this stage” wants to protect billionaires even though, as Klobuchar pointed out, even the one billionaire onstage, Steyer, had come out against protecting billionaires.

As of now, Warren remains the best candidate the Democrats have, but she hasn’t closed the deal, and there are plausible alternatives. Talking heads at CNN and elsewhere relentlessly promoted last night’s debate as historic because it was the most presidential candidates ever on a debate stage. But only after a ruthless culling will the campaign finally begin in earnest and real history be made.

But what about Michael Bloomberg? He has begun to float the idea of entering the Democratic primary as a centrist option if Biden falters. Would he be a contender?

At 77, he would at last remedy a glaring shortcoming of the septuagenarian Democratic field by filling the age gap between Biden (76) and Sanders (78). And it would be highly gratifying to see a genuinely successful and accomplished New York billionaire go up against the fraud in the White House. He might drive Trump crazy — that is, crazier — and he could be self-financing to an extent.

The downside? Trump’s revenge, make no mistake about it, would be to further stoke anti-Semitism among his alt-right stormtroopers. And should either Buttigieg, Klobuchar, or Harris catch fire with Biden’s up-for-grabs constituency, a tardy Bloomberg candidacy would be fighting a two-front war against opponents both in the party’s center and on the left. If he really wants to get in when Biden falters, someone should tell him that that time has arrived."

In a surprise development that broke from its past precedent of limiting presidential debate fields to ten candidates on any one night, the Democratic National Committee has indicated that all 12 qualifiers for the next debate will on a single stage on October 15. Debate sponsor CNN had the story:

“To address several inquiries we have received we are writing to let you know that, pending a final decision after the certification deadline, it is the intention of the DNC and our media partners to hold the October debate over one night on Tuesday October 15th,” the DNC wrote in an email Friday morning.

The party’s fourth sanctioned primary debate will air live at 8 p.m. ET from the campus of Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, with CNN anchors Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooperand New York Times national editor Marc Lacey serving as moderators.

The October debate will include the ten September debaters (Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julián Castro, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O’Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Andrew Yang) plus two more recent qualifiers (Tulsi Gabbard and Tom Steyer). The qualifying window doesn’t end until Tuesday, October 1, but no other candidates are thought to be anywhere near making the combined polling and fundraising thresholds. It’s always possible some qualifiers will free up stage space by dropping out of the race before October 15, but it’s unlikely any will give up the free exposure and the long-shot possibility of a breakthrough performance that rallies the nation to her or his banner.

On the one hand, this means we can stop worrying about debate-night “draws” skewing the interaction by placing potentially colliding candidates on different nights. But there will be even more jockeying for time and attention than in earlier debates — and perhaps more clash since higher qualifying thresholds kick in for the November and subsequent debates.

Most excited by the one-night decision will be campaign operatives and journalists who won’t have to work really late on two consecutive weeknights. Here’s the viewing details for those who want to rev their engines and savor the anticipation:

The debate will air exclusively on CNN, CNN International, CNN en Español, and stream on CNN.com’s homepage and NYTimes.com’s homepage. In addition, the debate will be available across mobile devices via CNN’s and New York Times’ apps for iOS and Android, via CNNgo apps for Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Chromecast and Android TV, SiriusXM Channels 116, 454, 795, the Westwood One Radio Network and National Public Radio.

This is CNN’s second bite at the debate apple; it hosted the July debates as well.

Update, October 1: it’s official: the twelve candidate mentioned above are the qualifiers for the October 15 debate."

Tuesday night marks the fourth debate on the primary calendar — meaning there are only eight more to go in the Democratic primary race. Unlike last month’s debate, the event on October 15 expands the field, with 12 candidates onstage, including one new challenger.

What Time Is the Democratic Debate?

Hosted by Otterbein University near Columbus, Ohio, the festivities will start at 8 p.m. ET and drag on until 11 p.m.

What Channel has the Democratic Debate?

Co-hosted by CNN and the New York Times, the debate will be available for streaming — without requiring a cable-provider log-in — at CNN.com, the New York Times mobile app, and on Facebook.

What is the Democratic Debate Lineup?

The candidates will appear onstage, from left to right, as follows:

Tulsi Gabbard

Tom Steyer

Cory Booker

Kamala Harris

Bernie Sanders

Joe Biden

Elizabeth Warren

Pete Buttigieg

Andrew Yang

Beto O’Rourke

Amy Klobuchar

Julián Castro

Like last debate, Biden is flanked by the two progressives closest in the polls; unlike last debate, Warren has surpassed the former vice-president in at least one poll, making his front-runner status no longer unanimous.

How’d They Decide Who Made the Cut?

To qualify for the debate, the Democratic National Committee determined that Democrats had to receive contributions from a minimum of 130,000 donors and had to register at least 2 percent of support in four DNC-approved polls. Because the qualifications did not increase in difficulty between September and October, candidates had more time to reach the donation and polling requirements — thus, the inclusion of Tulsi Gabbard and billionaire impeachment enthusiast Tom Steyer.

Who Are the Moderators for the Democratic Debate?

CNN anchor Anderson Cooper, CNN anchor Erin Burnett, and New York Times national editor Mark Lacey.

The I-Word Looming Over the Debate

A drastic political change has occurred since the last debate: House Democrats are conducting an impeachment inquiry into the president’s quid pro quo pressuring of Ukraine to investigate the business dealings of the former vice-president’s son Hunter Biden. And though a potential impeachment proceeding could benefit Democrats in the long run — just over half of voters support the president’s removal, according to a recent Fox News poll — the scandal will be complicate the debate, as New York’s Ed Kilgore notes:

In talking about Trump and impeachment, the candidates vying to become his vanquisher in November 2020 are in the awkward position of discussing and promoting an event that would make their own competition wildly different if not irrelevant. What are they supposed to do? Boast of how they will tear Mike Pence a new one? Make the general election a referendum on why it took Republicans so long to abandon their corrupt leader? It’s a tough set of questions — again, for moderators as well as for debaters.

If any of the debaters … go after Hunter [Biden], his father could very well exploit the moment to depict himself as the victim of an infamous Trump smear, and also as the candidate Trump fears enough to risk impeachment to smear. Suffice it to say there is some nervous debate prep under way on the subject.

When Is the Next Democratic Debate?

Held on Wednesday, November 20, in Georgia and hosted by MSNBC, the threshold for the next debate went up, as candidates will have to clear 3 percent in at least four national polls — or polls in early-voting states Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina — in addition to 160,000 donors. Despite the raised admission point, the debate will still be packed: Candidates who have made the fifth debate thus far include Biden, Booker, Buttigieg, Harris, Sanders, Steyer, Warren, and Yang."

It’s been a weird week or so for the presidential campaign of U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard (D–Hawaii). She announced and then abandoned plans to boycott the Democratic-candidate debate in Ohio after denouncing it as the product of a DNC/“corporate media” plot to rig the nominating contest. At the debate itself, she didn’t get much attention other than some raised eyebrows for saying this (according to the Washington Post’s transcript):

I agree with Hillary Clinton on one thing, disagree with her on many others, but when she said abortion should be safe, legal, and rare, I think she’s correct.

Actually, although Clinton did use that language (famously deployed by her husband in 1992) in her 2008 campaign, she’d abandoned it by 2016 in response to a growing concern from reproductive-rights advocates that the “rare” part demonized women who wanted to have abortions, which were, after all, mostly legal. I don’t know whether this comment annoyed HRC, but in any event, she sure as hell unloaded on Gabbard a couple of days later, as Axios noted:

Hillary Clinton said on David Plouffe’s podcast, Campaign HQ, this week that Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D–Hawaii) is Russia’s “favorite” 2020 candidate and said the country could be “grooming” her to become a third-party candidate.

“I’m not making any predictions, but I think they’ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She’s the favorite of the Russians …”

Clinton didn’t finger Gabbard by name, but the odds are very high that she was talking about her. Gabbard certainly took it that way and fired back with a tweetstorm of near-Trumpian grandiosity:

Great! Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain. From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a ... — Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019

... powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose.



It’s now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don’t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly. — Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019

Sorry, Elizabeth Warren. Sorry, Joe Biden. Sorry, Bernie Sanders. Sorry, Mayor Pete and Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar and all the others: This primary is between me and you.

While it would most definitely enliven the Democratic race if Clinton leaped in, I would bet the farm I don’t have that, even in that incredibly unlikely event, the race would not wind up being a Clinton-Gabbard throwdown. Perhaps the Hawaiian will get some fresh lefty street cred for saying nasty things about HRC out loud that others have simply thought, though even Hillary haters don’t typically think of her as the “queen of warmongers.” But this is more likely just a bizarre incident in which one pol tossed off a random remark in a podcast and another happily rose to the bait, happy for the attention.

Besides, everybody knows the queen of warmongers is Cersei Lannister, not Hillary Rodham Clinton!"

You didn’t have to be clairvoyant to think that high-flying candidate Elizabeth Warren might have a bull’s-eye on her back in the fourth round of Democratic presidential candidate debates in Ohio Tuesday night. And for the most part she handled the newly intensified attention she received from moderators and rivals alike with her usual articulate and passionate debating skill. But on one point that has become a sort of hardy perennial of the debate series, she drew sustained fire and responded in a way that may draw mixed reviews.

After a preliminary round of questions in which all 12 candidates were able to comment on the impeachment proceedings against President Trump, Marc Lacey of the New York Times went right back to the well about middle-class taxes and Medicare for All:

LACEY: Senator Warren, we’ve proposed — you’ve proposed some sweeping plans, free public college, free universal childcare, eliminating most Americans’ college debt. And you’ve said how you’re going to pay for those plans. But you have not specified how you’re going to pay for the most expensive plan, Medicare for All. Will you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it, yes or no?

WARREN: So I have made clear what my principles are here, and that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down.

Lacey wasn’t about to let that go by him, so he asked again:

LACEY: Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he’s going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for All. You’ve endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it, too?

WARREN: So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.

As someone who very explicitly suggested Warren address skepticism about Medicare for All’s promises in just this way, I was impressed by this approach. But she unfortunately combined it with a refusal to answer Lacey’s specific question about taxes, so he invited Pete Buttigieg, who recently started running ads criticizing Warren and Sanders on this subject, to join in his demand:

LACEY: Mayor Buttigieg, you say Senator Warren has been, quote, “evasive” about how she’s going to pay for Medicare for All. What’s your response?

BUTTIGIEG: Well, we heard it tonight, a yes or no question that didn’t get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this.

Still Warren wouldn’t budge, and instead counterpunched by calling Buttigieg’s “Medicare for All Who Want It” proposal “Medicare for all who can afford it.” So Lacey impleaded Warren’s policy buddy, Bernie Sanders, into the argument:

At the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of people will save money on their health-care bills. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up significantly for the wealthy. And for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less — substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expansions.

BUTTIGIEG: Well, at least that’s a straightforward answer, but there’s a better way.

LACEY: Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up?

No, she wouldn’t. Lacey dragged in Amy Klobuchar and Joe Biden to beat up on Warren on the same point. Nevertheless, she persisted in ignoring the tax question and focusing on total health-care costs and the perfidy of the private health-care industry. Sanders tried to come to her rescue:

SANDERS: I get a little bit tired — I must say — of people defending a system which is dysfunctional, which is cruel, 87 million uninsured, 30,000 people dying every single year, 500,000 people going bankrupt for one reason, they came down with cancer.

I will tell you what the issue is here. The issue is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the health-care industry, which made $100 billion in profit, whether we have the guts to stand up to the corrupt, price-fixing pharmaceutical industry, which is charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.

Eventually Klobuchar let her off the hook by changing the subject to long-term care, and Buttigieg trained his fire elsewhere. And Warren returned to her generally effective talking points.

Clearly, debate moderators and Warren’s rivals think her refusal to say out loud that her health-care plans will require a tax hike for the middle class is a big deal. And just as clearly, Warren thinks it’s a red herring and that her overall position on health care and Medicare for All is more compelling than an isolated focus on how the government’s share of the costs will be financed.

We’ll see how it plays out in the media echo chamber over this debate. If in the next debate in November moderators come back to this question of Medicare for All and taxes, we’ll know that whatever the public thinks, the chattering classes believe they must hear Warren submit.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg debuted a new look at Tuesday’s primary debate: that of a moderate pugilist, a combative scold whose engagement with his opponents’ ideas ranged from derisive to dismissive. Adopting a tone that verged on snide, he assailed several of the more left-leaning candidates onstage. Beto O’Rourke’s mandatory assault-rifle buybacks proposal became a “shiny object” from a man Buttigieg “[didn’t] need lessons from … on courage, political or otherwise”; the details of Elizabeth Warren’s Medicare for All plan, marked by her insistence on discussing its funding in terms of costs rather than taxes, were obscured by her evasive responses to “a yes-or-no question that didn’t get a yes-or-no answer” — behavior, the mayor said, that encapsulates “why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular.”

As my colleague Gabriel Debenedetti wrote, it’s all part of a strategy to position Buttigieg to benefit if Joe Biden falters. With Warren and Bernie Sanders staking out the primary’s leftward flank, the mayor sees his best hope for securing the nomination — or at least catapulting himself into a higher polling tier — in drawing contrasts with them and projecting himself as a younger, more lucid, and less baggage-laden competitor for supporters of the former vice-president: liberal centrists and older black voters. It’s a risky gambit for two reasons. First, Buttigieg’s appeal derives largely from his mild-mannered charm and self-branding as an above-the-fray consensus-builder — both of which were undermined by his antagonistic behavior on Tuesday. But more crucially, it’s imperiled by his knack for thwarting his own efforts to build relationships with black voters, whose support he’ll need if he’s to seriously challenge Biden, Warren, Sanders, or even Kamala Harris.

The latest example occurred on Friday, when the Associated Press reported that the mayor was scheduled to attend a fundraiser co-hosted by Steve Patton. As head of Chicago’s law department under former mayor Rahm Emanuel, Patton was a key figure in the administration’s efforts to hide dashcam footage of Laquan McDonald’s killing from the public. The black 17-year-old was shot 16 times in 2014 by then–police officer Jason Van Dyke, who was later convicted of second-degree murder and aggravated battery and sentenced to nearly seven years in prison. Officers at the scene initially lied, saying that McDonald had lunged toward them with a knife. The Emanuel administration pushed to hide video that disputed their account until after the mayor won reelection — a decision made under Patton’s advisement. When reporters this week drew attention to Patton’s role in the cover-up, and that he’d made a max donation of $5,600 to Buttigieg’s campaign, Buttigieg and his staffers declined to comment, according to the AP. But as public pressure mounted on Friday morning, they abruptly removed Patton as a co-host and refunded his money. “Transparency and justice for Laquan McDonald is more important than a campaign contribution,” Chris Meagher, the Buttigieg campaign’s communications director, told Axios. “We are returning the money he contributed to the campaign and the money he has collected. He is no longer a co-host for the event and will not be attending.”

Buttigieg has criticized promises made by the Warren and Sanders campaigns to refuse high-dollar donations from corporate PACs and lobbyists. “My competitors can go with whatever strategy they like … we’re not going to beat [Trump] with pocket change,” he said earlier this week. But ongoing developments showcase the irony of this stance: Buttigieg has attracted less money in donations than either of them, and, until public pressure forced his hand, one of his donors was a central figure in a police shooting cover-up. All of which complicates a campaign that’s already weathered its share of racial controversy, particularly the questions surrounding Buttigieg’s firing of South Bend’s black police chief and the police shooting death of Eric Logan over the summer — both of which have drawn fiery criticism from black locals. The mayor’s efforts to make nice have come off, to some of them, as superficial and unconvincing. “You running for president and you expect black people to vote for you?” one woman asked as he addressed a march protesting Logan’s death in June. “I’m not asking for your vote,” Buttigieg replied. “You ain’t gonna get it either,” the woman said.

By several accounts, Buttigieg’s once-dismal support numbers among black voters in key primary states, most notably South Carolina, are trending upward, and his black outreach team insists that name recognition is his main barrier to improving them exponentially. But the abrupt tonal shifts displayed during Tuesday’s debate and his ill-advised association with Steve Patton — paired with his initial decision not to comment when Patton’s role in the Laquan McDonald case was brought to his attention, and only parting ways with him once public pressure made their relationship untenable — risk creating even more barriers to his efforts to amass black support than his troubles in South Bend had already created. Perhaps more troubling, his newly combative attitude and derision toward progressive positions for which he once professed unequivocal support suggest the kind of boring careerism that fuels the very problems on Capitol Hill that he claims to want to solve. Last-minute efforts to mend the rifts he’s caused with black voters are unlikely to save his campaign. But they do illustrate why his path into Biden supporters’ hearts is rockier than he might have estimated."

Trump’s online provocateurs on Monday portrayed the parody video’s viral distribution as a victory — and a reason to create more like it.

Some pro-Trump supporters wrote online that they were giddy that the violent video had been shared en masse, including by journalists, whose revulsion they have claimed as a badge of honor. Others said they were emboldened by the impact the video had made and would continue pushing the boundaries in future memes. One pro-Trump user early Monday tweeted that the furious reaction to the video “is why the meme was made.”

“These new memes are the 21st century version of political cartoons. Get f---ed you p---ies,” the user AllesErdreich wrote Monday on the pro-Trump Reddit forum The_Donald. The user said the media was seeking to “cry and manipulate … zombies into clutching their pearls at the thought of (nonexistent) fascistic violence towards the free press. They do this because they realize they are losing control to independent content creators on the internet.”

Becca Lewis, who researches online subcultures and media manipulation for Stanford University and the think tank Data & Society, said the video’s sharing showed how such memes have become a potent force for political expression and propaganda. The meme creators, she said, routinely sought mainstream attention for the memes in a way that would make the shocking content seem more and more acceptable.

“The attention economy makes it so that whoever is interested in promoting the most shocking stuff ends up getting a tailor-made news cycle for themselves,” Lewis said. “The mainstream media gets shocked and disgusted and therefore posts the video, but that in turn gives more viewership to the video. And there’s nothing the meme creators want more than to shock and disgust the mainstream media.""

The incendiary video was aired at a conference held by the pro-Trump group American Priority at Trump’s golf resort in Doral, Fla., a Miami suburb, and was first reported by the New York Times. American Priority distanced itself from the video in a statement appended to its website publicizing what it called a three-day festival.

“This video was not approved, seen or sanctioned by the #AMPFest19 organizers,” the statement said, adding that organizers were not aware of the video until they were contacted by the Times. The statement claimed authorized sessions included one denouncing political violence.

In the video, a man dressed in a suit, with Trump’s head superimposed on the body, embarks on a bloody rampage in a church, targeting occupants labeled with the logos of media organizations, including The Washington Post; lawmakers including Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.); Republicans John McCain and Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah); and others including an image labeled “Black Lives Matter.” The assault was taken from a scene of a graphic brawl in the 2014 action movie “Kingsman: The Secret Service.”

The news drew widespread criticism, including from Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke, who warned in a tweet it “will get people killed.""

AD

Democratic lawmakers also sharply rebuked the White House. Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (N.J.), who leads the House’s top tech-focused committee, described the video as “abhorrent,” criticizing Trump for having “promoted extremist voices” in a bid to boost his presidency. Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), meanwhile, fretted the incident was “disturbing, but frankly not surprising.""

“From the beginning, Mr. Trump has cultivated support from some of the worst corners of the internet. He’s used his office to elevate this toxic internet culture while ignoring the real challenges we face on social media,” Warner said in a statement.

Reacting early Monday, Stephanie Grisham, the president’s press secretary, said Trump “has not yet seen the video,” and would watch later, “but based upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns this video.""

At least one of the pro-Trump firebrands tied to the videos attended a “social media summit” hosted by the White House in July, where Trump previously had lauded their efforts and attacked social media companies for allegedly censoring conservatives. The event sparked fresh fears that the White House was endorsing their controversial online tactics ahead of the 2020 election.

The church-shooting video has been viewable since July 2018 on the YouTube account of TheGeekzTeam, whose subscriber count rose 1,000 on Monday to 19,000. The account, which says it is “dedicated to pissing off liberals,” includes more than two dozen videos celebrating Trump and tearing down his opponents. Its most recent, in August, is a spoof of the action movie “John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum,” and shows Trump shooting up Sanders, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Andrew Yang.

TheGeekzTeam is one of several contributors to MemeWorld, a pro-Trump meme site created by a far-right Internet personality who calls himself Carpe Donktum but whose real name is Logan Cook. The self-described “memesmith” attended the White House social media summit in July and met personally with Trump, who called him a “genius.”

“Trump is absolutely engaging the darkest sides of some of the most extreme people in this country right now,” said Dipayan Ghosh, co-director of the Digital Platforms & Democracy Project and Shorenstein fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, and a former policy adviser to the Obama administration.

“He himself posted a video with similar themes two years ago. Meanwhile he’s not challenged the extreme views of many of the far-right,” Ghosh added. “The fact that he cannot come out and make a strident statement against violence and this kind of behavior is absolutely shocking and not appropriate for the president of the country.""

Pro-Trump meme creators defended the video as a political parody, and said the online fury over its screening at the Trump resort was overwrought because it had been played in the corner of a room away from the main conference events. In its statement, American Priority called the video “unauthorized” and noted it had been shown in a side room, and not from the event’s main stage.

A festival schedule advertised a “MAGA Comedy Night,” a VIP yacht party, and speeches and meet-and-greets with Donald Trump Jr., Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders. Attendees could participate in sessions titled “Memetics,” “Crushing Social Media Distortion and Dishonesty,” “To War With Words” and “Social Media Messages that Work.”

Several Trump backers laughed off the argument that the meme and videos like it could incite violence. Carpe Donktum, the Kansas man who has previously requested his full name not be used because he fears online or in-person harassment, tweeted a number of memes early Monday morning satirizing the argument, including one from “Star Wars” in which a Death Star labeled “Memes” blows up a planet labeled “Mainstream Media.” “This is an incitement of violence. Please do not share,” he wrote. It’s been viewed more than 50,000 times.

In a statement, Carpe Donktum said the video was “CLEARLY satirical” and that “no reasonable person would believe that this video was a call to action, or an endorsement of violence towards the media.""

“This attack is yet another example of the Mainstream Media’s hypocrisy,” he wrote. “The MSM could not find any controversy within the conference itself, so they have manufactured this outrage campaign to discredit its success.”

TheGeekzTeam did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Monday, TheGeekzTeam’s Twitter account, which calls itself a home for “spicy Trump memes,” posted a meme showing “Trump Memes” causing CNN to explode.

YouTube, which is owned by Google, added a restriction to the pro-Trump meme video Monday that forced viewers to confirm that they were an adult before viewing. “For content containing violence that is clearly fictional, we age-restrict and display a warning interstitial. We applied these protections to this video,” said Ivy Choi, a spokeswoman for YouTube.

Twitter did not respond to a request for comment. On Monday afternoon, Carpe Donktum’s Twitter account was briefly suspended for, he said, violating the social media site’s copyright rules with another video. But he was quickly reinstated.

For these sites and others, the incendiary posts, tweets, photos and videos by Trump’s online allies have proved to be a vexing political and policy challenge. On one hand, the content could violate each of the sites’ policies, raising fresh questions as to whether Google and Twitter have taken sufficient steps to ensure their services don’t become conduits for real-world violence. At the same time, these tech giants often face criticism for going too far, particularly from Trump and his peers who claim that Silicon Valley is biased against conservatives.

The president even convened the social media summit in July to take aim at sites including Facebook, Google and Twitter, while rallying some of his most fervent online supporters ahead of the 2020 election. Among the roughly 200 conservatives in the room were some of the Web’s most controversial provocateurs who have shared doctored videos and spread conspiracy theories about Trump’s opponents.

“Some of you are extraordinary. The crap you think of is unbelievable,” Trump said.

Pro-Trump meme creators have routinely built dark parodies and shareable memes from Hollywood films, superimposing the faces of journalists they dislike and the logos of media organizations onto characters getting beaten up or humiliated by a mighty Trump character.

Carpe Donktum’s memes, which have often been widely boosted by Trump supporters on sites such as Reddit and Twitter, include one in which he animated former vice president Joe Biden’s apology video to show the candidate caressing his own shoulders.

“Where is the genius? I want to meet the genius,” Trump said to Carpe Donktum as the men entered the Oval Office, according to the recollection of another pro-Trump meme creator called @mad_liberals, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of fear of harassment."

Most of the 12 debaters who will be on the stage in Ohio on Tuesday (a dozen, now that Tulsi Gabbard announced she will not go through with her threat to boycott the event as part of a DNC–media scheme to “rig” the nomination contest) are familiar figures to those who tune in regularly to these spectacles. Ten of them have been in all three previous debates, and Gabbard missed the September stage. But now, voters will see someone who might be a new face: Tom Steyer.

The billionaire activist will make his debut at the fourth debate, after his strategy of heavy spending in early states whose polls help candidates qualify for these events paid off. Steyer has rarely earned more than one percent in national polls of the 2020 field. But his polling average (according to RealClearPolitics) is at 2.3 percent in Iowa, 2 percent in New Hampshire, 3.5 percent in Nevada and 3 percent in South Carolina. (Interestingly enough, he barely registers support in his current home state of California, despite his conspicuous involvement, mostly as a big donor, in the progressive politics of the Golden State for years.) The debate is a great opportunity for him to expand his national profile after a late start, but how will he use that opportunity?

Presumably he will try to introduce himself to voters in places that haven’t seen his campaign ads or his earlier spots promoting impeachment of Trump long before that became a majority position among Democratic pols. He could tout his leadership on that issue, though it’s no longer controversial in his party (the entire presidential field has now endorsed impeachment proceedings). Or he could talk about his pre-impeachment focus on promoting climate-change activism (one observer called him “the green-minded answer to the conservative Koch brothers”) even though that might open him up to questions about the fossil-fuel investments made by the hedge-fund enterprise that earned him his fortune. But mostly you can expect him to exploit his position as one of the only two non-politicians on the stage (the other is Andrew Yang) to push his progressive version of Trump’s own populist-outsider-too-rich-to-be-bought message. The New York Times noted the central paradox of Steyer’s campaign in late August:

Running as something of a patrician populist, Mr. Steyer brushed aside the dissonance of someone with his résumé — Exeter, Yale, Stanford, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs — paying for ads that castigate the influence of “the powerful and well-connected.”

“I am the outsider in this race,” Mr. Steyer said in an interview. He described Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont as “part of the establishment” and asked whether the front-runner in the polls, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., really understood what this moment called for.

“The question really is for anybody running, including Vice President Biden, are you aware of how much has to change?” Mr. Steyer said, outlining a two-pronged agenda that would begin with rule changes to curb corporate power followed by significant action to address climate change.

This sort of talk might attract some fire from candidates like Warren and Sanders if they deign to pay much attention to Steyer during the debate. And rivals and moderators alike could bring up the common complaints that Steyer basically bought his spot on the stage with all that early-state spending, and that the $100 million he has pledged to pony up for his campaign would be better invested in down-ballot candidates or get-out-the-vote efforts.

It’s unclear what sort of personal impression Steyer will make with viewers. He is, after all, another older (62) straight white male who doesn’t have the sort of biography that lends itself to Democratic political audiences. He is religiously observant (an Episcopalian like Pete Buttigieg, the most conspicuous churchgoer in the field), and doesn’t seem to have typical rich-guy vices or outlandish tastes. CalMatters summed up his personal style succinctly:

Steyer is a bit of a contradiction himself. In the mold of Warren Buffet, he is famously restrained in his spending habits (to a point). His sartorial style could be described as “Boomer dad”: He regularly wears the same tartan tie and a colorful beaded belt he bought on a trip to Kenya. He flies commercial, for environmental reasons. Speaking to CalMatters over the phone from Iowa, he recalls meeting a “slick-as-could-be” energy lobbyist a few years back who was wearing a “$5,000 suit.” As if Steyer couldn’t drop ten times that on a new outfit every morning for the rest of his life.

Like Buffett, Steyer also has pledged to give away at least half of his wealth before he dies.

So Steyer is a paradoxical man running on a paradoxical platform. No matter how he does in his first debate, he probably isn’t going anywhere soon. He’s already qualified for the next debate in November. He obviously doesn’t need to worry about running out of money (he managed to raise $2 million from other people in the third quarter of this year). And as a hypersuccessful investment manager, he probably won’t be willing to write off the dough he’s already dropped in the early states until voters vote.

Get used to seeing him and hearing this self-styled billionaire scourge of the billionaires."

Read more about Sanders, find out where he stands on key issues and see how much money his campaign has rai…",2019-10-17,The Washington Post,Bernie Sanders,https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/candidates/bernie-sanders/,"Sanders has consistently polled among the top three candidates in the 2020 Democratic race by relying on the same grassroots energy and small donors that powered his bid for the 2016 nomination. An independent, Sanders has represented Vermont in the Senate since 2007 after serving in the House and as mayor of Burlington, Vt. In October, Sanders, 78, was hospitalized after having a heart attack .

The longtime U.S. senator from Vermont is a political independent who caucuses with the Democrats. He began his second presidential bid with the same message that has defined his political career: As economic inequality plagues the nation, the federal government must harness its power to redistribute wealth. Sanders has been a major force in moving the Democratic Party to the left -- shaping the debate about Medicare-for-all , a $15-an-hour minimum wage and free tuition at public colleges. But unlike in 2016, other Democratic contenders mirror his progressivism and threaten his hold on the left wing of the party.

Climate change Sanders released an ambitious Green New Deal climate plan, which declares climate change a national emergency and requires that the United States cease fossil fuel use by 2050. He has previously sponsored legislation to impose a carbon tax, although he now says that such action would have to be “part of a larger strategy” to move the economy away from fossil fuels. An early supporter of the Green New Deal in Congress, Sanders has allocated significantly more resources toward fighting climate change than fellow 2020 candidates — placing a $16.3 trillion price on his plan. He has said that his plan would “pay for itself” over 15 years and that it would generate 20 million jobs during that period. See all candidates

Education The senator has elevated higher-education affordability as a national political issue since he campaigned in 2016 on providing free college tuition to all U.S. residents. In June, Sanders added to his education policy package when he announced a plan to forgive $1.6 trillion in existing student loans — an extension of a policy that Warren introduced. Some worry that Sanders’s proposals would offer too much assistance to wealthy families, but his campaign contends that its plan would best address the “full scope of the problem.” Sanders’s education package also includes the Thurgood Marshall Plan for Public Education, which would significantly increase funding for schools in high-poverty areas. See all candidates

Foreign policy Sanders faced criticism during his last presidential bid for his lack of experience with foreign policy, but he has since developed expertise and messaging around issues abroad. The senator has focused on Yemen, where the United States is involved in a bloody war that has devastated the region. In 2018, Sanders led bipartisan efforts to end U.S. support for the Saudi regime — culminating in a resolution that passed the House and the Senate but was vetoed by President Trump. Sanders has celebrated diplomacy and foreign aid and spoke about the United States’ responsibility to support humanity worldwide. “A sensible and effective foreign policy recognizes that our safety and welfare is bound up with the safety and welfare of others around the world,” he said in a foreign policy speech in September 2017 at Westminster College in Fulton, Mo. See all candidates

Government A believer in structural reform, Sanders has called to abolish the electoral college and has said he wants to overhaul the Senate filibuster. “I believe in filibuster reform and making it much harder for any one senator to bring the Senate to a halt,” he told The Washington Post. Sanders has sponsored legislation on voter reforms such as automatic registration and making Election Day a national holiday. Instead of adding justices to the Supreme Court, as some 2020 presidential candidates have proposed, Sanders has suggested “rotating judges to the appeals court” to allow for “new blood” in the highest chamber. See all candidates

Health care Sanders is known for his commitment to Medicare-for-all, a single-payer health-care plan that has gained traction with other liberal Democrats. His plan would cover all U.S. residents, including undocumented immigrants, and would eliminate private insurance altogether within four years. Critics of the proposal say that it would cost too much and that it would lead to an increase in taxes that could cripple the middle class. Sanders tried to combat these concerns in October, releasing a proposal that would introduce a new wealth tax on those earning $32 million or more. His plan mirrors Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s signature wealth tax proposal but would raise more money by imposing higher taxes on a broader set of earners. See all candidates"

Ben: Pete Buttigieg has long been quite strong in Iowa polling, and a new survey out today continues that trend — according to USA Today–Suffolk, he’s within striking distance of Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, with 13 percent, five points from Biden’s lead, though 29 percent of caucusgoers say they’re undecided. With the likelihood that he’ll do well — maybe very well — in Iowa growing, but with his lack of traction among black voters showing few signs of improving, does he have a legitimate path to winning the Democratic nomination?

Ed: Yeah, though it’s a narrow one with a lot of factors beyond his control.

Sarah: I’m not willing to discount him completely, but while it’s possible that he has a path, realistically it’s a difficult one.

Ed: The path I discern involves Biden beginning to struggle (which we’ve all been waiting for throughout the invisible primary season) at the same time Buttigieg is killing off all those other Biden-alternative candidacies in Iowa. The latter looks entirely possible; not sure Beto, Booker, Harris, or Klobuchar are going to get out of Iowa alive. If Biden really declines quickly, you could have a weird Buttigieg-Warren-Sanders fight pretty early, and none of them exactly has a corner on minority voters (though Bernie’s doing better this year than he did early on in 2016). I’d put my money on Warren in that scenario, but Pete would have a chance.

Ben: Buttigieg is clearly trying to position himself as the moderate alternative to Biden, as Ed said. At the last debate, he was aggressive in his criticism of Elizabeth Warren’s fuzziness on how to pay for Medicare for All. In the process, he seems to have turned off some progressives, who were already suspicious of him. A report today that Mark Zuckerberg gave him recommendations on political hires has only furthered the impression on the left that he can’t be trusted to tackle the issues they care about. Buttigieg seems to be betting that he does not need this bloc of voters in his corner — is that a good bet from a political standpoint?

Sarah: He needs them to win the primary, at least, so no, I don’t think it’s a good bet. I also think it’s important to understand exactly why left voters object to his closeness with Zuckerberg — it’s not all due to their belief that Facebook is a monopoly that should be broken up. It’s business as usual. People who wouldn’t call themselves socialists or even liberals are tired of it. Buttigieg is close to CEOs right when public opinion seems to have shifted firmly against corporate America and in favor of policies like a wealth tax, which target executives like Zuckerberg. It’s potentially a weakness for him with the very working-class voters he says the Democratic Party needs to recruit.

Ed: Yeah, I don’t really understand why Pete would want to associate himself with Zuckerberg, and if I were him, I’d try to be the Non-Corporate Moderate in the race. He can raise money without relying on Wall Street and Silicon Valley. I’ve even been willing to argue that to some extent Buttigieg might be able to pull off a sort of centrism-plus-identity appeal like the last two Democratic presidential nominees, though obviously, there aren’t as many LGBTQ Democratic primary voters as there are feminists or African-Americans. But this is a bad moment to be Mr. Wall Street.

Ben: One thing that has distinguished his candidacy, though — especially considering what a long shot he was at the start — is how much money he’s brought in. He’s got an impressive campaign war chest, with a lot of money coming from small donors, but a lot also coming from the kind of corporate interests Warren and Bernie Sanders have shunned. The cash has allowed him to mount a major campaign apparatus in Iowa, including running TV ads, and it seems to be making a mark. Do voters who like his articulateness and what they see as pragmatism care so much about this aspect of the campaign that shutting off the spigot to Silicon Valley and Wall Street would be worth it?

Sarah: Maybe not in Iowa, but elsewhere, maybe? I think we put too much stock in Iowa, generally.

Ben: It is true that there’s quite a history of people winning it, then not going on to sustain the momentum.

Sarah: All I’d say is that Clinton’s own identity-plus-centrism appeal to voters did not work out well for her in the general, and I think it’s fair to blame that failure in part on the public’s perception of her as a moneyed elitist.

Ed: You may be right, but we will all argue until the end of time about which of Clinton’s problems was most important. And look, I am about as credentialed a career centrist as anyone you will meet, but while I don’t think it has any general-election magic associated with it any more, you can make a good case that Democratic primary voters still feel that way.

As for Iowa, as I noted earlier, its influence depends on who does and doesn’t survive it. It very nearly knocked HRC right out of the 2008 race; if she hadn’t pulled off the N.H. upset five days later, it would have.

Ben: One thing we haven’t heard much about Buttigieg is his suitability in a general election. Biden’s perceived strength against Trump is one of his campaign’s central planks, and Sanders and Warren have arguments on their side, too — that they’ll spur enthusiasm among the young and/or among people who are usually not that politically engaged. Does Buttigieg have a particular electability argument one way or the other? He is very young and also gay, which would be a first for a presidential nominee. Do you have any sense of how those factors would play out if he were to win?

Sarah: It’s really hard to say. I’m sure he’s banking on centrism as a way to win over white working-class voters, but again, that didn’t work out for Clinton, and I don’t think it will necessarily work out for anyone else.

Ed: I certainly don’t have the imagination to quite envision a general-election contest between someone as articulate as Buttigieg and the troglodyte in the White House. I do worry that despite all the “Trump proves you don’t need a résumé” talk, Pete’s tenure as mayor of a small city is a problem, particularly since about all we know of it is his struggle with police-minority relations.

One small asset Buttigieg has in a general election — and it could be more important in the primaries — is that he’s a voice for religiously observant, white mainline Protestants, who, ironically, given their cultural dominance for much of American history, have all but vanished from public discourse in the battle between Evangelicals and the religiously unaffiliated.

Sarah: So was Clinton, arguably.

Ed: She hardly ever talked about it, though, much like Warren, who has a similar background. Pete does talk about it, a lot. Again, I wouldn’t overestimate this as an asset for Buttigieg, but it’s real.

Ben: Given his polling, fundraising, and attention surge, would you still call him a long shot at this point?

Sarah: Yeah, I do think that’s fair to say. I think he’s really running to be vice-president at this point.

Ed: You know, that was probably true earlier, and may be true again soon enough, but he does have an opening right now if he’s both skillful and very lucky. The key variable remains Biden. A lot of us fear Uncle Joe won’t fully exhibit the weakness we perceive in him until he’s the nominee."

Sen. Kamala Harris, a California Democrat, urged Twitter to suspend President Donald Trump’s account for violating the service’s rules, while Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri is battling what he considers tech companies’ bias against conservatives. Hawley has also told Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg that he should sell off WhatsApp and Instagram.

The companies are trying to maintain a neutral stance, even if that draws the ire of politicians as divergent as the president and those trying to impeach him. Behind the scenes, though, they are spending millions on lobbying in hopes of warding off breakups or intrusive regulation.

Not that there is any danger of either happening any time soon, especially with an ongoing impeachment probe. Still, talking up Big Tech’s problems has proven to be popular political rhetoric.

When it comes to policing content, social media services are “caught between a rock and a hard place,” said Andrew Guess, a Princeton University political scientist who studies social media and its effects on political opinion.

AD

Blocking or suspending accounts for hate speech can prompt complaints of political bias or censorship, but a hands-off approach may be viewed as a free pass to politicians like Trump.

AD

“Anything they do is going to attract criticism,” Guess said. “That, of course, makes them a target.”

Beyond discourse and privacy, antitrust concerns have emerged as a major concern for lawmakers and candidates. This wasn’t the case in 2016, when grumbling about the outsized power of tech was largely confined to activists and those on the most liberal end of the spectrum.

Leading the pack has been Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate who in March proposed breaking up big tech companies. She garnered immediate support, even from rivals such as Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican who retweeted Warren for what he said was the first time. Cruz said “she’s right — Big Tech has way too much power to silence Free Speech.”

AD

Since then, calling out the tech behemoths and other big corporations has been a pillar of Warren’s presidential campaign. Sen. Bernie Sanders, another leading Democratic candidate, has also said breaking up Amazon, Google and Apple is “something we should definitely take a look at.”

AD

Still, while there have been congressional hearings, investigations and fines, including a record $5 billion against Facebook, little has changed for Big Tech.

A Republican-controlled Senate is unlikely to pass legislation that seems too anti-business. That includes breaking up tech companies seen as too monopolistic. The same likely goes for any privacy law that restricts companies’ ability to target ads to their liking.

AD

While the two parties agree that Big Tech has problems, they often differ on what those problems are — and how to fix them. You won’t find many Democrats complaining about tech’s perceived conservative bias, for instance. Nor will you find many conservatives complaining of algorithmic bias against people of color.

Trump has been uneven in his criticisms. Amazon has been a frequent target, though that is due in part to CEO Jeff Bezos’s ownership of The Washington Post. He’s met with Zuckerberg privately, but he’s also tweeted that “Facebook was always anti-Trump” and accused it of colluding with the news media against him.

AD

Amid all this, at least in public, the companies have mostly kept a low profile. But there are occasional glimpses of behind-the-scenes activity. Leaked audio from an internal Facebook meeting in July captured Zuckerberg acknowledging that if “someone like” Warren is elected, he expects Facebook to fight back — and prevail — against efforts to break it up in court. But he added: “And does that still suck for us? Yeah.”

AD

Amazon, by contrast, briefly tried to debate the candidates on Twitter.

In April, after Warren complained that Amazon and other big tech companies have “too much power,” the company responded by pointing the finger at its main rival: “Walmart is much larger; Amazon is less than 4% of U.S. retail.”

When Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in a TV interview in June that Amazon pays workers “starvation wages,” the company tweeted that she “is just wrong.”

AD

And Amazon gave former Vice President Joe Biden a corporate tax lesson after he tweeted that it shouldn’t be paying a “lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers.”

“We pay every penny we owe,” Amazon tweeted back. “Congress designed tax laws to encourage companies to reinvest in the American economy. We have.”

AD

This was in June. Amazon seems to have backed off since.

Expect the political pushback to continue, from both parties, said Joshua Tucker, co-director of New York University’s Social Media and Political Participation Lab.

“It’s a bipartisan issue,” he said. “But the right and the left are criticizing it for different reasons.”

The past decade has been a crash course in the limits of political “firsts.” Barack Obama, the first black president of the United States, cast himself as the personification of hope, a balm for a nation scarred by racism. He was convincing because he believed it himself: His faith in the fundamental goodwill of most white Americans and understanding that, for many black ones, he heralded a degree of power few thought they’d see wielded by one of their own, made his vision of a future marked by unprecedented national unity hard to resist. But short of realizing it, he was thwarted by a racist opposition and his own inclination to engage it in good faith. Perhaps worse, he was a president like most others where it counted the most: too invested in preserving his country’s global military might, rigidly enforced borders, and ballooning wealth to implement radical solutions to its ills.

By the 2016 presidential election, the merits of such a first — on its own terms — had become less evident. Bernie Sanders articulated this skepticism after Hillary Clinton’s loss. “It’s not good enough for someone to say, ‘I’m a woman! Vote for me!’” he said, weeks after the election. “What we need is a woman who has the guts to stand up to Wall Street, to the insurance companies, to the drug companies, to the fossil-fuel industry.” The term “identity politics” — devised originally by black feminists to describe how broader liberation derived naturally from uplifting the most oppressed — was recast as a pejorative, used to describe liberals who privileged the optics of diversity over the practice of justice, on the one hand, and on the other to decry a politics that didn’t indulge white people enough. Sanders was making a case for the former. But both spelled electoral ruin for Democrats if permitted to thrive, many argued.

Despite this, naught but plaudits has greeted the election on Tuesday of Steven Reed, the first black mayor-elect of Montgomery, Alabama. Reed has no governing experience to predict how he’ll perform: He was previously a probate judge, and time will tell whether his verbal commitments to addressing poverty by eliminating food deserts and improving water quality come to pass. There’s vast opportunity for him to affirm the warranted misgivings of anyone who argues that a brown face adorning standard Democratic orthodoxy — cultural liberalism paired with a zeal for privatization and a barely fettered free market — does little to solve any kind of inequality. But its historic nature aside, which should not be discounted, Reed’s brand of first still serves what should be an integral part of any progressive agenda.

First, if racial justice is to be a cornerstone of any political movement, its longest-serving champions should be heard. And there are few cities where they can be found more readily than in Montgomery, which in the course of a century evolved from the first capitol of the Confederacy to the cradle of the civil-rights movement. The bus boycotts organized by local activists in 1955 and 1956 — and marked by the arrests of Claudette Colvin and Rosa Parks and the neophyte leadership of Martin Luther King, Jr. — were a citywide effort, enabled not just by protesters who agitated in the streets, but by an entire black populace that refused to ride public transit and helped each other by arranging carpools, undercharging each other for cab rides, and raising money for shoes to replace those worn thin by increased walking. Participants and their descendants, biological and ideological, still abide in the city in large numbers: Montgomery is 60 percent black, backed Reed’s election at a 67 percent clip among voters, and houses the headquarters for the Equal Justice Initiative, the premiere capital defense firm in the South, and the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, billed as the first memorial to the victims of American lynchings.

The import of Reed’s victory isn’t lost on many of them — if largely because it suggests their work isn’t futile, and charts a new avenue of possibility for a community confined to the margins of influence and opportunity and the miseries that mark both for too long. “I am a lifelong resident of Montgomery,” resident Janay Smith told CNN. “My family, I come from maybe about four generations of activists and community leaders. Many of those who came before me are now deceased and didn’t get a chance to see this. But I’m so proud of my city … My city, little bitty Montgomery, Alabama, a place known for racial tension actually came together and did something positive and historic.” An energized base is better equipped to facilitate progressive change than a demoralized one. Black political leadership hasn’t always implemented the policies most amenable to fighting inequality and white supremacy. But it widens the spectrum of what’s presumed possible.

This may seem cosmetic until its broader implications become clear. Georgia seemed doomed to endure Republican leadership in perpetuity until Stacey Abrams came closer to winning the governor’s mansion than any Democrat in decades. She ran on an agenda as far to the left as any of her national counterparts, a platform that included robust investments in green energy and expanded health care. But her approach was largely demographic, geared toward turning out nonwhite, poor, and low-frequency voters. She almost single-handedly put Georgia in play for rescue from the maw of reactionary rule. And she would’ve been the first black and first woman governor in the state’s history. Even having lost, she’s encouraged a surge of progressive political activity, suggesting that firsts often have a compounding effect that prompts others. The potential benefits of the unknown are just that.

This is especially true for Reed, whose lack of experience both invites skepticism and shields him from the resistance that might hound a first whose record is better known and more suspect in its progressive bona fides. He’ll have to prove himself, but in the meantime, firsts like his also prompt other strategic boons to materialize, most notably a delineation of the stakes of governing, forcing the opposition to show its hand. This goes for enemies as well as putative allies: Racism for some might still be understood as an undercurrent in national politics had Obama’s presidency not coaxed it out and laid bare its electoral salience, leading to the empowerment of the Tea Party and the election of Donald Trump. Firsts can also be a barometer for one’s commitment to equity in leadership. Even a mainstream movement for justice that doesn’t entrust power to the communities it most impacts risks becoming little more than a front for paternalism. These are both true even if Reed’s politics disappoint. An integral part of progressivism is discarding what doesn’t work, but it does itself few favors by deriding what does. A black first in Montgomery marks the toppling of a regime however you slice it, a turning point for a black population that was integral in making black American political power possible at all. It’s no guarantee, but it’s a first that’s rich with the capacity to beget others, for the better. That’s why Steven Reed matters."

It’s been an unsettling few weeks for the Joe Biden campaign. As recently as last month, his people were describing a strategy for the nomination contest in which the former veep, with his universal name ID and relatively broad base of voters and donors, would outlast multiple candidates in a “dogfight” that wouldn’t really sort itself out until well down the road. But in the wake of Elizabeth Warren’s polling surge, particularly in the early states, along with a weakening of Biden’s position, the spin from his campaign has subtly shifted, as reflected in this report from Politico:

Joe Biden’s campaign is ramping up its investment in the Super Tuesday states, anticipating a Democratic race that narrows to two candidates by early March.

The increase in staffing across the 14 states that will vote March 3 comes as Biden’s polling numbers have declined and Elizabeth Warren’s have surged, particularly in states like Iowa and New Hampshire, where she’s heavily invested in field organization …

[I]n the event of weaker-than-expected performances, a built-out Super Tuesday organization would provide a fail-safe for Biden.

Many of the states on the Super Tuesday map — which includes a handful of Southern and Border states — play to his strengths among African-Americans and more-moderate Democrats.

What this really means is that Team Biden is afraid he’s going to get skunked by Warren in the early states (or at least in three of them; he’s still doing well in South Carolina). Unsurprisingly, its story is that the real fight will begin later, once it has all boiled down to a two-candidate race centered in states where Warren’s upscale white lefty base isn’t as dominant. So don’t look at Biden’s falling poll numbers in Iowa or New Hampshire as meaning much; it’s all just an elimination contest in which Biden has a bye and a ticket to the finals.

This makes some sense, although it’s also reminiscent of what we’ve heard over the years from failed candidates who tried to stage a “comeback” or build a “firewall” after losing early. This dates to the beginning of the modern primary-dominated Democratic nominating contest, with an “ABM” (Anybody But McGovern) rallying cry in 1972 and an “ABC” (Anybody But Carter) effort in 1976 and 1980. There was similar talk on the Republican side in 2016, when someone was forever going to beat Donald Trump in the late going. Truth is, particularly for Democrats, a win in Iowa or New Hampshire has been a condition precedent for recent nomination wins, with the asterisked exception of Bill Clinton ’92, who didn’t really compete in Iowa because favorite son Tom Harkin took the state right off the table.

It is also true that Biden is particularly ill suited for Iowa and New Hampshire, states with strong progressive activist traditions and few of the African-Americans so central to his coalition. But the strategic questions for him are (1) whether the early states produce a competitor for him among party moderates and/or minority voters, and (2) whether early wins blow up someone like Warren into a world-beater who simply cannot be stopped.

So far, Biden has been very lucky that no other “moderate” or black candidate has gotten a lot of traction. Kamala Harris, who showed some potential to appeal both to white moderates and to fellow minorities, is increasingly being perceived as a Democratic Marco Rubio — all potential but no performance. Cory Booker is down in the low single digits everywhere. Pete Buttigieg has raised a lot of money and built some buzz but, unlike other white candidates, seems to have a real problem with black voters. Amy Klobuchar’s proximity to Iowa and excellent electoral history haven’t lifted her into contention. Beto O’Rourke is lucky to still be in the race, and Andrew Yang is sui generis and not yet demonstrating any path to the nomination.

But Biden’s biggest fear is that if Warren wins the first two contests, she could become unstoppable, as has every other candidate who won both Iowa and New Hampshire. The biggest Super Tuesday (March 3) state is California, where early voting will begin the day of the Iowa Caucuses. A new, high-quality PPIC poll from the Golden State shows Warren taking a narrow lead there. In the next-largest Super Tuesday state, Texas, Warren moved into second place in a mid-September Quinnipiac poll, in which she trailed Biden by a less-than-formidable ten points. If Team Biden is right and candidates like Bernie Sanders and O’Rourke fade early on, there’s no particular reason Warren might not gain even more ground there. Yes, there are an array of southern states voting on March 3 (Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia) where Biden’s strength among white moderates and African-Americans will make him the early favorite. But Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Utah, Vermont, and Warren’s own Massachusetts also vote that day. The latest high-quality national Monmouth poll shows Warren with an identical three-point lead over Biden in both the early and later states

And while Warren does need to expand her support among minority voters (much as Sanders did in 2016), she’s already making progress. The aforementioned Monmouth poll shows her attracting 20 percent of minority voters nationally, eight points behind Biden. Assuming she wins in Iowa and New Hampshire and gets the usual short-term “bounce,” such Biden margins could disappear.

None of this peril for Biden takes into account the impact of impeachment proceedings, which is hard to predict. Biden could attract some sympathy from Democratic voters as the victim of Trump’s impeachable efforts to get a foreign government to drop a hammer on him. But sustained attention for his son Hunter’s overseas adventures and sketchy lifestyle may not help, and Warren was the Democratic field’s first impeachment champion.

It’s also not at all certain that Team Biden’s two-candidate prophecy will come true. Yes, there’s some uncertainty about Sanders’s health at the moment, but he shows every sign of recovering and he can boast of impressive third-quarter fundraising (as can Buttigieg and, to a lesser extent, Harris and Yang). And there will be three more candidate debates between now and the Iowa Caucuses, which could upset many applecarts.

Biden’s media whisperers are smart to get a strategic narrative out there to counter the evidence that he’s losing ground to Warren. But he also needs to ensure he doesn’t get embarrassed in Iowa and New Hampshire. However much you spin, the real world still turns according to its own impervious rhythms."

There’s a lot of enthusiasm surrounding Democratic presidential politics at the moment. When Bernie Sanders bashes billionaires or Elizabeth Warren goes after big corporations, most people within earshot get to feeling like populists. Harris’ campaign is very good at organizing demonstrations of support on behalf of “Kamala for the People.” Pete Buttigieg and Beto O’Rourke have shown signs of developing a bit of a cult of personality among excited followers. Joe Biden’s adept at getting into the swing of things at African-American churches, and could probably turn a Knights of Columbus Bingo Night into something special.

But for a distinctly wild and entirely spontaneous political crowd, it’s hard to beat Andrew Yang and his Gang, as they showed early this week in the City of the Angels. The Los Angeles Times had the story:

The underdog Democratic presidential hopeful Andrew Yang walked onstage at MacArthur Park on Monday night with the swagger of a competitor who’s already won, complete with a pyrotechnic display and the 1990s R&B classic “Return of the Mack” playing on the speaker system….

Yang’s showmanship, humorously math-based approach to solving America’s problems and his love of f-bombs have won him a diverse and ear-splitting following that was on full display at his Los Angeles rally.

Members of the “Yang Gang” and the Yang-curious packed the lawn in front of the amphitheater where the candidate spoke, many hoisting signs with single words on them that anywhere else wouldn’t seem to go together: Some just said “Math.” Others said “Humanity.”

The atmosphere was not, shall we say, that of an old-school political rally featuring corny patriotic songs or venerable protests songs–or the refashioned Top 40 music that boomer pols from Bill Clinton (“Don’t Stop Thinking About Tomorrow”) to Donald Trump (“You Can’t Always Get What You Want”) always favored:

This wasn’t a typical campaign rally. It was more like a revival set to hip-hop, with one-liners that much of the crowd knew by heart.

Any time Yang said the word “math,” the crowd chanted “Math!” “Math!” “Math!” as part of the nerdy-cool theater of his campaign events. Several people brought signs featuring a thousand-dollar bill with Yang’s face on it.

That would be an allusion to Yang’s signature policy initiative, a Universal Basic Income of $1,000 a month designed to offset mass unemployment caused by intensified automation. But increasingly the 44-year-old entrepreneur’s untraditional style is getting as much attention as his substance:

“He represents something that’s beyond politics,” said Lee-kai Wong, 34, a genetics lab worker at UCLA. “The way he talks about the country — it’s a message of healing. I think we need a little more mercy and forgiveness.”

Yang’s campaign is still in the single digits in polling, but his support and the donations that go along with it have gotten him onto the stage of every Democratic debate so far — beating out political veterans and more traditional candidates.

Tony Moreno, 52, a professional driver from Ontario, said Yang “crosses every color line there is” culturally and politically.

As I can testify upon abundantly hearing from the Yang Gang after writing that he had no plausible path to the nomination, the Gang is very outspoken on social media. They pretty clearly view their candidate as sui generis and the fomenter of a potential political revolution. Plus they believe deeply in his coolness:

The crowd at MacArthur Park kept urging Yang to body-surf over his amassed supporters, but he’s already riding a wave.

He’s raising money and performing in polls well enough, it seems, to stay on the debate stage with the more traditional candidates at least through November, at which point a lot of his rivals may drop out. So keep an eye on Yang and the Gang. However little media coverage they receive, they are pretty good at gaining attention."

It was obvious to anyone who’d been paying attention heading into Tuesday night’s debate that Elizabeth Warren — now the front-runner in Democrats’ presidential nominating contest — would get her share of heat from her competitors. But in the final moments before game time, as CNN’s panelists discussed their expectations, David Axelrod made a narrower prediction. It would be a problem, he said, for Pete Buttigieg if the South Bend mayor didn’t target Warren, after all the work he’d been doing to preview that attack — most prominently debuting a new ad on Tuesday — in recent days.

The viewers who were watching Buttigieg closely knew exactly what Axelrod was talking about. Three hours later, the rest of the country has now also seen a punchier Buttigieg than ever before, as he makes a risky wager — a bet on a largely new campaign tack — that could define the trajectory of his candidacy.

Over the course of the debate in suburban Columbus, Buttigieg clashed with Warren over the details of her Medicare for All support and her plan to pay for it. But he did not reserve his fire exclusively for Warren. He also disagreed vehemently with Tulsi Gabbard over Middle East policy, and ripped into Beto O’Rourke over his position on an assault-weapon buyback plan — perhaps the tensest exchange of the night (“I don’t need lessons from you on courage, political or otherwise,” the mayor said).

It was a break from the more mild-mannered Buttigieg voters had gotten to know over the first four debates, and over his first ten months in the national eye. This candidate, eager to look like a truth-teller and get in the mix as the bigger-name contenders wage ideological war, has sharper elbows than the version who’s quietly been building up his Iowa operation in recent months. It’s all part of a bet he’s making that drawing these kinds of stark contrasts now — just as more voters tune into the race, and just as Warren surges — can position him to be an alternative to Joe Biden for moderate voters, or that it can at least vault him from the floor of the race’s top tier, alongside Kamala Harris, to somewhere in the vicinity of Bernie Sanders’s third-place status.

But his gambit is far from straightforward.

By turning a fight with Warren into one of his centerpiece moments in the national eye, Buttigieg is also gambling that undecided voters now actually want to see this kind of disagreement, even after the last three candidates to try and make such striking attacks on stage — Harris, Cory Booker, and Julián Castro, all on Biden — saw no long-term polling gain. He’s hoping that it doesn’t tank his support among the slice of progressives that has been willing to give him a look. And it’s based on an expectation that voters who have gotten to like Buttigieg’s brand of low-key moderation and calls for generational change won’t rebel against these kinds of explicit critiques of his rivals.

Buttigieg and Democrats around him have been most eager to pick the health-care fight, according to multiple people in his orbit. Though he’d found himself clashing with Warren supporters in the last week for labeling grassroots donations “pocket change” in a recent interview while making a point about general-election fundraising strategy, and though he’d engaged in a back-and-forth with O’Rourke — who trails him in most polling — over gun policy, he has been trying to put himself more forcefully in the middle of the health-care fight with ads in early-voting Iowa touting his own alternative to Medicare for All. It’s a strategy he’s following more successfully than others who’ve tried a version of it, like Steve Bullock, Michael Bennet, John Hickenlooper, and John Delaney.

Those close to Buttigieg are fond of pointing to a late September Des Moines Register poll demonstrating fear among some Democratic caucus-goers that Medicare for All could cost the party in the general election, and on Tuesday Buttigieg released a digital ad criticizing Sanders and Warren by name while touting his own plan. It was the first candidate ad of the cycle directly going after named opponents, and Buttigieg onstage accused Warren of being evasive over her plan’s funding, a reflection, he said, of “why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular.”

Buttigieg isn’t the only candidate whose path ahead relies on Biden faltering. But in order to truly take Biden’s place at some point, he’d need to massively expand his support among both African-American voters and Democrats who aren’t yet fully engaged in the primary — two groups that have been Biden’s core supporters, but with whom Buttigieg has struggled. He’s now committed himself to a future firmly within that lane, with little wiggle room after he said onstage that Warren’s and Sanders’s health-care proposals would “unnecessarily divide this country” in a post-Trump world. Some of the fury that has long come Biden’s way from progressives fed up with his centrism is now certainly headed Buttigieg’s way.

To hear his allies tell it, Buttigieg’s new strategy makes sense because voters are now demanding clarity on what divides the candidates, and they’ll appreciate his new assertiveness. That may make the difference between his position in the top five and a place in the top three. It will, at the very least, determine whether the hopeful candidate who’s tried to spur a generational revolution can now credibly convince people to think of him as the moderate hope."

“It’s just human nature,” Miller said. “The worst enemy you face in a pandemic could well be your neighbor.”

Miller, along with about 100 other people who he says have purchased Fortitude Ranch memberships, believes that underground bunkers, stockpiled food, and semiautomatic weapons will see them through an apocalypse, however it may come.

AD

Some preppers — people who invest significant amounts of money and time in preparing for anything from a natural disaster to the collapse of civilization — think the end may come sooner than later. In addition to worrying about overpopulation, climate change, economic collapse and war, some also fret about politics. With impeachment in the air and tensions building toward the 2020 presidential race, preppers warn that violence could erupt in this fiercely polarized nation.

AD

“You know, people use the term ‘civil war,’ and that seems hard to imagine, but what started World War I? Some guy assassinated a minor archduke,” Miller said. “. . . Stuff escalates unpredictably.”

The scenario most often advanced by ranch members concerns the possibility of a disputed election. There’s fear by some members that if President Trump loses, he might blame cheating and refuse to step down. Others believe that if Trump wins, his opponents might also blame the outcome on fraud, triggering unrest. It’s not a scenario Miller thinks likely, but he’s heard it from both sides.

AD

Trump, in one of a series of tweets trying to discredit the impeachment inquiry launched by House Democrats, has stoked tensions further, suggesting his removal from office could trigger a “Civil War like fracture.”

AD

That’s the scenario David L. Jones, a Fortitude Ranch member who’s also something of a celebrity prepper, believes could set off unrest. Jones, 62, a former Alaska state trooper and Army veteran, is known as the “NBC Guy” because of his military background in nuclear, biological and chemical warfare. He has also worked in state and federal emergency management agencies. He has a podcast and was one of this year’s featured speakers at Prepper Camp, a three-day symposium that attracted more than 1,000 off-the-gridders, survivalists and homesteaders to a private campsite last month in North Carolina. Jones said he foresees turmoil, and perhaps violence, whether Trump wins or loses.

“You see, the veneer of civilization is very thin,” Jones said.

Fortitude Ranch occupies more than 50 acres within the George Washington National Forest. Its serene setting belies talk of catastrophe. On a recent tour, there were green mountain vistas just below the clouds and a stillness broken only by the soft patter of rain on leaves.

Members, who pay about $1,000 per person per year to be a part of the community, are encouraged to use the ranch’s two large rustic cabins here as vacation lodgings. In the event of emergency, however, they would head to 10-by-10-foot, claustrophobia-inducing rooms in underground shelters, some of which are constructed of metal culverts. Altogether, the compound here can hold up to 500 people.

AD

The organization also has two sites in Colorado. It’s working to set up a fourth in Wisconsin. The motto: “Prepare for the Worst — Enjoy the Present.”

AD

The camp is a reflection of a survivalist movement that has grown in recent years, although reliable numbers are hard to find. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which analyzes community preparedness, doesn’t track survivalists. And many preppers are reluctant to identify as such or discuss their activities, fearing that attention could attract marauders when things go south — or “s--- hits the fan,” in prepper parlance.

The number of preppers also tends to expand and recede in sync with social crises, both real and imagined. (Remember Y2K?) But interest appears to have grown since the Great Recession. Google searches for terms such as “survivalist” began ticking upward in mid-2008 as the economic crisis deepened. Reality TV — “Doomsday Preppers” on the National Geographic Channel in 2011 and “Apocalypse Preppers” on the Discovery Channel in 2013 — fed the end-of-days craze and fed off it.

AD

24/7WallSt.com, a financial news website, estimated in 2013 that there are 3.7 million preppers and a multibillion-dollar market that includes “bugout gear” such as freeze-dried foods, water purification systems, crossbows and tools. Businesses such as the Ready Store and the website Doomsday Prep have built on the movement, too.

AD

David Sanders, Doomsday Prep’s owner, launched the online store near Atlanta in 2012. Although Sanders declined to provide exact sales figures, he said that except for a flat year or two around 2015, the business has had annual growth of about 25 percent. His orders increase in sync with disasters or other bad news, such as the outbreak of Zika virus.

The bitterly divided political atmosphere is a driver right now, Sanders said. But his typical customer is someone who thinks about enduring a power outage for a few days, not a nuclear holocaust, although the website sells supplies and equipment for that, too.

AD

“Preparedness is a choice for empowerment, security and peace of mind,” he said. “Why would anyone not choose that?”

Miller’s experience with doomsday scenarios goes back to the Cold War. He’s a retired colonel in U.S. Air Force intelligence. He’s also a Harvard PhD, cryptocurrency consultant and author of a post-apocalyptic novel, “Rohan Nation: Reinventing America after the 2020 Collapse.” He’s disdainful of the recent prepper craze, especially the reality TV shows that often focus on the most wide-eyed survivalists and hold them up for ridicule.

“It really hurt preppers,” Miller said. Fortitude Ranch, he said, offers a more sober and realistic strategy for survival that draws on his own professional military experience. “I’ve been a prepper a long time,” he said.

Raymond Andrew Miller, 61, grew up in Lincoln, Neb., about an hour’s drive from the U.S. Strategic Air Command at Offutt Air Force Base, a prime target for the Soviet Union. Yet, Miller said, he didn’t dwell on the threat of nuclear annihilation, even after reading somewhere that Soviet ICBMs were accurate only to within about 60 miles.

“I thought, ‘Oh, that’s great. They’re going to aim for Offutt, and it’s going to land in Lincoln,’ ” Miller said.

He volunteered for the Civil Air Patrol when he was 13 years old. He entered the U.S. Air Force Academy, graduating in 1980 with a double major in history and international affairs. He obtained masters and PhD degrees at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government. His dissertation argued that NATO troops could survive a Warsaw Pact nuclear blitz at little cost if the allies built 10,000 inexpensive shelters using metal culverts with some dirt on top.

“Three feet of earth is kind of the magic number,” Miller said. “That’s why at Fortitude Ranch we have shallow underground facilities. No one’s going to drop a penetrating multi-megaton nuclear warhead in our area.”

Miller has analyzed other lethal threats, too, particularly pandemics, that he thinks are more likely to occur than another civil war. He noted that the 1918-1920 “Spanish flu” pandemic alone killed an estimated 30 million people. The next such outbreak could be started with a genetically engineered pathogen that has been designed to be more lethal and resistant to treatment, Miller said.

He also wants to ensure Fortitude Ranch could survive natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina; the eruption of a supervolcano, such as the one below Yellowstone National Park; or widespread civil disorder, such as occurred during the 1977 New York City blackout when rioting broke out and nearly 2,000 businesses were burned or looted. He wants the ranch to be prepared for nuclear attack, economic collapse or an electromagnetic pulse (EMP), a massive burst of energy that could fry the nation’s electrical grid.

AD

There are stockpiles of food, ranging from homemade preserves to cafeteria-sized cans and buckets of emergency rations, and a small greenhouse, along with seeds specially created to withstand long shelf lives. There are also chickens, milk goats and — in Colorado — cattle.

The ranch also has radio gear and solar- and propane-powered electrical generators, along with supplies of coal, kerosene and wood. Down the hill from the main bunker is a burn pit to dispose of contaminated bodies during a pandemic. Miller said he’s already tested the pit with a dead goat.

Miller and assistant camp managers are armed, and members receive training in using AR-15 semiautomatic rifles or pump-action shotguns for self-defense, but he emphasized that his group is not allied in any way with anti-government militias.

“We’re not gun nuts,” Miller said.

Miller has never had to shoot at anyone, although he came under rocket and mortar fire while serving in Iraq.

But he said he is prepared to do whatever is necessary defend himself, his family and members of Fortitude Ranch. There’s a saying among preppers — “72 hours to animal” — that suggests anyone can become dangerous when desperate.

“I think it’s more like 72 seconds,” Miller said.

And yet his worst nightmare is imagining a mother arriving at the camp’s gates with a starving child during a pandemic and asking for help. Survival discipline, he said, requires even they be turned away."

And the procedure he underwent is one of the most routine performed by cardiologists.

“This is a common procedure. It’s very safe. People recover quickly,” said Steven Nissen, chair of cardiovascular medicine at Cleveland Clinic. “I’ve treated businessmen who go back to work the next day. I’ve had patients in the U.S. Senate who have gotten right back to work. Although, if Bernie were my patient, I might tell him not to work 16 hours a day for a little while, just to make sure recovery goes well.”

Coronary arteries — arteries that feed blood to the heart muscle — can become blocked over time with the buildup of fatty deposits or plaque. As the artery narrows, it reduces blood flow and can cause chest pains. Heart attacks happen when that blood flow to a part of the heart becomes completely blocked.

So when a patient like Sanders comes in complaining of chest pains, doctors usually perform an angiogram to diagnose the problem, said Elizabeth Klodas, a cardiologist in Minneapolis. That means inserting a small catheter — about the thickness of a cooked piece of spaghetti — into an artery in the patient’s wrist or groin. That catheter goes up to the heart area, where it can inject dye into the coronary arteries, allowing doctors to see them through x-ray.

“That gives you a road map and shows you where the blockages may be,” Klodas said. Once doctors identify where the problem is, they can maneuver a balloon-tipped tube to the site of the blockage. The balloon is inflated, opening the artery back up so blood can fully flow again. The stent is a “tiny wire mesh tube,” according to the American Heart Association — “kind of like chicken wire,” Klodas notes — that expands with the balloon but stays in place permanently after the balloon is deflated and the catheter is withdrawn. The stent is what keeps the artery propped open, so blood can flow to the heart muscle for years to come.

AD

AD

The fact that doctors placed two stents in Sanders could mean he had two blockages on the same artery, or that it was an especially long blockage that required two stents to open up, Klodas said.

“It’s an in-and-out procedure and can take as little as 30 minutes,” said Allen Taylor, chair of cardiology at MedStar Heart & Vascular Institute. “And the outlook is often very good.”

At 78, Sanders is the oldest among the candidates running for the Democratic nomination. Sanders’s doctor released a letter during the 2016 campaign showing he had a history of elevated cholesterol but no indication of heart disease at the time.

Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men in America, resulting in 1 in 4 male deaths. In some ways, Sanders was fortunate, experts note, because half the men who suddenly die of heart disease have no previous symptoms, such as the chest pains Sanders felt.

Sanders often jokes about his age at town halls and when meeting with voters. But age is one of most dominant factors in heart disease — along with other factors including family history, cholesterol level, blood pressure, obesity and diet. And Sanders’s heart problem may revive the topic of age among Democratic Party voters, who must choose in coming months whether to nominate a candidate from among the three candidates over the age of 70 or from the new younger generation of leaders also running.

Many U.S. leaders have had heart problems. After leaving office at age 58, former president Bill Clinton had quadruple bypass surgery in 2004 because of extensive blockages in his arteries. Former president George W. Bush had a stent placed in his artery in 2013. Former vice president Richard B. Cheney suffered five heart attacks beginning at the age of 37. He required several procedures while in office and had a heart transplant after leaving office in 2012.

The statement, released after Sanders left the hospital, marked the first time the campaign had acknowledged he had a heart attack. Aides had previously declined to answer questions about his diagnosis.

Asked Friday why they waited to announce the diagnosis, Sanders campaign spokesman Mike Casca said, “We just wanted to wait until he was discharged to give out the information all at once.”

On Wednesday, Sanders’s campaign said he was hospitalized after experiencing chest pains at a Tuesday night campaign event. After doctors discovered an artery blockage, the campaign said then, they inserted two stents.

“The Senator was stable upon arrival and taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, at which time two stents were placed in a blocked coronary artery in a timely fashion,” his doctors said Friday. “All other arteries were normal.”

AD

They said his hospital stay was “uneventful with good expected progress. He was discharged with instructions to follow up with his personal physician.”

AD

It was not immediately clear what effect Sanders’s health issues would have on his second straight campaign for the presidency. While he was hospitalized, a senior aide said his campaign events were canceled “until further notice.”

Sanders planned to fly home to Vermont on Saturday, his campaign said. Over the weekend, surrogates are fanning out across early nominating states to campaign on his behalf.

Shortly after leaving the hospital, Sanders posted a video on Twitter in which he said he was feeling better. “See you soon on the campaign trail,” he added.

AD

His wife, Jane, said before his release that Sanders would “take a few days to rest” but would take part in the Oct. 15 Democratic presidential debate. It was not clear whether he would resume his normal campaign activities before then.

An arterial blockage such as Sanders’s typically has a good prognosis and does not normally require a long recovery period, medical experts said earlier this week, before it was known that he had suffered a heart attack.

AD

Sanders’s condition has revived a debate over age and health in the Democratic Party. The three candidates leading the polls in the Democratic primary — Sanders, former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) — are in their 70s. President Trump is also a septuagenarian.

AD

Earlier in the campaign, some younger candidates made the argument that it was time to turn the party’s leadership over to a new generation. But that pitch was mostly aimed at Biden, at the time the clear leader in the polls.

Sanders’s medical crisis occurred amid some good news for his campaign — an announcement this week that he raised $25.3 million, more than any other candidate for the Democratic nomination, in the third quarter. In recent weeks, Sanders has slipped in the polls, dropping behind Biden and Warren.

AD

Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir sought to emphasize his position in the money chase on Friday.

“Our third quarter fundraising totals make clear that Bernie’s campaign is part of a working class movement taking on the greed and corruption of the corporate elite,” Shakir said in a statement. “Let me thank all of our contributors and volunteers. We’re going to win and create the political revolution.”

Sanders, in a tweet issued from the hospital this week, used his hospitalization to argue for his agenda, specifically the Medicare-for-all plan he has long championed. He noted that a health emergency can come as a surprise, as his did.

In the statement released by his campaign Friday, Sanders thanked the doctors and nurses who treated him.

“After two and a half days in the hospital, I feel great, and after taking a short time off, I look forward to getting back to work,” Sanders said.

It comes as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has been siphoning support from Sanders among the party’s most liberal voters, a group that belonged solely to Sanders in 2016.

Democrats at Sanders’s campaign events often express approval of both his policies and Warren’s, citing their similar anti-establishment views. But Warren’s support has been climbing while Sanders’s has been fading, and polls suggest that while the senator from Vermont is cementing support from his core followers with his purist plans, Warren may be benefiting from the perception that she is not the most radical figure in the Democratic field.

Even President Trump weighed in on Sanders’s predicament Friday at a rally in Louisiana, wishing him a speedy recovery while opining that if Sanders does not win the Democratic nomination most of his supporters will probably go to Warren.

As the two senators jockey for position in the Democratic field, they have been reluctant to attack each other directly for fear of alienating each other’s supporters, and they often call each other friends.

But in an interview Sunday at his home in Burlington, Vt., Sanders was pressed by ABC’s Jon Karl to draw a line between him and Warren, and he did so, albeit with apparent reluctance.

“Elizabeth has said she is a capitalist through to her bones. I’m not,” Sanders said. “I am, I believe, the only candidate who is going to say to the ruling class of this country, the corporate elite, ‘Enough. Enough with your greed and your corruption.’ ”

Monday’s plan is the second proposal Sanders has issued since being sidelined from the trail that seeks to cut corporate influence. The first plan targeted corporate money in politics, while the latest proposal takes a more comprehensive swing at the way corporations treat workers, pay taxes, and interact with each other.

The centerpiece of the plan aims to dramatically shift control over U.S. corporations from Wall Street shareholders to tens of millions of workers who currently have little say in the management of the companies where they work.

Sanders proposes forcing all publicly traded companies, as well as all private companies with more than $100 million in revenue, to give their workers at least 45 percent of the seats on their corporate boards — going further than a similar idea from Warren, who has called for giving workers 40 percent of those seats.

AD

AD

Beyond that, Sanders would require the companies to issue a portion of their stock holdings to a fund controlled by workers. These worker-controlled shares — Sanders calls them “Democratic Employee Ownership Funds” — would give employees a percentage of the dividends paid out by the corporation.

Sanders takes a step beyond Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain’s Labour Party, by calling for corporations to turn over at least 20 percent of their shares to these worker funds, compared to 10 percent for Corbyn. The workers would then elect a board to manage and disburse the shares.

The plan would amount to a sweeping transformation of the American economy and empower workers in a far-reaching new way. But critics say it would also give businesses an incentive to hire contractors instead of full-time employees, potentially hurting workers rather than helping them.

AD

AD

Currently, about 7,000 companies in the United States are set up to allow employees to own a substantial share of their businesses, representing about 11 million workers, according to Joseph R. Blasi and Douglas L. Kruse of Rutgers University.

Sanders’s plan would aim to give an additional 56 million workers, in more than 22,000 companies, a share of their businesses. The campaign says workers at McDonald’s, for example, would ultimately control 20 percent of its stock and 45 percent of the vote on its management decisions.

“What we want is democracy within the workplace, so the decisions aren’t all being made by a tiny number of people,” said Peter Gowan, a senior policy associate at the Democracy Collaborative, a left-leaning think tank, who worked with the Sanders campaign on the proposal.

AD

Sanders also proposes some smaller measures designed to increase worker control of the economy, such as a $500 million bank for employees who want to buy or start their own firms and the creation of “worker ownership centers” to help employees manage their own companies.

Sanders also offered a sweeping set of antitrust policies, including a new “bright line” that would bar mergers of companies with too much market share. Warren has released antitrust plans related to agriculture and big tech, according to Matt Stoller, fellow at the Open Markets Institute, but not a comprehensive antitrust plan.

Sanders also offered a sweeping set of antitrust policies, including a new “bright line” that would bar mergers of companies that dominate too much market share. Warren has released antitrust plans related to agriculture and big tech, according to Matt Stoller, fellow at the Open Markets Institute, but not a comprehensive antitrust plan.

The plan reflects in part the battle to construct the left’s agenda, as Sanders and Warren vie for liberal voters. Both candidates have come under fire from the business community for their ideas, including the criticism that they would discourage entrepreneurs from starting businesses and would prompt investors to put their money overseas.

Jim Kessler, senior vice president of policy at the centrist think tank Third Way, has said such plans may do little for custodial or food service workers, who are often on contract. A Sanders campaign aide has said the senator has introduced legislation to prevent misclassification of workers as contractors.

Plans to boost employee-owned businesses have earned some interest from lawmakers in both parties, albeit with narrower measures. Republican Sens. Pat Roberts (Kan.) and Thom Tillis (N.C.), for instance, have pushed legislation to encourage technical assistance and other help for such firms.

Sanders’s plan would also repeal the 2017 GOP tax cut for corporations, which lowered the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. Many congressional Democrats also favor raising the corporate tax rate, though few want to raise it as much as Sanders.

Under his plan, America’s corporate tax rate would be among the highest in the world. Corporate tax rates have fallen globally, including in the European countries often cited as a model by Sanders, with Sweden and Norway both taxing firms below 25 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

The recent populist surge has prompted some in both parties to look for ways to cut the power of government and corporations. Sanders’s supporters say his approach would provide much-needed influence to ordinary Americans, but conservatives argue that raising corporate taxes would ultimately hurt those same people.

“Corporations might write the tax check to the government, but the tax is borne by consumers, workers and shareholders,” said Nicole Kaeding, vice president of policy promotion at the National Taxpayers Union Foundation. Raising the rate to 35 percent, she said, “would result in a smaller U.S. economy and lower wages.”"

“Probably not doing four rallies a day,” said Sanders, who had adopted a more furious campaign schedule than many of his much younger opponents.

Sanders, who has committed to releasing his medical records before the first primary votes but has not yet done so, said Tuesday he would provide the information at “the appropriate time.” Former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) — fellow septuagenarians who join Sanders at the top of most polls — have also committed to releasing their medical records.

Sanders met reporters outside his Burlington home where he has spent the past few days with family, making calls and recovering from a heart attack he suffered during a grass roots fundraising event in Las Vegas last week.

AD

The 78-year-old felt chest pains last Tuesday night and was taken to a hospital, where doctors inserted two stents into a blocked artery. By Monday, he was back in Burlington, taking a walk with his wife, Jane, and addressing his campaign on a staff-wide conference call.

AD

The campaign had not initially disclosed that Sanders had suffered a heart attack, acknowledging at first only that the stents had been implanted. Tuesday’s remarks were the first in which Sanders himself has been so open about what happened.

The senator from Vermont had been making more frequent campaign stops than almost any of his fellow Democrats, despite being the oldest candidate in the field. He had never spoken publicly about feeling increased fatigue, though it was clear he was maintaining a grueling pace.

AD

Far from admitting he was tired, Sanders tried to demonstrate that despite his age he remained robust and vibrant. In late August, for example, he participated in a softball game with his campaign staffers in Iowa.

But he suffered occasional minor physical setbacks. Sanders cut his head on a shower door in March, and had to cancel a day of events when he lost his voice in September.

AD

“If there’s any message that I hope we can get out there, it’s that I want people to pay attention to their symptoms,” Sanders said. “When you’re hurting, when you’re fatigued, when you have a pain in your chest — listen to it.”

Some Sanders advisers and supporters said they hoped Sanders would slow his campaigning pace somewhat, a wish that seems likely to be granted for at least the next few days. Campaign officials have signaled that Sanders will not hit the campaign trail again until next Tuesday’s debate.

AD

Allies also say they hope Sanders will talk openly about his heart attack as a way to present a more human side, a departure for a candidate noticeably reluctant to talk about himself. In his remarks in recent days, as well as appearances with his wife, he seems to have begun that process.

In the meantime, the campaign has churned along even without campaign appearances by the candidate. On Monday, Sanders’s team rolled out a proposal to curtail the role of money in politics. On Tuesday, the campaign began airing $1.3 million in television ads in Iowa.

Later Tuesday, the Sanders team announced a series of endorsements from local officials in Nevada. And Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a Sanders campaign co-chair, tweeted that Sanders “had a great call” with his campaign co-chairs.

Sanders’s hiatus from the trail mean the Democratic debate in Ohio next week is likely to be a crucial moment for his campaign. He will have had 14 days of rest between his procedure and the debate, when voters and rivals are likely to scrutinize his performance for any signs of fatigue or additional physical strain.

Thursday’s announcement was the most concrete indicator of the Vermont senator’s timeline for returning to the campaign after doctors found the blockage and inserted two stents earlier this week.

It remained unclear whether Sanders, 78, would resume his normal campaign activities before the debate. Jeff Weaver, a senior Sanders adviser, said Wednesday that Sanders had canceled appearances “until further notice.”

The overall state of Sanders’s health was also unclear. A spokesman declined to provide more specifics about his condition beyond the statement from Jane Sanders.

But the campaign signaled Thursday that it intended to keep pressing ahead in the early nominating states. A TV ad campaign in Iowa the Sanders team had abruptly put off will begin on Tuesday, a campaign spokesman said. It is backed by $1.3 million and is slated to run for two weeks.

Sanders was hospitalized during a trip to Nevada after experiencing chest pains at a Tuesday campaign event, according to Weaver. He was still recovering in a hospital on Thursday, the campaign said.

Jane Sanders flew to Las Vegas to be with him on Wednesday, according to the campaign.

An artery blockage such as Sanders’s normally has a good prognosis and does not tend to require a long recovery period, medical experts said.

The senator thanked those who have wished him a speedy recovery, taking the opportunity Wednesday to highlight Medicare-for-all, his proposal for universal health care. “None of us know when a medical emergency might affect us. And no one should fear going bankrupt if it occurs. Medicare for All!” he tweeted.

Sanders has been campaigning at an aggressive pace in recent weeks, often holding multiple events per day, sometimes in more than one state.

Sanders generally appears robust and energetic, but he has dealt with minor health issues over the past few months, such as losing his voice during a trip to Denver and injuring his head on the edge of a shower door in March, opening a wound that required seven stitches.

Sanders has vowed to release his health records before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses, the first contest of the primary season. Former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), two other candidates in their 70s, have made the same promise.

Polls show Biden, Warren and Sanders are the three leading candidates for the Democratic nomination, and a younger generation of White House hopefuls has struggled to keep pace with them.

Sanders received encouragement and well wishes from near and far as he recovered in Las Vegas. Harry M. Reid, the Nevada Democrat and former Senate majority leader who served in the upper chamber of Congress with Sanders, paid him a visit, according to the Sanders campaign.

Sanders’s Democratic rivals have wished Sanders a speedy recovery, and at least one campaign has sought to help his team deal with the difficult moment.

“big thank you to @Team­Warren for sending dinner to our dc headquarters. the team is very grateful (and started with the cookies first),” tweeted Sanders spokesman Mike Casca.

Being able to draw on such a base was especially important for Warren (D-Mass.) and Sanders (I-Vt.) in the third quarter — a notoriously difficult time to raise money because of the summer lull, when it’s harder to hold in-person fundraising events with large donors.

“This means our grassroots movement is in an incredible position — to double down on our investments in grassroots organizing, to keep getting Elizabeth’s plans for big, structural change in front of more caucus-goers and voters, and to bring more people into this fight,” according to an email set to be sent to supporters Friday morning from Warren’s campaign manager, Roger Lau.

Warren’s third-quarter figure shows that she has built a small-dollar fundraising machine that is quickly catching up to Sanders’s. Sanders, who is drawing on the donor base he built in the 2016 campaign, still has a formidable fundraising email list that has been without an equal in recent years.

Sanders and Warren came in significantly ahead of their rival Democrats for the quarter. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigeig raised $19.1 million, according to the self-reported figures. And former vice president Joe Biden, who leads many polls, raised about $15.2 million in the quarter, his campaign said.

Warren took in money from 509,000 individual donors over the three-month period, with a total of 943,000 donations — meaning that many of her donors gave more than once. The campaign reported ending the quarter with $25.7 million in cash.

Warren posted $19.1 million in the second quarter and ended that period with $19.7 million in cash, the campaign said.

Candidates have until Oct. 15 to file fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission, but those with noteworthy numbers typically share their totals soon after a quarter ends. Monday was the final day of the third quarter, which began July 1.

Concerns have risen in recent days that the potential Democratic slate has been weakened by events largely out of the candidates’ control. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) promised a speedy return to the campaign trail after leaving the hospital Friday, but it was unclear whether the 78-year-old would be able to replicate his previously frenetic travel schedule. Former vice president Joe Biden, who has spent most of the race as the leader in the polls, has faced daily attacks from Trump over largely unfounded allegations about his son Hunter’s foreign business dealings, highlighting a potential vulnerability for the candidate many saw as the best hope for beating Trump.

“This is crazier than most. It’s the normal twists and turns — on steroids,” said former senator Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.). “Anything can happen. Anything can happen.”

Interviews with more than two dozen Democratic leaders, top strategists and former elected officials revealed that most are still holding out judgment about how — or how much — the events will shift the race.

But they point to several worrying factors, including questions about whether Biden is equipped to mount an effective defense against Trump’s attacks and whether the surging Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) would alienate moderate voters and donors if she were the nominee. Some fear that Sanders’s health problems put a spotlight on the advanced age of the top contenders, all of whom are in their 70s. Others expressed skepticism that any Democrat would be able to compete against Trump’s unmatched ability to shift the public’s focus.

“We need to be proposing an alternative, and I think it is going to be very difficult to get any of that through when we are talking about impeachment,” said former senator Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), who lost her reelection in 2018 in the face of high Trump popularity in her state. “ ‘My ideas are better than your ideas’ has now been eclipsed by the news of the day.”

The shifting dynamic has already altered campaign strategies, as some trailing candidates focus on early-voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, where they can more easily avoid the nationally broadcast din of impeachment news. But for the front-running trio, the events of the last two weeks have served as a public test of how they would handle crises in a general election.

Trump’s early and fierce focus on Biden — which includes public requests for foreign leaders to investigate his family — has challenged the former vice president to prove his ability to fight back.

AD

AD

“This is not about me, this is not about my son. There’s not a shred of evidence of anything done was wrong,” Biden told reporters Friday. “Let’s focus on the problem. Focus on this man. What he’s doing that no president has ever done. No president.”

But there are signs that Trump’s attacks are having an effect, even among prospective Biden supporters. One Biden volunteer, Marcie Lammers of Las Vegas, who showed up to his Las Vegas event last month wearing a Biden T-shirt, said the backlash to the impeachment news was clear in the phone calls she has been making for her candidate.

“I know it’s getting in the way,” she said of the impeachment talk and Trump’s accusations about the Bidens’ actions involving Ukraine. “When I do the phone banking, at first people said ‘Well, I’m thinking about Joe or I’m leaning toward Joe.’ Now, the people that do pick up the phone, they say, ‘Well if he wants to collect money, why doesn’t he just get it from Ukraine?’ ”

The danger for Biden, strategists say, is that voters look past the details of Trump’s charges of corruption against him, many of which have been debunked, and fear the impact. Biden sought the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had previously investigated a company where his son worked — but he was carrying out U.S. policy with the support of other Western governments, not intervening on behalf of his family. Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing as part of investigation into his Ukrainian employer, which was dormant at the time his father sought the dismissal.

“Whether it is true or not, you have to take it seriously that it is something that might stick, even if there is no there there,” said Glen Caplin, who served as a top presidential campaign adviser for Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who ended her campaign in August.

“We saw it in 2016,” he added, referring to charges of corruption that Trump leveled against former secretary of state Hillary Clinton.

AD

AD

At the same time, several party strategists say Biden still has an opportunity to take advantage of the attention Trump has directed at him. The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee have announced $10 million in spending on campaign ads that misleadingly attack Biden for his work in Ukraine. Biden has begun airing an ad that directly takes on Trump and accuses him of trying to engineer the selection of the Democratic nominee.

“Biden’s best positioning is when it is him versus Trump in the primary,” said David Plouffe, a top adviser to Barack Obama’s two presidential campaigns who now hosts the Campaign HQ podcast. “It’s an opportunity to show people: ‘Trump is afraid of me. I can stand up to him.’ I would seize that.”

One factor raising alarm is that Biden raised only $15.2 million over the past three months, putting him in fourth place among the candidates and well behind Sanders and Warren, who have built grass-roots fundraising networks.

“That’ll be the discussion. He’s the front-runner. Why is he not raising more?” said Terry McAuliffe, a former Virginia governor and a prolific fundraiser who ran the Democratic National Committee. “This is an opportunity with everything going on. Get yourself on the news and do it.”

The Trump onslaught has revealed growing frustration among some Biden supporters that top party officials — as well as some of his rivals — have not done more to rally behind him during what they view as a moment of crisis fomented by Trump.

“I’m disappointed in a lot of the leaders in our party who are allowing the GOP to do what they do very well,” said Harold A. Schaitberger, president of the International Association of Firefighters and a fierce Biden backer. “They have their guns blazing. They have a great coordinated plan. The basic Democratic comment is just crickets. . . . All I know is our side better learn to fight better.”

Democratic leaders and strategists also expressed concern that Sanders’s recent illness could raise fresh questions about the septuagenarian polling leaders. Warren, 70, is the youngest, and both Biden, 76, and Sanders, 78, would be the oldest president ever to take office if they won.

Sanders started the week on a high note, announcing a significant third-quarter fundraising haul of $25.3 million, larger than every other Democratic candidate. But hours later, he was hospitalized for treatment of a blocked artery. He was released Friday but is taking an unknown amount of time off. It remains unclear whether he will hold events before the next debate on Oct. 15.

“The age issue was not so much a health-related issue, but rather more one about generational appeal,” said Donna Bojarsky, a California Democratic consultant who has donated money to Democratic Sens. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Cory Booker (N.J.). “Now, because of Senator Sanders, maybe the issue will come up more.”

The three top-polling candidates have promised to release medical records before the Iowa caucuses, but the Sanders campaign was not fully transparent about his condition. The announcement by his doctors of the heart attack, in a campaign-issued statement, came three days after he arrived at the hospital.

The flurry of impeachment news and distractions for Sanders and Biden have accrued so far to Warren’s benefit, disrupting other Democrats’ efforts to more directly challenge her ideas and background. Warren took the lead in several state and national polls last month, and she is widely seen as building the most accomplished campaign.

“My sense is the person who is getting the best of this is Elizabeth Warren. She’s not being attacked. And she’s raising money,” said Mitch Landrieu, the former mayor of New Orleans. But any pause in the scrutiny she may face is likely to be temporary, he added.

“She has a plan for everything except for how to beat Donald Trump. That needs to get tested,” Landrieu said. “She says she can do all these things. There’s a thing called political reality. . . . Aspiration is wonderful, but you can’t eat aspiration for lunch and send your kids to college on it. That’s a fundamental decision that Democratic primary voters need to make a decision on.”

The now-overshadowed attacks focused on whether Warren was the person she claimed to be, and whether her plans, including Medicare-for-all, would alienate general-election voters.

Biden said Warren was not being candid with voters about her policy plans, and his aides had pointed to the vice president’s release of decades of tax returns, highlighting the years when Warren did corporate legal work before entering public office. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has called Warren “extremely evasive” about the details of her health plans. Both Harris’s and Sanders’s campaign staff have pointed out that Warren, who boasts regularly of her grass-roots fundraising model, transferred $10 million into her campaign, including money she had solicited from wealthy donors during her Senate efforts.

“What has impressed me about her is she creates her own weather. She has risen in the polls on her own, not pushing off against somebody else,” said Jennifer Palmieri, a top strategist for Hillary Clinton in 2016. “I hear from a lot of campaigns that she is going to have to answer questions now. Well, I don’t know. She gets asked questions all the time. I’m not sure that confronting her is going to have the impact that other campaigns want.”

As Warren has steadily marched upward in the polls, the reality that she could become the nominee has unsettled some of the party’s top donors, who worry that she would hand the race to Trump. If it starts to look like Warren will win the party’s nomination, a longtime Democratic bundler said, “there will be efforts to stop that.”

“Right now, they think Joe Biden stands between us and Elizabeth/Bernie — and to defeat in 2020,” said the bundler, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. “So if he [Biden] doesn’t measure up, that’s where you start to feel angst in the donor community.”

Another major Democratic donor, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations, said he and other donors seeking a moderate as a nominee have “zero interest in coming around to Elizabeth Warren.” If she’s the nominee, “we can’t vote for her or Donald Trump” and would sit out the election, he said.

The donor also expressed worries that if Warren is the nominee, her presence would ruin any Democratic chances to win the Senate, because voters would perceive having a Republican majority as “the only way to keep her in check” as president.

For the rest of the Democratic field, which has been struggling in single digits or less in polls, the disruption at the top has provided a shred of hope that they might still be able to break out in one of the early-voting states.

“One or two people are going to emerge out of that second tier and be viable because I don’t think that the top tier is so strong that they can lock this down,” said Aaron Pickrell, who helped run Obama’s two winning presidential efforts in Republican-leaning Ohio. Asked about the general election, he admitted, “I’m still nervous about all of it.”

Democratic Party rules are set to narrow access to the November and December debates, possibly excluding candidates such as former housing secretary Julián Castro, Klobuchar, former congressman Beto O’Rourke (Tex.) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii).

But many candidates may continue to campaign without debate access, betting on early-state voters to lift them from obscurity amid the ongoing impeachment turmoil. That is particularly true among those who see themselves as alternatives to Biden.

“There are some people who think it will fix the field where it is because it will take the oxygen away from the presidential campaign, and I doubt that is true,” said Sen. Michael F. Bennet (Colo.), who polled at zero percent in the most recent Des Moines Register poll in Iowa. “I think the big thing that is shifting is that the voters in these early states really for the first moment are beginning to pay attention to the race. Everything up to now has been preseason.”

Rep. Tim Ryan (Ohio), another struggling candidate, said he has newfound interest from donors worried about Biden’s campaign and Warren’s ideology, and recently was meeting with newly interested donors in Los Angeles. He’s also putting together meetings in New York.

“For us, I think there’s new life into the campaign because of that,” he said.

“I’ve been saying how fluid this is,” he added. “It’s just wide open, and uncertainty of impeachment adds to it.”"

If you want another indication that Elizabeth Warren has arrived as a co-front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, here you go (from The Daily Beast):

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) … has been in contact with [former Florida gubernatorial nominee Andrew] Gillum over the past several months, multiple knowledgeable sources told The Daily Beast …

[T]wo sources said the talks between Warren and Gillum resemble the kind of courtship that happens when a leading presidential candidate is exploring potential vice-presidential contenders. One source briefed on the communications said the two Democrats have been in contact over the course of the campaign and that it is the “strong impression” that Gillum is a possible vice-presidential contender for Warren, who has risen in recent months to become a front-runner in the 2020 primary, the source said.

Warren’s campaign is denying that anything veepish is going on here and contends that she’s just consulting Gillum (for whom she cut an ad last year) as part of learning the lay of the land in the Sunshine State. Florida is holding what could become a key primary role (its contest is on March 17, two weeks after Super Tuesday) and is, of course, a major general-election battleground state. Among other things, Gillum is heading up a major voter-registration drive there.

Who knows what’s really going on? Even if she were eyeing Gillum as a running mate, Warren wouldn’t want to admit it at this point, since it would show a certain Harvardian hubris to be thinking much about whose hand to clasp in Milwaukee at the national convention before the first vote is cast to choose a nominee.

But it does raise a question: When is an appropriate time to begin thinking about a veep?

Everyone would agree not to follow the old-school tradition, in place until pretty recently, of figuring it all out at the convention itself. That approach was generally abandoned after 1972, when George McGovern struggled to find a willing running mate and then hastily chose Senator Tom Eagleton, whose previously undisclosed history of treatments for mental illness led to his resignation from the ticket under pressure just 18 days after his selection. The need for careful vetting was reinforced in 2008 when John McCain impulsively and in great secrecy picked little-known Alaska governor Sarah Palin, who subsequently proved to have some pretty alarming gaps in her knowledge base and threatened to upstage her senior partner on the campaign trail.

At the other end of the spectrum, there’s always the possibility that a candidate could not only choose but announce a running mate before winning the nomination, making the “ticket” a part of the campaign. It’s happened only twice: in 1976 when, shortly before the convention, Ronald Reagan announced Senator Richard Schweiker of Pennsylvania as his running mate in the unsuccessful hope of moving enough delegates from Gerald Ford to upset the incumbent; and in 2016 when another Republican, Ted Cruz, joined hands with former rival Carly Fiorina in April, soon after Trump had mathematically locked up the nomination.

Let’s just say the jury is out on the wisdom of this move, though it could work in certain circumstances. It has been mentioned in this cycle most often with respect to Joe Biden, who has reportedly considered naming a young pol early on to assuage concerns about his age.

The question of timing is heavily influenced by the criteria a candidate has for choosing a running mate. If, for example, a presidential aspirant is auditioning as a “unity candidate” in a divided party, aligning with someone from another part of the party might make sense, either as a primary-season tactic or a post-primary graceful gesture. In 2016, for example, it might in retrospect have saved Hillary Clinton a whole world of trouble had she chosen, well before the convention, a running mate (perhaps Sherrod Brown of Ohio, perhaps even Warren) who was pleasing to Bernie Sanders supporters.

A variation on the unity rationale for a relatively early veep choice is the need to address a particularly significant weakness displayed by the principal candidate. Let’s say, for the sake of argument, that midway through the primaries Warren is locked in a tight battle with Biden, who is still showing his current disproportionate strength among African-American voters. A “surprise” ticket with an African-American could make some tactical sense, particularly if she’s already comfortable with the prospective running mate and has done a full vet.

That brings us back to Gillum. He’s young (just 40), male, progressive without being abrasive about it, and, as noted above, from a crucial state. True, his highest office so far has been mayor of Tallahassee, but that’s a city with a population nearly twice as large as Pete Buttigieg’s South Bend.

Truth is we have no idea whether Gillum has become the apple of Warren’s eye or is just a good pol for her to know. Inaccurate veep speculation is a chronic disease of the chattering classes, emanating from campaign factions, would-be running mates, bored reporters, and even devious opponents. A wide consultation is indeed a good idea as long as the candidate doesn’t accidentally offend a prospect by raising expectations too high. In the end, running mates don’t usually matter that much in general elections, and the Democratic veep candidate isn’t likely to cut much ice in the kind of polarized cage match 2020 is certain to be. But as Biden shows, serving as vice-president can become a pretty good credential for a future run for the top job, so it will always be one of the greatest rewards a candidate can confer — and, as the cliché goes, the first key decision made by the next president of the United States. If the vetting process begins early and is serious, it could even encompass sooner rather than later a meaningful look at whether this or that option would make a good president."

Harris each draw 5 percent.

Although it’s just one survey, the findings suggest that Warren’s growing popularity, evident in other polls, comes from her increasing appeal beyond the party’s left wing. And with Warren also establishing herself as the second choice for many Democrats currently backing other candidates, she may be well-positioned to pick up more support as the field thins.

The GW Politics Poll is a joint venture of George Washington University’s School of Media and Public Affairs, Department of Political Science, and Graduate School of Political Management. The survey, conducted by YouGov and including interviews with 600 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, went into the field Sept. 26, two days after House Democrats announced their impeachment inquiry, and was completed Sept. 30. As a result, respondents were probably aware of Biden’s entanglement in the Trump-Ukraine drama but didn’t know about Sanders’s heart attack, which was revealed after the poll ended.

Warren appears to be broadening her appeal

Warren has throughout the campaign had her strongest support from the most liberal Democrats. And, not surprisingly, 4 in 10 voters who call themselves “very liberal” say they would vote for her. But the survey confirms she is now winning over other voters. Among Democrats who call themselves simply “liberal,” she is polling at 33 percent, 12 points ahead of Sanders and 17 points better than Biden.

AD

AD

Biden, meanwhile, continues to hold a lead among moderate and conservative Democrats, with 28 percent. But in what may be a sign of concern, he is polling just 12 points better among those voters than both Warren and Sanders.

Warren’s improvement among less liberal Democrats also means she’s doing slightly better with black voters, who are more ideologically conservative than whites. Long mired in single digits, Warren is at 13 percent among black voters (and Sanders at 12) in the GW Politics Poll, though she still trails Biden at 35 percent by a significant margin.

Warren’s image is also evolving. Respondents were asked whether they prefer elected officials who “make compromises with people they disagree with” or those who “stick to their positions.” Despite Warren’s reputation as a proponent of “uncompromising liberalism,” 34 percent of Democrats who said they prefer compromise are backing her. Among those who prefer politicians to stick to their positions, Sanders is the top choice (26 percent), with Biden at 20 percent and Warren at 18.

AD

AD

Warren is the prevailing second choice

Perhaps the poll’s most bullish finding on Warren comes from asking respondents whom they would support if their favored candidate dropped out or they had to choose someone else. Warren is the second choice of 34 percent of voters who support another candidate. That includes 45 percent of Biden voters and 31 percent of Sanders voters.

On the other hand, the numbers don’t look as good for Sanders and Biden. Sanders is the second choice of just 21 percent, and Biden is the second choice of 17 percent.

At the same time, Warren has work to do to win over voters who aren’t currently backing one of the other top-polling candidates (Biden, Sanders, Buttigieg and Harris). Among supporters of the many candidates polling below 5 percent, 20 percent have Biden as their second choice and 18 percent have Warren. This appears to be a function of ideology, as the lower-tier candidates’ supporters tend to be more moderate.

AD

AD

But views about Warren may also be less crystallized. Seventy-two percent of Democrats say they have a favorable impression of her, trailing Sanders (79 percent) and slightly better than Biden (69 percent). But 12 percent don’t know enough to give her a rating, twice as many as her two main rivals. Assuming Warren continues to get lots of media attention, that number will almost certainly diminish.

The implication of all this is that among the three front-runners, Warren appears to be in the best position to pick up supporters when other candidates start to pull the plug.

Warren’s rise isn’t about women

Finally, the GW Politics Poll also suggests that Warren’s rise is not being driven mainly by an increase in support among female voters. In an analysis for FiveThirtyEight in September, Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux found that Warren’s polling for most of the campaign had been about three points higher among women than men. In a reversal, our survey has Warren as the first choice of 29 percent of men and 26 percent of women.

AD

That suggests that an increase in the support of male voters is responsible for at least part of Warren’s recent trajectory. And the shift of the men’s vote may have come at Biden’s expense. Although Thomson-DeVeaux’s analysis found Biden polling roughly equally with men and women, in our survey he is at 22 percent among women but just 15 percent among men.

Of course, this one poll is a snapshot, and the state of the race remains fluid. But as the candidates take the debate stage Tuesday night, the recent news for Warren certainly appears favorable, especially as Biden and Sanders continue to contend with distractions on the campaign trail.

But Sanders, 78, may have the most riding on the debate, sponsored by CNN and the New York Times, as scrutiny of his age and endurance are greater than at any point in his nearly half-century political career. A strong performance could help calm the doubts about his prospects as the oldest candidate in the field, while a weak showing could deal a devastating blow to a campaign that was already slipping.

“I certainly expect that there are a lot of people who will question his age — even more than that question may have been raised before,” said Wayne Moynihan, a New Hampshire state representative who has endorsed Sanders. “It makes absolutely no difference to me, but I do recognize that it probably means something to someone else.”

The senator from Vermont’s performance has other implications for a fluid primary that has changed substantially since the last debate on Sept. 12. Both Biden and Warren would love to pull away supporters from Sanders, who has a loyal base of active devotees.

AD

Over the weekend, Sanders hinted at his plans. His campaign announced he would hold his first rally since his heart attack on Saturday in New York City. And in an interview with ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos,” Sanders, who often brushes aside questions about his differences with Warren, noted that she identifies strongly as a capitalist and he does not.

All this makes it the most consequential debate so far, and it will feature a few wild cards. Billionaire climate activist Tom Steyer is making his debate debut. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) has threatened to boycott the event. And with a dozen participants, it could become chaotic as candidates seek to break through the din.

“You have a lot of candidates on the stage with something to prove,” said Democratic strategist Rebecca Katz. “Biden has to prove that he is the most electable. Bernie has to prove that he is in as good a shape as ever. And Warren has to not mess up.”

AD

For Sanders, the personal and political pressures of the past two weeks have been extraordinary. He was hospitalized in Las Vegas after experiencing chest pains at an Oct. 1 campaign event. Doctors inserted two stents to clear a blocked artery, though the campaign did not initially disclose that he’d suffered a heart attack.

Just days later, Sanders’s daughter-in-law died of cancer at the age of 46. All this was happening after the senator was maintaining a breakneck campaign pace amid a growing threat from Warren’s rise.

While Sanders is by nature a private person when he campaigns, he has opened up a bit since the heart attack. He released a seven-minute direct-to-camera video on Thursday that touched on his experience in the hospital while tying it to Medicare-for-all, an approach that advisers hope Sanders continues.

AD

AD

Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. (D-Pa.), a Biden supporter, said he recently spoke with Sanders. He wished Sanders a speedy recovery and the two discussed the death of his daughter-in-law, Casey recalled. Despite the tough circumstances, “he sounded great,” Casey said.

On a conference call last week, Sanders thanked top campaign officials and told them to take care of their own health, according to Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, who serves as a Sanders campaign co-chair. Sanders said he plans to get back on the campaign trail and that his doctors predict a full recovery, Cohen said.

“I think the debate is an incredible opportunity for Bernie to reinvigorate his campaign,” Cohen said in an interview. Others who have spoken with Sanders say the signature elements of his personality — dry humor, an interest in policy and a strong desire to campaign — are coming through.

AD

AD

It’s unclear, though, whether Sanders will heed the advice of confidants who want him to publicly open up about his heart attack, at the debate and beyond. Before an earlier debate, advisers urged Sanders to sharply criticize Biden’s relationship with his donors, but he shied away from a full-on attack. And at the campaign’s outset, aides pressed Sanders to talk more about his personal story, but he soon dropped those efforts.

The bigger question may be whether following his heart attack, Sanders can convince enough primary voters that his age and health should not disqualify him from a hard-fought race against an aggressive Trump, let alone a job running the country. Many Democrats, while sympathizing with Sanders, suggested his physical well-being is reasonable for Democratic voters to consider.

“I feel terrible for Sen. Sanders. My heart goes out to him,” said Steve Westly, a California investor who is fundraising for Biden. “But let’s be honest: He’s 78 years old. When you are that age, you really want to be looking vibrant, healthy. You just, you can’t have people thinking you’re old, tired and likely to have serious health issues.”

AD

AD

Westly added, “It’s just hard to put a good spin on that one.”

Yet Biden is 76. And questions about age and health might extend Tuesday to candidates beyond Sanders, particularly Biden and Warren, who is 70. Like Sanders, they have agreed to release their health records before the first nominating contest in Iowa on Feb. 3.

Since he was discharged from the hospital, Sanders has repeatedly said he feels great. He has taken walks with his wife, Jane, and he played baseball with his grandchildren as he recuperated at home in Burlington, Vt.

In an interview with CNN, Sanders said his cardiologist, who he started seeing after his heart attack, said his recovery is going “very, very well.” Asked how severe his heart attack was, Sanders would not answer directly, saying he was told that “we are on the road to a full recovery” and “within the next month, we’ll see what happens.”

AD

AD

His Democratic rivals have been diplomatic regarding Sanders’s condition, wishing him a speedy recovery and voicing confidence he will bounce back. But they have been privately preparing to deal with potential questions from moderators about the subject on Tuesday night.

“What a tough time for him — genuinely,” Steyer said, adding that he had called Sanders. “Between him having a health incident and then losing his daughter-in-law . . . I think that must be so hard. And I really just wanted to send best wishes to him, and that’s all I really did.”

Asked whether an episode such as a heart attack should factor into voters’ choices, Steyer praised Sanders but did not answer directly.

AD

Younger candidates pushing a message of generational change — such as South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, 37, and former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke, 47 — will also appear onstage, creating the potential for lively discussions of age.

AD

“As the leader of the free world, it’s arguably the most stressful job, and we have to make sure our candidate is ready,” said Michael Tubbs, the mayor of Stockton, Calif. A Democrat who voted for Sanders in 2016 and is now undecided, Tubbs said age and health are fair questions for all candidates. “You want your president there for all four years,” he said.

Biden and Warren probably will face scrutiny on other fronts during the debate, strategists said. Congressional Democrats have embarked on an impeachment inquiry following revelations that Trump pressed the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter.

Trump and his allies have launched attacks on Biden that are unfounded but that some Democrats worry will nevertheless take a toll on his candidacy. And even some Democrats question why Hunter Biden was serving on the board of a Ukrainian firm while his father was the Obama administration’s point man on Ukraine. They wonder whether the furor will affect Biden’s electability, which is his main appeal for many Democrats.

Biden plans to challenge Trump in the debate, according to a person familiar with his strategy, and argue that the president is trying to handpick his 2020 opponent.

Warren has been steadily climbing in the polls, prompting more scrutiny of her left-leaning policies, including her support for Medicare-for-all and how it would affect middle-class taxes. Buttigieg called her explanation “extremely evasive” in a recent interview with CNN.

When it comes to Sanders, several of his prominent friends and supporters have advocated cutting back on his schedule when he plunges back into campaigning. Sanders, whose campaign calendar has been much fuller than most of his rivals’, has sent mixed signals about what it will look like after Tuesday.

After initially telling reporters that “we’re going to change the nature of the campaign a bit” by “probably not doing four rallies a day,” Sanders reversed himself the next day, saying in an interview with NBC News that he “misspoke” and “said a word I should not have said.” But the following day, he told to CNN that he probably will not be holding four rallies a day right away.

“I think for him and his family, yes, you’d like to see him hold fewer events because his message has gained traction without him,” said Kelley Monahan, the register of deeds in Grafton County, N.H., and a Sanders supporter.

Sanders’s campaign has faced questions and criticism for waiting more than two days before revealing publicly that he had a heart attack, another subject that could come up at the debate. He and his campaign have defended the decision to disclose only limited information at first.

Perhaps above all on Tuesday, it will be critical for Sanders to be self-assured, many Democrats say."

Most polls have shown Biden leading in the race for the 2020 presidential nomination, but Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has risen to a statistical tie with him in some recent surveys.

Six other Democratic candidates have released their third-quarter totals so far: Sanders; Buttigieg; Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California ($11.6 million); businessman Andrew Yang ($10 million); Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey ($6 million); and Sen. Michael F. Bennet of Colorado ($2.1 million).

President Trump’s campaign mocked Biden’s fundraising haul Thursday evening.

“HA! We did that in 3 days,” the campaign said in a tweet sent from its official account.

Biden held a flurry of fundraisers in the third quarter in an effort to collect checks for his campaign. Some donors have questioned whether the former vice president would be able to stay at the front of the money pack after a tough quarter marred by gaffes and misstatements. They also worry about his ability to sustain momentum among small-dollar donors.

AD

AD

In the second quarter, Biden raised $21.5 million — one of the largest quarterly hauls reported during that time. But the third quarter is notoriously difficult for fundraising due to the summer lull, especially for candidates like Biden, who do not have an established base of small-dollar online donors.

Warren, who has begun to eclipse Sanders’s standing among the Democratic Party’s most liberal voters, has not yet released her third-quarter fundraising totals.

Another candidate, author Marianne Williamson, said Thursday that she had raised slightly more than $3 million in the third quarter. While that almost equaled her campaign’s total take in the first two quarters of the year, she ended the most recent filing period with less than $656,000 on hand.

Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) participates in a climate forum with MSNBC's Ali Velshi at Georgetown University on Sept. 19. (Sarah Silbiger/Reuters)

In August, shortly after the second Democratic presidential debates, Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) got unpleasant news from his communications team. They did not see a path for him to grab the party's nomination. There was, as one aide put it, time for him to ""get out of this with a little bit of dignity"" and return to his eastern Ohio district with a much larger national reputation.

A little while later, Harta Communications left the campaign. Ryan's digital director, Erick Sanchez, signed up with Andrew Yang. But Ryan, one of seven Democratic candidates who did not qualify for this month's debate after missing last month's, kept running for president.

Democratic activists are grumbling about the size of the field — still the largest ever, even after eight candidates dropped out. Party leaders talk about impeachment drama “freezing” the race in place. But the candidates stuck in the 1 percent basement are hanging on. There could, still, be a moment to break out; there could be a scramble to find a “Biden alternative,” something candidates in the middle of the pack have spent months waiting for. And the stragglers want in on that, if it happens.

“I'm sure there are people who feel like there are too many people” on the debate stage, said Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, who entered the race in May, one month after Ryan, and didn't hit either donor or polling debate qualifications. “But I don't feel any hurry to go anywhere. I want to see, as people get closer to making decisions in Iowa, what they're going to decide.”

The seven Democrats still in the race who didn't make the debate stage are in that position for very different reasons and have wildly divergent resources. Bennet, who delayed the start of his campaign until after a successful cancer surgery, raised $2.8 million in his first two months as a candidate and has gotten raves from center-left tastemakers nervous about Joe Biden's age and messaging. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, who entered the race two weeks after Bennet, has a loud amen choir of Democratic strategists, eager for him to get more attention.

“Were it not for the new debate rules, Bullock would be looked at as a promising candidate who was in fine position to take off in the fall,” Jennifier Palmieri, a veteran of Hillary Clinton's 2016 bid, said in a September interview with the Atlantic.

Other straggling candidates don't have so many boosters. Marianne Williamson, who was a popular spiritual health author before the campaign and has become a popular Internet personality during the campaign, has no path to the debates, low favorability in polls of Democrats and no interest in quitting. She was even parodied in “Saturday Night Live's” season premiere, when better-polling candidates like Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Min..) were ignored. And she still draws crowds.

“Sometimes the political media elite talk about what the people think through the filter of why they think,” she explained in a talk with New York magazine. “They think people aren’t ready. That’s not my experience.”

John Delaney, whose Iowa state director jumped over from Williamson's campaign, has shrunk his staff over the past few weeks but argues that there's still opportunity that other candidates don't quite see. More than two years after entering the race, he is repositioning himself as the only candidate with business experience and business-friendly trade policies; not even Joe Biden, he points out, still supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Delaney does and sees an opening with trade-war-weary Iowans.

“We’re going to do 'Shark Tank'-type events to focus on job growth, and I need some different people to execute on that strategy,” Delaney said in an interview. “I have to figure out some way of distinguishing myself, and to the extent I have traction, it’s in rural Iowa. We just can’t continue to do stuff that I would describe as generic, showing up at the same things that everyone else is.”

Most Democrats are skeptical that there will be time for voters to take a second (or third, or seventh) look at their options. October, four months before the caucuses and right after the third pre-primary fundraising quarter, is not usually kind to insurgent candidates. In 2015, two of the low-polling Democrats in that presidential primary (Lincoln Chafee and Jim Webb) used October to quit the race. And that was without an impeachment inquiry dominating every news cycle, something Democrats in Iowa think will crowd out the lower-polling candidates.

“Unfortunately, I do” think that, said Sean Bagniewski, the chairman of Polk County's Democratic Party. “I believe it when Pelosi says it’ll be over by Thanksgiving, though. [That] leaves December and January open for some Hail Marys in Iowa.” (Pelosi and other Democrats have hinted at a quick impeachment inquiry, though there's no hard limit on how long it could last.)

One of the left-out candidates is trying for one; one isn't. Former Pennsylvania congressman Joe Sestak, a retired Navy admiral, has confused some Democrats with a busy, unexpected presidential campaign, focused almost entirely on personal campaign stops in Iowa and New Hampshire. In an interview after a September visit with Story County, Iowa, Democrats, Sestak said he'd build a “beachhead” in Iowa and “raised enough to keep us operative all the way to February,” though he would have to buy TV ads earlier than he expected. The reason: He was getting left out of the news.

“When I gave my speech at the New Hampshire [Democratic] convention,” Sestak said, “a woman who used to be the head of the party came up to me and said, 'great speech.' “ He recalled how he'd walked over to a TV booth, asked whether the talent wanted to interview him and buried his head in his hands when he realized they had not listened to his speech.

“I mean, that's okay,” he said he assured himself. ""I understand that. But they won't put me on the air or in the paper!""

The busy Sestak schedule — he held 23 public events in Iowa last month, many of them stops at labor or local party meetings — contrasts with the disappearance of a Florida mayor who is still, technically, running for president. Miramar, Fla., Mayor Wayne Messam, who entered the race six months ago with a small splash of national attention, quickly (and acrimoniously) parted with the consultants who courted that attention. He has not held a public event in an early-voting state since July 13, a “run with Mayor Wayne” town hall in South Carolina, after previously hinting that he would focus on the state.

“We have about 20 plus runners that have joined us on the trail,” Messam said in a Facebook video which did not show any of the other runners. “We're having a great dialogue.”

A spokesman for the New Hampshire Democratic Party said Messam's team never responded when invited to last month's state party convention; Bagniewski said Messam's team had initially passed on the steak fry, citing a “busy schedule,” and then ignored a follow-up from the county Democrats.

“Mayor Wayne Messam is still in the race,” a spokesman insisted in response to an email about his campaign schedule. “Please be advised that most of the multi-candidate forums have been limited to only the so-called top tier candidates or the ones that qualified for the debates and Mayor Messam has been excluded.”

Candidates in the middle of the pack could be under more pressure to break out than the stragglers, who weren't breaking into the news cycle anyway. Ryan has 71 days to file for reelection to his House seat, though risks to his political career remain low: He can run for two offices at once, no other Democrat has filed to run, and two Republicans — one of whom lost a 2018 race to Ryan by 22 points — have raised little money.

“He will continue to forge a path forward, and we’ll examine what our options are over the next several weeks,” said Mike Morley, a spokesman for Ryan. “We have not established internally a marker, but I expect that Congressman Ryan will assess all of his options.”

In the meantime, Ryan is getting what a House member might not pull on his own: national interest from the media. On Monday, he appeared on Fox News to defend the party's impeachment push and add to the chorus of Democrats worried about the party moving too far left.

“I don't think we should just go at rich people and say, 'Hey, we hate you, and we want you to pay more money,' “ Ryan said.

IMPEACHMENT WATCH

You can learn a lot about campaigns’ standing by what they don’t say. In the days after the House began its impeachment inquiry, Republicans claimed to have raised more than $15 million — $8.5 million for the Trump campaign alone in just two days. It was boosted by a 90-second digital ad, high-octane rage material urging conservatives to “stop this nonsense” over clips of Democrats explaining why they impeached. And on Tuesday, the campaign told the Associated Press that its joint fundraising with the RNC had piled up $125 million over the quarter — breaking records, thanks in part to the impeachment push.

Democrats haven’t said anything about their fundraising. Some campaigns refuse to say whether they saw particular boosts on particular days, and the Biden campaign offered no hint of its post-whistleblower fundraising, apart from a donor email warning that “Joe won’t have as much cash as Trump when the fundraising deadline hits.” There is no paid “covering fire” for Biden, or any Democrats; there is plenty for Republicans. The Republican National Committee has said it will spend $10 million on digital advertising that accuses Democrats of eschewing real work for “more hearings” — even, in the case of Rep. Max Rose (D-N.Y.), if they don’t support impeachment. The Congressional Leadership Fund is buying digital ads attacking some of the same members, describing impeachment itself as too divisive.

“Instead of working across the aisle to fix Washington, [Rep. Elissa] Slotkin is now pushing a radical scheme to impeach President Trump,” goes one ad running online in the freshman Democrat’s Michigan district.

Democrats are not yet doing much to defend their members. DNC chief executive Seema Nanda has urged Facebook not to let misinformation about the story play across its platform, something the social network has done to conspiracy sites but not political campaigns. At the same time, the committee is buying some Facebook ads, though it did not state the cost of the buy by Thursday afternoon.

But Need to Impeach, the grass-roots group founded and funded by Tom Steyer (who has stepped away from it to run for president), said Tuesday that it would spend $3.1 million on ads pressuring Senate Republicans in purple states: Sen. Martha McSally of Arizona, Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine.

AD WATCH

Bernie Sanders, “Fights for Us.” The first TV ad of the senator's 2020 bid comes one month earlier than his first 2016 ad; there's obviously much less need for him to make an introduction this year, but there's more competition. Unlike the first spot from the last campaign, this one starts with Sanders's own voice, describing how childhood struggles affected his life. ""Whether it was Wall Street, the drug companies or other special interests, Bernie has taken them on for us,"" a narrator says. The campaign has reserved $1.3 million worth of airtime for the spot.

John Bel Edwards, “Bipartisan.” Louisiana's Democratic governor is running for reelection less as a Democrat than as the guy who cleaned things up after two terms of Bobby Jindal, a Republican whom even Republicans have largely disowned.

“Two-thirds of the Republican-led legislature voted to fund TOPS [Taylor Opportunity Program for Students], save our hospitals and raise teacher pay,” says Republican state Sen. John Alario. “And Governor Edwards was willing to work with anyone committed to that goal,” says Richard Lipsey, a member of the board of regents. The closing message: Edwards did his best, so why throw him out?

Ralph Abraham, “It Ends.” A small problem for Republicans in Louisiana's race for governor is that the governor expanded Medicaid, and it has been popular. Neither Abraham nor business executive Eddie Rispone, the two Republicans competing for a runoff slot, say they would undo that expansion. Abraham has instead focused on the hasty implementation of the expansion, referring here to “tens of thousands of people in Medicaid who didn't even qualify” being added to the rolls.

In Louisiana, and in most red and purple states, the case against the expansion (which the Supreme Court made optional for states as part of its 2012 ruling on the health-care law) has been to cast Medicaid as a program for only the indigent, arguing that it is a failure of governance if people need to get onto a “government plan” instead of getting insurance through their jobs.

POLL WATCH

Should President Trump be impeached and removed from office? (CNN-SSRS, 1,009 adults)

Yes — 47%

No — 45%

In every poll since last week, support for impeachment has pulled into the 40s: not always a majority but usually a plurality. CNN's poll asks the question in the starkest way, one that fewer voters are comfortable with, and it finds a higher level of support than any call for any recent president's impeachment. The same poll, in 1998, never found support for impeaching Bill Clinton higher than support for censure or dropping the matter entirely. Polls during the George W. Bush and Barack Obama presidencies tended to find only hardcore partisan support for impeaching those presidents, never higher than the 30s.

Is asking a foreign leader for election help a good enough reason to impeach? (Quinnipiac, 1,115 registered voters)

Yes — 52%

No — 38%

All but the most loyal Trump voters describe this as reason enough to remove a president: The margin is 20 points for independents, five points for white voters and five points for all men. Only Republicans (17 percent), white men (42 percent) and white voters without college degrees (38 percent) oppose the idea that the president should be impeached if he leaned on a foreign leader for campaign dirt.

What are congressional Democrats' goals in the impeachment inquiry? (CBS News-YouGov, 2,059 adults)

Damage the president and harm his reelection — 53%

Protect American interests and investigate — 47%

Democrats were terrified of many things in the nine months before they moved toward an impeachment inquiry: conservative backlash, betting on facts that got debunked, being seen as reflexively partisan. The first polling on that last question does find that independents are more likely to see impeachment (or even exploring it) as a political act — and this is what Republicans have grabbed onto.

Did Joe Biden put pressure on Ukranian officials to lay off his son? (Monmouth, 1,161 registered voters)

Probably did — 42%

Probably didn't — 37%

To Democrats' dismay, whether they want Biden to be the nominee, the Trump administration and conservative media mobilized quickly after last week's whistleblower revelations, urging voters to ask whether Joe Biden was behaving ethically. No reporting has turned up evidence that Biden, who has spoken about the pressure he put on Ukraine to sack an incompetent prosecutor, made moves that directly helped his son, Hunter Biden, when he worked for a state energy company. But with just a week of accusations, including TV advertising, some of that messaging has sunk in with its intended, partisan audience.

IN THE STATES

Corey Lewandowski testifies during a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Sept. 17. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)

New Hampshire. Corey Lewandowski, the first of Donald Trump's three campaign managers, said Tuesday that he was unlikely to run for U.S. Senate in 2020.

“As much as I think I would be a great fighter for the people of New Hampshire, and one U.S. senator can make a difference, it is my priority to make sure the president of United States is reelected,” Lewandowski said on “New Hampshire Today,” a radio talk show.

Democrats had been salivating at the chance of challenging Lewandowski, who was popular with Republicans but had no obvious support from independents. National Republicans had grown bearish on the race after Gov. Chris Sununu opted not to run. Republicans still have a competitive primary, with former state House speaker Bill O'Brien running as the conservative loyalist.

“We didn't get into this without having surveyed the voters, and we found that [incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen] was struggling to get above 50 percent when we mentioned some of the things she has done and not done,” O'Brien said in a recent interview. “We find her falling back into the 40s when you talk about her vote on the Born Alive Act, when you talk about her opposition to the administration's tax relief.”

South Carolina. Two moderate Republicans are suing the South Carolina GOP over its decision to cancel the 2020 party primary, and former governor Mark Sanford — one of the president's three primary challengers — is welcoming it. Bob Inglis, a former congressman who lost a 2010 primary challenge to Trey Gowdy, is one of the plaintiffs; he told the Charleston Post & Courier that the state GOP denied “our voice in defining what the Republican Party is and who it supports.”

Sanford, who has adjusted to the decision by campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire, also welcomed the lawsuit, which cites previous party rules (in years without incumbent presidents) to argue that voters are being denied fair choices. “The State Executive Committee has chosen which candidate to support by fiat, and in doing so, excluded Republican voters from the process entirely — in violation of the law and its own rule,” the lawsuit reads.

For the next two weeks, the Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns — nearly two dozen of them — will be releasing their total fundraising from the start of July to the end of September. Full disclosure isn't necessary until Oct. 15, the day of the fourth debate, but there's a lot of strategy involved with this: It's in the interest of some campaigns to bury their totals and in the interest of others to find the moment when they could command the news cycle, even for a few hours.

So far, just four campaigns have revealed their third-quarter hauls.

Bernie Sanders. After a few weeks of “whither Sanders?” coverage, the campaign took a victory lap: It raised $25.3 million in the same quarter that it reached 1 million individual donors. In three months, 1.4 million donations had flowed into the campaign and more than 3.3 million had come since February, when Sanders entered the race.

“Media elites and professional pundits have tried repeatedly to dismiss this campaign, and yet working-class Americans keep saying loudly and clearly that they want a political revolution,” campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement. As in many of his statements, there was a reminder that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) would not make the same no-fundraisers promise if she became the party's nominee.

Sanders's total was the highest of any Democratic candidate so far, in any fundraising quarter. It was also slightly less than his haul from the third quarter of 2015, when he raised $26.2 million, establishing himself as a real competitor to Hillary Clinton.

Pete Buttigieg. He raised $19.1 million in the third quarter, down slightly from the $24.8 million he raised in the previous three months, a sum that immediately cemented him as a top-tier candidate. If Sanders's total surprised Democrats, who had wondered whether he was fading, so did Buttigieg's; he has fallen slightly in some trial heats of the early states, though his favorable numbers have been rising as he becomes better known.

Cory Booker. After a high-profile push for $1.7 million, Booker raised a bit more than $6 million; $2.2 million of that came after his emergency plea. Without the do-or-die campaign, Booker was still on track to raise more than the $4.5 million he put together in the second quarter; with the new money, the campaign intends to hire 40 more staffers.

Kamala Harris. She raised $11.6 million in the third quarter, better than some Democrats expected after a bad second debate seemed to slow down her campaign. She also promoted two staffers, Rohini Kosoglu and senior adviser Laphonza Butler, in a minor campaign shake-up after a few weeks of sluggish poll numbers.

And for the Democrats who haven't released their totals yet …

Tulsi Gabbard. The last 2020 Democrat to come out for an impeachment inquiry, Gabbard has criticized other candidates for raising money off it. “Candidates for POTUS who are fundraising off 'impeachment' are undermining credibility of inquiry in eyes of American people, further dividing our already fractured country,” she wrote on Twitter. “Please stop. We need responsible, patriotic leaders who put the interests of our country before their own.” So far, just a handful of Democrats have released impeachment-related fundraising appeals: Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Steve Bullock.

Elizabeth Warren. She welcomed a story in the Verge about Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who told employees that a Warren victory would “suck for us” and that if she tried to break up the company, “then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge.”

“Zuckerberg himself said Facebook is 'more like a government than a traditional company,'” Warren tweeted. “They’ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, undermined our democracy, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.”

Amy Klobuchar. She made her first campaign stop in Seattle, albeit to a smaller crowd than the one Warren spoke to last month. “I’ve got a plan, yes,” she told voters at a crowded coffee shop. “But it’s got deadlines.”

The “top” candidates talk the most about security policy.

The Democratic candidates have increasingly discussed foreign policy not just on the debate stage, but also on the campaign trail.

AD

One way to track this is by checking how often security has been mentioned in the top candidates’ social media accounts, defining top candidates as those polling above 2 percent support nationally as of the first debate in late June. I collected tweets using the Twitter API and WorkbenchData to pick up references to well-defined foreign affairs, leaving off trade and immigration so as to focus on security-related issues such as Afghanistan, cyberwarfare, U.S.-Iran relations and North Korea.

AD

The three top-tier candidates — using The Washington Post’s most recent ranking of front-runner Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) — have been commenting comparatively often on security issues. Since the June debate, security was the topic of 15.2 percent of Biden’s tweets and 14.5 percent of Warren’s. That’s a significantly larger proportion than those from some of the candidates still working to establish themselves as viable, such as former Housing Secretary Julián Castro with 9.3 percent and Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.) with 9.1 percent.

Substantively, these messages often focused on the security implications of climate change, driven in part by CNN’s September climate town hall. But they also discussed the future of the Afghanistan mission, veterans’ issues, and U.S.-Russia relations.

AD

2. Republicans’ advantage on national security has faded.

AD

By talking about national security, the top Democratic candidates are working to craft images as potential commanders in chief. That’s more likely to succeed than in years past. Republicans no longer have the monopoly on appearing strong on national security, as traditional party “stereotypes” keep weakening.

In 2014, Gallup found that Americans were 23 percentage points more likely to say Republicans would do better than Democrats at protecting the country from international threats; by 2018, the gap had shrunk to only 6 points. This is compounded by the fact that public approval vs. disapproval for the president’s handling of foreign policy has seen a negative 10-percentage-point swing since summer 2018.

AD

AD

During last week’s debate, the candidates took advantage of that growing gap between the Trump administration’s actions and general American opinion, charting a middle course between respecting the public’s skepticism about intervention abroad while remaining largely opposed to stepping back from key commitments.

The field’s two military veterans — Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii) — clashed on the future of U.S. involvement in Syria. But most of the candidates rejected Gabbard’s vision for wholesale departure in favor of Buttigieg’s call for measured engagement. Even Warren, the party’s front-runner and advocate for a decreased presence in the region, remarked that the Islamic State could not be allowed purchase and that withdrawal would have to be done “the right way, the smart way.”

AD

Meanwhile, nearly all the candidates talked about combating Russian political interference in U.S. elections. Biden aimed for the security “middle” by arguing most fervently in favor of renewing support to NATO allies. And Sanders argued for continued mitigation measures on climate change through support for policies like the Green New Deal. While Warren didn’t mention it in the debate, her platform specifically identifies the military as a venue for implementing climate action, calling for limiting military dependence on fossil fuels, hardening facilities against extreme weather and investing billions into research on “microgrids and advanced energy storage.”

AD

3. The Syria withdrawal works to the Democratic candidates’ advantage

AD

Both Booker and former congressman Beto O’Rourke noted the national security community’s disapproval, specifically mentioning retired general and Trump’s former defense secretary Jim Mattis. Invoking Mattis’s past remarks that the United States had two powers in foreign affairs — “intimidation and inspiration” — Booker called for relying on the diplomatic corps to “focus on the latter power.” And Biden similarly drew on the ex-military community’s disapproval for the decision when he explicitly noted that “commanders across the board, former and present, are ashamed” of the withdrawal.

AD

As the Democratic field tightens in coming months, we can expect an even larger shake-up in how the candidates and parties position themselves on national security.

The Democratic field has split up the donor base, which is giving to multiple candidates or not giving at all until donors see the primary field narrow.

AD

Two other candidates released their figures Tuesday, providing a sense of how wide-ranging the fundraising totals were among Democratic candidates as they slogged through the notoriously difficult summer fundraising months.

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, announced that his campaign raised more than $19.1 million in the third quarter — less than Sanders did but an amount that gives him staying power in a crowded field.

Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), announced raising $11.6 million — on par with her haul last quarter. Her campaign said she entered the fourth quarter with $10 million in cash on hand.

AD

Sanders (I-Vt.) transferred an additional $2.6 million from his other federal campaign accounts, the campaign said.

The third-quarter figure announced by the Sanders campaign rivals his $26 million haul at this point in the primary campaign in 2015, when he stunned the Democratic field by nearly matching the total of his opponent, Hillary Clinton, with an infusion of money from donors giving less than $200. Yet this time, he is facing more than a dozen opponents.

AD

The massive third-quarter haul is welcome news for Sanders supporters, who have seen their candidate fall behind former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in some recent polls. The Sanders campaign has also been dealing with staff turmoil in the key early states of Iowa and New Hampshire.

AD

But Sanders’s formidable fundraising email list, which has been without an equal in recent years, could help him weather those challenges into a crucial fall stretch.

The Sanders campaign offered a glimpse of where it is spending some of its cash, announcing its first paid TV commercial of the campaign Tuesday afternoon. The ad, which will begin a two-week run in Iowa on Thursday, is backed by $1.3 million for airtime, the campaign said.

“In this moment, we need a fighter — Bernie Sanders,” says the narrator in a 60-second version of the commercial. The ad shows clips of Sanders speaking at campaign rallies, marching with workers and greeting supporters.

AD

AD

Buttigieg’s reported third-quarter contributions were less than what his campaign raised in the second quarter — when he surpassed all of his Democratic opponents with $24.8 million. But they were far greater than his first-quarter total of $7.1 million, when he entered the race as a relative unknown.

His campaign has spent the past quarter aggressively building its operation and investing in early states, notably rolling out television ads in Iowa that seek to differentiate Buttigieg from Warren and Sanders when it comes to health care.

In addition, Buttigieg has more than doubled his staff members in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada over the past several months.

AD

Harris saw a bump in fundraising and polling at the end of the second quarter thanks to a headline-grabbing debate performance in June, but she has struggled to maintain momentum and slipped in the polls in subsequent weeks.

AD

Harris had a full fundraising schedule this summer to increase donations and sustain her campaign. She recently announced plans to expand her campaign in Iowa and South Carolina through November.

Candidates have until Oct. 15 to file fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission, but those with noteworthy numbers typically share their totals soon after a quarter ends. Monday was the final day of the third quarter, which began July 1.

AD

While Sanders’s support in the polls has fluctuated in his second run for president, his fundraising ability has been a reliable asset that has continued to stun some Democrats.

Campaign officials declined Tuesday to specify how much he had in cash on hand by the end of the quarter.

In a statement, campaign manager Faiz Shakir compared Sanders’s appeal among small-dollar donors to Trump’s. The president has consistently drawn donations from individuals giving less than $200.

AD

Their contributions can fuel campaigns for a longer period of time, because it takes longer for such donors to reach the $2,800 maximum they can donate to a primary campaign.

AD

The Democratic nominee will eventually face off against Trump’s successful small-dollar fundraising operation.

Sanders and Warren have opted not to host private fundraisers catering to wealthy donors.

Still, Sanders has supplemented his online fundraising with occasional in-person events his campaign has dubbed “grass-roots fundraisers.” The gatherings, held in big cities such as San Francisco and New York, have featured far lower entry fees than the typical private fundraisers.

One such event in Hollywood in late July included opening musical performers. Actor Danny Glover appeared at a San Francisco fundraiser in June.

Democratic donors fueled campaigns and groups with a record-breaking amount of small-dollar donations on the last day of the third quarter, according to ActBlue, a Democratic fundraising platform.

AD

AD

ActBlue announced that on Monday, it had recorded the largest number of individual contributions in a day since its founding in 2004.

WinRed, the GOP platform for online donations, said Tuesday that it processed more than $13.7 million in donations from more than 276,000 contributors in the six days since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced the impeachment inquiry, drawing on Trump’s online donors showing their support for the president."

AD

AD

The maneuvering paid off in a big way this week, when Sanders scored one of the biggest coups of the primary season, as Omar announced late Tuesday she was endorsing him and Ocasio-Cortez plans to do the same on Saturday.

A third member of the Squad, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), has opened the door to endorsing Sanders. Sanders’s campaign announced Wednesday that he will join Tlaib for a tour of her Detroit district later this month.

Two weeks ago, Sanders, 78, had a heart attack that raised questions about his health, drew attention to his age and prompted doubts about the viability of his campaign.

The endorsements suggest that despite Warren’s recent rise, the fight for the allegiance of the party’s liberal wing is far from over, and that Sanders still commands the loyalty of many Democrats who want the party to move sharply to the left.

AD

AD

The three lawmakers in many ways symbolize the youth, vitality and diversity of a new generation of Democrats. Although some in the party privately question whether the endorsements will win over many voters not already committed to Sanders, they have the potential to help him move past the most difficult chapter of his campaign, marked by falling polls as well as the heart attack.

“This isn’t just about the horse race — it also helps Team Bernie turn the page from last week and start looking forward,” said Democratic strategist Rebecca Katz. “ ‘Bernie is back’ is a real thing.”

Katz was referring to the catchphrase the Sanders campaign is using to brand his return to the campaign trail after his hospitalization. After a well-received debate performance Tuesday night, Sanders plans to hold his first rally since his health scare on Saturday in Queens, N.Y., where Ocasio-Cortez will join him.

AD

AD

Aides have eagerly been promoting the event and Sanders teased the rally at the debate, saying he would have a “special guest” though not identifying the person. With a large online following and high name recognition, Ocasio-Cortez could energize the rally and become a significant asset for the Sanders campaign in her home state and potentially beyond.

Few figures hold as much sway with the party’s liberal wing as Ocasio-Cortez, who at age 30 represents a new generation of young left-leaning activists who are pushing such ideas as the Green New Deal and show an easy deftness with social media.

Omar, 38, like Ocasio-Cortez is part of the wave of Democrats, many of them women, who swept into the House in 2018 powered by a backlash against President Trump. The two lawmakers also reflect the growing diversity of the Democratic Party. Omar, a Somali American, is the first woman in Congress to wear a hijab, a Muslim head covering, while Ocasio-Cortez is of Puerto Rican descent.

AD

AD

In some ways, endorsing Sanders was a natural choice for Ocasio-Cortez. She worked as a volunteer for Sanders’s 2016 presidential bid and, like the senator, identifies as a democratic socialist. On health care, climate change and a federal jobs guarantee, the two are closely aligned.

But the emergence of Warren as a liberal alternative to Sanders, who has been outperforming him in the polls and would make history as the first female president, created uncertainty about what Ocasio-Cortez would do. Both Sanders and Warren aggressively courted Ocasio-Cortez, collaborating on legislation with the congresswoman, dining with her and showing support for her on social media.

Yet it was Sanders who prevailed in the endorsement chase, with an approach that mirrored his strategy for winning voters: methodical, policy-driven and consistent.

AD

AD

“A lot of good conversations. A lot of good, thoughtful conversations,” Shakir said after Tuesday’s debate, explaining the process that won her over.

He said the endorsements were part of a larger plan heading into the final months before the first nominating contest, the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses. “We thought it would be very helpful to start rolling these out in October and keep building momentum into November and December and ultimately, hopefully, win the Iowa caucuses,” said Shakir.

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a Sanders campaign co-chair, said the biggest benefit of the endorsements “is the message that Bernie Sanders resonates with young people, with communities of color, with women.” Sanders has sometimes struggled to attract African American audiences.

AD

Campaign officials hope the endorsements will lead to more support. In an email to top campaign personnel Wednesday, Sanders’s political team said it was eager to roll out a new slate of state-level endorsements, but was holding off until next week to allow for more time to woo people who may have been swayed by the debate and the congressional endorsements.

AD

It was after Sanders had his heart attack that Omar privately told him she would support him, according to the aide close to her, though she had long been moving in that direction. The campaign announced the endorsement Tuesday night after The Washington Post reported Ocasio-Cortez’s forthcoming support.

On Wednesday, the Sanders campaign released a video featuring Omar.

AD

“The senator is the only candidate that isn’t about leaning a particular way, but being true to yourself and fighting for what you believe regardless of what the obstacles are,” Omar says in the video. In her Iowa speech, the ideal president she described closely resembled Sanders.

Omar was swayed by Sanders primarily because of his policy positions, said her aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid. The two teamed up on a bill to curb student debt earlier this year, and this week they introduced a joint legislative proposal for a universal school meals program.

AD

The one member of the Squad who has not signaled at least the possibility of endorsing Sanders is Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), who represents a district in Warren’s home state and is publicly neutral. A spokesperson for Pressley distanced her from the decisions of other congresswomen Wednesday.

AD

“Ayanna has tremendous respect for her sisters-in-service. Ultimately, these political decisions are made as individuals,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “Ayanna knows that taking back the White House in 2020 is a top priority, and she is working every day to hold this administration accountable and build a bold, diverse movement that will help propel Democrats to victory up and down the ballot.”

Support from members of the Squad is not risk-free and could alienate more moderate Democrats. At times, the lawmakers have stoked controversy within their party’s ranks.

AD

In February, for example, Omar faced a forceful rebuke from Democratic leaders for suggesting that Israel’s allies in American politics were motivated by money rather than principle. She apologized for her comments.

Trump has also attacked the members of the Squad, at one point suggesting they should “go back” to their own countries — even though they are American citizens — and has sought to make them the face of the Democratic Party. He recently held a rally in Omar’s district.

But Sanders campaign officials said that trying to design an approach in anticipation of what critics will say is a faulty strategy. The best bet, they said, is to lean into your core beliefs.

“Look, the haters are gonna hate regardless,” said Nina Turner, a national co-chair of the Sanders campaign. “So why not just ride this thing on out and do it in a way where the senator has the ability to do the greatest amount of good?”

It remains unclear whether Sanders’s campaign can fully rebound following the candidate’s heart attack, which required not only a hospital stay but also the insertion of two stents in an artery and drew renewed attention to his age. But for Sanders, the past 48 hours have been some of the most productive of the race.

He raised more than $620,000 from 40,000-plus contributions Tuesday, his campaign said.

Thirty-five percent of all money raised on ActBlue — the main online clearinghouse Democrats use to raise money — between the hours of 9 and 10 p.m. Eastern time went to Sanders, the campaign said, even though there are 18 Democrats in the race and 12 appeared on the debate stage.

But sustaining momentum has been a challenge. After an impressive start, Sanders stagnated over the summer and struggled to keep up with Warren and Biden in the polls. Campaign officials are hoping things will turn out differently this time, particularly as the year’s end is rapidly approaching and candidates do not have unlimited time to mount a surge.

“This is the moment, in our perspective, that everything has to move in the upward direction,” Shakir said. “It was our view that we wanted to start off the fourth quarter with some strength. I think rolling out a couple major endorsements of people who can inspire a lot of young people around this country is a good marker, I hope, of success in the next months to come.”"

“I would be very open about the experience he had,” said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a national co-chair of the Sanders campaign who made his pitch to the senator in a brief telephone conversation last week. “I think it can show a resilience, a sense of empathy and a sense of vulnerability.”

AD

Sanders supporters privately acknowledge concern that the heart attack could give voters second thoughts about the candidate, who would be the oldest president in history if elected. In an effort to move beyond the setback, some hope he can seize on the event to transmit a softer side that’s eluded him.

The goal, said Khanna, would be to “make a very human connection.” He said he texted the senator’s wife, Jane Sanders, last week to tell her that this could be Sanders’s “FDR moment,” referring to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose battle with polio is sometimes said to have contributed to his empathy for the less fortunate.

The sensitivity of dealing with the heart attack has been evident since the episode occurred. The campaign did not immediately disclose the heart attack, initially saying only that Sanders had experienced chest pains and had two stents inserted in an artery.

AD

AD

Advisers and friends also say Sanders should consider easing his breakneck campaign pace. Sanders has been sprinting across the country, holding multiple events per day, maintaining a speed that has surpassed his top rivals.

“If I were giving him advice, I would tell him just slack up a little bit,” said former Senate majority leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), who visited Sanders in a Las Vegas hospital last week. “Even if he slacks up a little bit, he’s campaigning more than anybody else.”

Sanders spent Monday recuperating at home in Burlington, Vt. On a conference call with staff, he reiterated that the movement he has been leading is not about him, a theme he often hits in campaign speeches.

AD

“If there’s anything that this event kind of tells us, it is the importance of what our message is in this campaign. And our message is ‘Us, not me,’ ” Sanders said, according to a person with knowledge of his remarks.

AD

Campaign officials have signaled that he is not expected to return to the trail until the Oct. 15 debate near Columbus, Ohio. That makes the debate a critical event for the campaign, as Sanders will face considerable scrutiny from voters and rivals sizing up his health and vitality.

“Bernie is raring to go, and his campaign staff has been trying to hold him back until the debate,” said Ben Cohen, who co-founded Ben & Jerry’s ice cream and serves as a national co-chair of the campaign. “The plan is for the debate to be his reentry into the race.”

AD

People with knowledge of the situation said there had been a period of uncertainty about the campaign’s future in the immediate aftermath of Sanders’s hospitalization for chest pains last week. The campaign suspended an Iowa ad buy and made reassuring calls to supporters during those first hours.

AD

But in recent days, the campaign has shown determination to move full speed ahead. The Iowa ad touting Sanders will be on the airwaves starting Tuesday.

The campaign rolled out a new policy proposal Monday aimed at curtailing the role of money in politics. It would eliminate big-dollar fundraising for all federal elections, enact a constitutional amendment to declare that campaign contributions are not speech and end corporate contributions to the party conventions.

AD

Surrogates campaigned for Sanders in the key early states over the weekend, a strategy the campaign plans to continue. Cohen said he plans to campaign for Sanders this weekend in New Hampshire.

The campaign is also aggressively calling voters. After establishing a goal of making a million calls in the early primary states over the past 10 days, it beat that goal by 300,000 calls, the campaign said.

AD

Sanders and his allies have also used his heart attack to

call attention to his push to enact a Medicare-for-all universal health-care system. They note that while Sanders was fortunate to have access to good doctors and treatment, many Americans do not.

AD

And Sanders has already begun showing a more personal side of himself. When he left the hospital on Friday, he stood shoulder-to-shoulder with his wife, Jane, smiling and waving. When he returned to Burlington, reporters there noted Sanders saying he was “happy to be home” before walking inside where family was waiting.

On Monday, he and Jane took a walk in the rain, and he joked with reporters he said should get paid more for working in the drizzle.

When he launched his second campaign for president early this year, advisers encouraged Sanders to speak about his participation in the civil rights movement and his modest upbringing in Brooklyn. He mentioned those things at early campaign stops. But as time went on, they faded from his stump speeches.

“He’s somewhat reticent to talk about his own . . . life experiences,” said Cohen. “But I think it’s helpful for him to do that and it’s certainly only a decision that he can make, but I do think this is an opportunity for him to talk.”

Sanders has been trailing former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) in many recent polls, sparing him the pressure that can face the front-runner. His Democratic ­rivals have either wished Sanders well or brushed aside questions about his physical fitness for office. And President Trump and his allies have been preoccupied with the impeachment inquiry.

These external events have led some Sanders allies to conclude that he does not have to rush back onto the national stage.

In a sign of how the Sanders movement has charged ahead without him on the trail, a video created by a supporter arguing that he’s been criticized unfairly by the media had received 6 million views as of late Monday.

As Sanders recovers, his campaign has taken steps to reassure staffers and supporters, scheduling calls and other outreach to keep allies focused.

The problem emerged at a critical moment for Sanders and the Democratic campaign. The senator had just announced he had raised an impressive $25.3 million in the year’s third quarter, giving him a boost at a time when rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) had been gaining ground. Now he’ll be off the campaign trail for an unknown period, with the next Democratic debate rapidly approaching on Oct. 15.

Age and health have loomed over the 2020 presidential race more than any such contest in recent history. The three leading candidates for the Democratic nomination are septuagenarians — Sanders, 78; former vice president Joe Biden, 76; and Warren 70 — who have faced scrutiny over their physical well-being.

The Democrats are vying for a chance to face President Trump, 73, who was the oldest person in history to be sworn in as president for the first time. Although Trump’s physicians have given him a clean bill of health — sometimes extravagantly — he pointedly enjoys fast food and avoids exercise, despite holding one of the highest-pressure jobs in the world.

While some older presidents, such as Ronald Reagan, have been seen as reassuring father figures, others, like John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama, have appealed to voters as youthful, energetic leaders. “I think age is an issue for some voters as a proxy for being able to do the job and a proxy for being an agent of change,” said Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson.

Facing a younger crop of Democratic candidates running on generational change, Biden, Warren and Sanders have sought creative ways to project youthfulness and vigor. Sanders played in a summer softball game and reminds voters he used to be a competitive runner. Biden told reporters over the summer he rides a Peloton bike to keep fit. And Warren frequently jogs to the stage at her events.

But they have also had to deal with concerns from voters, questions from rival Democrats, provocations from Trump and, occasionally, injury or illness. Biden, whose gaffes, misstatements and sometimes meandering speeches have plagued his campaign, has absorbed the brunt of these broadsides.

AD

At the first Democratic debate, then-candidate Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) urged Biden to “pass the torch.” Biden snapped back, “I’m still holding onto that torch!”

In the September debate, former Housing and Urban Development secretary Julián Castro went after Biden in a way that many saw as a dig at his mental acuity. “Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?” Castro asked Biden during a heated exchange over health care.

After the debate, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) took his own swipe at Biden. “I think that we are at a tough point right now because there’s a lot of people who are concerned about Joe Biden’s ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling,” Booker told CNN.

AD

The next day, Biden promised to release his medical records “before there’s a first vote,” referring to the Iowa caucuses Feb. 3. He also tried to defuse the tension surrounding the subject, jokingly asking a reporter, “Man, you want to wrestle?”

AD

That didn’t put the topic to rest, and Trump has been particularly persistent in needling Biden about his mental sharpness. On Wednesday, the president said Biden was “less smart now than he ever was.”

Sanders, whose gruff persona has been parodied in popular culture for years, with comedian Larry David portraying him as a grumpy old man on “Saturday Night Live,” has long sought to brush off questions about his age.

AD

“I think you look at the totality of a candidate,” Sanders said recently on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” responding to concerns about his age voiced by former president Jimmy Carter, himself 95. “I’m in good health and running a vigorous campaign.”

Sanders, Biden and Warren have all committed to releasing their health records before the first nominating contest, although none has done so yet.

AD

An artery blockage such as Sanders’s typically has a good prognosis and does not normally require a long time to bounce back from, medical experts said.

“People recover very quickly,” said Steven Nissen, chief academic officer at Cleveland Clinic’s Heart & Vascular Institute. “Often they can be back to work in days, and certainly within weeks.”

AD

Nissen said he does not think age was a big factor in Sanders’s case, but “clearly if you’re older, you do have other issues that may come up.”

Coronary arteries, which feed blood to the heart muscle, can become blocked over time, and as the artery narrows it reduces blood flow and can cause chest pains.

When a patient such as Sanders comes in complaining of chest pains, doctors usually perform an angiogram to diagnose the problem, said Elizabeth Klodas, a cardiologist in Minneapolis. That means inserting a small catheter that goes up to the heart area, where it can inject dye into the coronary arteries, allowing doctors to see them through X-ray.

AD

AD

When the chest pains struck Sanders on Tuesday, he was in the midst of a busy campaign swing that took him from New Hampshire to Nevada. He had planned to hopscotch across California in the coming days.

That’s consistent with Sanders’s breakneck campaign pace in recent months. Last Sunday he made three stops in New Hampshire, followed by four more Monday, then flew to Nevada for a grass-roots fundraiser Monday night.

That tempo contrasts sharply with Biden, who normally conducts one or two events a day.

But there have been signs that the aggressive clip has taken a toll on Sanders. The senator lost his voice during a trip to Denver in early September, and it was still raspy at a debate a few days later. His campaign canceled two days’ worth of events in South Carolina a week later so he could rest his vocal cords.

In March, Sanders received seven stitches on his head after what a spokeswoman described as an injury from the edge of a glass shower door. The injury did not prevent him from appearing at scheduled campaign events.

Injuries and illnesses, even those that are not severe, can present challenges for a campaign, and it’s not clear whether Sanders’s latest health issues will factor into how voters see him.

In 2000, former senator Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) had to reassure voters his irregular heartbeat was not a significant problem. When former senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1992, he went to great lengths to show voters he had recovered from non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, though he died five years later of problems related to the cancer.

Hillary Clinton and her team had to combat conspiracy theories about her health, many of them spread by Trump supporters, after she experienced a fainting spell in 2016.

AD

It was unclear late Wednesday how long Sanders would be off the campaign trail or if the episode would change his approach to the race. A campaign spokesman declined to immediately provide more details about Sanders’s condition but said he was recovering at a Las Vegas hospital.

Before Wednesday’s news, the Sanders campaign had been planning to plow ahead aggressively in the key early nominating states and to air its first ad.

But Wednesday the campaign abruptly put off plans for a $1.3 million investment to air the ad in Iowa. “It’s just a postponement,” said campaign spokesman Bill Neidhardt. He declined to elaborate further or explain the reasoning behind the delay.

The campaign had touted the commercial as recently as Tuesday night, presenting it as part of a larger strategy to perform well in the early states. Campaign manager Faiz Shakir had told supporters on a call that the campaign would be “up on the air aggressively over the next few weeks leading up to the debate on October 15.”

Sanders’s Democratic primary opponents, meanwhile, wished him a swift recovery Wednesday. Warren said she texted and called Sanders but had not heard back. “I’m sure Bernie will be back on the trail soon. He’s tough,” she said.

Booker added, “Whatever you want to think about Bernie Sanders, I think most of America agrees that is one tough guy.”"

Born on Oct. 1, 1924, in Plains, Ga., the typically cheery and humble former Navy lieutenant has had a life of service. Before taking office as president, he served as a state senator in Georgia and as governor.

AD

His presidency — remembered for the Camp David accords, the Iran hostage crisis and the creation of the Departments of Energy and Education — flamed out during the election of 1980, when Ronald Reagan defeated him.

After leaving the White House in 1981, Carter, then 56, and his wife, Rosalynn, returned to their hometown in southern Georgia. Yet another distinction: Carter has been a former American president longer than anyone.

He remains engaged in the causes and activities that matter most, the Carter Center’s director of communications, Deanna Congileo, told The Post earlier this year.

AD

He participates in Carter Center programs in global peace and health and annual Habitat for Humanity builds, and he received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002, for work during and after his time in office. He also continues to teach Sunday school lessons and courses at Emory University.

AD

“Both President and Mrs. Carter are determined to use their influence for as long as they can to make the world a better place. Their tireless resolve and heart have helped to improve life for millions of the world’s poorest people,” Congileo wrote in an email to The Post in March, as he surpassed Bush’s record for longest-living president.

In 2015, Carter announced doctors had discovered a form of melanoma that spread to his brain.

AD

“I just thought I had a few weeks left, but I was surprisingly at ease,” Carter said at a news conference that August. “I’ve had an exciting and adventurous and gratifying existence.”

He received his first radiation treatment at 90. Four months later, he was — remarkably — cancer-free.

Bush, the 41st president, died on Nov. 30. Carter attended the funeral in Washington, along with President Trump and former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton and, of course, Bush’s son George W.

AD

Carter says he takes pride in having “always told the truth.” He also says he is proud that former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) “comported themselves with dignity, talked about issues that matter and presented a vision for our nation,” during the 2016 presidential election. Still, thinking back on more than 40 years, Carter told The Post last year that he “regrets not doing more to unify the Democratic Party.”

AD

His 2016 message to the younger generation of voters was: “Stay engaged. Stay involved. And be sure to vote.”

Last month, at a Carter Center event, the former president, who voted for Sanders in Georgia’s 2016 Democratic primary, said he is keeping “an open mind” about the 2020 Democratic candidates.

“One of the major factors I will have in my mind is who can beat Trump,” he said.

AD

At that same event, Carter was asked what it would take for him to run for president again. The questioner noted that Grover Cleveland had served two nonconsecutive terms in the late 19th century.

“I hope there’s an age limit,” Carter said with a big grin as he sat next to the former first lady.

AD

“You know, if I were just 80 years old, if I was 15 years younger, I don’t believe I could undertake the duties that I experienced when I was president,” he said. “For one thing, you have to be very flexible with your mind. You have to be able to go from one subject to another and concentrate on each one adequately and then put them all together in a comprehensive way.”

Carter added that presidents “also have to adopt new ideas.”

“The things I faced just in foreign affairs, I don’t think I could undertake them if I was 80 years old,” he continued. “So 95 is out of the question. I’m having a hard time walking. I think the time has passed for me to be involved actively in politics, much less run for president.”

Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said the congresswomen could excite younger voters.

The endorsements could be a blow for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who, like Sanders, is running on a platform of sweeping liberal change and who has emphasized her role as a female pioneer.

Her backing was a sought-after prize in the Democratic primary, and it was widely assumed that she would endorse either Sanders or Warren, the most liberal figures in the contest.

President Trump has attacked the members of the Squad, at one point suggesting they should “go back” to their own countries — even though they are American citizens — and has sought to make them the face of the Democratic Party. He recently held a rally in Omar’s district.

Sanders and Warren have been battling for the support of the women, holding individual meetings with them, co-sponsoring their legislation and wishing them well on social media. On Tuesday, Sanders unveiled legislation with Omar to enact a universal school meals program.

Sanders, a 2020 presidential candidate, told the New York Times last month while introducing his wealth tax that he does not think billionaires should exist.

Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have proposed to enact a wealth tax on the accumulated assets of multimillionaires and billionaires. Either proposal would cost the Facebook founder tens of billions of dollars over time but would not eliminate billionaires in America.

Sanders’s plan introduces a new 1 percent wealth tax on those with assets over $32 million and then increases that rate in steps until it reaches 8 percent for those with more than $10 billion. Warren’s plan would institute a tax of 3 percent for wealth above $1 billion, as well as a 2 percent rate for those with more than $50 million.

The plans come amid the rapid growth of inequality in the United States, with the 400 richest Americans — representing only 0.00025 percent of the population — tripling their share of the national wealth since the early 1980s. The richest 400 Americans control as much of the national wealth as the bottom 60 percent of the population.

Zuckerberg would be directly impacted by the wealth taxes proposed by Sanders and Warren. He would owe the federal government an additional $5.5 billion in taxes in the first year of Sanders’s proposed tax, should it ever be enacted, according to Sanders’ campaign.

In 2016, Hillary Clinton won nearly 2.9 million more votes than Trump — reminding us that winning a majority of voters doesn’t mean winning the presidency.

AD

AD

But early head-to-head polls aren’t useless. They reveal important demographic patterns that help us understand how candidates would perform in the electoral college. A candidate who can’t appeal to key demographic groups in swing states will have a much harder time winning the presidency.

So which of the leading Democratic candidates has demographic strengths that would be an advantage in the electoral college?

Here’s how I did my research

To answer this question, I used data from two recent Quinnipiac national polls that reported how different demographic groups said they would vote in hypothetical matchups between Trump and each of the five major Democratic candidates. With this, we can measure the difference between candidates’ support in each demographic group and their overall level of support.

AD

AD

Next, we compare these differences to the results of the 2016 election, asking whether a candidate is doing better or worse than Clinton did, and with which groups. Using these comparisons, and a statistical model built from state election returns, exit polls and census data, we can adjust the 2016 results to create a hypothetical 2020 election. This lets us predict which states each candidate would win, if they won the same fraction of the national popular vote as Clinton.

Last, we can turn a knob on the model, so to speak, to ask what would happen if a candidate won more or less of the popular vote than Clinton did. There’s uncertainty in the underlying polls, which carries over into the predictions; we don’t know exactly what would happen if Joe Biden won 48.5 percent of the national popular vote, for example. So the model gives probabilities, predicting that he would win Virginia 98 percent of the time and lose Minnesota 75 percent of the time, based on how he is polling among that state’s major demographic groups and how much of the state’s electorate each group represents.

To check this approach, I performed the same analysis on four early polls from 2015. The model indicated that Clinton would have a hard time winning the Rust Belt states, because she was performing poorly with white men and voters without a college degree. It estimated that to win Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio, she would need an additional 0.6 percent in the popular vote — over three-quarters of a million votes — than Barack Obama won in 2012. These predictions come from national polling matchups in which Clinton was leading Trump by more than double her eventual margin.

AD

AD

Overall, Democrats are at a disadvantage in the electoral college — but Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg might do best

In the figure below, you can see how each candidate’s popular vote would translate into electoral votes, according to the model. Candidates with an electoral college advantage win more electoral votes for the same national popular vote totals, because the demographic groups that dominate key swing states prefer that candidate. You can see which candidate gets more electoral college bang for each vote by whose lines are highest for each popular vote percentage.

Every Democratic candidate would need to win more than 50 percent of the popular vote to win the electoral college. But exactly how much varies by candidate: Warren makes it to 270 electoral votes first, with about 50.7 percent of the popular vote, followed by Buttigieg, then Kamala D. Harris, and finally Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. These estimates are not perfect; though Warren wins first most of the time, she isn’t guaranteed to do so.

AD

AD

To understand these patterns, let’s look at two key sets of swing states: the Rust Belt states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which were key to Trump’s victory in 2016; and the Southwestern states of Nevada and New Mexico.

The graph below shows how well a Democrat must do nationally to win back the Rust Belt. On average, Democratic candidates poll 7.4 percent lower among whites than among the general population. But Buttigieg polls only 6.4 percent lower. As a result, he can usually win these states with 49 percent of the national popular vote — and so would win more electoral votes, on average, than his competitors.

But in Nevada and New Mexico, Warren wins first. While on average, the Democratic candidates poll 8.9 percent higher among Hispanics than among the general population, Warren polls 11 percent higher. As a result, she wins these states with about 51.1 percent of the national popular vote, compared to last-place Sanders with about 52.5 percent.

Current projections suggest that Warren could win with the lowest national vote total

AD

AD

To capture the presidency, Democrats need to win both the Southwest and the Rust Belt — and the Southwest will probably be more challenging than the Rust Belt. While that may be surprising considering the 2016 election, in the 2012 election Obama’s margin in Nevada was narrower than in Wisconsin and Michigan.

Among the top Democratic candidates, Warren wins the Southwest — and the presidency — with the lowest average share of the national popular vote. Buttigieg’s Rust Belt strength isn’t matched in the Southwest. He usually needs a slightly larger popular-vote margin to reach 270 electoral votes.

But plenty can and will change between now and November 2020

AD

Recessions, wars and scandals can — and often do — upend any presidential race. These conclusions could change with new polling data. And candidates’ demographic strengths will probably shift as the campaign continues. All that means is this analysis isn’t definitive.

AD

But these patterns suggest Biden may be wrong in arguing that he is best positioned to beat Trump. In swing states, he doesn’t perform exceptionally well in any key demographic groups. In contrast, Warren’s support among Hispanics and Buttigieg’s among whites set both up for an easier electoral college victory.

Ultimately, it matters not just how many votes a candidate wins, but where they win them.

“There’s no question it hits the middle class,” he added.

John Holahan, a health policy expert at the nonpartisan Urban Institute agreed: “Even though high-income people are going to pay a lot more, this has to hit the middle class.”

Several other economists who specialize in health care say it is difficult to predict how most Americans would be impacted, given far-reaching effects to the nation’s two most complicated systems, health care and taxes. They include one to whom the Sanders campaign referred The Washington Post.

Robert Pollin, a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who has consulted with Sanders, said he has been baffled by how the senator from Vermont talks about the proposal and says there are not enough details to analyze how the middle class would be impacted.

AD

AD

“I didn’t try to decipher. Theirs was too complicated,” he said. “They don’t go into a whole lot of detail. . . . The Sanders proposal to me was not clear enough to enable me to make the estimates on different types of families.”

Their skepticism comes as voters are seeking more assurances at town hall meetings and as former vice president Joe Biden focuses more tightly on his plan to build on President Barack Obama’s health-care law with a proposal that costs far less than the one from his two key rivals. New polling has also shown some of the political risks of Medicare-for-all, with voters growing more skeptical once they learn of the details.

After questions were posed over the past few weeks, the campaigns conceded that their plans still remained in flux. They put forward several new arguments and provided additional detail in their cost estimates, but their responses did not fully answer a key question: In a plan that would significantly alter the tax code and the health-care industry, how many and which Americans would ultimately be hit with higher costs?

AD

AD

The Sanders campaign said it would be able to address that question with more precision after it releases a comprehensive plan on reforming the nation’s tax laws. It would not specify when that plan would be released.

Health care has dominated the first three debates and promises to factor heavily into the next one on Oct. 15. The once largely philosophical debate about whether Americans should have a choice of insurers is turning toward more fundamental and specific questions about how much it would cost and who would pay for it.

Long confined to the fringes of the Democratic Party, Medicare-for-all has become more popular in recent years, helped along by the rise of Warren and Sanders. Now, in the eyes of many voters, the burden for explaining the nuts and bolts of the plan has fallen upon the candidates.

AD

AD

“Medicare-for-all does appeal. It’s just how we’re going to pay for it,” said 37-year-old Yul Owens of Philadelphia, who attended an AFL-CIO candidate forum last month. “As long as somebody has a plan for how we’re going to fund these things, there’s not a problem at all.”

But the candidates’ plans don’t fully explain the funding. Sanders has said that his plan would be paid for in part with higher middle-class taxes, something that Warren has declined to directly acknowledge. They both make the case that any tax increases would be offset by health-care savings.

“If you’re making more than $29,000, in a progressive way, you will be paying more in taxes,” Sanders said in an interview conducted before his recent hospitalization. “But the increased taxes that you’re paying will be significantly less than what you were paying for premiums, co-payments and out of pocket expenses.”

AD

AD

Yet, in the way Sanders has outlined his proposal, that statement won’t apply to everyone. And his campaign has been unable to say at which income level Americans will start paying more in taxes than they are saving in health-care costs.

The Sanders campaign has sought to frame the debate over Medicare-for-all in personal terms, emphasizing how it would address the catastrophic financial toll health-care costs have taken on some Americans under the current system. He touted the plan repeatedly while being treated for a heart attack, noting that such sudden illnesses as his can be financially ruinous for those without coverage.

Warren, despite a reputation for coming up with plans on a wide variety of subjects, has so far largely outsourced her health-care proposal to Sanders. “I’m with Bernie,” she said at the first debate, signaling to fans of his plan that they would also have a champion in her.

AD

AD

Warren has been pressed in a variety of settings — on debate stages, in interviews, on late-night television shows — but has avoided the question of costs to the middle class. MSNBC’s Chris Matthews asked her the question in late July several times without an answer, to the point that he said in frustration, “I’m not getting anywhere.”

When asked specifically how she would finance Medicare-for-all, Warren’s campaign said that she is “reviewing the options” suggested by Sanders and is also examining “other options” for how to pay for the plan. Her campaign would not outline what that entails.

The campaign pointed to Warren’s previous statements pledging to not raise overall costs on middle-class families but would not outline how she would accomplish that with a plan that many economists, as well as Sanders, say will require significant tax hikes.

AD

AD

“Right now, what we’ve got in Medicare-for-all is a framework, and it doesn’t have the details,” Warren said late last month in Keene, N.H., responding to a voter worried about losing his health care.

She also floated the idea of offering “cash equivalents” to union members who lose favorable insurance plans that have been negotiated during the transition to Medicare-for-all. (Sanders also has proposed assistance for those workers.)

Sanders estimates that his plan would cost $30 trillion to $40 trillion over 10 years. But his campaign clarified that — because he would use the spending already going toward Medicare, Medicaid and other health-related government programs — he would only need to come up about $15 trillion in new revenue.

AD

He has proposed several tax increases to help pay for it, all of which add up to $16.2 trillion. Those details are crucial to projecting how an average American family might be impacted by the transition to Medicare-for-all.

AD

A portion of the revenue for Sanders’s plan would come from an additional 4 percent tax on income for families making more than $29,000, which he estimates would raise $3.5 trillion. He would also impose an additional 7.5 percent payroll tax, raising $3.9 trillion. Although Sanders would levy the payroll tax only on employers with payrolls over $2 million, economists generally assume that all payroll tax increases are passed along to workers in the form of wage cuts, slower wage increases or job losses.

The senator has proposed generating further revenue by making more affluent Americans pay more in taxes, including raising the top marginal tax rates, limiting itemized deductions and establishing a wealth tax.

Sanders has argued that his plan would be cheaper than maintaining the status quo — putting forward a $50 trillion figure to maintain current health-care spending over the next 10 years — but fact-checkers have said that figure is dubious. The Post’s Fact Checker gave him three Pinocchios for the comment.

Sanders also has provided estimates for a family of four earning $50,000. He estimates that the family would no longer pay $5,277 in premiums and would see their taxes go up by $844 — seeing a savings of about $4,400. The employer, instead of paying $12,865 a year in health-care premiums for the family, would have a payroll tax increase of $3,750 — for a savings of $9,000.

But the employer would break even if the insured is an individual making $50,000 — rather than a family of four, which have higher premiums — according to Fact Checker. The financial impact on an individual would depend on whether the employer passes on the additional costs they could incur on employees making above $50,000.

Sanders and Warren have declined to specify what they view as “middle class” — something Pew Research Center puts at $45,200 to $135,600, based on 2016 data — but economists say that most taxpayers would pay more in taxes than they would save from having the federal government absorb the cost of health-care premiums.

Thorpe’s analysis of the Medicare-for-all plan that Sanders outlined in 2016 found that about 71 percent of those with private insurance would pay more in new taxes than they would save by having health insurance covered by the federal government. Thorpe estimated Sanders’s plan is underfunded and would need higher taxes than he has proposed; Sanders’s updated health-care plan, released this year, imposed higher taxes than his earlier proposal but still not as high as Thorpe says would be needed.

“Most of the proposals to move to Medicare-for-all would involve substantial tax increases that would affect most people,” said Katherine Baicker, an economist at the University of Chicago who specializes in health policy. “These are going to be big tax increases. The tax brackets may have to shift. You may have to do more than just dialing up the top tax bracket in a realistic accounting.”

“I think it seems likely under most proposals taxes would have to go up substantially unless you dramatically cut the health care you’re getting,” she added. “And I don’t think most proposals envision substantially cutting back on care. And most envision expanding care which means you’re spending more unless you dramatically cut the price per service.”

Pollin, the professor who has briefed the Sanders campaign on his plan, said his in-depth study of how Medicare-for-all would work was paid for by National Nurses United, which has backed Sanders and supported Medicare-for-all. Pollin briefed the campaign, and Sanders himself, on his findings.

Pollin said he believes the goals are achievable and has come up with a different proposal to pay for the plan that he says would ensure low- and middle-class Americans would not see overall costs go up. But that is not the same as Sanders’s plan.

Biden has proposed adding a public option that would allow people to choose between a private insurance plan or one offered by the federal government. His plan would cost an estimated $750 billion, which he would pay for by repealing the tax cuts for the wealthy that were passed in 2017 and by raising capital gains taxes."

But something deeper is happening.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/09/30/democrats-have-moved-left-taxes-something-deeper-is-happening/,"While Sanders may be still be on the left of the Democratic Party, the economic proposals this campaign is producing show how much the conversation around the economy has changed among Democrats, even those who are ostensibly more moderate.

Here’s what Sanders is proposing:

Under Sanders’s plan, the government would increase a firm’s corporate tax rate if its highest-paid employee earns more than 50 times what its average worker does — an attempt to encourage companies to distribute their profits more equitably. The plan would apply only to companies with more than $100 million in annual revenue.

So if the median employee makes $40,000 a year and the CEO makes more than $2 million a year, the corporation would have to pay a higher tax rate.

AD

I’m a bit skeptical about this as a policy solution, since it seems more likely that if it were in place a company would find ways to reduce its chief executive’s pay to avoid the tax rather than raising the pay of employees, which ought to be the primary goal.

AD

But there’s no question that the gap between CEO pay and workers’ pay is obscene. In 2018, according to the Economic Policy Institute, the ratio of CEO to median worker’s pay at top corporations last year was a remarkable 278 to 1 (or 221 to 1 depending on which measure you use to account for stock options). At some large corporations, the ratio is over 1,000 to 1. Over the past 40 years, while worker pay has only grown by 12 percent in inflation-adjusted terms, CEO pay has grown by more than 1,000 percent.

Sanders’s approach to this problem is a kind of outside-in one: Tell the companies they’ll be punished if the outcome of their pay reflects this glaring inequality, and then let them figure out how to fix it.

AD

Warren, in contrast, has a proposal that is in many ways more fundamental. She would mandate that large corporations serve the interests of all stakeholders (including their workers and the communities where they’re located), not just their shareholders. And she would require that 40 percent of the seats on corporate boards be filled by people elected by employees. “Codetermination” systems are in place in other countries, most notably Germany, where they seem to produce less short-term thinking (and lower CEO pay) without sacrificing economic success.

AD

But what’s striking about these kind of proposals is that they’re intended to question some of the basic premises on which our economic system has been operating for decades — and that’s now mainstream thinking in the Democratic Party. Even Joe Biden, who’s running as a moderate, is considering proposing a financial transactions tax on Wall Street, which used to be something advocated only by progressives like Warren and Sanders.

To see what an extraordinary change this is, let’s recall the tax policies of the two most recent Democratic presidents. In 1993, Bill Clinton passed a budget that included, among other things, an increase in the top income tax rate from 31 percent to 39.6 percent. At the time, Republicans predicted that this would immediately plunge the United States into an outright economic cataclysm. Of course, the opposite happened: We experienced a dramatic boom, just one of the many times that reality has proved Republicans’ economic predictions to be 180 degrees wrong.

AD

But the point is that even though it raised plenty of revenue and helped lead to a balanced budget, Clinton’s tax increase was relatively modest. Just seven years before, the top rate had been 50 percent.

AD

Then after George W. Bush cut the top rate to 35 percent, Barack Obama eventually negotiated a deal whereby the Bush cuts would be retained for all but the wealthiest, bringing the top rate back to 39.6 percent — an even smaller increase than Clinton’s. In 2016, Hillary Clinton offered an intricate tax proposal that would have raised taxes on the top 1 percent of earners by about 5 percent.

So while Democrats have wanted to raise taxes on the wealthy pretty much since they were dramatically lowered under Ronald Reagan, up until now the ideas have been mostly about tweaking things around the edges. While it’s not inaccurate to say the party has “moved left” in the time since, what has really happened is that Democrats have decided that it’s politically safe to advocate for things that they probably supported years ago but worried wouldn’t fly with the electorate.

AD

And they still might not. But with inequality at unprecedented levels and polls consistently showing that wide majorities of Americans believe the biggest problem with the tax system is that corporations and wealthy people get away without paying their fair share, the last thing Republicans probably want is to have an argument about whether we should be tougher on corporations and the wealthy.

But that is indeed the argument we’re going to have in 2020.

That isn’t inherently problematic — there are some things candidates shouldn’t say — but it is revealing.

AD

AD

Let’s start with the fact that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), one of the leading candidates throughout the campaign, just had a heart attack. By all appearances, it was mild and was treated with a routine procedure, and he seems to be recovering well. Nevertheless, because Sanders is 78 years old, one reaction I’ve heard from Democrats (to be clear, I’m not talking about public officials, just people I know) was “Well, that’s too bad, but his campaign is probably over.”

If that seems unfair, it certainly is. Sanders doesn’t have a history of heart problems that would suggest his life is in imminent danger. And whether you agree with his politics or not, it’s difficult to deny that, at an age when many people are beginning to experience some cognitive decline, he seems extremely mentally sharp, with an answer for any question and a clever response for any criticism.

But the assumption is that though he’s probably no less able to do the job of president today than he was a month ago, the public just won’t be forgiving, even if the currently 73-year-old president eats nothing but fast food and frequently devolves into incoherent gibberish when speaking in public.

AD

AD

Like many assumptions about what other people believe, the idea that the public would reject Sanders because of his age and health is based less on hard evidence than gut feeling. I can’t say exactly how widespread that feeling is among Democrats, but its existence is undeniable, even if his opponents will only offer him their good wishes.

Likewise, the Democrats running for president are standing behind Joe Biden as he gets attacked by President Trump over his son Hunter’s work in Ukraine. When asked directly whether they’d allow their children to sit on the boards of foreign companies, the Democratic candidates either have tried to change the subject or have said no while attempting to make the discussion as abstract as possible so as not to appear to be criticizing Biden.

Yet, in private, you won’t get much disagreement among Democrats that as dishonest as Trump’s attacks on Biden are, and notwithstanding the fact that Trump is the most corrupt president in history, Hunter Biden’s deal with a Ukrainian energy company was, well, kind of sleazy.

AD

AD

He was doing what mediocre children of famous and powerful people have done for hundreds of years: Trade on their names for money. It’s the same thing that Trump’s children do, and that various members of the Bush clan have done, and that the children of senators and congressmen and mayors do, and that’s done by the children of people who are influential in realms outside of politics.

That tells you nothing about what sort of president Joe Biden would be, but there’s still a widespread discomfort with the possibility that the Hunter Biden story could allow Trump to muddy the waters at a time when his corruption should and will be one of the main issues of the campaign. Again, that might happen or it might not, but the fear among Democrats is there.

The third candidate at the top of the pack, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), mostly causes unease among Democrats who worry that she has made too many commitments for large government programs and progressive initiatives, commitments Republicans could exploit. The attempt to smear her over the fact that she lost her job in 1971 when she got pregnant seems to have failed, but she’ll inevitably make Democrats nervous, too.

AD

AD

That’s because dread is the default mode for Democrats. They always think they’re about to screw everything up, a fear that, given their history, is not completely unwarranted. But you won’t hear their candidates say it on the campaign trail or from a debate stage, where optimism and solidarity reign.

But why?",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/10/07/trump-sanders-even-pope-embrace-anti-endorsement-why/,"A 2010 study published in the European Journal of Marketing showed that your level of “political salience” — that is, the degree of information about and interest in politics — determines whether celebrity endorsements work on you. The authors found that if you have low salience, a celebrity endorsement will increase your intention to vote for a politician or party by 28 percent (compared with an endorsement by someone who isn’t famous). But if you have high political salience, the celebrity endorsement will lower your intention to support the politician by 11 percent.

In other words, celebrity endorsements are good only for convincing people who don’t care much about politics or follow what’s going on. What happens if the politician is also a celebrity? Say — just hypothetically, of course — a reality-TV star? No studies of that have been conducted, that I’m aware of. But feel free to speculate.

Now here’s a new twist, one that mixes our fixation on fame with today’s political vortex of negativity: the celebrity anti-endorsement. In this phenomenon, a politician who is criticized by a celebrity uses the attack to gain support from people who dislike that celebrity.

Consider Sanders’s campaign website, which features a page literally titled “Anti-Endorsements.” “I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made,” the Sanders page says, followed by a list of famous people, mostly from the worlds of business and finance, who have criticized him. Upon unveiling the list, Sanders said, “These people have a vested interest in preserving the status quo so they can keep their grip on power so they can continue to exploit working people across America.” He added this flourish: “We welcome their hatred."" (Sanders is recovering at home after suffering a heart attack on Oct. 1 and has vowed to return to campaigning soon.)

AD

AD

What were the hateful things said about Sanders? To take one example, JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon made the list for saying about Sanders’s economic populism, “Just because it resonates doesn’t make it right.” Frankly, that doesn’t qualify as “hatred” in my book — more like “mild disagreement” — but it was enough to deem him an enemy.

While Sanders has employed the anti-endorsement in its barest form, he is far from alone, of course. President Trump has mastered the technique by complaining about negative reporting of his presidency by the mainstream media, whom he deems an “enemy of the people.” Nor is embracing the anti-endorsement limited to politicians. Recently, many were surprised when Pope Francis said, in response to a journalist asking about U.S. criticisms of his papacy, “For me, it’s an honor that Americans are attacking me.”

The anti-endorsement technique seems to assume there is a kind of transitive property for hate. It goes something like this: Are you trying to figure out if you like and support me? Well, you hate certain rich and famous people, right? They hate me. Therefore, you must like me!

AD

AD

We don’t have any research evidence on the efficacy of this strategy. Personally, I’m skeptical. Anti-endorsements might be seen as a political analog to “humblebragging” — the social media phenomenon of making a self-deprecating comment or complaint that is actually a boast. A humblebrag on Twitter might be something like, “On my way to meet the President and stuck in DC traffic! I never leave enough time!”

My Harvard Business School colleagues Francesca Gino and Michael Norton (with Ovul Sezer of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) tested the effectiveness of humblebragging in a 2018 article in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. They found it doesn’t work; people see through it and find it disingenuous and repellent. Humblebragging is even less effective than outright complaining or bragging.

This seems to me the most likely effect of anti-endorsements as well. They display faux outrage and promise brave perseverance in the face of criticisms that are often exaggeratedly portrayed as attacks. Anti-endorsements also openly borrow prestige from the critics they trash as enemies. They are assaults dressed up as victimhood.

AD

AD

Whether I agree with the political messenger, anti-endorsements leave me stone cold, and less likely to support a politician. But hey, maybe that’s just me. What about you, dear reader with high political salience? Do they work on you?

“The cheapest possible way to make sure that everyone gets health care is Medicare-for-all,” the senator from Massachusetts said at the end of a town hall in Indianola, attended by about 475 people. “What I see, though, is, we need to talk about costs.” Over “the next few weeks,” Warren added, she will offer a proposal for “specifically how we pay for it.”

AD

The Medicare-for-all legislation introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in 2017 does not lay out how the proposal would be funded. A separate “white paper” proposed some ideas, like a 4 percent “premium” paid by families making more than $29,000 per year.

Sanders has not shied away from telling voters they will have to pay higher taxes under a Medicare-for-all plan. But, he’s said, that cost would be more than offset by other savings.

“At the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of people will save money on their health-care bills,” Sanders said at last week’s debate in Ohio. “But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They’re going to go up significantly for the wealthy. And for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expansions.”

Warren supports the Medicare-for-all bill unveiled by Sanders. But so far, she’s refused to say taxes will go up for middle-class families, even when asked directly.

AD

AD

As a result, she has been taking fire on the cost question from her Democratic rivals. In a Sunday interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg scoffed at the idea that Warren might use “pay-fors” previously sketched out by Sanders.

“We need to see how this is going to be paid for,” Buttigieg said. “Right now, whether you copy-paste the Bernie Sanders math or do it some other way, there is a hole amounting to trillions of dollars in how this is supposed to work.”

Single-payer advocates have been frustrated by the tax and cost debate, pointing out that the cost of the entire program — usually pegged at $30 trillion over 10 years — does not factor in how much taxpayers shell out for insurance under the current system.

“The single-payer taxation debate constantly, frustratingly, refuses to differentiate between literal compulsory taxes and virtually compulsory private taxes — premiums, hospital bills, etc.,” said Timothy Faust, author of the Medicare-for-all tract “Health Justice Now,” and a supporter of single-payer insurance. “The only reason to advocate for the public option is if you fundamentally believe that it is important to keep insurance companies profitable.”

Warren said Sunday that current estimates show Medicare-for-all will cost “trillions and trillions” of dollars, and added that “there are a lot” of potential revenue streams.

She also said that she’s been working on her plan to pay for the proposal for “months and months.” She added: “It’s just a little more work until it’s finished.”

Warren, using a double negative, repeated a pledge that she won’t sign a bill into law that “does not reduce the cost of health care for middle class families.”

When asked by a reporter after her town hall if her plan would include taxes on the middle class, Warren declined to answer saying: “The whole plan will be out — you’ll be able to look at it.”

And speaking of Sanders, who returned from his recent heart attack, his energetic debate performance and his campaign’s most genuinely emotional moment (thanking well-wishers) demonstrated he is still a force to be reckoned with. He managed to deliver a rare snub to Warren by agreeing the candidates should be honest about taxes to pay for Medicare-for-all.

Sanders also got an additional boost when Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) decided to endorse him and appeared along with Michael Moore at Sanders’s massive rally (a new campaign record of 26,000) in New York on Saturday. (After previous massive crowds, a Warren event at a half-filled smaller venue attracted notice, putting additional pressure on her advance team to keep crowd size up.) One could argue that in the general election, Warren is better off without the boosterism of the furthest-left House members, but it does set back her effort to solidify support among the most progressive Democratic primary voters.

Indeed, the Sanders resurgence and support from half of the Squad carries a reminder that Warren was never going to out-Bernie Bernie. As he said, she’s a capitalist; he is a socialist. She cares if her policy initiatives are politically plausible; he does not. One wonders, then, if it was all that wise for her to bind herself so tightly to Medicare-for-all. Granted she did not want to leave a lot of room on her left, but her effort to adhere so closely to Sanders’s unworkable and politically problematic Medicare-for-all comes with a price (not just the $30-plus trillion it will cost).

This is in no way shape or form a prediction of her demise. She has plenty of room to finesse Medicare-for-all. The uber-progressive former Harvard Law professor has convinced many Democrats that she is an Okie and the compromise candidate between the center-left and far-left. Like South Bend Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, her quick wit and agile mind helps her run rhetorical circles around many opponents.

No, the import last week’s events is not that she is done for or in trouble but that no one including Warren has a lock or even substantial advantage in the Democratic primary. There are a handful of candidates with a plausible path to the nomination, of which Warren is one but, as we witnessed last week, certainly not the only one.

The aborted hire is a parable about how the effort to harness organic online ingenuity, built on distrust of the mainstream media and turned into one of Sanders’s main tactical advantages, can backfire. The campaign, eager to capi­tal­ize on viral enthusiasm, plucked the YouTuber from relative obscurity and prepared to put him on payroll. The offer was made before he had been fully vetted, the campaign’s leadership acknowledged, saying, “It’s clear some of Matt’s prior social media content does not reflect the campaign’s values.”

To Orfalea, the interest in his video showed he had his finger on the pulse of the movement.

“When you see someone you support being misrepresented, that’s what inspires the grass roots,” Orfalea said, explaining why the pro-Sanders video gained so much traction. His aim, he said, is to produce “stuff that’s powerful, that hits people, but that also inspires people and informs people.”

AD

AD

The episode is also a lesson about the dangers of falsified media, which is a focal point of concern about political disinformation. And it became a new front in the highly charged conflict over how much responsibility someone bears for past posts on social media — a quandary facing numerous candidates going into 2020.

Sanders, in his second run for the Democratic nomination, enjoys an online following that dwarfs that of his rivals. The Vermont independent commands the attention of devoted meme-makers, who turn his clarion calls, as well as his quips, into viral Internet campaigns that reach across platforms like Reddit and Twitch and match the energy of President Trump’s online movement.

His team has the digital sais quoi that former vice president Joe Biden might envy as he goes toe-to-toe with Trump and his online empire over deceptive claims about nepotism and foreign dealings.

AD

AD

Crucially, Sanders is also able to turn the enthusiasm into cash, recently raising more than $25 million in the third quarter, fueled by legions of small-dollar donors.

Orfalea’s video promoting Sanders was a vivid illustration of how the 78-year-old’s fans make him go viral, circumventing mainstream gatekeepers to present a more favorable account of their candidate.

“What Bernie does is relay that sense of grievance from his most passionate supporters,” said Ethan Porter, an assistant professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University.

From his basement living quarters in northwest D.C., Orfalea put together the video over the course of about three weeks, pairing clips of negative commentary, mostly on MSNBC, with favorable imagery of the senator.

AD

The charge that Sanders is “a not pro-woman candidate” was juxtaposed with a clip of the senator’s rapturous reception at the 2017 Women’s March. The notion that Sanders “doesn’t actually smile that much” was followed by clips of the senator beaming. In a dramatic close, complaints that Sanders is too loud were interspersed with the verdict of a mother of a diabetic son that “We are not being vocal enough.” The video was set to music from “The Green Mile,” the 1999 fantasy crime drama adapted from the Stephen King novel.

AD

Superimposed on the final minute of the video was a request to viewers: “Please Share.”

And share they did. The video has been viewed nearly 7 million times on Twitter, posted by the activist Shaun King, who was then retweeted by the Sanders campaign’s official account. On Orfalea’s YouTube channel alone, it racked up more than 433,000 views, dwarfing viewership for most of the videos on the campaign’s official channel.

AD

The video, digital strategists said, testifies to the power of independent online actors, who are sometimes best left alone.

“Change happens from organic momentum,” said Keegan Goudiss, Sanders’s director of digital advertising in 2016 and now a partner at Revolution Messaging. “Only individuals who aren’t associated with the campaign can produce that, and then the campaign can tap the best tweets or the best content out there.”

AD

After graduating from the Santa Fe University of Art and Design, which closed last year, Orfalea moved to Los Angeles, where he was an editor with “The Real World” and “Real World/Road Rules Challenge” before an overuse injury brought him back to D.C., where he had grown up, to recuperate.

AD

He concentrated on making his own videos, including about politics, and became enamored of Sanders during his 2016 bid for the presidency.

“Now I’m editing the real real world,” he said, noting the convergence of politics and entertainment and arguing that someone schooled in the ways of reality television could help defeat Trump, who rose to national prominence on “The Apprentice.”

As his video, titled “Rising Up,” picked up steam, a Twitter message arrived from Faiz Shakir, the campaign manager for Sanders. The two exchanged ideas over the phone, Orfalea said, about the “need to make great content.”

AD

He was offered a job and invited to tour campaign headquarters last week. Weighing whether to sign up, he feared only for his “creative freedom.” Campaign staff had already asked that he edit the video, he said, to remove certain figures, including late-night host Trevor Noah, whom they saw as “possible allies,” Orfalea recounted.

AD

When they backed down, Orfalea decided to move ahead with the job, he said.

“Happy to report Faiz and I see eye-to-eye,” he wrote in an email last week. Referring to the senator’s recuperation from a recent heart attack, he added, “I’m joining the squad. Bernie Sanders camp just got some new blood to go with that new heart upgrade.”

On Friday, the campaign shared the video in an email blast to supporters, with the subject line “These folks HATE Bernie Sanders.”

The same day, Orfalea signed a contract, and on Saturday, he recorded a video for his followers, sharing the “big, big news” that he was joining the campaign.

AD

On Sunday, he put the news on Twitter. Within hours, a 53-year-old Sanders critic in New York, Michele Ferrer, dredged up old videos on his channel, which included offensive language and an altered and sexualized rendition of King’s “I Have a Dream” speech.

AD

That evening, Orfalea announced his resignation on Medium, and said the decision to step back was his — made because he didn’t want his past videos to “distract from the real issues.” Of the King video, he wrote, “When I was about 20 yrs old, I edited MLK audio, to expose how easily media can completely misrepresent reality.” He also apologized for using offensive language about people with special needs.

Shakir, in the campaign’s statement, said, “All initial job offers are contingent on the completion of a final review of a person’s record. That vetting process had not yet been completed.”

In the celebratory message to his followers, which may now never go live, Orfalea said he had received scads of notes from viewers about how the video had helped them get through to a family member or friend initially turned off by negative coverage of Sanders.

“The mission,” he said, “really was accomplished.”"

Elizabeth Warren

Polling average: 26 percent

She has leads in some polls, nationally and in early-voting states. She is raising millions of dollars more than former vice president Joe Biden. And she’s been declared a winner by The Fix in the past three debates as other candidates have either declined to or not figured out how to attack her. But with more standing comes more scrutiny, as the senator from Massachusetts saw recently when political opponents drummed up accusations she wasn’t fired for being pregnant as a teacher. (She maintains she was.) Warren still faces questions about the financial cost of Medicare-for-all on middle-class taxpayers, as experts question her and Sen. Bernie Sanders’s assertion that costs will definitely go down. Still, with Biden focused on how to respond to President Trump and Sanders having his own problems, this is the moment Warren could stand out in a way she hasn’t yet on the debate stage: as the unequivocal leader.

Joe Biden

Polling average: 27 percent

AD

AD

After largely ignoring Trump’s unsubstantiated allegations that Biden as vice president intervened in Ukrainian politics to help his son’s business ties, Biden has recently switched tactics to confronting the allegations and the president. “Enough is enough,” he wrote in a Washington Post op-ed. “Trump won’t destroy me, and he won’t destroy my family.” Some of his supporters warned him that Trump and his conservative media machine will flood the information stage if he doesn’t speak up and call Trump out when he’s wrong. Biden seems to now agree. But it means he’s running an election campaign while still in a primary. And especially for that reason, his team is playing whack-a-mole with Trump allies spreading disinformation on social media and in the media. A recent poll shows a plurality of Americans are wondering if the allegations are true, and at least one of his 2020 opponents said they wouldn’t let family members have such close business ties to their work. In addition, Biden hasn’t shaken off questions about his acuity from sluggish previous debate performances. Given all this, how can Biden show Democratic voters he’s up to the task of such relentless confrontations with Trump?

Bernie Sanders

Polling average: 16 percent

AD

AD

The debate comes at a tough time for Sanders, who was hospitalized for a heart attack and paused campaigning, right after he shared that he raised the most money of all candidates these past three months. Sanders is 78 and the oldest candidate running for president. He would be the oldest president ever (though Biden and Warren are in their 70s, too, and would set a record if elected). His campaign waited days to announce he had a heart attack and won’t answer questions about how serious it was. The senator from Vermont is resting now and it’s possible Tuesday’s debate will be his first campaign appearance since the heart attack. It’s fair to say his age and health are the last things Sanders will want to talk about on the debate stage — but that’s reality when you’re running for president and every aspect of your life is under scrutiny.

Kamala D. Harris

Polling average: 5 percent

AD

AD

She had a dream first debate this summer, after attacking Biden for his position on school busing. But Sen. Kamala D. Harris failed to translate that momentum to the campaign trail. Her polling has dropped precipitously since this summer, into the single digits, according to an average of top polls from RealClearPolitics. Even her home state, California, is indifferent to her candidacy, reports The Post’s David Weigel. Harris needs an extra-strong debate performance. That will be extra tough to do on a crowded stage of 12 candidates, where the national story is elsewhere, like on impeachment.

Pete Buttigieg

Polling average: 5 percent

The South Bend, Ind., mayor continues to pull in impressive fundraising hauls — $19 million in the quarter that just ended — and has had steady debate performances. But he hasn’t dominated headlines since his entrance in the race, when some compared him to a young Barack Obama. Like Harris, his candidacy just hasn’t gained the traction he needs to reach the first tier. His biggest moments on the debate stages so far have come from criticizing Warren and Sanders’s take-it-or-leave-it liberal policy proposals, so there could be an opening there for him to be more aggressive — and more noticeable.

Cory Booker

Polling average: 1 percent

AD

AD

The senator from New Jersey has no problem with aggressive campaigning and debating. “Mr. Vice President, there’s a saying in my community, you’re dipping into the Kool-Aid and you don’t even know the flavor,” he said in a July debate in a back-and-forth with Biden over their criminal justice reform records. This past week, Biden has been Booker’s ticket again to national headlines. More than the other senators running, Booker leveraged his role as a senator who would be a jurist of Trump’s impeachment by defending Biden from the unsubstantiated Ukraine allegations that Trump peddled to the Ukrainian president. “... If you come after Joe Biden, you’re going to have to deal with me…,” he told CNN last week. Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani went after Booker afterward. A few days later, a fired-up Booker got a standing ovation while speaking to a receptive crowd of 300 in Iowa.

Julián Castro, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O’Rourke, Andrew Yang, Tulsi Gabbard

For these candidates, all of whom are polling at 1 or 2 percent, they need to make a moment in this debate. Controversy is always a good bet to get noticed, but there’s a way to take that overboard. (See Castro, former housing secretary, in September’s debate, who appeared to go there on Biden’s age: “Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?”)

AD

AD

The Democratic National Committee is raising the bar for who qualifies for the Nov. 20 debate, above the polling averages of a number of candidates here. Yang has made it in but the rest are in danger of not.

Tom Steyer

Polling average: 1 percent

The only new person on the debate stage Tuesday will be billionaire Tom Steyer. His campaign to date is mostly self-funded, and he entered the race late, after Biden, Warren and Sanders were already dominating the polls. Steyer is best known for his activism (and his willingness to put money behind it) on climate change and to push Democrats to impeach Trump. Now that impeachment may be happening, can Steyer have an “I told you so?” moment on the debate stage that helps place his candidacy in perspective?

After a three-hour debate that showed sharper divisions in the Democratic field, the candidates were asked a question inspired by the friendship between talk show host Ellen DeGeneres and former president George W. Bush. Each candidate was asked to speak about a friendship that would be a surprise.

Three, Klobuchar, Sanders and Biden, named the late senator John McCain. Buttigieg said the people he met in the military from different walks of life. Warren said Charles Fried, a solicitor general in the Bush administration, who helped her get a job 27 years ago. She also mentioned her three older brothers whose politics are different from hers.

Harris said Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Gabbard said former congressman Trey Gowdy, and O’Rourke recalled driving with Rep. Will Hurd from Texas to Washington and airing the whole thing on Facebook. Booker referenced working with former New Jersey governor Chris Christie and his effort to dine with every Republican senator, including Ted Cruz (Tex.).

Gabbard also used the moment to take a veiled shot at Hillary Clinton, saying, “When I look out at our country, I don’t see deplorables. I see fellow Americans.”

Yang cited a trucker named Fred, an avid supporter of President Trump who he said is now supporting him.

“He let me ride in his truck for hours. He spent some time in jail. I heard about his experiences trying to get other people off of drugs, and I’m happy to say that after our ride together, he actually said that he would move from Donald Trump to my campaign, which was a thrill for me. And we’ve remained in touch ever since,” Yang said.

Warren, Biden face off on CFPB

Biden, situated onstage between liberal champions Sanders and Warren, attempted to distinguish himself as the realist with a résumé of successes.

“I'm going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here. But I'm the only one on this stage who has gotten anything really big done,” Biden said. “The question is who is best prepared. We all have good ideas.”

AD

AD

Warren shot back that she came up with the idea to create a consumer agency to keep big banks in check and that she helped get it passed.

Biden responded that he played a key role in persuading people to support that bill. “I went on the floor and got you votes,” Biden said. “So let’s get those things straight too.”

Warren paused before responding, “I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed in the law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it. And who helped pass it into law,” Warren said.

“Understand this: It was a dream-big fight-hard,” Warren said. “People told me go for something little, go for something small, go for something that the big corporations will be able to accept … we have to be willing to make big structural change.”

Candidates address abortion rights

Harris said that if she were elected president, her Justice Department would use “pre-clearance” to fight back against state legislators that pass unconstitutional abortion restrictions, so that those laws would not go into effect. She also recalled questioning Brett M. Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing and asking whether he could think of a law that sought to control only men’s bodies.

“And the answer was ‘Uh, uh, uh, no,’” Harris said. “The reality of it is, this is still a fundamental issue of justice for women in America.”

Several candidates, including Klobuchar and Castro, said they would codify Roe v. Wade. Booker said he would create an office of reproductive freedom in the White House to elevate the issue.

AD

Gabbard said the necessity of “safe, legal and rare” abortions was one of the rare things on which she agreed with Hillary Clinton. However, she said there should be restrictions in place so that abortions were not allowed in the third trimester “unless the life or severe health consequences of a woman are at risk.”

AD

Warren said she lived through a time in the United States when abortion was illegal and reminded the crowd that people still got abortions — if they could afford to travel to places where it was legal. It was the poor and young who were denied access, she said.

Biden takes stronger stance on justices

Biden has previously taken heat from the Democratic base because he suggested that Republicans would be willing to work with him if he were elected president.

AD

“With Trump gone, you’re going to begin to see things change,” Biden said earlier this year. “Because these folks know better. They know this isn’t what they’re supposed to be doing.”

On the debate stage Tuesday night, he struck a different note, declaring that he would take the same approach to the Supreme Court as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) did when he blocked the Senate from considering the nomination of Merrick Garland in 2016.

AD

At the time, McConnell had argued that the successor to the late Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia should be chosen by whichever president won the November 2016 election.

Biden said Tuesday night that, if one of the current Supreme Court justices steps down, he would make sure as the Democratic nominee that his party “would do exactly what McConnell did last time out: We would not allow any hearing to be held for a new justice.”

Harris wants Warren to join her call to kick Trump off Twitter

In their first notable disagreement of the night, Harris pressed Warren to join her in calling for Trump to be kicked off Twitter, accusing Warren of having a double standard when it comes to holding corporations accountable.

“I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter, I want to push him out of the White House,” Warren responded.

AD

Warren then said the real problem is not whether Twitter will suspend Trump but the amount of corporate money in politics.

“You can't go behind closed doors and take the money of these executives, and then turn around and expect that these are the people who are actually finally going to enforce the laws,” Warren said.

AD

Harris pivoted back to the corporate accountability issue, arguing that Warren has different standards for different businesses.

“This is a matter of holding big tech accountable because they have an outsized influence on people’s perceptions about issues, and they actually influence behaviors, we all have to agree this is their power,” Harris said. “And so what I am saying is that it seems to me that you would be able to join me in saying the rule has to apply to Twitter the same way it does to Facebook.”

“I think all of the rules should apply across the board. I don’t have a problem with that,” Warren said, though she didn’t clarify whether she would support Harris’s call to kick Trump off Twitter.

Biden has an answer on his age

Biden had an answer ready when the moderators eventually asked him about his age. He turned the question around, emphasizing the experience and wisdom he has gained through his decades of public service.

AD

“I will not need any on-the-job training the day I take office,” the 76-year-old former vice president said.

Warren, 70, also fielded a similar question. She emphasized her tenacity, arguing that she will work harder than any other candidate, regardless of age.

“Well, I say, I will outwork, out-organize and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with,” she said, a nod to the possibility that Trump may be removed from office before the 2020 election.

Sanders, asked about health, says he’s ‘feeling great’

As the debate approached the two-hour mark, Sanders faced a question about his health.

“I’m healthy. I’m feeling great,” he said when a moderator broached the subject, before he insisted on weighing in on a previous question about drug laws.

When Booker pointed out Sanders favors legalizing marijuana, Sanders quipped, “I'm not on it tonight.""

Then Sanders, who suffered a heart attack two weeks ago, gave a more serious answer, telling Americans he would prove to them that he has the fitness to serve by “mounting a vigorous campaign,” including a comeback rally with a special guest in New York on Saturday.

Klobuchar makes opioid epidemic personal

Klobuchar made a question about the opioid epidemic personal by relating a story about her father, who struggled with an alcohol addiction, as a reason there should be more investment in treatment programs.

“My dad, he struggled with alcoholism his whole life, and by his third DWI, they said to him, ‘you’re going to face jail or you got to go to treatment.’ He picked treatment, and he was pursued by grace, and he has been sober ever since,” Klobuchar said.

Klobuchar has spoken about her father’s struggles before, most famously during the confirmation hearing of Kavanaugh.

The senator also mentioned drug executives’ emails revealed by The Washington Post, in which one said about pills: “Just like Doritos keep eating. We’ll make more.”

Debate turns to gun control

The candidates delivered impassioned arguments on gun control, with several — including Booker, Harris and Castro — referencing their personal experience with gun violence in their communities.

Harris said that there are 5 million assault weapons on the streets of America today and noted her experience meeting with the family of gun violence victims, including police officers shot in the line of duty, during her time in California.

“I’m done,” Harris said. “And we need action. And Congress has had years to act and failed because they have not had the courage.”

Klobuchar noted that polls show a majority of Trump voters want to see universal background checks. “I just don’t want to screw this up,” she said.

Castro prompted applause from the crowd when he called for action on the case of Atatiana Jefferson, who was fatally shot in her home by a Fort Worth police officer.

“Police violence is also gun violence, and we need to address that,” Castro said.

O’Rourke and Buttigieg also had a heated exchange on guns, after a moderator asked O’Rourke how he would enforce his proposed mandatory buyback of AR-15s and AK-47s.

O’Rourke said he would trust his fellow Americans to follow the law.

“You just made it clear that you don’t know how this is actually going to take weapons off the street. If you can develop the plan further, we can have a debate about it, but we can’t wait,” Buttigieg shot back. “We cannot wait for purity tests. We have to just get something done.”

O’Rourke said those challenges were not mutually exclusive. He said he also supports a ban on the sale of new weapons and high-capacity magazines, and red-flag laws. He called for a comprehensive gun-control policy. “Let’s decide what we are going to believe and what we are going to achieve. And let’s bring this country together in order to do that,” O’Rourke said. ““Let’s … not be limited by the polls and the consultants and the focus groups.”

“The problem isn’t the polls. The problem is the policy,” Buttigieg said dryly. “And I don’t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.”

Biden calls on foreign policy experience

Playing up his decades of foreign policy experience, Biden said that he’s the only person on the stage who had “spent extensive time alone with Putin, as well as with Erdogan,” referring to the leaders of Russia and Turkey.

Biden also blasted Trump for how he’s conducted global affairs.

“We have an erratic crazy president, who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy and operates out of fear for his own reelection,” Biden said. “The fact of the matter is you have Russia influencing and trying to break up NATO. What does the president do? He says: ‘I believe Vladimir Putin. I believe Vladimir Putin. I don’t believe our intelligence.’”

Booker also attacked Trump’s relationship with Putin, saying he had turned “the moral leadership of this country into a dumpster fire.”

“Russia and Putin understand strength, and this president, time and time again, is showing moral weakness. He is partnering more with Putin than he is with Merkel and Macron,” Booker said, referring to the leaders of Germany and France. “… I will stop this, and restore American integrity abroad.”

Asked about Trump’s decision, Castro launched a double-edged attack, criticizing the president’s policy of separating families at the U.S.-Mexico border while also taking aim at his withdrawal of troops from Syria.

“Think about how absurd it is that this president is caging kids on the border and effectively letting ISIS prisoners run free,” Castro said.

Sanders isn’t toning it down

Sanders gave a fiery answer, a signal that he is not toning down his combative tendencies in the wake of his health scare.

“Turkey is not a U.S. ally when they engage in another mass slaughter,” he said forcefully in the second hour of the debate.

Earlier, he eagerly reminded viewers that when it comes to Medicare-for-all, he “wrote the damn bill.""

And he gave one of the most impassioned defenses yet of his health-care plan, challenging Democrats to have the “guts” to stand up to the insurance companies and fight for a system that offers universal care.

Two veterans onstage face off on involvement in Syria

Gabbard and Buttigieg, the only veterans onstage, faced off on the question of U.S. involvement in Syria and what to do about Turkey’s attack on the Kurds, waged days after Trump ordered U.S. troops out of Syria.

Gabbard called the situation “yet another negative consequence of the regime-change war that we've been waging in Syria.” But she placed blame beyond Trump to include politicians “from both parties” and the mainstream media.

“Well, respectfully, Congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong,” Buttigieg told Gabbard. “The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence. It’s a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values.”

He said U.S. troops were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and the resurgence of the Islamic State.

“Really, what you’re saying, Mayor Pete, is you would continue to support having troops in Syria for an indefinite period of time, to continue this regime-change war?” Gabbard asked.

Buttigieg said what the United States was doing in Syria was keeping its word.

“Part of what makes it possible for the United States to get people to put their lives on the line to back us up is the idea that we will back them up, too,” he said. “I would have a hard time today looking at an Afghan civilian or soldier in the eye after what just happened over there, and it is undermining the honor of our soldiers. You take away the honor of our soldiers, you might as well go after their body armor next.”

Buttigieg, Klobuchar call Warren’s plans unrealistic

For the second time this evening, Buttigieg and Klobuchar attacked Warren for promoting an unrealistic policy. Both went after her wealth-tax plan and tried to appeal to more-moderate voters.

“Washington politicians … [offer] the most elegant policy prescriptions, and nothing changes,” Buttigieg said, a comment directed at Warren.

Klobuchar chimed in with a more pointed attack, suggesting that Warren’s characterization of her competitors’ plans was unfair.

“I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires. We just have different approaches. Your idea is not the only idea,” Klobuchar said.

O’Rourke joined in too, calling the Massachusetts Democrat’s wealth-tax plan “punitive.”

Warren quickly fired back. “I’m really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I’m punitive,” she said.

After the moderators tossed a question to Booker, the New Jersey Democrat took a moment to call on his competitors to tone down the intraparty attacks.

“You know, we’ve got one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president, and how we talk about each other in this debate really matters,” Booker said, drawing applause from the crowd.

Billionaires’ place in America is discussed

At one point, Sanders was asked whether his goal was to “tax billionaires out of existence.” The Vermont senator launched into a lengthy speech about income inequality in the United States, lamenting the staggering number of homeless, uninsured, underinsured and debt-burdened Americans.

“Then you also have three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society. That is a moral and economic outrage,” Sanders said. “And the truth is, we cannot afford to continue this level of income and wealth inequality, and we cannot afford a billionaire class.”

Steyer, the only billionaire on the debate stage, agreed that Sanders was right to go after the wealthy.

“There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor. And the results are as shameful,” Steyer said. “As Senator Sanders says, both in terms of assets and in terms of income, it’s absolutely wrong, it's absolutely undemocratic and unfair.”

Steyer then advocated for a wealth tax, ending Trump’s tax cuts and increasing the minimum wage.

Warren takes on Yang on universal basic income

Warren found herself on defense for much of the first half-hour of the debate. But as the end of the first hour neared, she played offense against Yang, taking on the entrepreneur over his signature issue, universal basic income, which would guarantee every American $1,000 a month, no matter their employment status.

“I think the thing closest to universal basic income is Social Security,” Warren said, arguing that her proposal for strengthening Social Security would do more to protect vulnerable Americans than Yang’s plan.

She added that she wants to “see the data.”

“I have the data,” Yang quickly shot back.

Harris brings up abortion

During the back and forth on Medicare-for-all, Harris noted that women’s reproductive rights did not come up in any of the previous debates, even though, she said, Republican state legislatures are trying to dismantle those rights.

“This is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle and not nearly one word, with all of these discussions about health care, on women’s access to reproductive health care, which is under full-on attack in America today,” she said. “It’s outrageous.”

Harris continued, “People need to keep their hands off of women’s bodies and let women make the decisions about their own lives.”

Medicare-for-all: Who would pay?

In the first policy debate of the evening, Warren and Buttigieg sparred over whether middle-class taxes would go up under Medicare-for-all.

“I have made clear what my principles are here: Costs will go up for the wealthy and for corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down,” Warren said.

Buttigieg, who has previously accused Warren of being “evasive” on that question, said she was doing so again on the debate stage.

“A yes-or-no question that didn’t get a yes-or-no answer,” Buttigieg charged, before touting his own plan, “Medicare for All Who Want It,” which institutes a public option but allows private insurance companies to remain.

Sanders cut in, noting that he was the person “who wrote the damn bill.”

If the proposal is passed, taxes are going to go up significantly — for the wealthiest Americans, Sanders said.

Warren faced more flak from another opponent: Klobuchar, who argued Warren was “making Republican talking points right now in this room.”

Klobuchar also prompted applause from the crowd — a rarity so far this evening — when she raised the issue of the opioid epidemic.

Sanders and Biden, who have long disagreed over health-care policy, engaged in one of their sharpest exchanges on the topic in any debate.

Biden suggested Warren and Sanders needed to be clearer about the high costs of their plan, and he sought to steal some of Buttigieg’s thunder by saying that the mayor’s approach is effectively one he has spearheaded — expanding Obamacare.

Sanders snapped back, arguing that those who are defending the current system are advocating for a problematic approach in which many Americans are suffering. He said he gets “a little tired, I must say, of people defending a system which is dysfunctional, which is cruel.”

Biden addresses questions on Ukraine

Biden said he did nothing wrong when he worked on Ukrainian policy as vice president while his son was serving on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company.

“My son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government rooting out corruption in Ukraine. And that's what we should be focusing on,” Biden said.

Biden then pivoted to talking about Trump’s corruption, saying a statement his son put out today “speaks for itself.”

Pressed to answer whether it was a mistake for his son to take the position, Biden dodged the question.

“I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having to do with Ukraine,” Biden said. “We’ve always kept everything separate even when my son was the attorney general of the state of Delaware. We never discussed it so there’d be no potential conflict. My son made a judgment. I’m proud of the judgment he made. I’m proud of what he had to say.”

It was unclear what judgment Biden was referring to, but he seemed to be talking about his son’s public statement where he said it was a mistake for him to take the job.

Yang wants to talk about economic problems

While many of the candidates spent their first few minutes talking about Trump and the impeachment inquiry, Yang took a different approach, encouraging Democrats to focus on the economic problems that paved the way for Trump’s win in 2016.

“When we talk about him, we are losing,” Yang said of Trump. He noted that the debate was unfolding in Ohio, a state Trump won. “Why did Donald Trump win your state by eight points?” he asked, before pointing out the manufacturing job losses that have occurred in the state.

“These are the problems that got Donald Trump elected,” Yang said.

Steyer makes debate-stage debut

In his first debate appearance, Steyer noted that he began his “Need to Impeach” campaign two years ago, long before the other Democrats onstage embraced the idea.

Even as he sought to distinguish himself from the others onstage, Steyer also praised them, saying that every Democratic candidate was “more decent and patriotic than the criminal in the White House.”

Buttigieg, meanwhile, cast himself as a uniter who can bring the country together after Trump has left the White House. “One way or another, this presidency is going to come to an end,” Buttigieg said, asking listeners what it’s going to feel like the first day the sun comes up after Trump is no longer president. “Really think about where we’ll be — vulnerable, even more torn apart by politics than we are right now.”

“I’m running to be the president who can turn the page and unify a dangerously polarized country,” he added.

Candidates talk about impeachment support

In his first comments, Biden said Trump’s decision to stonewall every congressional investigation led him to support the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry. Biden drew a contrast between Trump and the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. At that time, Biden said lawmakers needed to be mindful of the American people’s vote.

“He’s gone so far to say since this latest event … I will not cooperate,” Biden said. “They have no choice but to move.”

Biden, who has found himself at the center of the impeachment inquiry, said nothing more about the specifics of the House investigation or his role in it.

Harris echoed her competitors, expressing her support of the impeachment inquiry and adding that she didn’t think the impeachment process would take very long.

“Because as a former prosecutor, I know a confession when I see it,” Harris said.

Striking a more cautious tone, Booker said he understood “the outrage that we all feel” but said it was important to conduct the impeachment process in an “honorable” way that did not further divide the country.

Both Klobuchar and Castro brushed off concerns that impeachment would be a “distraction,” saying U.S. lawmakers and voters were capable of doing two things at once.

“When [Trump] made that call to the head of Ukraine, he’s digging up dirt on an opponent,” Klobuchar said. “That’s illegal conduct; that’s what he was doing.”

Sanders goes after Trump and Republicans

Sanders, who has been off the campaign trail for two weeks after suffering a heart attack, also went after Trump and Senate Republicans. “Mitch McConnell has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate,” said Sanders, speaking about the topic of impeachment.

While his voice was a bit scratchy as he spoke, Sanders sounded much clearer than he did in the last debate, when he was noticeably hoarse. He is positioned toward the middle of the stage, to the left of Biden. Sanders stood patiently with his hands in front of him as Biden delivered his first remarks of the debate.

Debate starts with discussion of impeachment

The moderators wasted no time tackling the issue of the impeachment inquiry into Trump. Warren got the first question, on why she believes Congress should hold impeachment proceedings rather than leaving the issue of Trump’s fitness for office up to the voters to decide next November.

Warren’s response: “Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.”

Sanders, too, defended his call for impeaching Trump, adding that McConnell “has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate.”

Biden — who only recently came out in favor of impeachment — called Trump the most corrupt president in history. He highlighted the White House’s efforts to stonewall the impeachment inquiry. “They have no choice but to move,” he said of House Democrats.

The debate

To qualify, candidates had to hit 2 percent in at least four polls approved by the Democratic National Committee and receive contributions from at least 130,000 individual donors. The debate is at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, in the Columbus suburbs."

You said what you said, and the fact is after that exchange with Jonathan Karl, you were asked another time why the aid was held up, what was the condition for the aid, and you didn’t mention two conditions, you mentioned three conditions.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) defends his progressive turf. “Sen. Bernie Sanders returned to the campaign trail in New York on Saturday for a rally with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who delivered to him one of the most sought-after endorsements in progressive politics and called for a ‘mass mobilization’ of young, working class voters in 2020.”

At least one senator is defending decency and conservative values. “[Sen. Mitt] Romney has emerged as an outspoken dissident in Trump’s Republican Party. In just the past few weeks, he has denounced the president’s attempts to solicit dirt on political rivals from foreign governments as ‘wrong and appalling’; suggested that his fellow Republicans are looking the other way out of a desire for power; and condemned Trump’s troop withdrawal in Syria as a ‘bloodstain on the annals of American history.’” Good for him.

Unfortunately, most Republicans still defend Trump’s incompetence and malfeasance. “I cannot fathom why being in Congress would be worth sacrificing your last shreds of dignity and integrity while knowing that history will remember you with utter embarrassment. And yet, that’s what many Republicans seem to be willing to do. Watching people I have admired for many years contradict themselves from one day to the next simply because Trump commands them to do so is immensely sad, not just for me, but for the country — and for them.”

When will Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tire of defending the indefensible? He claims not to know they were capitulating entirely to the Turks. “I was there. It sure didn’t feel that way when we were negotiating.” Huh?!

We shouldn’t be too dismissive, of course. Money enables you to pay for advertising and for staff, especially the organizers who are vital to corralling supporters in the early states.

But it’s notable that Sanders is raising all that money at a time when he’s been struggling to win over new converts, and that struggle has led to a lot of negative media stories with headlines like “Bernie Sanders Is in Trouble.”

Or look at Pete Buttigieg. He has run a remarkably effective fundraising campaign for a 30-something mayor of a small city. In the second quarter of the year, he raised $24.8 million. In the third quarter, he raised $19.1 million.

And what has the money produced? The RealClearPolitics poll average puts Buttigieg at 5.4 percent nationally, vying for fourth place with Kamala D. Harris. He does slightly better in Iowa, but he’s still in fourth place there. He might experience a surge of interest and support, but it probably won’t happen because he drops a few tens of millions on Iowa.

The lesson: Money is necessary to win a presidential nomination, but not sufficient.

That’s especially true when everyone seems to have plenty of money, at least among the top and mid-tier candidates. If you were the only one running thousands of Facebook ads, that would be one thing, but if your ads are jostling for attention with those of 10 other candidates, all the spending probably isn’t doing much good, other than forcing voters not to forget you exist.

Speaking of Facebook, the biggest political spender there is, of course, President Trump, who has been pouring money into ads on the platform all year. He has already spent millions on Facebook ads defending himself on impeachment just in the past few days. To what end? The ads are no doubt being watched by his most ardent supporters, or hate-watched by his opponents. But is anyone really being persuaded to change their minds about him?

AD

AD

As of his last quarterly report three months ago, Trump’s reelection campaign had already spent more than $150 million, if you include the outside groups supporting him. And yet he trails all the leading Democrats in pretty much every head-to-head matchup.

If you were sitting next to Mitch McConnell, he’d lean over and say, “See, I told you — there isn’t too much money in politics. This is all fine.”

That is most definitely not the point. Politicians still become captive to their donors, and there are lots of situations where big money sways elections. But those are more likely to happen lower down the ballot — House races, statehouse races, local races — where a corporation or super-rich individual can give a candidate so much help that the whole playing field is tilted.

AD

Indeed, while so much money pours into presidential campaigns that another million here or there doesn’t really change anything, that’s not true in down-ballot races. And there some really important ones going on right now.

AD

In Virginia, where Republicans narrowly control both houses of the state legislature, Democrats have a good shot to seize total control of state government in this November’s elections. That would mean they’ll not only be able to pass all kinds of progressive legislation that could positively affect people’s lives, it also means they’ll control redistricting after the 2020 Census.

This is also true of many of the state legislative contests that will be unfolding across the country in 2020, which could impact voting rights, redistricting and local legislative battles in all kinds of ways. Just ask Republicans — who swept state races in 2010 and used their new power to gerrymander and pass voter suppression laws to lock that power in for the years that followed — how important those races are.

AD

And those races can turn on a relatively small amount of money. I’m not trying to discourage anyone from donating to a presidential candidate. If you’re inclined to give the one you like $20 or $100 or $1,000, go right ahead. But you might consider matching that donation with another to somebody who could really use it.

AD

For instance, Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., invited listeners to “picture what it’s going to be like” after Trump is gone, then said:

AD

It starts out feeling like a happy thought. This particular brand of chaos and corruption will be over. But really think about where we’ll be: vulnerable, even more torn apart by politics than we are right now. And these big issues from the economy to climate change have not taken a vacation during the impeachment process. I’m running to be the president who can turn the page and unify a dangerously polarized country while tackling those issues that are going to be just as urgent then as they are now.

For Buttigieg, it’s largely a matter of “turning the page” on the Trump era. Elsewhere he’s used the metaphor of “changing the channel” away from this “horror show.” After this, Buttigieg promises to heal the country’s divisions while also getting to work on its challenges.

But in spite of his recognition that we face “big issues,” for Buttigieg, this need for healing actually argues for tempering our policy ambitions. Buttigieg basically said just this, noting that we should not attempt Medicare-for-all because after Trump, our country will be “horrifyingly polarized,” and expanding Medicare voluntarily can achieve universal health care without further exacerbating that polarization.

AD

In short: Too much ambition means more division, and we’ve already got as much of that as we can take.

It’s hard to overstate how fundamentally different a reading that is from that offered by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). She declared that the only way Democrats can beat Trump is by “addressing head-on” the fact that “the wealthy and the well-connected have captured our democracy,” adding:

AD

People in our own party don’t want to admit that. They think that running some kind of vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of big problems in this country is a winning strategy. They are wrong. If all Democrats can promise is after Donald Trump it will be business as usual, then we will lose. Democrats win when we call out what’s broken and we show how to fix it. ... Democrats will win when we give people a reason to get in the fight.

That’s a fairly direct indictment of the caution offered by Buttigieg — and Joe Biden, whose agenda is somewhat more liberal than is commonly acknowledged, but who nonetheless is making his No. 1 mission to “restore” the country’s unity after Trump’s racism tore it apart.

AD

In Warren’s diagnosis, the problem is oligarchic capture of our political economy. It isn’t just that vowing to genuinely take on this capture is necessary to mobilize the grass-roots energy to defeat Trump but also that it threatens to persist as a defining feature of the After Trump era.

Over and over, Warren says shrinking from “big fights” is the wrong thing to be signaling an intention to do — contra Buttigieg, the prospect of deep divisions after Trump calls for more ambitious reform efforts. Thus Warren proposes deep reforms to rid Washington of corruption and to restructure the economy.

AD

If anything, Bernie Sanders went even more decisively in that direction. He argued that the way to end the “hatred” and “division” inflicted on the country by Trump is with …

AD

… an agenda that works for every man, woman, and child in this country rather than the corporate elite and the 1 percent. A progressive agenda that stands for all is the way that we transform this country.

Transforming the country, Sanders noted, means dealing with the stark facts that “87 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured,” that “half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck” and that we face “the existential threat of climate change.”

It’s often suggested that the fundamental divide among Democrats is between those who see Trump as merely a passing aberration — after which something resembling normalcy can be restored — and those who see him as a symptom of much more deeply rooted systemic problems with our economy and democracy.

But the divide might be better expressed this way: It’s between those who think the deep ferment of the moment calls for a combination of some sort of unspecified unifying salve and a promise of minimal post-Trump disruption, and those who see it as an opportunity — to jolt Americans into an awareness that things are so badly off track that we need to reach for something much bigger.

While I have no inside information to confirm this, I’m fairly sure that it took so long because she and her team have been trying to figure out how to thread the needle on what may be an impossible problem, one with both policy and political implications. It’s hard to see how she’ll solve it.

Up until recently, Warren had seemed open to multiple approaches to achieve universal coverage and control costs. Although she co-sponsored Bernie Sanders’s single-payer plan in the Senate, she also co-sponsored other, more modest proposals (that’s true of other candidates, including Sanders himself).

AD

AD

But eventually Warren began speaking more firmly about her support for Medicare-for-all. Even if it’s a term with various definitions, she made clear her belief that insurance companies are at the center of what ails the system. They extract billions in profits while adding no value to anyone. And they do it, as Warren often points out, by collecting as much as possible in premiums and paying out as little as possible in claims.

At a different time, those ideas might still have left flexibility to take a number of approaches. The problem Warren faces is that within the Democratic Party, what used to be a lefty proposal — the creation of a widely available public option resembling Medicare or Medicaid — has now become the conservative position. The candidates espousing it — Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar — are now attacking Warren from the right.

A couple of years ago, Warren could have said, “I support Medicare-for-all, which is why we should create a public option now, and over time, more people will migrate to it from private insurance. The transition will be less disruptive than if we did it all at once.” That wouldn’t have been seen as contradictory.

AD

AD

But now, saying that — especially since it’s basically what Buttigieg says — would be seen as a sellout and a flip-flop. Warren has seemingly been trapped into proposing something more closely resembling Sanders’s plan, not just by what she has said but by the way the rest of the field has moved.

That’s what happened to Kamala D. Harris. She’d said some of the same things as Warren about insurance companies. But when she released her plan — which would allow private insurers to compete with a government plan and so essentially universalize Medicare as it is now and not as it is in Sanders’s enormously generous vision (which is “Medicare-for-all” in the same way a Lexus LC500 is a Toyota Corolla) — it was greeted with contempt from the right and the left.

Warren could face the same problem. About a year and a half ago, Democrats all started saying they wanted Medicare-for-all, but they were using the term to refer to both single-payer and public option plans. Then pollsters began asking about it, and it turned out public option plans are much more popular.

AD

AD

The most important reason for this is loss aversion — people are afraid of losing what they have even if they’ll get something better in exchange and react positively to choice. There are plenty of arguments as to why single payer is actually superior, but few believe the public will grasp the nuances.

Before, the political advantages of public option plans weren’t clear. Now they are. That’s Warren’s dilemma: How can she offer something true to what she has said until now and doesn’t open her up to attacks that prey on the public’s fear of losing their insurance?

I honestly have no idea. But meanwhile, let’s keep a couple of things in mind.

The first is that the media’s incessant focus (and that of a couple of the candidates) on whether taxes will be raised on the middle class to fund Medicare-for-all is utterly inane. The whole point is moving from a system in which trillions of dollars are shunted through insurance companies to one in which that money moves through the government — minus what the insurance companies take for themselves.

AD

AD

When Warren says that what matters is the cost people pay and not whether it goes toward taxes or premiums, she’s exactly right. According to the Peterson-Kaiser Health System Tracker, the typical family of four with employer-sponsored coverage now spends $12,500 a year on health care, plus $1,450 in Medicare taxes, plus $13,050 that their employer contributes, for a total of $27,000 dollars in total costs.

The idea that it would be somehow worse to pay more in taxes while paying less in premiums and co-pays is both absurd and dishonest.

The second is that that we in the media judge Democrats and Republicans by wildly different standards when evaluating this kind of policy proposal. Donald Trump’s 2016 health-care plan consisted of “Everybody’s going to be taken care of, much better than they’re taken care of now.” It was gibberish, but the media pretty much let it slide.

AD

AD

Even before its release, Warren’s plan is being treated as though cost is the only thing that matters. But the far more important questions include: How will this work? What will the effects be on providers? How long will the transition be? How does Warren plan to overcome the opposition of wealthy interests? What will it mean for our economy and quality of life when everyone is covered and no one ever has to fight with an insurance company again?

Those are the questions we should be asking. I hope she has some good answers.

Part of her success is attributable to her aggressive challenging of Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s Medicare-for-all scheme. Klobuchar likes to say she does not want to “trash” President Barack Obama’s achievement but rather build on it. while Warren is now scrambling to show how a plan costing $30 trillion or more over 10 years is going to be funded. (Hint: If Sen. Bernie Sanders had to resort to taxing those making over $29,000 and adding to the payroll tax, Warren is going to have a tough time.) And Klobuchar got a boost this week when it was announced that Obamacare premiums will be going down.

Klobuchar has a couple of other possible lines of attack that both undermine Warren and boost her own résumé .

For starters, the Massachusetts Democrat’s trade plan has been widely panned by both Republicans and Democrats. Daniel W. Drezner wrote in The Post: “It’s a great plan — if you don’t like the benefits of trade and want to see it restricted as severely as possible. If you think freer trade is good for the economy and good for foreign policy, then it’s the mother of all dumpster fires … Warren’s trade policy would actually be more protectionist in its effects than Trump’s, something that I did not think was possible.”

AD

AD

Contrast that with Klobuchar, who is likely the most knowledgeable Democratic presidential candidate when it comes to farmers and trade. (“Klobuchar largely sticks to mainstream agricultural policy proposals, eschewing more liberal reforms sought by other candidates like Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.),” Politico reported in August. “Warren and Sanders, for example, seek to improve the farm economy by aggressively targeting consolidation in the industry and propose breaking up large companies that have taken on outsize power in the pesticide, seed and meatpacking sectors.”) She has railed about Trump’s tariff war, which she describes as “complete chaos.” In Iowa, trade policy and agricultural fluency matter.

In addition, Klobuchar advocates a balanced internationalist foreign policy, which contrasts with Warren’s more radical message. She commented on Syria in the last debate. “We need to work with our allies, to work with Turkey and bring them out. This is an outrageous thing that happened here,” she declared. “And I think we need to talk about this not only in terms of the horror of what happened here with Turkey, but the fact that our president blew it and now he’s too proud to say it.” She continued: “And what do we do now? We continue that humanitarian aid, but then we work with our allies to say come back, Turkey, and stop this … Think about our other allies, Israel. How do they feel right now? Donald Trump is not true to his word when they are a beacon of democracy in the Mideast. Think about our allies in Europe when he pulls out of the Iranian agreement and gives them holding the bag and gives the power to China and Russia.”

Klobuchar has a short-term goal (get into the next debate) and a longer-term goal (do well in Iowa). For the first time in the race, it seems her “moderate from the heartland” message might work, especially if she can set up a contrast with super-progressive candidates whose electability and radical plans become more suspect as the primary goes on.

Fifty-five percent of respondents support opening the inquiry; 44 percent don’t.

In this poll, “Elizabeth Warren had the support of 27 percent [of adults surveyed], with Joe Biden backed by 26 percent and Bernie Sanders a distant third at 10 percent. Support for South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg climbed to 7 percent from 5 percent. No other candidate polled more than 3 percent.” Warren has been steadily climbing (up 10 percent since August polling) while Biden gradually has been slightly declining (down 4 percent since August).

Perhaps worse for Biden, his lead over President Trump, which has bolstered his electability argument, is declining. (“The October poll showed Biden beating Trump 51 percent to 44 percent. He led 54 percent [to] 42 percent in September.”)

Let’s look at five critical questions for Democrats, beginning with Biden. His own numbers are slightly down, but his biggest challenge is a clear opponent in second place who has vacuumed up support from other contenders. Warren seems to have improved at Sanders’s expense but also as Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.), Beto O’Rourke and others remain mired in middle to low single digits. While Biden is punching back against Trump and spurious accusations against himself, he has yet to puncture Warren’s appeal. For him, the real question is: How and when does he take on Warren’s progressivism?

That brings us to the second question, this one concerning Warren. She has not had to go after Sanders to establish herself as the stand-out candidate for progressives. Even before Sanders’s heart attack, she was establishing herself as more engaging, prepared and accessible candidate, one with a clear message she articulates well. She has not, however, faced serious challenges, although Buttigieg has begun poking and prodding her to give a direct answer on how she will fund her Medicare-for-all. Debates, we have learned, are not the ideal place to attack another candidate, given the voters’ distaste for intra-party fights. However, at some point either Biden or a Biden alternative from the center of the ideological spectrum is going to need to go directly at voters’ concern that she may be too far left to regain key states lost in 2016. Warren’s big open question: Can she draw from all segments of the party — including moderates and African Americans (many of whom are moderate) — without losing her base?

AD

AD

The third question is whether Sanders, who was already slipping in the polls, falls even further to the point where he is a non-factor or leaves the race entirely? Sanders’ heart attack — and his campaign’s less than immediately candid explanation of his health situation — will undoubtedly and appropriately raise questions about health, age and endurance. (That should also be an issue for Biden, Warren and Trump.) If he does drift down in polling, the assumption is that Warren would win the lion’s share of his voters, but that is far from certain. Polling shows that Biden, however, is the second choice of many Sanders voters. Ryan Cooper wrote in September, “The top second choice for Sanders supporters is actually Biden (26 percent versus 24 percent for Warren). Meanwhile, Sanders is the top second choice for Warren supporters, but only by a small margin (24 percent for Sanders versus 21 percent for Biden). Voters often have weird preferences like that.” Sanders’s question is: Can he can regain his second-place standing and, if not, where do his voters go?

The fourth question has to do with Trump’s impeachment. If he looks more vulnerable, Democratic voters might be willing to take a chance on a riskier candidate; if he is not on the ballot, the entire “electability” argument may be turned on its head given the widespread believe it was Trump personally, not the GOP, who picked the lock on the states in the Upper Midwest. Conversely, Biden might have a good case to make that given the wreckage Trump will leave behind, someone with no learning curve needs to get into the Oval Office as soon as possible, especially on the foreign policy realm. (If the public perceives how badly Trump has bollixed up foreign policy and shredded alliances, Biden’s stock may go up.) So many candidates and voters have operated under the assumption the Trump of pre-impeachment days would be on the ballot, thereby necessitating a certain kind of nominee. The open question for the entire field is: How does impeachment affect both the candidates’ messages and their appeal?

Finally, the early, small states in the primary calendar will have plenty to say about who continues on in the race and who, if anyone, can climb into contention. Both Buttigieg and Harris are campaigning strenuously in Iowa; Buttigieg’s polling and fundraising numbers suggest he could well pass a fading Sanders, especially in an early state Sanders might have been expected to dominate. It once seemed inconceivable that a Midwest mayor of a medium-sized city could move up to challenge the two top contenders. Buttigieg remains a long shot, but not an inconceivable nominee. Our final question then becomes: Is Buttigieg or anyone else in the field capable of riding a wave to a better-than-expected finish in an early state, thereby lifting the candidate into the top tier?

AD

Here are a few other things we learned.

Feeling the burn (rate)

You know the primaries are getting close when the candidates start spending big. That was certainly the case in the third quarter. All but four of the leading candidates spent more money than they raised, creating a “burn rate” of more than 100 percent. The only exceptions were Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) (75 percent) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) (84 percent), South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg (95 percent) and Andrew Yang (43 percent).

AD

(Side note: It seems the guy who wants to give away free money isn’t exactly doing that with his campaign.)

The highest burn rate from a non-self-funder belonged to Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who raised $4.8 million and spent $7.8 million for a burn rate of 162 percent. That’s important because the Minnesota Democrat is still struggling to make the fifth debate. Having dropped so much cash in the third quarter and not making too much headway in the polls isn’t great, which may explain her more combative debate performance Tuesday.

AD

Speaking of trouble: Julián Castro

Making the next debate requires getting to 3 percent in four qualifying national or early-state polls, or getting to 5 percent in two early-state polls. Klobuchar at least has $3.6 million in the bank and one 3 percent poll. The situation for Julián Castro, though, appears more dire.

AD

He raised less than all but two of the 12 candidates on the debate stage Tuesday ($3.5 million), and he has by far the lowest cash on hand ($672,000). With no qualifying polls thus far, a middling performance Tuesday and with very little in the bank to try to improve his lot, it’s difficult to see how he makes that next debate.

Booker’s gambit pays off

With 10 days left in the quarter, news leaked out that Sen. Cory Booker was telling supporters he needed to raise at least $1.7 million down the stretch to stay in the campaign. He got it, and it’s about the only thing separating him from his own pretty dire financial situation.

AD

The New Jersey Democrat has $4.2 million cash on hand thanks to the late $2 million infusion he got. That’s way behind the top five candidates, and it’s also behind Yang ($6.4 million). The good news for Booker is he’s already in the next debate. Now he needs to show some momentum so that he doesn’t have to resort to such gimmicks to raise money.

AD

Steyer’s $47 million self-funding explosion

Klobuchar’s and Castro’s struggle to make the next debate has to be all the more difficult to swallow given the one newcomer in Tuesday’s debate — billionaire Tom Steyer — has already qualified for it. Steyer is one of just seven candidates who are set for the fifth debate at this point.

AD

How has he done it? By absolutely flooding early states with his own money and getting the polls he needs in them. Steyer spent an astounding $47 million in the third quarter, almost all of it from his own pocket and more than doubling what every other candidate spent. Sanders was next in line at $21.3 million.

Sanders wins again, right when he needed to show staying power

Sanders hasn’t exactly kept pace with Warren in national polls, and some of his early-state poll numbers have waned, but he remains the fundraising champion. For the third time in three quarters, he beat everyone else.

AD

For the second quarter in a row, Sanders pulled in a little over $25 million and narrowly outpaced the second-place candidate. In the second quarter, the runner-up was Buttigieg ($24.9 million), and in the third it was Warren ($24.7 million).

Sanders also has the most cash on hand, at $33.7 million — a number buoyed by $12.7 million in transfers from his old campaign committee. That suggests, despite the health problems he faced in the past few weeks and the lack of early traction, he can be in this thing for the long haul if he really wants to.

Both are ardent critics of the glut of money in politics, and because of their self-imposed limits, both say their campaigns are “100 percent” funded by grass-roots donors.

AD

These identical claims got our interest.

Sanders and Warren have raised most of their campaign money this year from small-dollar donations. Yet both also have tapped millions of dollars left over from previous campaigns — from a time when they had not yet adopted the strict fundraising practices they currently follow. That complicates their claim to “100 percent” grass-roots purity.

AD

It’s a good example of how the complexities of the campaign finance system sometimes get blurred in the service of an appealing talking point. Let’s dig in.

The Facts

Sanders had raised $46.3 million by the end of the second quarter, according to Federal Election Commission records. That includes $10.1 million transferred from previous campaigns.

AD

When not counting transfers, 77 percent of Sanders’s fundraising this year came from donations of $200 or less. That’s the highest share of small-dollar donations relative to total fundraising among all major candidates. When counting transfers, the share of small-dollar donations is 60 percent.

Warren had raised $35.6 million by the end of the second quarter, FEC records show. That includes $10.4 million transferred from her 2018 Senate campaign.

When not counting transfers, 67 percent of Warren’s fundraising this year came from donations of $200 or less. When counting transfers, the proportion is 48 percent.

AD

“Grass-roots funding” has no formal definition. Sanders and Warren seem to define it in terms of the money they won’t accept.

AD

Sanders doesn’t hold closed-door fundraisers to solicit high-dollar contributions and doesn’t accept money from corporate PACs or super PACs, or from fossil fuel, drug or insurance companies. Warren doesn’t hold closed-door fundraisers to solicit high-dollar contributions and doesn’t accept money from federal lobbyists or PACs, or fossil fuel or pharmaceutical executives.

Considering these restrictions, it’s plausible to describe all the money Sanders and Warren have raised directly this year as grass-roots funding.

But there’s another piece of the pie here. As noted, Sanders and Warren each have transferred nearly $10 million from previous campaigns to their 2020 presidential committees.

AD

AD

In Sanders’s case, FEC records show he had transferred $4.6 million from his 2016 to 2020 presidential campaign committee as of the end of the second quarter.

In his previous presidential campaign, Sanders had somewhat looser fundraising restrictions in place. News reports show he held at least a few events in 2015 where he sought high-dollar donations.

Time magazine reported in December 2015: “Sanders has hosted at least nine medium- to high-dollar, closed-door fundraisers in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere to directly fund his own presidential campaign. Even though Sanders’ efforts sometimes have a proletarian flair — he held one $200-per-ticket fundraiser at a dive bar near a grungy Seattle park — some aspects of the Democratic insurgent’s fundraising are similar to the candidates he condemns.”

AD

AD

The New York Times reported in October 2015: “Mr. Sanders was cheered at a fancy campaign fund-raiser at the Hollywood home of Syd Leibovitch, a high-end real estate agent, and his wife, Linda, on Wednesday night. Tickets for the event sold for a minimum of $250. Those who spent the maximum, $2,700, or who raised $10,000, were invited to a ‘pre-event reception,’ according to the invitation.”

Sanders spokeswoman Sarah Ford said: “In 2016, we held zero closed-door fundraisers with high-dollar donors and accepted no donations from corporate PACs, corporate lobbyists or super PACs.”

When we asked about the high-dollar fundraising in 2015, though, a Sanders aide said, “We do not plan to transfer the amount of money from the 2016 account that came from fundraisers with high-dollar donors in attendance.”

AD

AD

The Sanders aide added that, for the 2020 campaign, grass-roots fundraisers “run alongside the senator’s schedule at public venues and are live-streamed on social media.” The aide added: “They are open to the public and tickets start at $27.”

In Warren’s case, FEC records show she jump-started her presidential campaign this year with a $10.4 million transfer from her 2018 Senate committee. The infusion allowed her to build a campaign apparatus early in the race.

For her 2018 Senate reelection campaign, Warren raised money at events with high-dollar donors. A search of her FEC records showed max contributions of $5,400 from the chief executives of DreamWorks and Yelp, media mogul Haim Saban, philanthropist Alexander Soros, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, hedge fund owners and wealthy investors, and some donors who have given millions to the Democratic Party. Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, film director Steven Spielberg and actress Barbra Streisand each donated $2,700 to Warren’s Senate campaign. (The contribution limit for individuals is $2,700 per race, but they can give that amount for both a primary and general election.)

AD

AD

Warren also benefited from some PAC donations when she ran for Senate, though it was a small share of her fundraising, as we explained in this fact check.

Warren raised $6 million in donations of $1,000 or more to her 2018 Senate campaign, a spokesman said. That’s about 23 percent of her total $25.8 million fundraising for that race. According to OpenSecrets, Sanders raised nearly $28 million in donations of $1,000 or more to his 2016 presidential campaign, a little more than 10 percent of his total $232 million haul for that race.

“The open secret of Ms. Warren’s campaign is that her big-money fund-raising through 2018 helped lay the foundation for her anti-big-money run for the presidency,” the Times reported this month, noting “trips to Hollywood and Silicon Valley, Martha’s Vineyard, and Philadelphia — all with fundraisers on the agenda.”

AD

AD

The Warren campaign in response to our questions said the average contribution to her Senate campaign in 2018 was $29.45, a sign of broad appeal among grass-roots donors.

Warren also “raised or donated $11 million to Democrats running for office and state parties in all 50 states,” a spokesman said.

“Elizabeth’s schedule is filled with town halls and selfie lines, not closed-door fundraisers with millionaires and billionaires, because she believes that to take back the White House we need to build a grassroots movement,” Warren spokesman Chris Hayden wrote in an email. “When we made the decision to run the campaign this way, the players in the usual money-for-influence game dismissed it as naive and said it would never work and it would kill the campaign. We're pleased that our grassroots strategy has been so effective that they're now threatened enough to be attacking us for it.”

AD

The Pinocchio Test

Sanders and Warren say they’re running presidential campaigns funded “100%” by grass-roots donors. It’s a big claim with no wiggle room.

Money is fungible, so it’s an artifice to claim that money from wealthy donors last time around isn’t being used this time around.

The key here is that Sanders and Warren define their presidential campaigns as entirely grass-roots-funded because of their self-imposed restrictions: no hobnobbing with rich donors in closed events and no PAC money, for example.

But Warren held high-dollar fundraisers for her 2018 Senate run and then transferred $10.4 million from that campaign account to her presidential committee. Her Senate run raised $6 million from donors who gave $1,000 or more, and she also took some PAC contributions.

Sanders in 2015 sought and received big checks from wealthy donors. Sanders’s 2020 committee so far has gotten $4.6 million from his prior presidential campaign.

These are omissions worthy of Two Pinocchios. As a share of total fundraising, however, Sanders was less dependent than Warren on high-dollar contributions in his previous campaign.

“Look what we got running for president in the Democratic Party. We can go over here to [the county jail] and get better people out of there than those running for Democratic, to be president of the United States,” Hurst said, according to CBS affiliate WVLT, which captured some of his comments on video. “We got a queer running for president, if that ain’t about as ugly as you can get.”

His comment — an apparent reference to Democratic candidate Pete Buttigieg, who is openly gay — drew laughter and applause from many in the room, Thompson said. Hurst then decried the plight of white men in the United States.

“I’m not prejudiced, but by golly, a white male in this country has very few rights, and they’re getting took more every day,” Hurst said. “You’ll hear ’em stand on the stage and say, ‘Oh, I’m for the poor and the black.’ You never heard one of them say ‘I believe white people have rights, too.’ ”

AD

Thompson’s exit was captured on video, too. The woman recalled standing up during Hurst’s remarks to comment on his lack of professionalism. But no one was supporting her sentiment, she said, so she left.

“I found it totally unprofessional, demeaning, bullying; I could not stay there any longer,” she said. “Think about how many people were in that room. I’m the only one who stood up and objected to it.”

Many Democrats in Sevier County keep their political affiliation private out of fear, Thompson said. But as Hurst’s rant has drawn national attention, leaders in Sevier and its surrounding jurisdictions have insisted that the commissioner’s views do not align with those of other officials in local government.

AD

Hurst’s statements “do not reflect the opinion or position of Sevier county administration,” according to the Sevier County Twitter account. The city of Sevierville, the county’s seat, was more explicit in its condemnation, writing that its administration rejects “bigotry and prejudice toward any and all persons.”

AD

In his own statement, Sevier County Mayor Larry Waters said he disapproved of Hurst’s comments, which were “his and his alone.”

“I have lived in Sevier County my whole life and know it as a place that is welcoming to everyone, as evidenced by the more than 12 million people who visit annually,” Waters said in a statement. “Generations of families have enjoyed our beautiful county and know that our citizens are caring and compassionate.”

AD

Sevier County’s nearly 100,000 residents are more than 95 percent white, according to census data, and that racial majority is reflected in its leadership. Assistant Mayor Perrin Anderson told The Washington Post that the county’s 25 commissioners are all white. The commission consists of 24 men and one woman. The primary focus of Monday’s monthly meeting was the resolution to make Sevier a Second Amendment sanctuary — which means legislators will refuse to enforce laws they believe will infringe on the constitutional right to keep and bear arms. It passed in a unanimous vote.

AD

Anderson stressed that Hurst’s comments were not related to anything on the meeting agenda. Hurst, who was elected to the commission in 1982, could not be reached for comment Tuesday but told WVLT he stands by his words. He also said some of his best friends were African American.

State Rep. Gloria Johnson (D), whose Knox County district is 30 miles west of Sevier County, said Hurst should resign from the commission. Johnson underscored the importance of tourism in Sevier, which lies near the popular Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The county also contains the mountain towns of Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge, both known for their tourist attractions.

AD

Johnson lamented the dozens of social media posts she’s seen from tourists to the area, some of whom have vowed not to return as long as Hurst remains on the commission.

AD

Pigeon Forge City Manager Earlene Teaster in a statement to WVLT said her city “in no way condone[s] Sevier County Commissioner Hurst’s disturbing comments” and “welcomes everyone with open arms. We do not discriminate.”

“It’s so frustrating because they rely a lot on tourists. It’s such a welcoming, wonderful place,” Johnson said in an interview. “But then you’ve got those elected officials there that are making statements like that, and the reality is, they represent everyone in the county — including the LGBTQ community. To lash out at their constituents like that is ridiculous.”

AD

Johnson called Hurst “wrong and ignorant” and said she was perturbed to see others laughing and clapping when he spoke.

“That should not be who we are; it’s frightening,” she added. “Someone said ‘Amen’ as if he was preaching a sermon. It’s all unacceptable, and we’ve got to do better.”

AD

Chris Sanders, executive director of the Tennessee Equality Project, which advocates for LGBTQ rights in the state, echoed Johnson’s call for Hurst to resign. The other option, he said, would be for the commission to introduce inclusive ordinances for Sevier County to bolster protections against discrimination on the basis of race, gender identity and sexual orientation.

AD

“There may be ways for him to make up for what he said, but they have to be concrete. We’re beyond an apology at this point,” Sanders said. “We need to see some real change backed up by public policy in that county.”

After a three-hour debate that showed sharper divisions in the Democratic field, the candidates were asked a question inspired by the friendship between talk show host Ellen DeGeneres and former president George W. Bush. Each candidate was asked to speak about a friendship that would be a surprise.

Three, Klobuchar, Sanders and Biden, named the late senator John McCain. Buttigieg said the people he met in the military from different walks of life. Warren said Charles Fried, a solicitor general in the Bush administration, who helped her get a job 27 years ago. She also mentioned her three older brothers whose politics are different from hers.

Harris said Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Gabbard said former congressman Trey Gowdy, and O’Rourke recalled driving with Rep. Will Hurd from Texas to Washington and airing the whole thing on Facebook. Booker referenced working with former New Jersey governor Chris Christie and his effort to dine with every Republican senator, including Ted Cruz (Tex.).

Gabbard also used the moment to take a veiled shot at Hillary Clinton, saying, “When I look out at our country, I don’t see deplorables. I see fellow Americans.”

Yang cited a trucker named Fred, an avid supporter of President Trump who he said is now supporting him.

“He let me ride in his truck for hours. He spent some time in jail. I heard about his experiences trying to get other people off of drugs, and I’m happy to say that after our ride together, he actually said that he would move from Donald Trump to my campaign, which was a thrill for me. And we’ve remained in touch ever since,” Yang said.

Warren, Biden face off on CFPB

Biden, situated onstage between liberal champions Sanders and Warren, attempted to distinguish himself as the realist with a résumé of successes.

“I'm going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here. But I'm the only one on this stage who has gotten anything really big done,” Biden said. “The question is who is best prepared. We all have good ideas.”

Warren shot back that she came up with the idea to create a consumer agency to keep big banks in check and that she helped get it passed.

Biden responded that he played a key role in persuading people to support that bill. “I went on the floor and got you votes,” Biden said. “So let’s get those things straight too.”

Warren paused before responding, “I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed in the law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it. And who helped pass it into law,” Warren said.

“Understand this: It was a dream-big fight-hard,” Warren said. “People told me go for something little, go for something small, go for something that the big corporations will be able to accept … we have to be willing to make big structural change.”

Candidates address abortion rights

Harris said that if she were elected president, her Justice Department would use “pre-clearance” to fight back against state legislators that pass unconstitutional abortion restrictions, so that those laws would not go into effect. She also recalled questioning Brett M. Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing and asking whether he could think of a law that sought to control only men’s bodies.

“And the answer was ‘Uh, uh, uh, no,’” Harris said. “The reality of it is, this is still a fundamental issue of justice for women in America.”

Several candidates, including Klobuchar and Castro, said they would codify Roe v. Wade. Booker said he would create an office of reproductive freedom in the White House to elevate the issue.

AD

Gabbard said the necessity of “safe, legal and rare” abortions was one of the rare things on which she agreed with Hillary Clinton. However, she said there should be restrictions in place so that abortions were not allowed in the third trimester “unless the life or severe health consequences of a woman are at risk.”

AD

Warren said she lived through a time in the United States when abortion was illegal and reminded the crowd that people still got abortions — if they could afford to travel to places where it was legal. It was the poor and young who were denied access, she said.

Biden takes stronger stance on justices

Biden has previously taken heat from the Democratic base because he suggested that Republicans would be willing to work with him if he were elected president.

AD

“With Trump gone, you’re going to begin to see things change,” Biden said earlier this year. “Because these folks know better. They know this isn’t what they’re supposed to be doing.”

On the debate stage Tuesday night, he struck a different note, declaring that he would take the same approach to the Supreme Court as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) did when he blocked the Senate from considering the nomination of Merrick Garland in 2016.

AD

At the time, McConnell had argued that the successor to the late Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia should be chosen by whichever president won the November 2016 election.

Biden said Tuesday night that, if one of the current Supreme Court justices steps down, he would make sure as the Democratic nominee that his party “would do exactly what McConnell did last time out: We would not allow any hearing to be held for a new justice.”

Harris wants Warren to join her call to kick Trump off Twitter

In their first notable disagreement of the night, Harris pressed Warren to join her in calling for Trump to be kicked off Twitter, accusing Warren of having a double standard when it comes to holding corporations accountable.

“I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter, I want to push him out of the White House,” Warren responded.

Warren then said the real problem is not whether Twitter will suspend Trump but the amount of corporate money in politics.

“You can't go behind closed doors and take the money of these executives, and then turn around and expect that these are the people who are actually finally going to enforce the laws,” Warren said.

AD

Harris pivoted back to the corporate accountability issue, arguing that Warren has different standards for different businesses.

“This is a matter of holding big tech accountable because they have an outsized influence on people’s perceptions about issues, and they actually influence behaviors, we all have to agree this is their power,” Harris said. “And so what I am saying is that it seems to me that you would be able to join me in saying the rule has to apply to Twitter the same way it does to Facebook.”

“I think all of the rules should apply across the board. I don’t have a problem with that,” Warren said, though she didn’t clarify whether she would support Harris’s call to kick Trump off Twitter.

Biden has an answer on his age

Biden had an answer ready when the moderators eventually asked him about his age. He turned the question around, emphasizing the experience and wisdom he has gained through his decades of public service.

AD

“I will not need any on-the-job training the day I take office,” the 76-year-old former vice president said.

Warren, 70, also fielded a similar question. She emphasized her tenacity, arguing that she will work harder than any other candidate, regardless of age.

“Well, I say, I will outwork, out-organize and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with,” she said, a nod to the possibility that Trump may be removed from office before the 2020 election.

Sanders, asked about health, says he’s ‘feeling great’

As the debate approached the two-hour mark, Sanders faced a question about his health.

“I’m healthy. I’m feeling great,” he said when a moderator broached the subject, before he insisted on weighing in on a previous question about drug laws.

When Booker pointed out Sanders favors legalizing marijuana, Sanders quipped, “I'm not on it tonight.""

Then Sanders, who suffered a heart attack two weeks ago, gave a more serious answer, telling Americans he would prove to them that he has the fitness to serve by “mounting a vigorous campaign,” including a comeback rally with a special guest in New York on Saturday.

Klobuchar makes opioid epidemic personal

Klobuchar made a question about the opioid epidemic personal by relating a story about her father, who struggled with an alcohol addiction, as a reason there should be more investment in treatment programs.

“My dad, he struggled with alcoholism his whole life, and by his third DWI, they said to him, ‘you’re going to face jail or you got to go to treatment.’ He picked treatment, and he was pursued by grace, and he has been sober ever since,” Klobuchar said.

Klobuchar has spoken about her father’s struggles before, most famously during the confirmation hearing of Kavanaugh.

The senator also mentioned drug executives’ emails revealed by The Washington Post, in which one said about pills: “Just like Doritos keep eating. We’ll make more.”

Debate turns to gun control

The candidates delivered impassioned arguments on gun control, with several — including Booker, Harris and Castro — referencing their personal experience with gun violence in their communities.

Harris said that there are 5 million assault weapons on the streets of America today and noted her experience meeting with the family of gun violence victims, including police officers shot in the line of duty, during her time in California.

“I’m done,” Harris said. “And we need action. And Congress has had years to act and failed because they have not had the courage.”

Klobuchar noted that polls show a majority of Trump voters want to see universal background checks. “I just don’t want to screw this up,” she said.

Castro prompted applause from the crowd when he called for action on the case of Atatiana Jefferson, who was fatally shot in her home by a Fort Worth police officer.

“Police violence is also gun violence, and we need to address that,” Castro said.

O’Rourke and Buttigieg also had a heated exchange on guns, after a moderator asked O’Rourke how he would enforce his proposed mandatory buyback of AR-15s and AK-47s.

O’Rourke said he would trust his fellow Americans to follow the law.

“You just made it clear that you don’t know how this is actually going to take weapons off the street. If you can develop the plan further, we can have a debate about it, but we can’t wait,” Buttigieg shot back. “We cannot wait for purity tests. We have to just get something done.”

O’Rourke said those challenges were not mutually exclusive. He said he also supports a ban on the sale of new weapons and high-capacity magazines, and red-flag laws. He called for a comprehensive gun-control policy. “Let’s decide what we are going to believe and what we are going to achieve. And let’s bring this country together in order to do that,” O’Rourke said. ““Let’s … not be limited by the polls and the consultants and the focus groups.”

“The problem isn’t the polls. The problem is the policy,” Buttigieg said dryly. “And I don’t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.”

Biden calls on foreign policy experience

Playing up his decades of foreign policy experience, Biden said that he’s the only person on the stage who had “spent extensive time alone with Putin, as well as with Erdogan,” referring to the leaders of Russia and Turkey.

Biden also blasted Trump for how he’s conducted global affairs.

“We have an erratic crazy president, who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy and operates out of fear for his own reelection,” Biden said. “The fact of the matter is you have Russia influencing and trying to break up NATO. What does the president do? He says: ‘I believe Vladimir Putin. I believe Vladimir Putin. I don’t believe our intelligence.’”

Booker also attacked Trump’s relationship with Putin, saying he had turned “the moral leadership of this country into a dumpster fire.”

“Russia and Putin understand strength, and this president, time and time again, is showing moral weakness. He is partnering more with Putin than he is with Merkel and Macron,” Booker said, referring to the leaders of Germany and France. “… I will stop this, and restore American integrity abroad.”

Asked about Trump’s decision, Castro launched a double-edged attack, criticizing the president’s policy of separating families at the U.S.-Mexico border while also taking aim at his withdrawal of troops from Syria.

“Think about how absurd it is that this president is caging kids on the border and effectively letting ISIS prisoners run free,” Castro said.

Sanders isn’t toning it down

Sanders gave a fiery answer, a signal that he is not toning down his combative tendencies in the wake of his health scare.

“Turkey is not a U.S. ally when they engage in another mass slaughter,” he said forcefully in the second hour of the debate.

Earlier, he eagerly reminded viewers that when it comes to Medicare-for-all, he “wrote the damn bill.""

And he gave one of the most impassioned defenses yet of his health-care plan, challenging Democrats to have the “guts” to stand up to the insurance companies and fight for a system that offers universal care.

Two veterans onstage face off on involvement in Syria

Gabbard and Buttigieg, the only veterans onstage, faced off on the question of U.S. involvement in Syria and what to do about Turkey’s attack on the Kurds, waged days after Trump ordered U.S. troops out of Syria.

Gabbard called the situation “yet another negative consequence of the regime-change war that we've been waging in Syria.” But she placed blame beyond Trump to include politicians “from both parties” and the mainstream media.

“Well, respectfully, Congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong,” Buttigieg told Gabbard. “The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence. It’s a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values.”

He said U.S. troops were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and the resurgence of the Islamic State.

“Really, what you’re saying, Mayor Pete, is you would continue to support having troops in Syria for an indefinite period of time, to continue this regime-change war?” Gabbard asked.

Buttigieg said what the United States was doing in Syria was keeping its word.

“Part of what makes it possible for the United States to get people to put their lives on the line to back us up is the idea that we will back them up, too,” he said. “I would have a hard time today looking at an Afghan civilian or soldier in the eye after what just happened over there, and it is undermining the honor of our soldiers. You take away the honor of our soldiers, you might as well go after their body armor next.”

Buttigieg, Klobuchar call Warren’s plans unrealistic

For the second time this evening, Buttigieg and Klobuchar attacked Warren for promoting an unrealistic policy. Both went after her wealth-tax plan and tried to appeal to more-moderate voters.

“Washington politicians … [offer] the most elegant policy prescriptions, and nothing changes,” Buttigieg said, a comment directed at Warren.

Klobuchar chimed in with a more pointed attack, suggesting that Warren’s characterization of her competitors’ plans was unfair.

“I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires. We just have different approaches. Your idea is not the only idea,” Klobuchar said.

O’Rourke joined in too, calling the Massachusetts Democrat’s wealth-tax plan “punitive.”

Warren quickly fired back. “I’m really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I’m punitive,” she said.

After the moderators tossed a question to Booker, the New Jersey Democrat took a moment to call on his competitors to tone down the intraparty attacks.

“You know, we’ve got one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president, and how we talk about each other in this debate really matters,” Booker said, drawing applause from the crowd.

Billionaires’ place in America is discussed

At one point, Sanders was asked whether his goal was to “tax billionaires out of existence.” The Vermont senator launched into a lengthy speech about income inequality in the United States, lamenting the staggering number of homeless, uninsured, underinsured and debt-burdened Americans.

“Then you also have three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society. That is a moral and economic outrage,” Sanders said. “And the truth is, we cannot afford to continue this level of income and wealth inequality, and we cannot afford a billionaire class.”

Steyer, the only billionaire on the debate stage, agreed that Sanders was right to go after the wealthy.

“There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor. And the results are as shameful,” Steyer said. “As Senator Sanders says, both in terms of assets and in terms of income, it’s absolutely wrong, it's absolutely undemocratic and unfair.”

Steyer then advocated for a wealth tax, ending Trump’s tax cuts and increasing the minimum wage.

Warren takes on Yang on universal basic income

Warren found herself on defense for much of the first half-hour of the debate. But as the end of the first hour neared, she played offense against Yang, taking on the entrepreneur over his signature issue, universal basic income, which would guarantee every American $1,000 a month, no matter their employment status.

“I think the thing closest to universal basic income is Social Security,” Warren said, arguing that her proposal for strengthening Social Security would do more to protect vulnerable Americans than Yang’s plan.

She added that she wants to “see the data.”

“I have the data,” Yang quickly shot back.

Harris brings up abortion

During the back and forth on Medicare-for-all, Harris noted that women’s reproductive rights did not come up in any of the previous debates, even though, she said, Republican state legislatures are trying to dismantle those rights.

“This is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle and not nearly one word, with all of these discussions about health care, on women’s access to reproductive health care, which is under full-on attack in America today,” she said. “It’s outrageous.”

Harris continued, “People need to keep their hands off of women’s bodies and let women make the decisions about their own lives.”

Medicare-for-all: Who would pay?

In the first policy debate of the evening, Warren and Buttigieg sparred over whether middle-class taxes would go up under Medicare-for-all.

“I have made clear what my principles are here: Costs will go up for the wealthy and for corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down,” Warren said.

Buttigieg, who has previously accused Warren of being “evasive” on that question, said she was doing so again on the debate stage.

“A yes-or-no question that didn’t get a yes-or-no answer,” Buttigieg charged, before touting his own plan, “Medicare for All Who Want It,” which institutes a public option but allows private insurance companies to remain.

Sanders cut in, noting that he was the person “who wrote the damn bill.”

If the proposal is passed, taxes are going to go up significantly — for the wealthiest Americans, Sanders said.

Warren faced more flak from another opponent: Klobuchar, who argued Warren was “making Republican talking points right now in this room.”

Klobuchar also prompted applause from the crowd — a rarity so far this evening — when she raised the issue of the opioid epidemic.

Sanders and Biden, who have long disagreed over health-care policy, engaged in one of their sharpest exchanges on the topic in any debate.

Biden suggested Warren and Sanders needed to be clearer about the high costs of their plan, and he sought to steal some of Buttigieg’s thunder by saying that the mayor’s approach is effectively one he has spearheaded — expanding Obamacare.

Sanders snapped back, arguing that those who are defending the current system are advocating for a problematic approach in which many Americans are suffering. He said he gets “a little tired, I must say, of people defending a system which is dysfunctional, which is cruel.”

Biden addresses questions on Ukraine

Biden said he did nothing wrong when he worked on Ukrainian policy as vice president while his son was serving on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company.

“My son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government rooting out corruption in Ukraine. And that's what we should be focusing on,” Biden said.

Biden then pivoted to talking about Trump’s corruption, saying a statement his son put out today “speaks for itself.”

Pressed to answer whether it was a mistake for his son to take the position, Biden dodged the question.

“I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having to do with Ukraine,” Biden said. “We’ve always kept everything separate even when my son was the attorney general of the state of Delaware. We never discussed it so there’d be no potential conflict. My son made a judgment. I’m proud of the judgment he made. I’m proud of what he had to say.”

It was unclear what judgment Biden was referring to, but he seemed to be talking about his son’s public statement where he said it was a mistake for him to take the job.

Yang wants to talk about economic problems

While many of the candidates spent their first few minutes talking about Trump and the impeachment inquiry, Yang took a different approach, encouraging Democrats to focus on the economic problems that paved the way for Trump’s win in 2016.

“When we talk about him, we are losing,” Yang said of Trump. He noted that the debate was unfolding in Ohio, a state Trump won. “Why did Donald Trump win your state by eight points?” he asked, before pointing out the manufacturing job losses that have occurred in the state.

“These are the problems that got Donald Trump elected,” Yang said.

Steyer makes debate-stage debut

In his first debate appearance, Steyer noted that he began his “Need to Impeach” campaign two years ago, long before the other Democrats onstage embraced the idea.

Even as he sought to distinguish himself from the others onstage, Steyer also praised them, saying that every Democratic candidate was “more decent and patriotic than the criminal in the White House.”

Buttigieg, meanwhile, cast himself as a uniter who can bring the country together after Trump has left the White House. “One way or another, this presidency is going to come to an end,” Buttigieg said, asking listeners what it’s going to feel like the first day the sun comes up after Trump is no longer president. “Really think about where we’ll be — vulnerable, even more torn apart by politics than we are right now.”

“I’m running to be the president who can turn the page and unify a dangerously polarized country,” he added.

Candidates talk about impeachment support

In his first comments, Biden said Trump’s decision to stonewall every congressional investigation led him to support the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry. Biden drew a contrast between Trump and the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. At that time, Biden said lawmakers needed to be mindful of the American people’s vote.

“He’s gone so far to say since this latest event … I will not cooperate,” Biden said. “They have no choice but to move.”

Biden, who has found himself at the center of the impeachment inquiry, said nothing more about the specifics of the House investigation or his role in it.

Harris echoed her competitors, expressing her support of the impeachment inquiry and adding that she didn’t think the impeachment process would take very long.

“Because as a former prosecutor, I know a confession when I see it,” Harris said.

Striking a more cautious tone, Booker said he understood “the outrage that we all feel” but said it was important to conduct the impeachment process in an “honorable” way that did not further divide the country.

Both Klobuchar and Castro brushed off concerns that impeachment would be a “distraction,” saying U.S. lawmakers and voters were capable of doing two things at once.

“When [Trump] made that call to the head of Ukraine, he’s digging up dirt on an opponent,” Klobuchar said. “That’s illegal conduct; that’s what he was doing.”

Sanders goes after Trump and Republicans

Sanders, who has been off the campaign trail for two weeks after suffering a heart attack, also went after Trump and Senate Republicans. “Mitch McConnell has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate,” said Sanders, speaking about the topic of impeachment.

While his voice was a bit scratchy as he spoke, Sanders sounded much clearer than he did in the last debate, when he was noticeably hoarse. He is positioned toward the middle of the stage, to the left of Biden. Sanders stood patiently with his hands in front of him as Biden delivered his first remarks of the debate.

Debate starts with discussion of impeachment

The moderators wasted no time tackling the issue of the impeachment inquiry into Trump. Warren got the first question, on why she believes Congress should hold impeachment proceedings rather than leaving the issue of Trump’s fitness for office up to the voters to decide next November.

Warren’s response: “Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry.”

Sanders, too, defended his call for impeaching Trump, adding that McConnell “has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate.”

Biden — who only recently came out in favor of impeachment — called Trump the most corrupt president in history. He highlighted the White House’s efforts to stonewall the impeachment inquiry. “They have no choice but to move,” he said of House Democrats.

The debate

To qualify, candidates had to hit 2 percent in at least four polls approved by the Democratic National Committee and receive contributions from at least 130,000 individual donors. The debate is at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, in the Columbus suburbs."

Bernie Sanders: In his first debate after suffering a heart attack, he seemed more lively than he has been at any previous one. He was also witty, joking with Biden after Biden gestured at him while talking about Vladimir Putin. “Are you suggesting I’m Vladimir Putin?” Sanders asked before the two men embraced. At another point, Cory Booker noted that Sanders supports medical marijuana, and Sanders responded, “But I’m not on it tonight.” Sanders has been accused of sometimes being humorless and a little dry — even overly angry. He also has a perception issue because of his health problem. Fighting that off was the most important thing he could do Tuesday.

AD

Amy Klobuchar: The Minnesota senator arguably made herself Warren’s chief foil in this debate, creating contrasts on taxes, Medicare-for-all and other issues. At one point, she rejected the charge that she was creating a Republican talking point by pressing Warren on whether her Medicare-for-all proposal would raise taxes on the middle class. “You are making Republican talking points right here in this room” by talking about getting rid of private insurance, Klobuchar charged. And she wasn’t wrong. All of this said, being the attacker in these debates hasn’t always meant much. See: Castro, Julián and Delaney, John. But Klobuchar needs to try something, especially since she’s fighting to make the fifth debate; we’ll see if voters are buying it. (One piece of advice, on behalf of all of Klobuchar’s fellow Minnesotans: The bad jokes need to stop.)

Millennials: There was a point in the middle of the debate when South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii) had an impassioned debate about whether the United States should be in Syria. Gabbard was the most noninterventionist candidate on the stage, while Buttigieg said Syria was perhaps the one place in the Middle East where we continue to need a presence. That disagreement aside, this was two millennial veterans of Middle East wars — the only two combat veterans among the leading candidates — having that debate on a presidential stage. That’s quite the moment.

AD

Andrew Yang: He makes this list solely because some of his top issues — automation and universal basic income — got a real debate. Candidates shared his concerns about the impact of automation on jobs, to some degree, and some on the stage, including Castro and Gabbard, were even open to his idea to give every American $1,000 per month.

Losers

Biden: Not only does he seem to no longer be the candidate his opponents fear most, he was again somewhat off his game. He offered some odd figures on the middle-class costs of Medicare-for-all. He said “expidentially” instead of “exponentially.” He mixed up Iraq with Afghanistan. He said he never discussed his son’s Ukraine dealings with him, even though his son has said differently. And at the end of the debate, Biden said he didn’t mean to disrespect his opponents but that “I’m the only one on this stage who has actually gotten anything really big done.” His opponents bucked, with Warren pointing to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — and then suggesting that perhaps certain members of the Obama administration could have been more supportive. Biden hasn’t really dropped in the polls as Warren has risen, but he is not showing the sharper version of himself that he probably needs to. And he seemed to be trying a little too hard at points on Tuesday.

AD

Booker’s Biden question gripe: We get it; there’s no safer applause line than attacking the refs, and Democrats are angry about how 2016 was handled by the media. But some of the complaints about moderators’ questions on Tuesday night just didn’t really make sense. Booker took up the mantle we knew someone would when he attacked a question Biden faced about his son Hunter’s overseas work. He called it “deja vu all over again” from the 2016 election and accused the moderators of “elevating a lie and attacking a statesman.” Except that question was fair. Anderson Cooper rightly noted that the major accusations President Trump has lodged against the Bidens are unsubstantiated — twice. Cooper also asked a very fair question about why Hunter Biden is ruling out working overseas if his dad becomes president, when they say there was nothing wrong with him doing it when his dad was vice president. Calling that “attacking a statesman” was melodramatic.

AD

Biden’s answer to that question: Biden was asked that question twice, and he said three times, “My son’s statement speaks for itself,” which isn’t really an answer. He added the second time, “My son made a judgment. I’m proud of the judgment he made.” It’s okay to point out Trump’s allegations are baseless while acknowledging Hunter Biden’s overseas work perhaps wasn’t a great idea — which is what his new pledge tacitly seems to acknowledge.

The question Warren won’t answer: Warren was given four chances to answer the question she has thus far refused to directly answer: Whether her Medicare-for-all proposal would increase taxes on the middle class. The fact that she passed each time wasn’t surprising — she instead focuses on total costs going down for the middle class, including health care — but she did get pushback from across the stage, including from Buttigieg, Klobuchar, Beto O’Rourke and even gently from Sanders, who again forthrightly admitted taxes would go up under his plan.

AD

Tom Steyer: The one complete newcomer on the stage Tuesday, he began by initially ignoring the question about impeachment (his pet issue) and saying that “everyone here is more decent and more patriotic than the criminal in the White House.” He then waited for applause, which was slow to come and tepid. There are no second chances at first impressions, and Steyer — a billionaire who Democrats have accused of buying his way onto the debate stage — didn’t do anything in the debate to overcome that.

AD

In-between

Warren’s answer on the Middle East: Warren at one point said, “I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don’t think we should have troops in the Middle East. But we have to do it the right way, the smart way.” The question was about Syria, but that is a very broad statement. She will need to expound. Expect to hear more on this.

We need to get our troops out of Syria, but we need to do it the right way. Donald Trump has sucked up to dictators, cut and run on our allies, and worsened a humanitarian crisis in Syria. We need a president who makes our country and the world safer. #DemDebate — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 16, 2019

Buttigieg: We have repeatedly had him in the winner category, even as he hasn’t really risen in the polls. On Tuesday, as in other debates, he was sharp and came prepared, but this time he was more combative. Some thought he was amazing; others thought he was grating. I actually come down somewhere in the middle.

Pushback came quickly from Andrew Yang, a presidential candidate with support not much higher than Gabbard’s, and another candidate, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg. The most recent defense of Gabbard came from Clinton’s 2016 rival — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).

Tulsi Gabbard deserves much more respect and thanks than this. She literally just got back from serving our country abroad. — Andrew Yang🧢 (@AndrewYang) October 19, 2019

Buttigieg told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday that attacks such as Clinton’s require proof.

“Statements like that ought to be backed by evidence,” he said.

“I don’t know what the basis is for that. I consider [Gabbard] a competitor. I respect her service,” added Buttigieg, who was deployed to Afghanistan. “I would prefer we had arguments in terms of policy.”

Tulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country. People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 21, 2019

All three candidates referenced Gabbard’s service in the military as one reason not to paint her as a tool of a foreign power, which is something Gabbard also referenced in her response to Clinton. The idea seems to be that no one who would put their lives on the line for the United States would betray this country to the point of working with a foreign government to harm the United States.

“This is a message to every veteran in this country who has put their life on the line to serve our country, to every single American who believes strongly that we must end this long-standing foreign policy of being the world’s police and ending these regime-change wars, which is really the legacy of Hillary Clinton, then we are traitors to the nation that we love,” Gabbard told CBS News.

But none of the candidates responded to the underlying claim, which so many others find troubling: the possibility of Gabbard launching a third-party candidacy that would get a boost from Russia, including via a disinformation campaign that would cause harm to Democrats’ chances in the 2020 presidential election. Gabbard denied to CBS that she was considering a third-party run.

Clinton was explicitly stating what some on the left, as well as in the foreign policy world, have been suggesting for quite some time — before going further than most. Some have argued that Gabbard doesn’t have to be proactively working with Russia for that government to be using her campaign to interfere in the 2020 election.

Last month, Naveed Jamali, a former secret double agent who worked for the FBI to spy on Russia, noted that Russia could attempt to amplify support for the lawmaker by using the troll factories that were so effective in 2016.

“Russia may choose to covertly amplify her message by building what may look like organic and grass-roots online support for her,” he wrote for Newsweek. “They may take some of her talking points — such as, Assad ‘is not the enemy of the U.S.’ or that the U.S. is in ‘a new nuclear arms race’ — and work to increase their reach across social media.”

But he said concerns that Gabbard could be aware of Russia’s preference for her are inflamed by the fact that she “has steadfastly refused to renounce any Russian support she may be receiving.”

AD

“If borne out, Russian support of Gabbard does not mean that she is a Russian-directed operative, or that she has ties with or is in contact with Moscow,” Jamali added. “The same holds true if Russia seeks to independently aid the Gabbard campaign.”

AD

Clint Watts, a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, an international relations think tank, wrote in May that one of Russia’s main goals for 2020 will be to “divide the opposition,” and it appears that they have begun to do that with Gabbard, often using members of the right.

“Moving forward, the Kremlin’s strategy will be to identify, highlight and empower the unwitting and the like-minded on the political left,” he wrote for the Daily Beast, providing examples of how this would work.

Tulsi Gabbard fell into this crossfire with her meeting with and support of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad. It situated her as a bridge between anti-Israel activists of the political left and white supremacists like former KKK leader and GOP Louisiana state representative David Duke, who tweeted, “Tulsi Gabbard is currently the only Presidential candidate who doesn’t want to send White children off to die for Israel.” Alt-right leader Richard Spencer and the nationalist Mike Cernovich also fanned support for Gabbard in January 2019. And we shouldn’t forget Steve Bannon sought Gabbard out for a meeting with President-elect Trump in November 2016. Online and on-the-ground convergence between the populist right and the populist left is happening in plain sight—all the Kremlin has to do is help it grow.

Both Watts and Jamali tweeted about Russia and Gabbard after Clinton’s comments suggesting that the country was helping the lawmaker. Gabbard didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

In February, NBC conducted an analysis of the main English-language news sites Russia employed while interfering in the 2016 election and discovered that Gabbard was the favorite candidate of those sites — even before Gabbard officially launched her campaign.

AD

All three sites celebrated Gabbard’s announcement, defended her positions on Russia and her 2017 meeting with Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad, and attacked those who have suggested she is a pawn for Moscow. The coverage devoted to Gabbard, both in news and commentary, exceeds that afforded to any of the declared or rumored Democratic candidates despite Gabbard’s lack of voter recognition.

NBC News analyst Alex Stamos, former chief security officer at Facebook, said the lawmaker helps Russia with all their “lines of attack.”

“Her promulgation of positions compatible with Russian geostrategic interests can help them mainstream such discussion in the [Democratic] Party,” he said.

Concerns about Russian interference in the 2020 election remain significant for many Americans. Confidence in the integrity of the election process has been threatened since the 2016 election, particularly since President Trump has not aggressively confronted Russia for what American intelligence agencies say the country’s government did.

Defenders of Gabbard, including those on the right and the populist left who regularly oppose the Democratic establishment, may attempt to color Clinton’s critiques of the lawmaker as bitterness coupled with the former secretary of state’s desire to bolster a more centrist candidate’s campaign. But experts in the field of Russian interference view manipulations of Gabbard’s campaign as potentially harmful to the 2020 election in ways that are similar to the previous election. And for those who are concerned about the integrity of the U.S. election process, that is a much bigger issue than Gabbard’s personal feelings.

And then there was Dudley Webber, 60, an employee of some 40 years at the GM outpost here, which ships and distributes parts. Six hours into his picketing shift, he was hollering at every passing car or truck that honked.

AD

“Woohoo!” he shouted at one. “Badass!” the driver yelled back.

Three weeks into one of the longest and largest private employer strikes in 50 years — some 50,000 workers have stopped working — picket lines like this are the front lines of a dispute that has seen production halted at 55 General Motors factories and parts centers.

AD

Workers, who receive only $250 a week from the union during the strike and not their regular paychecks, say they want to regain ground lost in contract negotiations during the recession, now that the company is back to near-record profitability. GM, which analysts estimate could be losing as much as $100 million a day, says it needs to keep pace with foreign automakers in the United States, which are not unionized and pay workers less.

AD

But the action is unfolding amid a broader conversation about inequality and the well-being of everyday Americans. Workers say they have drawn inspiration from recent battles, such as the 2018 teacher strike in this state, that have given organized labor a newfound sense of momentum. Worker strikes are proliferating to levels not seen for 30 years. A successful effort here could help beget others.

There are early signs that the strike may begin to drag the economy in places like Michigan. Picket lines there and in other swing states have served as a revolving door for Democratic presidential candidates to show support in front of television cameras.

But a strike is not a monolith. It is a quilt stitched together from the experiences of tens of thousands of workers, including the 88 at this distribution center in West Virginia’s panhandle. And to understand it, you have to go to the picket line — for all four round-the-clock shifts of it.

1:20 a.m. — Route 9 picket line

Traffic on this thoroughfare, heavy during the day, had slowed to a trickle. The cicadas hummed that night — Oct. 2 — the air so warm that anything more than a T-shirt felt heavy.

AD

AD

And the 6 p.m.-to-midnight crew had mostly taken off, leaving the graveyard rotation, all under 30. Except for Gerry Van der Wijst, 61, who had been there since 3 p.m. He was banking some hours so he could take off on a trip with his wife, missing a shift over the weekend.

“Told the wife three weeks ago, ‘Aw, we’re not going to be on strike that weekend; don’t worry,’ ” he said.

Van der Wijst used to own a furniture store, but it closed in 2016 after business dried up. He never thought too kindly about unions as a private business owner. Now, he said, he finds himself supporting them.

“I feel like if I see people picketing in the future, I’m going to stop,” he said. “It means more to me now.”

2:30 a.m. — Route 9

Now it was just the three younger employees — Corbin Clark, 28; brother Elisha, 23; and Logan Byers, 27 — standing on the road.

AD

AD

The picket line is staffed in four six-hour shifts to cover the clock. Striking workers don red shirts during the day, but the dress code loosens overnight. Corbin was in track pants.

The three men began playing a game, guessing the color of the next car on the road. It would be a long night.

“Watch out for them coyotes!” a driver shouted out her window as she passed, sending the men into a fit of laughter.

The three, who all came in as temporary employees before getting hired full on, said the company’s increasing reliance on temporary workers — now 7 percent of its workforce — was a sticking point for them. Elisha had set an informal record at the facility after temping for more than two years before being hired, they said.

AD

These contract workers make significantly lower wages than the other employees but do the same work on a similar schedule. They get three unpaid days off a year and have little job security.

AD

“This is our future,” said Corbin, who worked at a grocery store making less wages before GM. “If we’re going to be here for a while, we gotta make sure our contracts are good.”

3:20 a.m. — Main entrance to the GM facility

GM employed more than 1,000 workers in Martinsburg from the plant’s founding in the 1960s to the 1990s. But the company has shed jobs over the past 20 years — consolidating certain facilities, such as the distribution center here, with its operations in Michigan, and outsourcing other jobs to factories in places such as Mexico and China.

AD

Still, the 88 workers left here have set up three picket lines, two of which are staffed around the clock, to show their resolve.

Randy Brown, 56; Sam Beitler, 61; Carol Barnes; and Vanessa Banks, 55, stood at the second picket location about a mile away, a gravel median near the GM plant’s entrance that smells vaguely of roadkill and gets even less traffic at night. They have some 90 years of work at the company among them.

AD

Brown cooked sausages and peppers on a makeshift wood-burning stove he had fashioned out of a waist-high steel can.

Beitler, with more than 30 years at the company, said GM has always been one of the best jobs in the area.

But the strike had been a new challenge. Just days after it began, GM announced it would cut off health benefits for those striking, creating confusion for workers. Beitler’s wife is in the middle of treatment for brain cancer and was waiting for an appointment at a hospital in Baltimore. But under public pressure, GM quickly shifted course and said health coverage would continue.

AD

The workers said they had seen news of officials and presidential candidates visiting picket lines in Kansas City, Detroit and Ohio but noted that none of them had come to Martinsburg, population 17,000. Would Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) pay them a visit, one wondered?

AD

They bit into the sausages on the quiet road, staring into the darkness.

11:35 a.m. — Route 9

A group of four workers stood in the shade of a canopy at the Route 9 picket location. It was 92 degrees and only getting hotter.

The men are fervent union supporters. But they don’t want to be confused for socialists.

Earl Dick, 60, an electrician at the company, said reporters from the World Socialist website, which has been writing about the strikes, had been canvassing the picket lines to recruit and take pictures, he claimed.

AD

“They were taking the strike as an opportunity to infiltrate,” Dick said, noting he had his President Trump hat in the car.

A report on the group’s website seems to indicate another purpose — covering the strike to air the workers’ plight.

Tim Armstrong, 51, said he felt as though Democrats and most Republicans didn’t care about unions beyond the money they bring in through contributions. He is 22 years in to what he hopes will be a 30-year career at GM.

AD

“The one thing I do see that somebody is trying to make a difference, is Trump trying to keep the jobs in America,” he said. “To me, that’s huge.”

5:45 p.m. — Truck entrance to GM facility

A brief afternoon rush on the road had dissipated, leaving Carl Franklin, 55; Jim Ennis, 65; Banks; and Dick in lawn chairs as the sun sank in the sky. Dick was wearing the red Trump hat he had mentioned earlier.

They began to talk about the concessions the union had made amid economic head winds in 2007 and again in 2009 while the company was going through bankruptcy. The compromises created a two-tiered wage system. New hires have to spend eight years working their way up to the top wage, which is about $30 an hour.

Those were tougher times. The company has been making near-record profits in recent years; it made $8.1 billion after taxes last year. And workers, who have received profit-sharing checks of about $8,000 to $10,000 the past nine years, hope to get what they say would be a fairer piece of that pie.

AD

“There is no teamwork here; it’s us trying to appease them,” said Franklin, a retired police officer who has been at GM for 19 years.

Franklin brought up the federal bailouts given to companies, including General Motors, after the financial crisis in 2008. He still remembers when AIG executives, whose company was rescued by taxpayers, turned around and flew to luxury retreats. He cited the $22 million compensation given to GM chief executive Mary Barra in 2018 — 280 times what the median GM worker makes, based on some estimates.

“What kind of job do you do as the CEO to have private vehicles, multimillion-dollar income, and then you’re going to sit there and question us because we want extra something on our health care?” Franklin said.

“Or just to maintain the health care we have,” Banks added.

9:10 p.m. — Main entrance

Scott Henry, 54, Lacey Hockman, 36, and Collin Hopkins, 24, sat in the darkness, talking about subsisting without a regular paycheck from GM. But other than that, workers have to rely on money they’ve been told to save up for months.

“We kind of prepared,” Hockman said. “Not exactly prepared for it to be this long.”

GM, one of the country’s biggest manufacturers, has a long history of portentous fights with the United Auto Workers. Large-scale strikes at GM and Detroit’s other big automakers in the 1930s and ′40s helped cement the labor movement’s might in a growing economy. But it has been nearly 50 years since the last strike at the company to go this long, a 1970 shutdown that lasted 67 days.

“I would have bet money that we wouldn’t have been out this long,” said Henry, an employee of 35 years.

The economic effects of an extended strike have already begun to reverberate. GM plants in Canada and Mexico have laid off some 9,000 workers amid the U.S. shutdown. Some suppliers from whom the company buys parts have also begun downsizing. Striking workers say they are cutting their expenses, putting pressure on restaurants and other local businesses that rely on their spending. The longer this lasts, the more severe the impact will be.

Hockman said she had made her car payments in advance. But, she said, you’re “certainly not going out and doing a lot of extras.”

Most of the workers said, though, that they were prepared for the strike to continue. They felt that the cause was worth it, and that they were slowly gaining ground. The health insurance turnaround had been a modest victory. Are others on the horizon?"

And yes, it is time to raise questions about age and fitness with regard to all candidates, but especially with regard to the top three. If elected, former vice president Joe Biden would be 78, Sanders 79 and Sen. Elizabeth Warren 71 on Inauguration Day; each one — Biden, Sanders or Warren — would be the oldest elected president at the start of his or her presidency.

AD

AD

There has been a lot of chatter about Trump’s verbal acuity and mental state, but the issue is not him per se or Sanders or any other individual contender. The presidential campaign is stressful and exhausting, the presidency more so. Rather than pick out any single candidate, it would be advisable for them all to stick to some basic rules.

First, when an incident is so serious as to require hospitalization, the campaign should answer any and all questions from the press. The candidate should authorize his or her doctor to answer all questions as well.

Second, candidates should release his or her medical files (not simply a signed doctor’s letter of the kind Trump produced) well in advance of the first primary. Sure, it is a substantial invasion of privacy, but no one forces these candidates to run for president. The voters have every reason to demand all the data they need to evaluate candidates’ physical health.

AD

AD

Third, candidates would be wise to agree in advance to annual physical and mental fitness exams if elected, and to release as much data as possible. It would be advisable to impanel some independent experts to agree upon what data is important and what tests should be run. We would do well to have clear, objective criteria that apply across the board regardless of who is president.

Trump should, of course, agree to this as well. If reelected, he’ll be about 74½ on Inauguration Day. We already know he does not exercise and is overweight. It is perfectly legitimate to insist the same rules apply to him as to potential competitors.

This isn’t ageist. In fact, older candidates especially should want these kinds of rules in place if only to give the voters comfort that they are physically up for the job. It also is good insurance against the kind of rumor-mongering and conspiracy theories spread by Trumpers about Hillary Clinton’s health in 2016. And don’t think Trump won’t do it again in 2020 should he be on the ballot.

AD

Or maybe it’s not surprising at all. Trump is in trouble for, essentially, trying to coerce Ukraine into doing something corrupt on his behalf while he claims that Joe Biden was doing something corrupt by demanding the removal of a corrupt official who refused to investigate corruption.

AD

If you find that sentence confusing, welcome to Trump’s reelection strategy. The most corrupt president in American history will run for reelection saying that his opponent is hopelessly corrupt. In fact, he’ll repeat the word “corrupt” so often it will begin to lose all meaning, in the hopes that voters just say, “I guess they’re all corrupt.” Which is just about the only way he’ll get reelected.

But the Democrats will be talking about corruption, too. How could they not?

AD

It will be a very different argument depending on who winds up with the nomination, however. While the corruption conversation will inevitably concern the person of Donald Trump, a couple of the Democratic contenders have a much wider critique, in which the problem is not an individual but a system.

The clearest contrast is between the two candidates atop the polls, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. As anyone watching the campaign knows, Biden puts his focus on Trump as an individual, saying that once we get rid of him, we can return to normal. While he has some plans that are more liberal than those advocated by any Democratic nominee in the past few decades, on a fundamental level Biden sees the system as a healthy one that mostly requires personnel changes and some policy recalibration. The way to make sure the interests of ordinary people are advanced is to elect someone who cares about ordinary people and promises to work on their behalf, like him.

AD

Warren, on the other hand, argues that as abhorrent as he is, Trump is at least as much symptom as cause, and the deeper problem is a system that allows people like him to use their wealth and power to amass more wealth and power, at the expense of those ordinary people. She was putting that kind of corruption at the center of her campaign before the Ukraine scandal emerged (not that there weren’t endless examples of Trump’s corruption before then).

AD

Should Bernie Sanders be the nominee, he’ll make an argument similar to Warren’s. If any of the other candidates prevails, they’ll make claims similar to Biden’s, that Trump is the core of the problem.

It’s critical to understand that Trump will be making his own personal argument, about the Democratic nominee, whoever it is. He always projects on to his opponent the thing he is guilty of. “I know you are, but what am I?” is Trump’s go-to strategy. He used it against Hillary Clinton in 2016, and he’ll use it again.

AD

The facts will be irrelevant. If we learn that Warren took a selfie with someone whose cousin’s ex-boyfriend’s neighbor’s boss once got a parking ticket, Trump will try to convince us that it’s the worst scandal in American history, and the “Lock her up!” chants will ring out once again.

AD

But of course, he can’t make the same argument about the system that he made in 2016, when in addition to saying Clinton was the crooked one, he claimed that everything was rigged and he’d “drain the swamp.” Trump can’t simply renew that argument, not only because he has made the system far more corrupt than it was when he got to Washington but also for the simple reason that he’s in charge. “We need change” is not an argument an incumbent can make.

So all the fantastical lies he and other Republicans are now telling about Biden are in effect a dry run for 2020, whether or not Biden is the nominee. And to a great extent, it has been a success. It may not be persuading many people to change their votes, but those lies are being hammered home again and again on Fox News and are being accepted by the Republican faithful. As far as Trump is concerned, that’s all he needs to win.

Trump’s lawyers made a stunning argument in their bid to quash Vance’s subpoena: Not only is the president immune from prosecution, they said, but law enforcement officials should be barred from even investigating him, for anything he did at any point in his life.

In his decision, the judge seemed almost stunned by the sweeping implications of that claim, saying that the assertion of “virtually limitless” immunity was “repugnant to the nation’s fundamental structure and constitutional values.”

Naturally, Trump’s lawyers immediately asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit to step in and put a halt to the case. After all, as they had said before, if his tax returns were given to the district attorney, Trump would suffer “irreparable harm.”

AD

Would he ever. Everyone — Democrat, Republican, Trump friend or foe — is united in the belief that the information contained in Trump’s tax returns is so scandalous that if they become public, it will be a political cataclysm for him.

AD

But this isn’t just about what appalling or even criminal doings the returns reveal. It’s also about the conflicts of interest Trump faces right now. His financial entanglements are an ongoing concern, constantly raising new questions about how the decisions he makes about American policy are influenced by his financial interests.

Trump’s new Syria decision

For instance, Trump has just decided that the United States will be withdrawing troops from an area along Turkey’s border with Syria, which many are justifiably arguing is an abandonment of Kurdish forces there to be overrun and even slaughtered by the Turkish military, our lengthy alliance with the Kurds notwithstanding. Trump apparently made the decision after a phone conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

AD

So one might reasonably ask: How much income does Trump derive from Trump Towers Istanbul? Does that play into his thinking as he tries to balance the interests and desires of two U.S. allies that are in conflict? At the very least, we should know the extent of his financial interests in Turkey.

AD

As to the long-term implications of Trump’s tax returns, they will likely offer the public one of the most vivid possible illustrations of how America’s wealthy avoid paying taxes. In effect, they will be nothing short of an advertisement for the campaign of the Democratic nominee for president in 2020, especially if that nominee is Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, both of whom want to impose wealth taxes and make it harder for people such as Trump to cheat, remaking the tax code so that the wealthy pay something resembling their fair share.

And right now, they don’t. As David Leonhardt details, in recent decades the combined rate of taxes paid by the ultra-wealthy (he uses the richest 400 families as an illustration) has fallen down and down: In 1950, their combined federal, state, and local taxes were 70 percent; today, the figure is only 23 percent. The result is that despite what you might think, we don’t actually have a progressive tax system but something more closely resembling a flat tax.

AD

At their second debate in 2016, Hillary Clinton suggested that Trump was hiding his tax returns because he didn’t want the public to know that he doesn’t pay any taxes. Trump interrupted her, leaning into his microphone to say, “That makes me smart.”

AD

And when the New York Times reported that during the 1980s and 1990s Trump declared over $1 billion in losses, he insisted that the losses weren’t real but were just a way to avoid paying his taxes. Apparently, he would rather be known as a tax cheat than as a failed businessman.

But Trump doesn’t get away without paying taxes because he’s smart. He gets away without paying taxes because he’s rich. That’s just the problem: While people like him can avoid contributing to the society that enables them to amass enormous wealth, the rest of us have to pay.

AD

That’s the system that Republicans are so desperate to maintain. And if the public ever gets a look at Trump’s returns, they’ll see in vivid detail exactly how it works. They might even decide to elect someone who thinks the system isn’t fair and wants to change it.

With the proposal, Mr. Sanders is embracing an idea that has been a centerpiece of the campaign of his top progressive rival, Senator Elizabeth Warren. But while Ms. Warren came first, Mr. Sanders is going bigger. His wealth tax would apply to a larger number of households, impose a higher top rate and raise more money.

Mr. Sanders’s plan to tax accumulated wealth, not just income, is particularly aggressive in how it would erode the fortunes of billionaires. His tax would cut in half the wealth of the typical billionaire after 15 years, according to two economists who worked with the Sanders campaign on the plan. Mr. Sanders would use the money generated by his wealth tax to fund the housing plan he released last week and a forthcoming plan for universal child care, as well as to help pay for “Medicare for all.”

“Let me be very clear: As president of the United States, I will reduce the outrageous and grotesque and immoral level of income and wealth inequality,” Mr. Sanders said in an interview. “What we are trying to do is demand and implement a policy which significantly reduces income and wealth inequality in America by telling the wealthiest families in this country they cannot have so much wealth.”"

In Wilmington, Del., Tuesday, Mr. Biden called the president’s actions an “abuse of power’’ that undermined national security, and said he would support impeachment if Mr. Trump did not provide information related to congressional investigations.

In some respects, Mr. Trump’s conduct has reinforced the central message of Mr. Biden’s appeal to Democratic voters: that the country is threatened by an out-of-control presidency, and that ousting Mr. Trump is more important than any other policy goal Democrats might share.

Among the people in Ms. Warren’s audience, there was a sense of outrage about Mr. Trump’s conduct and a sense of support for the steps taken this week by House Democrats to investigate him more aggressively.

But there was little optimism that Mr. Trump might ultimately be removed from office, and some expressed anxiety at the unpredictability of the impeachment process.

Tim Butterworth, a retired teacher who is supporting Ms. Warren, said he believed the House had a duty to proceed with impeachment even though there was “kind of a stone wall” waiting in the Republican-controlled Senate. Mr. Butterworth did not mention Ms. Warren’s support for impeachment among his reasons for supporting her, focusing instead on her plans for addressing economic inequality.

“I think it would be easier to defeat him in an election,” Mr. Butterworth, 75, said of the president. “But when you see a crime being committed, you have to report it. If you don’t, you’re complicit.”

Ellen Moran, an undecided voter who works in urgent care, expressed both exasperation with Mr. Trump and some trepidation about impeachment.

Here's How Those Plans Would Work (or Not). - The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/24/business/economy/wealth-tax-rich.html,"Among Democratic presidential candidates, it’s the rallying cry of the moment — tax the rich. The idea is a centerpiece of the campaigns of Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders. A former candidate, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, went so far as to say the government ought to “tax the hell out of the wealthy.”

The new taxes would fund a laundry list of liberal proposals — “Medicare for all,” free college, combating global warming and rebuilding roads and bridges.

But these measures will face fierce opposition, including from wealthy donors. Republicans in Congress are sure to oppose new taxes, making passage impossible unless Democrats take both houses of Congress in 2020. Whatever their political fate, these proposals represent the broadest rethinking of tax policy in decades.

“We seem to go back and forth between Democrats and Republicans on taxing the rich, depending on who is in power,” said Eric Toder, co-director of the Tax Policy Center. “But the Democrats now are a good deal more aggressive than they’ve been in the past.”

Four ideas have gained the most traction: a tax on wealth, raising marginal tax rates, expanding the estate tax and changing how the government taxes capital gains.

Creating a Wealth Tax

How many people would pay? Relatively few. Would it reduce inequality? Almost certainly. How much money could it raise for the government? A lot. Would the rich find ways to avoid or evade this tax? Probably.

In January, Ms. Warren took a bold new approach by proposing to tax wealth, not just income. Her proposal would impose a 2 percent tax on assets above $50 million, or the top 70,000 families by wealth, in a nation of nearly 330 million people. Someone with $100 million in assets would pay $1 million a year. Fortunes over $1 billion would be subject to an additional 1 percent surcharge.

The tax, akin to how property taxes work, would be aimed at a group that controls a growing portion of the nation’s wealth. The 400 richest Americans own 3.5 percent of the country’s assets, according to Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, economists at the University of California, Berkeley, who have advised Ms. Warren. Over time, her tax would reduce that to 2 percent, according to Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman. If it had been in place since 1982, the fortune of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, would now be $87 billion, rather than $160 billion, they estimate, using figures from before his divorce.

Ms. Warren’s proposal would bring in $2.6 trillion over 10 years, according to Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman. At $260 billion a year, that is a small share of total annual federal spending of $4.4 trillion. Lawrence Summers, a former Treasury secretary, and Natasha Sarin, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, have disputed earlier estimates by the two economists as overly optimistic.

On Tuesday Mr. Sanders is proposing his own wealth tax, one that goes after mega-wealth even more aggressively than Ms. Warren’s proposal. His graduated tax would start at 1 percent for assets of more than $32 million, climbing to 8 percent for wealth exceeding $10 billion. The tax would raise an estimated $4.35 trillion over a decade.

As appealing as a wealth tax might sound for the party’s liberal base, enacting it would pose major challenges. Anyone lucky enough to be in its sights has access to top tax lawyers and accountants who can sift through the tax code for a way out, or at least a means of minimizing the hit.

European countries have had mixed success with wealth taxes. Weak enforcement and offshore havens have enabled many individuals to greatly reduce what they owe. The Internal Revenue Service would need detailed reports from banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions to make the tax effective.

“It could raise a lot of money but probably less than Elizabeth Warren thinks,” Mr. Toder said.

Raising top income tax rates

How many people would pay? Not many. Would it reduce inequality? Probably. How much money could it raise for the government? A modest amount. Would the rich find ways to avoid or evade this tax? Yes.

Raising the top income tax rate is one of the most straightforward ways to tax the rich and some prominent Democrats have embraced it. For example, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York City has said that the government should impose a 70 percent tax on earnings above $10 million.

While that might sound radical, it would actually represent a return to tax policies that prevailed for decades. The top income tax rate stood at 70 percent as recently as 1980, and was even higher before then, topping 90 percent in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Highest marginal tax rate 100 percent 80 1940 81% 60 40 2018 37% 20 0 ’18 1940 ’50 ’60 ’70 ’80 ’90 ’00 ’10 100 percent 80 1940 81% 60 40 2018 37% 20 0 1940 ’50 ’60 ’70 ’80 ’90 ’00 ’10 ’18 100 percent 80 1940 81% 60 40 2018 37% 20 0 1940 ’50 ’60 ’70 ’80 ’90 ’00 ’10 ’18 Source: Tax Policy Center

In terms of inequality, it would effectively reduce some of the extremes in pay that have developed in recent decades. The vast fortunes accumulated by a few dozen billionaires have also made new taxes more politically palatable. For example, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s 70 percent tax would be paid by about 21,000 taxpayers.

Over 10 years, her proposal would raise up to $382 billion, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model. That is about half as much as the government will spend on the Defense Department this fiscal year.

With the help of accountants and lawyers, the wealthy would no doubt try to find ways to convert earned income into capital gains or business income, which are currently taxed at lower rates.

Raising the estate tax

How many people would pay? Not many. Would it reduce inequality? A lot. How much money could it raise for the government? A modest amount. Would the rich find ways to avoid or evade this tax? Most likely.

Experts say inherited wealth is an important driver of inequality. The estate tax is meant to combat that, but in recent decades lawmakers have made it easier for taxpayers to avoid it. Mr. Sanders wants to change that.

Under his proposal, the estate tax rate would begin at 45 percent for assets worth more than $3.5 million and rise to 77 percent for those with more than $1 billion. The proposal would apply to just 0.2 percent of the population, according to Mr. Sanders.

The senator’s plan would raise $315 billion over 10 years, or less than half of military spending this year. But the higher tax on estates worth more than $1 billion could raise $2.2 trillion over the long term. Mr. Sanders has said he wants the money to pay for his ambitious agenda of social programs.

Source: Tax Policy Center

Ms. Warren has also proposed expanding the estate tax as part of a housing bill. The estate tax would start at 55 percent and rise to 75 percent. She has said that the tax would affect 14,000 wealthy families a year.

Lawyers and accountants have devised many strategies for avoiding the estate tax, said Kyle Pomerleau, chief economist at the Tax Foundation. Of course, if Congress were to adopt Mr. Sanders’s proposal, lawmakers could also try to close some of those loopholes.

Raising capital gains tax rates

How many people would pay? Relatively few taxpayers. Would it reduce inequality? Most likely. How much money could it raise for the government? A lot. Would the rich find ways to avoid or evade this tax? Possibly.

Several Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden, want to end the discrepancy between how different kinds of income are taxed. To wit, long-term capital gains are taxed at a top rate of 20 percent, but the top rate for salary and wage income is 37 percent.

Lower taxes on investment income skew the system in favor of wealthier households and raising capital gains tax rates would change that.

As of 2016, about 80 percent of the income of households that earn less than $198,000 a year comes in the form of wages and salaries, according to a paper by Lily Batchelder and David Kamin of the New York University School of Law. By contrast, capital gains and dividends account for 70 percent of the income of the families that earn $53 million or more a year.

“The way that the very top of earners in our country make money is very different from the rest,” Mr. Kamin said.

The top 10 percent of households by income own 84 percent of all stocks. Mr. Biden’s plan is aimed at this group and would raise the capital gains rate to 39.6 percent for top earners.

Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, who is not running for president, would go further still by fundamentally changing how capital gains are taxed, at least for the wealthiest Americans. He recently proposed taxing the appreciation of stocks held by the richest 0.3 percent of households, even if those gains haven’t been realized. Mr. Wyden also favors equalizing the rate at which earned income and capital gains are taxed.

The senator’s proposal would have the effect of trimming the wings of billionaires who have watched their fortunes soar but haven’t sold their shares.

The proposal from Mr. Wyden would raise an estimated $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion over 10 years, which would be earmarked for Social Security. Mr. Biden would allocate money raised in part from hiking capital gains taxes to pay the $750 billion cost of expanding coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

Simply raising capital gains taxes without other reforms is tricky as taxpayers could choose not to sell stocks to avoid owing money. Based on research it has analyzed, the Tax Policy Center estimates that raising the capital gains rate above 30 percent would reduce revenues, Mr. Toder said. Taxing appreciation as Mr. Wyden has proposed would help address this."

Associates say Mr. Biden is infuriated by Mr. Trump’s conduct and astonished by the president’s willingness to dismiss some of the most basic ethical lines in American politics.

In Wilmington, Del., Tuesday, Mr. Biden called the president’s actions an “abuse of power’’ that undermined national security, and said he would support impeachment if Mr. Trump did not provide information related to congressional investigations.

In some respects, Mr. Trump’s conduct has reinforced the central message of Mr. Biden’s appeal to Democratic voters: that the country is threatened by an out-of-control presidency, and that ousting Mr. Trump is more important than any other policy goal Democrats might share.

At fund-raisers and other events, Democrats who have spoken with Mr. Biden in recent days say he has largely appeared measured, greeting old friends in his typical effusive style and keeping the focus on his concerns with Mr. Trump’s foreign policy, rather than dwelling on the challenges the moment raises for his family.

Still unclear in this moment of crisis is what conclusions Democratic voters might make about Mr. Biden as an opponent for Mr. Trump, and how a drive for impeachment in Congress might shape the Democratic primary campaign.

Former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa, who saw Mr. Biden at a fund-raiser in Iowa on Saturday, said he believed that Mr. Trump’s dangerous conduct was at the forefront of Mr. Biden’s mind."

Capitalism needs a wealth tax

The idea of a wealth tax is not new, but it gained mainstream popularity with the publication in 2013 of the French economist Thomas Piketty’s “Capital in the Twenty-First Century,” the book that launched a thousand think pieces. Mr. Piketty, who has expressed support for both Ms. Warren’s and Mr. Sanders’s campaigns, argued that a capitalist economy inevitably produces wealth inequality that is self-perpetuating and, if left unchecked, “potentially terrifying.” He wrote:

When the rate of return on capital exceeds the rate of growth of output and income, as it did in the nineteenth century and seems quite likely to do again in the twenty-first, capitalism automatically generates arbitrary and unsustainable inequalities that radically undermine the meritocratic values on which democratic societies are based.

To avert what he calls “patrimonial capitalism,” where rich people get ever richer only by virtue of being rich in the first place, Mr. Piketty prescribed a global wealth tax, progressing from 1 percent on assets of one million euros to 5 to 10 percent on assets above a billion euros (as well as an “optimal” top marginal income tax in developed countries around 80 percent).

“Short of that, many may turn against globalization,” he wrote with prescience in The Financial Times in 2014. “If, one day, they found a common voice, it would speak the disremembered mantras of nationalism and economic isolation.”

A wealth tax may not work

Even those sympathetic to the spirit of a wealth tax acknowledge that there are considerable pragmatic obstacles to its implementation. Even if there were sufficient political will to pass it, it could face a constitutional challenge. Megan McArdle , a libertarian Washington Post columnist, writes:

The big problem is Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution, which forbids “direct taxes” on people or property unless they’re “apportioned” — doled out among the states by population. Instituting an income tax required a constitutional amendment to override that clause, and Warren’s plan might well require another.

Both Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have cited numerous legal experts who say a wealth tax would be constitutional. But with the Supreme Court’s composition being what it is, the question is far from settled.

There’s also the matter of enforcement. As Paul Krugman notes, the wealthy are quite good at avoiding taxes and evading them illegally. And because many assets owned by the ultra-wealthy — like artwork and diamonds — aren’t always traded on the market, Ms. McArdle writes, taxing them would mean “creating a lot of administrative capacity to track and price the assets, with the wealthy and their lawyers fighting every step of the way.”

“If these difficulties prove insurmountable,” writes Noah Smith, a left-leaning economist, in Bloomberg, “Warren and other egalitarian tax crusaders might consider an alternative — an inheritance tax, which would close many of the loopholes that now riddle the U.S. estate tax.” He adds:

Taxing all income from inheritances — including trusts, foundations, gifts, estates, and any other kind of family transfers — at a very high rate would yield a result similar to a small annual wealth tax, only its constitutionality would be less in doubt. And it would focus the tax on the rich people whose fortunes Americans are most likely to think of as being undeserved.

A wealth tax is a bad idea

Skeptics of the idea of a wealth tax argue that it has a bumpy track record. While 12 European countries had a wealth tax in 1990, Greg Rosalsky writes in NPR, only three (Norway, Spain and Switzerland) still do. He writes:

According to reports by the OECD and others, there were some clear themes with the policy: it was expensive to administer, it was hard on people with lots of assets but little cash, it distorted saving and investment decisions, it pushed the rich and their money out of the taxing countries — and, perhaps worst of all, it didn’t raise much revenue.

An economist and leading inequality scholar who has advised Ms. Warren, Gabriel Zucman of the University of California, Berkeley, says that her wealth tax is designed with those failures in mind, since it applies only to the ultra-wealthy, taxes citizens wherever they live and imposes a 40 percent “exit tax” on Americans worth more than $50 million who renounce their citizenship.

Still others oppose the idea on principle, for the very reasons many support it. Michael R. Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, writes in Bloomberg:

Warren’s wealth tax would be an abuse of government power. It is the tax-code equivalent of looting mansions. What is wrong with the way these 75,000 families made their money? Paying taxes is not a punishment, and the tax code should not be used to penalize any group of citizens. Not even the very rich.

A wealth tax is only a start

A wealth tax could close the country’s wealth gap from the top, and the universal social programs it helps fund could go some way to closing the wealth gap at the bottom. But more targeted redistributive measures, like reparations, may be needed to completely close the gap between blacks and whites, argues William Darity Jr., a professor of public policy at Duke University. He told The Times:

That’s an objective that is not achieved by any of the existing policies on the table now. Ultimately, you need a person-based program if you’re really concerned about the racial wealth gap. And it not only has to be person-based, but it has to be race-specific.

Some on the left have also criticized the idea of a wealth tax as utopian in its belief that those at capitalism’s helm would steer the system in a direction it by nature does not want to go. To fix the problem at the root, writes Benjamin Kunkel in The London Review of Books, imagine a market socialist revolution through which the shares of all corporations are transferred into public hands. With ownership of the means of production more evenly distributed, inequality wouldn’t deepen automatically as Mr. Piketty says it does under capitalism. Mr. Kunkel writes:

The notion of such a revolution — first in one country, then gatheringly international but not yet universal — is fanciful right now. But is it more so than a global capital tax requiring the coordination of virtually all nations? … Socialist revolution frankly seems more likely. … Capitalism can dispense with democracy more easily than with profits.

THE TAKEAWAY

In “Capital,” Mr. Piketty himself wrote that his idea of a progressive global wealth tax was indeed “utopian.” Yet he also said that the United States, producing as it does a quarter of global G.D.P., wouldn’t need to “ask permission” from other countries to pioneer the policy."

That goes for those that purport to help him, despite his explicit condemnation of their existence.”

In addition to its public statements, Mr. Biden’s campaign has warned off some Democrats from participating in a super PAC. One prominent Democrat, David Wilhelm, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said he had been approached about being involved in the pro-Biden super PAC but had declined to do so after the campaign urged him against it.

Mr. Riddle said a final decision about whether to deploy a super PAC for Mr. Biden would be made in “the coming weeks.”

Mr. Biden clearly needs to jolt his campaign, which has lost ground in the early nominating states to Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has been largely unscathed by her rivals. And the vice president’s longtime friends increasingly believe that Ms. Warren’s growing strength — along with Mr. Trump’s offensive — is reason enough to risk the backlash they would get from their opponents and campaign finance reform advocates for creating a group reliant on large contributions. But Mr. Riddle said there had been no final decision on whether to proceed with a super PAC, in part because of this risk. Mr. Biden’s two leading competitors for his party’s nomination, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have made getting big money out of politics a major theme of their campaigns. And Mr. Biden has already drawn criticism for his comparative reliance on wealthy donors to fund his candidacy.

“I’m mindful that any effort to do this is going to be disowned by the campaign because of the way Warren has replayed her hand,” said Mr. Rasky, alluding to the senator’s decision not to solicit large campaign checks as a presidential candidate, despite having done so in her Senate campaign.

Mr. Riddle said that any pro-Biden advertising would be focused on responding to attacks from Mr. Trump and Republicans, rather than targeting other Democrats.

Despite Mr. Munger’s presence at the meeting last week, Mr. Riddle said Mr. Munger was not involved in devising the pro-Biden group and had not contributed any money so far. Mr. Munger is the son of Charles Munger, a billionaire who is the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s investment firm."

How long will this all take?

As long as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wants.

But there’s a strong political argument for moving the process forward this year, given that it gets harder for Democrats to make their case as the election nears — and voters could throw Mr. Trump out of office anyhow. Historically, the process has taken about four months.

How likely is it that Mr. Trump will be removed from office at the end of all this?

Not very. There are no signs that Senate Republicans have any appetite for investigating Mr. Trump. To reach a two-thirds majority in the Senate, at least 20 Republicans would have to vote with every Democrat to remove Mr. Trump from office.

No House Republicans and only two Senate Republicans back any kind of investigation into Mr. Trump. Here’s how Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who described the allegations against Mr. Trump as “deeply troubling,” explained his party’s resistance earlier this week:

There’s such enormous power associated with being the party in power, both in the White House as well as in the Senate and the House. … I think it’s very natural for people to look at circumstances and see them in the light that’s most amenable to their maintaining power, and doing things to preserve that power.

How does this effect the 2020 election?

This clearly leads to a Joe Walsh surge in Arizona, a Joe Sestak victory in North Dakota and Mayor Pete Buttigieg dropping out of the race to become a professor of 16th century art history.

Seriously, though, no one really knows.

As my colleague Reid Epstein and I wrote today, it’s probably not great for the lower-polling candidates, who will now face an even greater struggle to get media attention.

How it impacts the front-runners in the race — Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren — is a topic of great debate within Democratic circles right now. We’ve never seen an impeachment inquiry quite like this, leaving the candidates, strategists and assorted prognosticators navigating uncharted political waters.

Also important to remember: Mr. Trump can run for re-election even if he’s impeached by the House. And maybe even if he’s removed by the Senate, too."

In a private chat room, pro-Trump internet trolls discussed which memes, videos and news stories to push on social media in order to reclaim the narrative.

The last time America watched an impeachment inquiry, it was largely an analog affair. When the House voted to begin impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton in 1998, only one in four American homes had internet access.

If the inquiry opened by House Democrats this week results in a formal impeachment of Mr. Trump, it will be the first of the social media era. In many ways, it is a made-for-the-internet event.

The start-up I.P.O. market has gone ice-cold

It isn’t just Uber and WeWork that have struggled to get into the public markets. Wall Street has become much more skeptical of I.P.O.s by loss-making companies, the NYT reports, and the consequences could ripple through Silicon Valley and beyond.

Consider the most recent spate of bad news:

• Peloton, the maker of home fitness bikes, saw its shares tumble 11 percent below their I.P.O. yesterday, one of the worst debuts of the year.

• Endeavor, the entertainment conglomerate run by Ari Emanuel and Patrick Whitesell, pulled its I.P.O. yesterday, after previously cutting the price range.

“The rejection threatens Silicon Valley’s favored approach to building companies,” the NYT writes. Buzzy businesses had relied on huge sums from venture capitalists to grow quickly. But if public market investors are increasingly disdainful of such companies, start-ups may find it harder to get funding in the first place."

No such thing as bad publicity? CrowdStrike might beg to differ.

President Trump mentioned the cybersecurity company in his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. His issue with CrowdStrike wasn’t clear from the call, though it was ostensibly related to the company’s investigation into the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee. CrowdStrike’s stock has fallen more than 10% since the White House memo of that call was released midday Wednesday.

That might seem an overly harsh penalty for a passing mention, even in what is sure to become one of the more infamous phone calls of the century. But CrowdStrike has also been one of the most expensive stocks in the cloud software category since its well-received initial public offering in June. Even with some substantial declines from earlier in the month, CrowdStrike still started the week trading around 25 times forward sales.

Jonathan Ruykhaver of Baird started coverage of the company on Thursday with a neutral rating, praising the business but noting that very strong growth assumptions have already been dialed in.

It’s possible that Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, could refuse to hold a trial — a move that would overturn long-held Senate rules but might not be unconstitutional.

How long will this all take?

As long as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wants.

But there’s a strong political argument for moving the process forward this year, given that it gets harder for Democrats to make their case as the election nears — and voters could throw Mr. Trump out of office anyhow. Historically, the process has taken about four months.

How likely is it that Mr. Trump will be removed from office at the end of all this?

Not very. There are no signs that Senate Republicans have any appetite for investigating Mr. Trump. To reach a two-thirds majority in the Senate, at least 20 Republicans would have to vote with every Democrat to remove Mr. Trump from office.

No House Republicans and only two Senate Republicans back any kind of investigation into Mr. Trump. Here’s how Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who described the allegations against Mr. Trump as “deeply troubling,” explained his party’s resistance earlier this week:

There’s such enormous power associated with being the party in power, both in the White House as well as in the Senate and the House. … I think it’s very natural for people to look at circumstances and see them in the light that’s most amenable to their maintaining power, and doing things to preserve that power.

How does this effect the 2020 election?

This clearly leads to a Joe Walsh surge in Arizona, a Joe Sestak victory in North Dakota and Mayor Pete Buttigieg dropping out of the race to become a professor of 16th century art history.

Seriously, though, no one really knows.

As my colleague Reid Epstein and I wrote today, it’s probably not great for the lower-polling candidates, who will now face an even greater struggle to get media attention.

How it impacts the front-runners in the race — Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren — is a topic of great debate within Democratic circles right now. We’ve never seen an impeachment inquiry quite like this, leaving the candidates, strategists and assorted prognosticators navigating uncharted political waters.

Also important to remember: Mr. Trump can run for re-election even if he’s impeached by the House. And maybe even if he’s removed by the Senate, too."

In a private chat room, pro-Trump internet trolls discussed which memes, videos and news stories to push on social media in order to reclaim the narrative.

The last time America watched an impeachment inquiry, it was largely an analog affair. When the House voted to begin impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton in 1998, only one in four American homes had internet access. AOL and Yahoo were the biggest websites in the world, and “tweet” was a sound birds made.

If the inquiry opened by House Democrats this week results in a formal impeachment of Mr. Trump, it will be the first of the social media era. In many ways, it is a made-for-the-internet event. The political stakes are high, the dramatic story unspools tidbit by tidbit and the stark us-versus-them dynamics provide plenty of fodder for emotionally charged social media brawls."

The candidates are not perfectly aligned — some have been more forceful than others, and some, like Ms. Gabbard, have been careful only to endorse the inquiry Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Tuesday, not necessarily impeachment itself."

There is, I’d argue, an important clue in the “Obama rage” that swept Wall Street circa 2010. Objectively, the Obama administration was very good to the financial industry, even though that industry had just led us into the worst economic crisis since the 1930s. Major financial players were bailed out on lenient terms, and while bankers were subjected to a long-overdue increase in regulation, the new regulations have proved fairly easy for reputable firms to deal with.

Yet financial tycoons were furious with President Barack Obama because they felt disrespected. In truth, Obama’s rhetoric was very mild; all he ever did was suggest that some bankers had behaved badly, which no reasonable person could deny. But with great wealth comes great pettiness; Obama’s gentle rebukes provoked fury — and a huge swing in financial industry political contributions toward Republicans.

The point is that many of the superrich aren’t satisfied with living like kings, which they will continue to do no matter who wins next year’s election. They also expect to be treated like kings, lionized as job creators and heroes of prosperity, and consider any criticism an unforgivable act of lèse-majesté.

And for such people, the prospect of a Warren presidency is a nightmarish threat — not to their wallets, but to their egos. They can try to brush off someone like Bernie Sanders as a rabble-rouser. But when Warren criticizes malefactors of great wealth and proposes reining in their excesses, her evident policy sophistication — has any previous candidate managed to turn wonkiness into a form of charisma? — makes her critique much harder to dismiss.

If Warren is the nominee, then, a significant number of tycoons will indeed go for Trump; better to put democracy at risk than to countenance a challenge to their imperial self-esteem. But will it matter?

Maybe not. These days American presidential elections are so awash in money that both sides can count on having enough resources to saturate the airwaves.

Indeed, over-the-top attacks from the wealthy can sometimes be a political plus. That was certainly the case for F.D.R., who reveled in his plutocratic opposition: “They are unanimous in their hate for me — and I welcome their hatred.”"

The proposal is the latest measure from Mr. Sanders aimed at reducing income inequality — a pillar of his campaign for the Democratic nomination for president.

It is also the latest example of the commitment by Mr. Sanders and his leading progressive rival, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, to use America’s tax system to address the wide gulf between ordinary Americans and the rich.

“The American people are sick and tired of corporate C.E.O.s who now make 300 times more than their average employees, while they give themselves huge bonuses and cut back on the health care and pension benefits of their employees,” Mr. Sanders said in a statement. “They want corporations to invest in their workers, not just dividends, stock buybacks and outrageous compensation packages to their executives.”"

Deploys an Old Tactic",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-fired-teaching.html,"Mr. Trump has slurred Ms. Warren for years over her ancestry claims, and the personal attacks on her come out of the Trump playbook from 2016 that targeted both Republicans and Mrs. Clinton. Michael Steel, a Republican strategist who was an adviser for former Gov. Jeb Bush’s 2016 presidential campaign, said Mr. Trump would need to “tear down” whoever is the eventual Democratic nominee in order to win re-election, given his low approval ratings.

“One of Senator Warren’s great strengths is her ability to connect her biography to her record to her plans for the future,” he said. “That gets undermined if she can’t rely on her biography as the foundation of that progression.”

All year, Ms. Warren has framed her personal story to voters as one of perseverance , focusing on her upbringing in Oklahoma, her family’s financial struggles and her winding path to an eventual career as a law professor. Voters often praise her biographical story as a powerful part of her pitch , which centers on bringing about big change to an economic and political system that she describes as rigged against ordinary people .

As part of that story, Ms. Warren tells crowds that at the end of her first year as a public-school teacher, she was “visibly pregnant” and lost her job. A retired teacher from Ms. Warren’s school in New Jersey told CBS News, “The rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant.”

Teachers in the United States were commonly pushed out of their jobs during pregnancy at the time, either through termination or the requirement of an unpaid leave of absence. Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act in 1978, which barred employers from treating pregnant women differently from other people “similar in their ability or inability to work,” but claims of discrimination persist to this day.

“These attacks on Senator Warren are absurd,” said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who dropped out of the presidential race in August. “Of course pregnancy discrimination was a serious problem in 1971, and it continues to be a widespread issue today despite a law banning it. The stories that women are sharing are real and powerful.”

Regardless, the Republican National Committee dismissed Ms. Warren’s description of losing her job, citing a 2007 interview in which she discussed her public-school teaching career but did not mention being forced out, as well as records showing that the school board had approved a contract for Ms. Warren for the next school year."

Mr. Biden zeroed in on Ms. Warren’s refusal to say if she would raise taxes on middle-class Americans to pay for “Medicare for all,” a single-payer health care system that would all but eliminate private health insurance. While other candidates are pouncing on that issue as well, Mr. Biden is under particular pressure because Ms. Warren has passed him in some national and early-state polls and joined him as a front-runner, a status he held alone for months.

Their tax proposals are helping to galvanize those on the left, but their ideas will also provide fodder for Republicans eager to paint them in a general election as tax-happy and too liberal.

Polls have found widespread support for the idea of taxing wealth. A poll conducted for The New York Times by the internet research firm SurveyMonkey this summer found that two-thirds of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, backed a 2 percent tax on households worth over $50 million, which is the heart of Ms. Warren’s plan.

The proposals for a wealth tax are among a variety of ideas for collecting more tax revenue that Democratic presidential candidates have put forward. On Monday, Mr. Sanders proposed a new tax on corporations that have a huge gap between what they pay their chief executive and their median worker. Jared Bernstein, who was chief economist for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. from 2009 to 2011, said he has discussed with the Biden campaign a proposal to tax financial transactions.

[The latest data and analysis to keep track of who’s leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.]

On the campaign trail, Ms. Warren explains the concept of a wealth tax by putting it in familiar terms, likening it to the property taxes that many Americans pay on their homes. For the superrich, she said in South Carolina on Saturday, “how about we include in yours not only your real estate, but also your stock portfolio, the diamonds, the Rembrandt and the yacht?”

Mr. Sanders is blunt about his desire to reduce the size of America’s biggest fortunes, even highlighting how much individual billionaires would have to pay in taxes under his proposal. He said last week that he did not believe billionaires should exist in the United States.

“There’s no question to my mind that the United States is moving toward an oligarchy,” Mr. Sanders said. “This is an issue that has to be addressed, and this wealth tax begins to do that.”"

But it can give us the perspectives of some of the people with expertise on primary races: veteran campaign strategists and consultants from both parties.

Here is a sampling of their reactions.

Warren took fire from all sides

The strategists agreed on one thing: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s new front-runner status was clear, because she was everyone else’s biggest target. But they were divided on how well she handled the attacks.

“Warren took almost everyone’s best punch there & came away basically unscathed.” — Jesse Lehrich, former foreign policy spokesman for Hillary Clinton “Heading into this debate as a frontrunner, she did not seem ready for the incoming.” — Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and former Democratic National Committee spokesman “This is the @ewarren debate. You might be happy or sad about it, but she’s the one who is setting the tone and she’s the reference point for most of the other candidates. That happens to the frontrunner.” — Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics

Buttigieg stood out …

Several consultants said Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., had successfully set himself up as an alternative for moderate Democrats uneasy with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. They particularly liked his responses on foreign policy, which he framed in terms of his own experience in the military.

“Very strong, passionate and compelling condemnation of @realDonaldTrump betrayal of Kurds from Northern Syria by @PeteButtigieg. Owning this discussion.” — David Axelrod, former chief strategist for Barack Obama “I am impressed with Buttigieg on foreign policy. Like Biden, he really shines and opens up when he talks about FP.” — Jess Morales Rocketto, political director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance “This has been @PeteButtigieg’s best #DemDebate performance so far. While other candidates tried to out-left and anti-Trump each other, Mayor Pete came across as reasonable and rational.” — Frank Luntz, Republican consultant and pollster

… and so did Klobuchar

Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota received similarly positive reviews, with strategists arguing that she and Mr. Buttigieg in the middle against Ms. Warren on the left was the biggest dynamic of the night.

“@amyklobuchar performance tonight will resonate with moderate Democrats who are tired of being told that they are sellouts if they don’t subscribe to most left views. It’s a theme that’s cut across all her answers tonight & why she is having a good night.” — Jennifer Palmieri, former spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama “With 11 other people on stage, you don’t get a lot of opportunities to make an impression. But she’s finding them, using each one to stand out and draw a contrast.” — Mo Elleithee “Every time Amy Klobuchar speaks she says something sensible. Not sure that makes her electable, but it’s nice to hear.” — Joe Lockhart, former spokesman for President Bill Clinton

Sanders was reassuring

After his heart attack two weeks ago, Senator Bernie Sanders badly needed to project strength and stamina, and on the whole, the consensus was that he succeeded.

“What heart attack?! @BernieSanders is giving a strong performance and not missing a step.” — Patti Solis Doyle, senior adviser to the 2008 Obama campaign “Bernie Sanders making a damn important point here — stuff in our county was bad before Trump was elected, and this election has to be about more than defeating Trump.” — Sally Kohn, progressive commentator and former campaign strategist “This was @BernieSanders’ best debate by far, but I still don’t hear him making a pitch to people who don’t already support him.” — Laura Belin, Iowa political commentator

Biden had an uneven performance

Mr. Biden won praise for his responses on foreign policy — frequently a strong area for him — but was criticized for seeming to claim credit for Ms. Warren’s work establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

“Biden needs to have a clear and compelling response to the Trump charge against him and his son, and I assumed he would have prepared one, but his answer is not sharp. When asked ‘did you make a mistake?’ he snaps back with a much sharper line.” — Robert Reich, professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and former labor secretary No one more experienced on foreign policy on this debate stage than @JoeBiden. This is where his experience shines and reminds voters that experience does matter.” — Adrienne Elrod, former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton “Biden yelling ‘I GOT you votes’ at Warren is not the best look.” — Kelly Dittmar, scholar at Rutgers University’s Center for American Women and Politics

Other standout moments

Several other candidates got good reviews for specific answers: Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker on reproductive rights, and the former housing secretary Julián Castro for the statement, “Police violence is also gun violence.”

“Such a smart move by @KamalaHarris to refocus the conversation on women’s reproductive rights. She listened to women since the last debate and will gain attention and praise for it.” — Kelly Dittmar “@CoryBooker brings a lot to this primary, but perhaps his greatest debate contribution is his continuance to be the moral compass, reminding candidates and the audience what this campaign is really all about: defeating Trump and helping people live better lives.” — Adrienne Elrod “Castro was really strong on police violence there and brought in an angle on seizing guns that other candidates missed.” — Seth Masket, political scientist at the University of Denver

Ms. Warren has become known for her towering stack of policy plans, having offered dozens of proposals on a wide variety of subjects. But on health care, she has not been similarly forthcoming, and her repeated refusal to say whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to help finance Medicare for all has drawn sharp criticism from some of her Democratic presidential rivals.

Given her increasing status as a front-runner in the primary race, Ms. Warren was ce rtain to continue facing challenges on the issue. For weeks, she has sidestepped questions about raising taxes, no matter who was asking and when. But it had been an open question whether it would remain politically tenable for her to continue simply aligning herself with Senator Bernie Sanders’s health care plan while declining to provide any detailed explanation of how she would pay for it.

Ms. Warren brought up the issue of Medicare for all at the end of a town-hall-style event in Iowa on Sunday afternoon. “I plan over the next few weeks to put out a plan that talks about, specifically, the cost of Medicare for all and, specifically, how we pay for it,” she told the crowd at the event, held at Simpson College."

Some candidates have more maneuvering room than others to challenge the two leaders: Whereas Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders are flush with cash, Ms. Klobuchar is in a far more tenuous financial position and has yet to qualify for the debate in November. At least a few other candidates who took an assertive approach Tuesday are in similar straits, straining to raise money or meet the debate threshold or both.

What could prove decisive in Iowa, and beyond, is if centrist voters coalesce behind a single candidate or fracture among the group of hopefuls presenting themselves as pragmatists. If Mr. Biden cannot recover a measure of momentum, but holds on to enough support to block other candidates from building a coalition of more moderate Democrats, it could allow Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders to roll through the earliest primaries and caucuses with relatively weak opposition.

This scenario, of a sort of zombie Biden candidacy, is what most alarms supporters of other center-left Democrats in the race.

Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio, a close ally of Mr. Buttigieg, predicted the South Bend mayor would now “dig down deep in Iowa and New Hampshire,” carrying his message from the debate — a combination of uplifting rhetoric about the future and blunt criticism of certain progressive policies — into the early states where he’s polling in fourth place.

Ms. Whaley said she expected Mr. Buttigieg, 37, to make a determined effort to displace Mr. Biden as the candidate seen as most capable of speaking to Midwesterners."

Experts Weigh In,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/us/politics/who-won-the-debate-experts-weigh-in.html,"Twitter can’t tell us whether, or how, Tuesday’s CNN/New York Times debate might change voters’ minds. But it can give us the perspectives of some of the people with expertise on primary races: veteran campaign strategists and consultants from both parties.

Here is a sampling of their reactions.

Warren took fire from all sides

The strategists agreed on one thing: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s new front-runner status was clear, because she was everyone else’s biggest target. But they were divided on how well she handled the attacks.

“Warren took almost everyone’s best punch there & came away basically unscathed.” — Jesse Lehrich, former foreign policy spokesman for Hillary Clinton “Heading into this debate as a frontrunner, she did not seem ready for the incoming.” — Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and former Democratic National Committee spokesman “This is the @ewarren debate. You might be happy or sad about it, but she’s the one who is setting the tone and she’s the reference point for most of the other candidates. That happens to the frontrunner.” — Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics

Buttigieg stood out …

Several consultants said Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., had successfully set himself up as an alternative for moderate Democrats uneasy with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. They particularly liked his responses on foreign policy, which he framed in terms of his own experience in the military.

“Very strong, passionate and compelling condemnation of @realDonaldTrump betrayal of Kurds from Northern Syria by @PeteButtigieg. Owning this discussion.” — David Axelrod, former chief strategist for Barack Obama “I am impressed with Buttigieg on foreign policy. Like Biden, he really shines and opens up when he talks about FP.” — Jess Morales Rocketto, political director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance “This has been @PeteButtigieg’s best #DemDebate performance so far. While other candidates tried to out-left and anti-Trump each other, Mayor Pete came across as reasonable and rational.” — Frank Luntz, Republican consultant and pollster

… and so did Klobuchar

Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota received similarly positive reviews, with strategists arguing that she and Mr. Buttigieg in the middle against Ms. Warren on the left was the biggest dynamic of the night.

“@amyklobuchar performance tonight will resonate with moderate Democrats who are tired of being told that they are sellouts if they don’t subscribe to most left views. It’s a theme that’s cut across all her answers tonight & why she is having a good night.” — Jennifer Palmieri, former spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama “With 11 other people on stage, you don’t get a lot of opportunities to make an impression. But she’s finding them, using each one to stand out and draw a contrast.” — Mo Elleithee “Every time Amy Klobuchar speaks she says something sensible. Not sure that makes her electable, but it’s nice to hear.” — Joe Lockhart, former spokesman for President Bill Clinton

Sanders was reassuring

After his heart attack two weeks ago, Senator Bernie Sanders badly needed to project strength and stamina, and on the whole, the consensus was that he succeeded.

“What heart attack?! @BernieSanders is giving a strong performance and not missing a step.” — Patti Solis Doyle, senior adviser to the 2008 Obama campaign “Bernie Sanders making a damn important point here — stuff in our county was bad before Trump was elected, and this election has to be about more than defeating Trump.” — Sally Kohn, progressive commentator and former campaign strategist “This was @BernieSanders’ best debate by far, but I still don’t hear him making a pitch to people who don’t already support him.” — Laura Belin, Iowa political commentator

Biden had an uneven performance

Mr. Biden won praise for his responses on foreign policy — frequently a strong area for him — but was criticized for seeming to claim credit for Ms. Warren’s work establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

“Biden needs to have a clear and compelling response to the Trump charge against him and his son, and I assumed he would have prepared one, but his answer is not sharp. When asked ‘did you make a mistake?’ he snaps back with a much sharper line.” — Robert Reich, professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and former labor secretary No one more experienced on foreign policy on this debate stage than @JoeBiden. This is where his experience shines and reminds voters that experience does matter.” — Adrienne Elrod, former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton “Biden yelling ‘I GOT you votes’ at Warren is not the best look.” — Kelly Dittmar, scholar at Rutgers University’s Center for American Women and Politics

Other standout moments

Several other candidates got good reviews for specific answers: Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker on reproductive rights, and the former housing secretary Julián Castro for the statement, “Police violence is also gun violence.”

“Such a smart move by @KamalaHarris to refocus the conversation on women’s reproductive rights. She listened to women since the last debate and will gain attention and praise for it.” — Kelly Dittmar “@CoryBooker brings a lot to this primary, but perhaps his greatest debate contribution is his continuance to be the moral compass, reminding candidates and the audience what this campaign is really all about: defeating Trump and helping people live better lives.” — Adrienne Elrod “Castro was really strong on police violence there and brought in an angle on seizing guns that other candidates missed.” — Seth Masket, political scientist at the University of Denver

I know what the job is. I’ve been engaged. Look, one of the reasons I’m running is because of my age and my experience. With it comes wisdom. We need someone to take office this time around who on Day 1 can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders from Putin to our allies, and know exactly what has to be done to get this country back on track. It is required, now more than any time in any of our lifetimes, to have someone who has that capacity on Day 1. That’s one of the reasons why I decided to run, why I decided to run this time, because I know what has to be done. I’ve done it before. I’ve been there when we pulled the nation out of the worst financial recession in history. I’ve been there, and I’ve got so many pieces of legislation passed, including the Affordable Care Act as well as making sure that we had the Recovery Act, which kept us from going into a depression. I know what has to be done. I will not need any on-the-job training the day I take office. And I will release my medical records, as I have 21 years of my tax records, which no one else on this stage has done, so that you can have full transparency as to my health and what I am doing.

BURNETT: Just to be clear, Mr. Vice President, when will you release those records?

BIDEN: Before the first vote.

BURNETT: Senator Warren, like Senator Sanders and Vice President Biden, if you win the presidency, you would be the oldest president ever inaugurated in a first term. You would be 71. Forty percent of Democratic primary voters say they think a candidate under the age of 70 is more likely to defeat President Trump. What do you say to them?

WARREN: Well, I say I will outwork, out-organize and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with. Look, the way I see this, the way we’re going to win is by addressing head-on what millions of Americans know in their bones, and that is that the wealthy and the well-connected have captured our democracy, and they’re making it work for themselves and leaving everyone else behind. And political pundits and Washington insiders and, shoot, people in our own party don’t want to admit that. They think that running some kind of vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of big problems in this country is a winning strategy. They are wrong. If all Democrats can promise is after Donald Trump, it will be business as usual, then we will lose. Democrats win when we call out what’s broken and we show how to fix it. Democrats will win when we fight for the things that touch people’s lives, things like child care and health care and housing costs. Democrats will win when we give people a reason to get in the fight."

WARREN: So you started this question with how you got something done. You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, don’t even try because you will never get it passed. And sure enough, the big banks fought us. The Republicans fought us. Some of the Democrats fought us. But we got that agency passed into law. It has now forced big banks to return more than $12 billion directly to people they cheated. I served in the Obama administration. I know what we can do by executive authority, and I will use it. In Congress, on the first day, I will pass my anti-corruption bill, which will beat back the influence of money.

And when it comes to the tech sector, that has meant taking square aim at giant companies like Facebook — companies she says have become so large that they are stifling competition.

Ms. Warren rolled out a proposal to break up Facebook, Amazon and other tech giants in March. To ensure that tech workers got her message, her campaign paid for a billboard near a major transit station in San Francisco. It read “Break Up Big Tech,” in capital letters.

On Tuesday, nearly seven months after Ms. Warren first unveiled her plan, The Verge offered a window into what Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, thinks about it. In leaked audio recordings of open meetings with employees this summer, Mr. Zuckerberg can be heard saying that the company would sue if Ms. Warren were to enact the plan as president.

A NBC/Wall Street Journal poll in July found that 72 percent of Democratic voters nationwide, largely liberals, said they would support a taxpayer-funded, single-payer health care system. Even moderate and conservative Democratic voters supported the idea, at 57 percent. Younger Democratic voters were particularly likely to back a single-payer system.

But support was mushier across party lines, according to the poll. Just 44 percent of all American voters supported a single-payer plan funded by taxes.

And when given a choice between Medicare for all and a public option, even Democrats remain split.

In a July study, Pew researchers found that 4 in 5 Democrats believed it was the government’s responsibility to ensure all Americans have health care. But in a follow-up question on how it should be administered, just 44 percent of all Democrats favored a Medicare for all model, while an additional 34 percent said they would like to see a public option operating alongside private insurers — the approach favored by Mr. Biden and more moderate Democrats.

Among the general population, just over a quarter of Americans said they would choose a Medicare for all-type system, according to the Pew survey.

Who’s Paying?

Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have made two claims central to their candidacies: that only Medicare for all would be enough to make health care affordable for every American, and that the richest Americans ought to pay far more in taxes than they currently do."

In 1974, the Supreme Court ruled some of these policies unconstitutional. But not all such policies were explicitly written down and tracked, giving many female teachers little legal recourse.

CBS News quoted a retired teacher from Ms. Warren’s school, Trudy Randall, who suggested Ms. Warren would have been unwelcome at the school given her pregnancy.

“The rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant. Now, if you didn’t tell anybody you were pregnant, and they didn’t know, you could fudge it and try to stay on a little bit longer,” Ms. Randall was quoted as saying. “But they kind of wanted you out if you were pregnant.”

At issue are the circumstances that brought to an end Ms. Warren’s brief career as a special needs teacher at an elementary school in Riverdale, N.J., where she worked from 1970 to 1971, when she was just out of college. On the campaign trail, Ms. Warren’s personal story is a central part of her stump speech, beginning with her upbringing in Oklahoma and, eventually, her experience as a teacher. As Ms. Warren tells it, she had wanted to be a teacher since she was in second grade.

“I loved that work, and I would probably still be doing that work today, but my story has some more turns,” she told a crowd in Nevada last week. “By the end of the first year, I was visibly pregnant, and the principal did what principals did in those days: wished me luck and hired someone else for the job.”

She included a similar account in her 2014 memoir. In some retellings earlier this year , she said the principal “showed me the door.”"

Ms. Warren’s campaign said on Friday that it had received 943,000 donations in the third quarter from 509,000 donors, and more than 300,000 of those donors gave to her presidential campaign for the first time. The average donation was $26, and Ms. Warren ended the quarter with $25.7 million in cash on hand, according to her campaign.

“Please take a moment to be proud of the movement you’re helping build ,” Roger Lau, Ms. Warren’s campaign manager, wrote in an email to supporters. “Close your eyes and picture Wall Street bankers scowling into their catered breakfast,” he suggested.

Collecting small contributions from a vast group of donors comes with a huge long-term advantage: Those donors can keep giving again and again as the campaign goes on. That is not the case for wealthy donors writing $2,800 checks to candidates — the maximum an individual can give to a campaign for the primary race.

Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders “are breaking these old political models in which rich donors can capture and control political parties,” said Stephanie Taylor, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is supporting Ms. Warren. “This is just a really revolutionary, seismic shift in American politics.”

Beating Mr. Sanders’s total for the past three months would have given another jolt of momentum to Ms. Warren’s campaign. Instead, Mr. Sanders’s status as the top fund-raiser for the quarter provides a reminder of his sizable base of support, even as other indicators like polling are less favorable.

In the long run, Mr. Sanders’s slight financial edge over Ms. Warren in the quarter is unlikely to make a major difference in the perceptions of their candidacies. Mr. Sanders entered the race having already established an enormous network of donors during his 2016 presidential campaign, and he raised slightly less in the third quarter of 2019 than he did during the same time period in 2015."

But she should not have been surprised.

For months, Ms. Warren had moved largely unimpeded in her brisk jog to the front of the 2020 Democratic pack, coasting through debates without incident as her calls for “big structural change” took hold and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. absorbed the unforgiving glare afforded the favorite. Time and again this year, moderators had invited Ms. Warren’s top competitors to attack her. Time and again, they had done so gently, if at all.

This time, Mr. O’Rourke went after her. Pete Buttigieg, the millennial mayor of South Bend, Ind., did the same early in the evening in a slashing exchange on health care. Andrew Yang said she was wrong on the wealth tax. Senator Kamala Harris smiled as she and Ms. Warren sparred over whether to regulate President Trump’s tweets. Mr. Biden initiated his most direct debate-stage confrontation with Ms. Warren to date, saying she was “being vague” in campaign proposals.

This was Ms. Warren’s reward for achieving co-front-runner (and maybe outright front-runner) status: persistent sniping from fellow Democrats who see her surge as the most urgent threat to their own paths to the nomination. Ms. Warren greeted the deluge with mixed success, never wobbling too precariously but retreating at times to the safe harbor of stump-speech platitudes. On occasion, she appeared so eager to avoid the fray that she could give the impression that she was not engaging with the substance. “A yes-or-no question that didn’t get a yes-or-no answer,” Mr. Buttigieg observed at one point."

During both the opening stretch of the debate and subsequent ones, her prescriptions were the point of reference, her priorities set the terms of the discussion, and she was the candidate to whom the debate’s moderators kept returning so that she could respond to her rivals’ invocations of her.

And she stayed cool and confident under fire, sounding more grateful for the spotlight than fearful of the microscope. It was, for the most part, a fine performance.

But it was also, at first, an exasperating one. That unwillingness to talk candidly about middle-class taxes, though she was pressed by both a moderator and by other candidates to do so, bordered on perverse.

She kept saying, as if it were a tic or a stutter, that “costs will go down” for middle-class families, the translation of which is that taxes might well go up but that those families would be economically ahead of the game in the end.

If that’s the case, why not be explicit about the arithmetic and own it? If there’s nothing to hide from, why hide from it? Warren has campaigned as a truth teller but came across, in this instance, as a classically evasive Washington operator, scared to treat voters as grown-ups who can process information in a sophisticated manner."

And yet ….

And yet, if it comes to Trump vs. Warren in a general election, the only plausible choice is to support Warren. Over the past month Donald Trump has given us fresh reminders of the unique and exceptional ways he corrupts American life. You’re either part of removing that corruption or you are not. When your nation’s political system is in danger, staying home and not voting is not a responsible option.

Politics is downstream from morality and culture. Warren represents a policy wrong turn, in my view, but policies can be argued about and reversed. Trump represents a much more important and fundamental threat — to the norms, values, standards and soul of this country.

Last week, Trump all but greenlighted the ethnic cleansing of Kurds without an ounce of remorse. He normalizes dishonesty and valorizes cruelty. His letter to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reminds us yet again that we have a president whose professional competence is at kindergarten level. Once a nation has lost its heart, mind and soul, it is very hard to get these things back.

Furthermore, Trump is an unprecedented threat to democratic institutions. Over the past few years, I’ve thought the progressive fears of incipient American fascism were vastly overblown. But, especially over the past month, Trump has worked overtime to validate those fears and to raise the horrifying specter of what he’ll be like if he is given a second term and is vindicated , unhinged and unwell.

In their book “How Democracies Die,” Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt argue that authoritarians undermine democracy in several ways. They reject the democratic rules of the game, the unwritten norms we rely upon to make the political system work. They deny the legitimacy of their political opponents, using extreme language to deny them standing as co-citizens. They tolerate or even encourage violence, threatening to take legal action against critics in rival parties."

Under attack from her Democratic rivals, can Elizabeth Warren hold on to her new front-runner status in the 2020 presidential primary?

Warren’s reticence to admit that the Medicare for All proposal she’s backed would raise middle-class taxes is understandable, argues Michelle Goldberg, but her embrace of Bernie Sanders’s plan is also a liability. Ross Douthat thinks Joe Biden is depriving other more moderate candidates, including Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, of political oxygen. And David Leonhardt thinks the more effective campaigners — like Warren and Sanders — are eclipsing the candidates who are appealing to swing voters.

Other presidents and presidential candidates have had heart trouble, though not all of it was known to the public at the time. Experts believe that President Warren G. Harding died of a heart attack that his doctor did not detect. Toward the end of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s third term and until his death in his fourth term, his White House doctor withheld the fact that he had serious heart failure. President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a heart attack near the end of his first term, and might have had a heart attack before he ran for president.

In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley damaged his presidential campaign by not disclosing that he had had a number of episodes of atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm abnormality, before he experienced one while campaigning and had to be rushed to a hospital with reporters trailing him.

Before his heart attack pulled him from the campaign trail, Mr. Sanders was polling in the top tier of the Democratic primary race with Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, and his staff has been trying to project optimism about his candidacy. But the episode has cast a shadow over his campaign just as he was attempting to reinvigorate it after a summer slump that saw his standing in some polls slip.

Hoping to reverse course, he had recently begun to focus more on his electability, arguing that he is the candidate best positioned to beat Mr. Trump in the general election.

The Sanders campaign announced this week that it had raised $25.3 million in the third quarter, placing him ahead of Ms. Warren, his chief ideological rival, by a hair and at the top of the field in fund-raising.

In a show of force, the campaign announced a $1.3 million ad buy in Iowa that it then postponed as it waited to assess the situation; the ad will now begin airing next Tuesday, and will run for two weeks as planned."

Mr. Biden said he would want to keep American troops there and convey to the Turkish government that it would pay a “heavy price” for its invasion. Ms. Warren said she opposed Mr. Trump’s handling of the situation but believed the United States should “get out of the Middle East.” (Aides to Ms. Warren said she was referring to the withdrawal of troops from combat.)

Throughout the debate, which was sponsored by CNN and The New York Times, Mr. Biden played a far less central role than he did in the past, stepping to the foreground for exchanges over foreign policy but otherwise taking a more passive approach. His most important moment of the night may have come early on, when he was pressed by a moderator to explain why his son had not crossed any ethical lines by doing business in Ukraine while his father was overseeing diplomacy there for the Obama administration.

Mr. Biden said several times that he and his son had done “nothing wrong,” and alluded repeatedly to an interview Hunter Biden gave to ABC News, in which he said it had been an error in judgment to sit on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while the elder Mr. Biden was vice president. Mr. Trump has accused the Bidens of corruption, often in false or exaggerated terms, and his efforts to enlist the government of Ukraine in tarring Mr. Biden instigated an impeachment inquiry.

“This is about Trump’s corruption,” Mr. Biden said. “That’s what we should be focusing on.”"

As our colleagues Sydney Ember and Jonathan Martin reported, Mr. Sanders’s wife, Jane, his most trusted adviser, has helped shape the campaign’s response.

Republicans are attacking Warren

Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts often tells voters that after she became “visibly pregnant” at the end of her first year as a public-school teacher, the principal wished her luck and hired someone else to replace her.

This week, a conservative news site and other outlets challenged her account, citing a 2007 interview with Ms. Warren and minutes from a school board meeting — and Ms. Warren pushed back in a unique way. Rather than just restating the truth of her account (though she has done that as well), she called on women to share their own stories of pregnancy discrimination, which remains widespread.

The candidates talked L.G.B.T.Q. rights

CNN and the Human Rights Campaign hosted the latest subject-based forum of the presidential race on Thursday, focused on gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender issues. Protesters interrupted the event at several points to call attention to the murders of black transgender women, and the candidates seemed to welcome the reminder.

You can read about the forum here.

Before the event, Ms. Warren, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Kamala Harris of California released plans on L.G.B.T.Q. equality. All three said they would fight to pass the Equality Act and ban conversion therapy as president."

“It’s been the most shameful thing any president has done in modern history in terms of foreign policy,” former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said.

While Democrats have been consumed with the Trump administration’s dealings with Russia and Ukraine, the emerging foreign policy crisis in Syria presented a delicate test for the party’s presidential hopefuls on the debate stage.

Pollsters said on Tuesday that it was too soon to determine or measure the impact of Mr. Sanders’s health issues on voter preferences in the race, but they noted that his admission about his health would create a new challenge for Mr. Sanders, who, at 78, would be the oldest president ever elected by far.

​“This will just raise the issue of his age​, which to me has always been the Achilles’ heel of the Sanders campaign,” said Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which polls public opinion in the key primary state. “When Sanders ran for president in 2016, he was the not-Hillary Clinton candidate and no one paid attention to how old he is. Now, there will be a lot of attention to how old he is, and how old Joe Biden is.”

Mr. Biden is 76, while Ms. Warren is 70. President Trump is 73.

Speaking to reporters outside his home in Burlington Tuesday, Mr. Sanders gave no indication that he was planning to drop out of the race and said he would continue to campaign actively. Indeed, Mr. Sanders remains formidable: He reported a third-quarter fund-raising total of $25.3 million, the largest in the Democratic field, and he has helped steer many in the party to embrace ideas like “Medicare for all” and tuition-free public colleges.

Now, several Democratic presidential candidates are proposing that parents who stay home to care for children be paid, too. It’s a twist on typical family policies — like paid leave, subsidized child care or the right to work part-time — all of which make it easier for parents to have jobs outside the home. Instead, this proposal would make it easier for them not to.

It’s an idea that blurs partisan lines. On the left, there have long been calls to recognize the economic value of unpaid domestic labor by paying for it. At the same time, many on the left fear that paying at-home parents — who are most often women — would reinforce unequal gender roles and set women back in the labor force.

On the right, proponents appreciate that the proposal supports traditional families and allows young children to be home with a parent. Yet many on the right resist the expansion of government benefits, especially without work requirements."

Your political operation takes over the D.N.C. You cannot divorce in any way fund-raising for the presidential campaign and the Democratic Party.”

The donation limits for the D.N.C. are actually far higher than those for direct contributions to campaigns. The D.N.C. can raise money in increments of $355,000; direct donations to a potential Warren general election committee would be limited to $2,800.

Ms. Orthman said Ms. Warren would attend D.N.C. events that are open to the press to “make sure the Democratic National Committee, state and local parties, and Democratic candidates everywhere have the resources” they need. She also said Ms. Warren was “not going to change a thing in how she runs her campaign,” including “no special access or call time with rich donors or big-dollar fund-raisers.”

Ms. Warren headlined a D.N.C. event in August, but she did not meet privately with large donors who attended. She is scheduled for another D.N.C. event next week.

The Warren campaign declined to say whether it would create a joint fund-raising committee with the D.N.C., which is traditionally a big lure for contributors who want to support candidates up and down the ballot. Mr. Trump and his shared committees with the Republican National Committee raised $125 million in the last three months.

Henry R. Munoz III, who stepped down as finance chair of the D.N.C. earlier this year and has co-hosted a fund-raiser for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said Ms. Warren’s proposed arrangement left him confused.

“I don’t even know how that would work,” Mr. Munoz said. Democrats, he added, “have to do everything in their power to work together to create an infrastructure to do battle with the almost unlimited resources that this administration and that party will use to destroy what we believe in.”"

For many young, progressive Americans, democratic socialism is a far better representation of their ambitions of far-reaching structural change across the economy and society than the agenda of the Democratic Party, which they see as overly influenced by corporate interests, big-money donors and moderate traditionalists.

The attempt at Ohio State to define objectives also comes as the Democratic presidential contenders are locked in a battle over what direction the party should take in order to win in 2020. That dynamic will be on display Tuesday night less than 15 miles from O.S.U., when the candidates gather for the fourth primary debate at Otterbein University in Westerville.

Two top candidates, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, have successfully pushed the primary conversation to the left. The D.S.A. saw drastic growth in its membership when Mr. Sanders, himself a democratic socialist, ran for president in 2016, and there are now nearly 60,000 members across the country.

“Send Quid Pro Joe Biden into retirement,” a narrator in the ad intoned.

The video wasn’t released by the Trump campaign, which has produced ads on Facebook with similar accusations in recent weeks. Instead, it was made by an independent political action committee, or super PAC. And it was allowed to run on Facebook with false information, in violation of the social network’s policies on misinformation, the Biden presidential campaign wrote in a letter to Facebook on Thursday.

In the letter, which was viewed by The New York Times, the Biden campaign acknowledged that Facebook had a policy of allowing all political leaders’ speech and ads to remain up because the company considers them to be newsworthy. But the ad by the super PAC was not from a politician, the Biden campaign wrote, so it needed to be rejected.

“This is a most basic test,” Greg Schultz, Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, said in the letter. “The ad contains transparently false allegations, prominently debunked by every major media outlet in the country over recent weeks. It should be rejected.”"

“It’s not lost on people that many of these candidates were actually on the record supporting impeachment before anyone was even talking about Ukraine,” said Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist and former Trump White House official.

The debate, held outside Columbus, Ohio, allowed Republicans to try to make their case in a state that Mr. Trump won by eight percentage points in 2016 and has many of the middle-class, blue-collar voters that he hopes to turn out again in next year’s election. To underscore the point, the Trump campaign took out a full-page ad in the Columbus Dispatch on Tuesday that blared, “Democrats Will Kill Ohio Jobs … President Trump’s Fighting for the Economy.”

The president remains historically unpopular, however. The Gallup presidential approval poll has measured public support for his job performance at below 50 percent for his entire presidency. To overcome this skepticism, Republicans have attempted to define the Democrats as out of touch and too far to the left of where most Americans’ views are. Some of the Democratic candidates, like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., hold moderate and liberal views, while Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont are generally more progressive.

Senator Marco Rubio of Florida on Wednesday expressed the kind of binary argument that Republicans hope prevails on voters. “Last night’s debate was a reminder that while you may not always agree with everything Trump says or does, the leading alternatives to Trump mock people with traditional beliefs & support socialism, gun confiscation & free government funded health care for unlawful immigrants,” he wrote on Twitter.

With Ms. Warren the target of sustained attacks from the other Democrats onstage, Mr. Trump and his Republican allies moved to frame the race around the question of whether voters want a strongly liberal president and government in 2021.

On Tuesday night, after Mr. Sanders picked up the support of two high-profile liberals in the House Democratic caucus — Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar — Republicans jumped at the chance to make them a focal point in the morning-after debate analysis.

Mr. Biden’s campaign has said he scored his best week of fund-raising since the second week of the campaign as Democrats initiated an impeachment inquiry of Mr. Trump over a whistle-blower complaint claiming that Mr. Trump prodded the president of Ukraine to investigate the business dealings there of Mr. Biden’s son Hunter Biden.

Still, some Biden supporters are nervous about how the impeachment process, and any added scrutiny of Hunter Biden’s business affairs, will play out. Some have even discussed creating a super PAC, which the campaign quickly disavowed. Others see in Ms. Warren’s rise as a top rival, with Mr. Sanders in third, an opportunity for Mr. Biden to truly consolidate a donor class that has remained fractured.

Mr. Biden’s ability to attract small donors will be closely scrutinized. In the last 90 days, his campaign ranked 10th among the Democratic presidential candidates for advertising dollars on Facebook, where campaigns often prospect for new contributors. He spent less than one-quarter of what Mr. Buttigieg had spent on the platform in that time, and well less than half of what Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders had spent, according to Facebook data.

Mr. Biden told donors at a sushi restaurant in Los Angeles last week that he had nearly 670,000 donations overall with an average donation of $46, which would translate to only about $10.8 million this quarter. A Biden campaign official said the former vice president had not presented the “full picture” but declined to elaborate.

A Biden campaign official said Tuesday that the former vice president had “unequivocally’’ raised enough money to be competitive in the primary race, and that details would be released soon.

Continuing the fight with Facebook

In a speech on Thursday at Georgetown University, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, argued forcefully against the idea that the social network should be an arbiter of speech, doubling down on a stance that has drawn wide condemnation as the company continues to face accusations of amplifying disinformation.

Ms. Warren renewed that criticism after Mr. Zuckerberg’s speech, saying late Thursday in a tweet: “Facebook is actively helping Trump spread lies and misinformation. Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. They might do it again — and profit off of it.”

The comments continued an increasingly public feud between Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Warren. Earlier this month, Ms. Warren bought a political ad on Facebook that purposefully included the false claim that Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebook backed Mr. Trump’s re-election — and essentially dared the social network to remove it. (Neither Mr. Zuckerberg nor Facebook has endorsed a candidate.)

Mr. Zuckerberg at one point invoked the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to make his point about free speech, which drew a response from one of Dr. King’s daughters, Bernice King. “I’d like to help Facebook better understand the challenges #MLK faced from disinformation campaigns launched by politicians,” she wrote on Twitter. “These campaigns created an atmosphere for his assassination.”"

Thanks to a nearly $25 million fund-raising bounty in the spring, which he topped up with a respectable $19.1 million over the summer, as reported Tuesday, Mr. Buttigieg has been able to invest in a gold-plated ground game in Iowa as he seeks to challenge two candidates who have been organizing for longer here, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders .

“We’re entering the stage where the rubber meets the road,” Mr. Buttigieg said in an interview as his four-day trip wrapped up last week. “ In order to settle the question of electability , the best thing you can do is perform well in an actual election. Iowa’s of course the first. And so that’s where a lot of our focus is going to go.”

Grass-roots organizing is essential to a strong caucus finish. Word of mouth about a candidate is often what turns people out on a cold February night. The Buttigieg campaign, which opened its bus tour to live-tweeting journalists in an effort to set itself apart, is also road-testing a somewhat novel approach to organizing. Its Iowa volunteers first contact friends and family members rather than cold-calling lists of registered voters, who are now so bombarded they ignore unknown numbers."

Let’s start with pessimism: Some people are burned out. In her book “American Resistance: From the Women’s March to the Blue Wave,” Dana Fisher, a professor at the University of Maryland, described how a series of “moral shocks” propelled people who hadn’t thought of themselves as activists to join protests. But after three years of Trumpism, it takes more to shock people than it used to. “People have grown accustomed to a certain baseline level of outrage,” Fisher told me.

But that’s far from the whole story. Fisher surveyed people at the Women’s March and other demonstrations, and then tracked them afterward, doing follow-up surveys six months before the midterms and two days after. “All of their levels of civic engagement went up,” she said.

Many had called elected officials and attended town halls. Now, she says, much of the Resistance is focused on organizing for presidential candidates, particularly Elizabeth Warren. “One of the reasons we’re seeing less protest is that protest is being seen as the beginning of activism and political involvement rather than being the end,” she said.

So if America isn’t seeing the sort of huge demonstrations roiling other countries, it’s at least in part because those most fiercely opposed to Trump still believe in the power of our democracy to get rid of him. “People actually trust the election to sort it out,” said Chenoweth. “This is something that’s common in democracies — when you start to see a protest wave really pick up, a lot of time that mobilization really gets filtered into the next election.”

But the next election is a year away, and American democracy is in danger now. You can’t count on an election to restrain the president when the president is using the power of his office to subvert the election with foreign interference. Each day, it seems, Trump and those around him become increasingly brazen in their lawbreaking."

Oct. 11, 2019

With a crucial debate looming next week in the Democratic presidential primary, the party’s populist wing appears increasingly in control of the race — rising in the polls, stocked with cash and with only a wounded leading candidate, Joseph R. Biden Jr., standing in its way.

Several slow-building trends have converged to upend the race over the last few weeks: Senator Elizabeth Warren’s steady ascent in the polls has accelerated. Both she and Senator Bernie Sanders, a fellow progressive, have raised immense sums of money from small donors online, dominating the Democratic field and each collecting about $10 million more than Mr. Biden in the last quarter. And Mr. Biden’s numbers have gradually slipped in a way that has alarmed his supporters.

The race is far from over: All three of the top candidates — Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders — have a path to victory, and there is still time for longer-shot candidates to make a real run at the nomination. The CNN/New York Times debate in Ohio on Tuesday is likely to test Ms. Warren’s status as an emerging front-runner, subjecting her to new criticism from her fellow Democrats on matters ranging from health care policy to trade and the role of the government in overseeing the economy. Above all, she may need to allay lingering reservations about her appeal to swing voters in the general election."

Teachers in Chicago, the nation’s third-largest school district, are now on strike, and Ms. Warren has offered her support. She has proposed policies that would make it easier for unions to organize teachers and other workers, and easier for employees to strike.

On teacher pay, Ms. Warren’s plan promises new federal funding but does not offer as much detail as a proposal by Senator Kamala Harris of California, which supports an average teacher raise of $13,500 per year, with more money for teachers in low-income schools.

“We have to get a little edgier than just, ‘Pay teachers more,’” said Paul Reville, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and a former Massachusetts secretary of education. He suggested that in addition to a broad anti-poverty agenda, candidates should support a longer school day and year, with afternoon and summer enrichment activities that could help children from low-income families keep up with more affluent peers.

“We have millions of children who are being grossly underprepared for the 21st-century labor market, to say nothing of citizenship in a complex democracy,” he said.

Ms. Warren has steadily gained momentum in the Democratic primary contest, and she now stands as a front-runner alongside Mr. Biden. Last week’s debate, in which she was the target of a barrage of attacks from other candidates, was indicative of her perceived strength in the race.

On the campaign trail, Ms. Warren often tells crowds that she had dreamed of becoming a public-school teacher ever since the second grade, recounting how she lost her job after her first year as a special needs teacher because she became pregnant. She has said she would appoint a former public-school teacher as education secretary and, six months ago, Ms. Warren released a higher education plan that calls for canceling student loan debt and eliminating tuition at public colleges. She has also proposed expanding access to free preschool and capping child care expenses at 7 percent of parents’ income, with free child care for low-income families."

He and his advisers had tried for months to portray the race as a battle between Mr. Sanders and Joseph R.

The top tier of candidates in the field has narrowed faster than his advisers expected, complicating matters: Rather than competing for the nomination with a half dozen candidates, he is essentially battling just two right now — Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren."

Ms. Warren’s surge in the polls has finally reached the point where it has become problematic for Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders. Both men have signaled that attacks could be coming, with Mr. Sanders drawing a pretty sharp contrast over the weekend.

It’s likely that some of those attacks will focus on her health care plan: how she would pay for it, whether she would raise taxes on the middle class, whether she would end private insurance plans and how she would accommodate union health plans.

Will Ms. Warren be ready with more polished answers than she has given in the past?

Whither Mayor Pete?

Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has the most field offices in the early states (tied with Ms. Warren) and a generous campaign bank account (only Mr. Sanders has raised more among Democrats). What he lacks is actual traction in the polls.

So far, most of his debate performances have been characterized by “West Wing”-style monologues. But there are signs he may pivot to a more aggressive tack Tuesday night in hopes of expanding his support. In recent weeks, he has nudged Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders on health care and has been in something of a sniper fight with former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas.

There have been plenty of signs that the two young guns in the race may be headed for a shootout at the Otterbein University Corral. The question is whether that will be enough for either to make a mark.

Does anyone else break out of the pack?

Four candidates on the stage haven’t qualified for the next debate in November: the former housing secretary Julián Castro, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Mr. O’Rourke. Tuesday night is a now-or-never moment for them."
381,James Traub,So what can a Democratic president do to restore liberal norms? The resentment that Mr. Trump has exploited is plainly rooted in decades of middle-class stagnation and rising inequality.

Madison recognized that “the people” can be as tyrannical as a monarch. It is not enough, he wrote in Federalist 51, “to guard the society against the oppression of the rulers”; it is equally necessary “to guard one part of the society against the oppression of the other part.” What we now call a “liberal democracy” is a state where majoritarianism is tempered by a respect for individual rights as well as the rights of political or ethnic minorities.

The opposite of liberalism is not conservatism, as we understand the term in modern America, but populism. The illiberal populism of Donald Trump, Hungary’s Viktor Orban or Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, each of whom was more or less fairly elected, entails the cynical and reckless use of the mechanisms of democracy to disenfranchise political minorities, politicize the state, stigmatize immigrants and other “outsiders,” and diminish civil liberties. Populists address an exclusionary “us.” As Mr. Trump himself once put it with rare clarity, “The only important thing is the unification of the people — because the other people don’t mean anything.” Populism is democracy without liberalism.

We suffer from a confusion of terms, and not only in regard to liberalism. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are routinely referred to as “populists,” including in this newspaper, presumably because they assail the rich. But so did Theodore Roosevelt. In his day, as in ours, the rich vacuumed up almost all the value produced by the economy. Does pointing that out make you a populist? Does denying that claim, or endorsing the virtues of gross inequality, mean that you are not a populist? The thought is absurd. None of the Democratic candidates would talk about, or treat, “the people” as Mr. Trump has done. They are not populists. Are they liberals? Bernie Sanders — who calls himself a socialist, opposes free trade and shows very little regard for the working of the free market — is not. I have my doubts about Elizabeth Warren. But they’re not populists either.

Today, paradoxically, it is not liberals but conservatives who endanger liberalism. The secular, free-market conservatives who voted for Ronald Reagan accepted the basic apparatus of a liberal society. But Mr. Reagan also welcomed into the party extremists and conservative evangelicals who thought about politics in far more absolute terms. Over time, those groups took over the host body of the Republicans, leaving us with an illiberal party that represents half the country. Today’s Republican leaders, with the vehement support of their base, have threatened the autonomy of the federal and state judiciary, treated intelligence and law-enforcement agencies as instruments of the “deep state,” attacked the press and pulled down the empire of science, reason and fact into the mire of “fake news.”

It may be that a combination of the impending impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump and a Democratic victory in 2020 will break the illiberal fever. Certainly any imaginable Democratic victor would put an end to attacks on the government and the press. But it is not, in the end, the formal rules and institutions that sustain liberal democracy. It is the widespread faith in them, what we call “norms.” Forty years of swelling illiberalism on the right — and some reciprocal illiberalism on the left — have deeply corroded that faith."

So I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.”

Many Democratic strategists and officials have warned that the scrutiny on the Biden family has become a significant distraction for the former vice president, and poses perhaps the greatest threat yet to a candidacy that until recent weeks was well ahead in the polls. That makes it all the more urgent for Mr. Biden to land the kind of consistently fluent, forceful debate performance that has so far eluded him at a moment when Senator Elizabeth Warren has now surpassed him in some polls, Democratic operatives and activists said.

“I’m never a distraction to my dad, but as it relates to actually going and being onstage with him — this is not a family business,” Hunter Biden said Tuesday in the ABC interview, which aired on “Good Morning America’’ and was also excerpted online by the network. “Everybody kind of thinks that somehow, whether it’s a compliment that we’re like the Kennedys or whether it’s a, you know, backhanded compliment like you’re the Trumps, my dad has a, a job, but that does not mean that I have had any plans to go do rallies and, you know and, you know, talk about Donald Trump’s kids and I never will, you know, that’s not what Bidens do.”

At a news conference on Sunday, however, his father did appear to take some oblique swipes at the ethical practices of members of the Trump family, some of whom who have conducted their own overseas business dealings. And Hunter Biden seemed to be dismissive of Donald Trump Jr., who along with his father and brother have been highly critical of the Bidens.

“Donald Prince Humperdinck, um, Trump, Jr., is not somebody I really care about,” he said, an apparent reference to a character in the movie “The Princess Bride.”

In the interview, Hunter Biden signaled that by backing away from foreign dealings, he hoped to eliminate the controversy as a campaign issue for his father.

“I’m taking it off the table,” he said. “I’m making that commitment. Let’s see if anybody else makes that commitment. But that’s the commitment that I’m making.”"

He constantly plies this theme, which deserves constant plying. For him it’s clearly more than cant, and has roots in his stint in the military, which throws diverse Americans together, endowing them with a shared purpose.

I’d be a lot more comfortable if there were an additional zero in that population figure, if he had a better record on race, and if there weren’t quite so many elitist mile markers on his journey to this point.

Speaking at a campaign rally hours after Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo brokered a cease-fire, Mr. Trump defended his decision to withdraw American forces from Syria, effectively clearing the way for a brutal Turkish assault on Kurdish fighters who had fought for years alongside the United States against the Islamic State.

The president’s decision to pull out drew rebukes from both Democrats and Republicans, who accused him of abandoning America’s friends. But Mr. Trump said the violence of the past week was useful. “It was unconventional what I did,” he acknowledged. “Sometimes you have to let them fight a little while. Sometimes you have to let them fight like two kids,” he added. “Then you pull them apart.”

WARREN: Sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics. I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry. When I made the decision to run for president, I certainly didn’t think it was going to be about impeachment. But when the Mueller report came out, I read it, all 442 pages. And when I got to the end, I realized that Mueller had shown ... that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly. And so at that moment, I called for opening an impeachment inquiry. Now, that didn’t happen and look what happened as a result. Donald Trump broke the law again in the summer, broke it again this fall.

You know, we took a constitutional oath, and that is that no one is above the law, and that includes the President of the United States. Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences. This is about Donald Trump. But understand, it’s about the next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country. The impeachment must go forward.

If his family intends to shun foreign business in the event that he becomes president — as Hunter Biden said he would on Sunday — voters may wonder why they didn’t do it far sooner, when Mr. Biden was conducting foreign diplomacy as vice president.

Perhaps most of all, anxious Democratic leaders are looking to the former vice president for a sign on the debate stage that all of this is not coming too late in this campaign to make a difference — to quash the undercurrent of doubt among some Democratic strategists, activists, donors a nd voters that Mr. Biden is really ready for a general-election fight against a president prepared to scorch and smear his way to a second term.

“I’m a little worried about how Joe’s going to do if he were to get on a debate stage with the president, a little worried he’d be able to get him rattled,” said Tom Courtney, t he co-chairman of the Des Moines County Democrats in Iowa, a state where the Biden campaign has made substantial investments. “I would like to see him quit getting bogged down in little things.

“Let’s have some real talk,” Ms. Harris said in Reno. “This is not a new conversation for me. This is a conversation that I’ve heard every time I’ve ran a campaign and — here’s the operative word — won.”

In strategic terms, her campaign’s choice to pivot to Iowa is a concession that its initial theory of the presidential race was at least partially incorrect. From the start, her longtime advisers mapped out a national strategy that highlighted primaries with more diverse electorates — such as South Carolina, Nevada and California, her home state — while conserving resources often used in early states for television advertisements in later ones.

It was a risky bet made with California confidence, that they would not only boost a candidate with the potential to make history but also do so without prioritizing Iowa and New Hampshire, a strategy that is unproven on the national stage and a break from Barack Obama’s successful playbook in 2008.

But after the fleeting high of Ms. Harris’s much-talked-about exchange with Mr. Biden over segregation and school busing in the first Democratic debate, it became clear that several assumptions underpinning that national strategy were not in line with the current moment.

Mr. Biden’s support soon bounced back, fueled by perceptions that he was best suited to defeat Mr. Trump, which remains the obsessive top priority for most Democratic voters. Mr. Biden’s strength with black voters has been particularly difficult for Ms. Harris to match, and some of her own supporters from within the Congressional Black Caucus told her privately they felt the debate moment had crossed a line.

Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have also dictated the policy terms of the primary and the debates, pulling Ms. Harris between the dueling worlds of progressives advocating structural change and Mr. Biden’s yesteryear centrism. She prefers neither."

Tad Devine, a veteran Democratic strategist who advised Mr. Sanders’s 2016 campaign but is not working for anyone in the 2020 race, said the lack of cash would limit Mr. Biden’s political options. He pointed to the variety of areas where campaigns might want to invest money: airing television ads, deploying staff on the ground, staging splashy but expensive events and running a robust digital program.

“Your strategic options are limited,” Mr. Devine said, adding that the options available to Mr. Biden’s better-funded rivals were “much bigger.”

“He’s going to have to place the right bet,” Mr. Devine said. “It’s going to have to be a winner. It’s almost like you’re playing roulette, and one guy gets five numbers and the other guy gets one number. Who’s going to win?”

Over the summer, Mr. Biden had already begun to slash his digital spending budget, which was also clear in the new fillings. He spent about $1 million in the first half of the quarter and about $311,000 in the second half, records show.

During the quarter, Mr. Biden also spent $924,000 on a charter jet company, Advanced Aviation Team, as he raced across the country not only for rallies and speeches but also for dozens of fund-raisers on both coasts. Mr. Biden’s campaign said the costs included paying for carbon offsets.

Mr. Biden’s biggest expense is his payroll, which cost about $6.8 million in the past three months, records show. Mr. Biden had roughly 440 people on his payroll — about as many as Mr. Buttigieg — while Ms. Warren had more than 600 and Mr. Sanders had about 550."

Maybe an anniversary-of-publication, maybe an authorial death, maybe a Nobel Prize. I have none of those for this column, but I think my hook is better: I’m writing about “Watership Down” because I’m reading Richard Adams’s 1972 novel to my daughters, and in that reading I’ve decided that the book has real relevance to the crisis of the liberal order in the Western world.

Comes the reply: You mean the book about the … rabbits?

Yes, I do, and that frequency of that reply is another reason for this column. Adams’s novel was a huge best seller in its day, it’s been the basis for an animated movie and a recent Netflix mini-series, and it’s obviously well-regarded and much-loved. But I find that many educated people who pride themselves on being cultural completists (whether that means the whole of Shakespeare or the entirety of Harry Potter) haven’t read the book, and indeed have a mild allergy to the idea: Perhaps because they assume it’s just too childish, too Beatrix Potter or Brambly Hedge, or perhaps because they’ve seen a snatch of one of the adaptations and can’t quite take seriously rabbits arguing with one another in actorly English accents.

To these doubters I offer varying suggestions. The anthropologically inclined can approach the book as a portrait of a lost hominid subspecies, complete with its own mythology and linguistic tics, and gradually accustom themselves to the references to hind legs, ears and burrows. The religious can just approach it as an extended parable. The ecologically minded can come for the very English style of environmentalism, the lyrical depiction of the natural world, the evocation of nature’s harsh harmonies and the dissonant cruelty of humankind.

But really the reader should just come for an exercise in epic storytelling — Odyssean adventure and Aeneidan dramaturgy — that exceeds most modern imitations of the classics. One of the virtues of reading a narrative aloud, to children or indeed to anyone, is the way that vocalizing a story clarifies its power, especially in the quavering passion that you try to keep from your voice (because you don’t want your kids to think their dear dad is too emotional) but that bleeds through in spite of everything. And with a hundred pages to go I can already tell that when I get to the climax of “Watership Down,” I’m going to be a wreck."

A month later he dismissed criticisms of raising middle class taxes to pay for expanded health care, calling it “a distinction without a difference.”

By October, however, Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., had moved toward the center on all three issues . He has a climate-focused TV ad in which he says, “I believe that we need to have a plan that works for all of us.” The border crossings issue, he told CNN last week, is “the kind of stuff that gets us trapped.” And he’s a month into an attack on Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts for not explaining how she’d pay for an overhaul of health care.

For most of his political career, Mr. Buttigieg presented himself as more of a centrist technocrat than a liberal ideologue. But striving for attention in a crowded field, he spent the early part of the 2020 Democratic primary touting an array of aspirational progressive ideas, delivering speeches that could have been ripped from an Aaron Sorkin script.

Now a serious candidate with a policy staff stocked with Washington insiders and a war chest boasting millions from big donors, Mr. Buttigieg has gradually reinvented himself as more of a moderate. While he hasn’t pivoted 180 degrees on policy proposals, he is modulating his positions and drawing explicit and implicit contrasts with his progressive rivals."

Mr. Biden and other candidates will start announcing fund-raising results as early as Tuesday morning for the third quarter of 2019; he came in second for the last quarter, behind Pete Buttigieg, pulling in online money early but mostly relying on big donors.

In this race’s early stages, Ms. Harris showed all the signs of a possible coalition candidate, merging liberals and more moderate minority voters behind the strength of her historic bid to become the country’s first woman of color elected president. On the race’s first day, she raised $1.5 million, and she soon held a kickoff rally in Oakland, Calif., that remains one of the largest events for any candidate, with more than 20,000 people in attendance.

However, as the race has matured, Ms. Harris has been outflanked in money and ideology. Mr. Buttigieg has become the favorite of big money donors, and advisers for Mr. Biden, the race’s most prominent moderate candidate, are now considering a super PAC to supplement his coffers.

On the grass-roots side, progressives have centralized behind their two preferred candidates: Mr. Sanders, who retains many supporters from his previous presidential run, and Ms. Warren, who has grown her fund-raising base as her poll numbers have risen. She has outpaced Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders in recent polls, both nationally and in a few early-voting states.

Ms. Harris’s team is adamant that she remains well-positioned — and adequately funded — to mount a vigorous operation in Iowa. As Mr. Biden’s poll numbers fade, Ms. Harris’s advisers believe her campaign is likely to gain from this and can use a strong initial showing to centralize black voters in later states. Recently, Ms. Harris shook up her senior staff, in a move that was first reported by Politico, and was taken as an acknowledgment of the campaign’s tough road ahead."

Extended drones, chantlike repeating phrases, tolling chords, spacious reverberation: Those are meditative sounds, defying fracture or interruption, tuning out the momentary and the trivial, invoking concentration, absorption, ritual and rapture. It’s the kind of music Nick Cave has chosen for “Ghosteen,” his 17th studio album leading the Bad Seeds.

Cave has been prolific and chameleonic since the early 1980s, when he emerged with the Birthday Party, the Australian post-punk band whose jagged songs introduced Cave’s lifelong fascination with humanity’s extremes: evil and transcendence, desire and violence, perdition and redemption, creation and annihilation. He started the Bad Seeds after the Birthday Party disbanded in 1983; since then he has written books, acted in and scored films (with the Bad Seeds’ longtime musical director, Warren Ellis) and also led a raucously collaborative band, Grinderman. His music never settled into any idiom for long.

“Ghosteen” is an eerie, somber monolith, a set of 11 songs that stretches over an hour and is grouped on two CDs. “The songs on the first album are the children. The songs on the second album are their parents. Ghosteen is a migrating spirit,” Cave wrote.

Throughout “Ghosteen,” the tempos are slow and slower, as songs circle through a handful of chords or hover in place while tension builds. Although the Bad Seeds still have the lineup of a rock band, on “Ghosteen” drums and guitars are almost entirely absent, replaced by the disembodied, sustained tones of synthesizers and string sections — built from Ellis’s violin — behind Cave’s brooding baritone, singing or speaking. Cave foreshadowed the approach with songs on “The Skeleton Tree” in 2016 — “Girl in Amber,” “Magneto” and “Distant Sky” — but those were interludes. This is a whole."

Watching without access to polling data, you might have imagined that this was some sort of wild careening mess of a primary race, when really it’s remarkably consolidated.

There is a Joe Biden constituency that seems stable at around 30 percent of the primary electorate. There is an Elizabeth Warren constituency that has expanded swiftly enough, especially in early states, to make her arguably the front-runner. There is a Bernie Sanders constituency that is about two-thirds the size of Warren’s and Biden’s peak and seemingly stuck there. And then, way down at around 5 percent and under, there is everybody else.

So a big question in this debate and in the ones before Iowa arrives and the also-rans begin to be formally run out is whether Democratic voters can be persuaded to reconsider this consolidation. And last night there were only really two candidates who presented themselves as plausible vehicles for that reconsideration: Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar.

As for the others — well, Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard are too niche, Beto O’Rourke is too limp, Julián Castro is too forgettable and Tom Steyer is too absurd. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker should be contenders, but Booker manages to be appealing at every debate without quite finding a rationale for his candidacy, while Harris has been on a weird self-destruct mission ever since her brief ascent — with her strange fight with Warren last night over whether Twitter should ban Donald Trump a particularly peculiar self-charted nose-dive."

Seven in 10 Democratic voters support mandatory buybacks, according to an August Quinnipiac poll, although less than half of all voters do.

There is a similar lack of consensus among the Democratic candidates on whether to force all gun owners to register their weapons in a national database. Democratic politicians long dismissed the idea of a gun registry as a fear-mongering tactic from the National Rifle Association, but it now enjoys broad support from the public: 62 percent of Americans back the idea, including 85 percent of Democrats.

Most candidates now favor establishing a registry, though some — including Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. — do not. Others, like Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, say it should apply only to owners of assault weapons.

Climate Change









Democratic voters widely believe that climate change represents an international emergency — 84 percent said so in the August Quinnipiac poll — and roughly nine in 10 think the United States is not doing enough to address global warming.

All the major Democratic candidates have expressed support for the Green New Deal, though some have been more guarded than others. All five senators who will debate Tuesday night co-sponsored the bill. Mr. Buttigieg has simply called it “the right beginning,” while Mr. Biden’s campaign website endorses it as a “crucial framework.”

But the Green New Deal enjoys broad support from the American public, with 63 percent of respondents to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll in July saying they like the idea of investing government money to fund sustainable infrastructure projects and green jobs. Among Democrats, it’s a particularly winning concept; 86 percent of Democrats nationwide back the Green New Deal, the poll found."

As a young player, Zeile found the differences disorienting. In time, though, he grew fond of the Montreal’s art and architecture and came to view trips there almost as brief European excursions. But by 2003, when he played for the Expos, the team was splitting its home games with San Juan, Puerto Rico. The Expos ranked last in the N.L. in attendance in each of their final seven seasons, and Zeile said Olympic Stadium sounded hollow, like an echo chamber.

Now the Rays are the team that struggles to draw, and Zeile sees some merit to their idea of eventually splitting home games with Montreal, which M.L.B. has endorsed, at least in concept. But he said it would be hard for a team to win that way.

“It could be interesting from the perspective of trying to get the most out of a franchise that’s not getting full support in one home — but you don’t want to take the risk of having lack of support in two homes,” Zeile said.

“And there’s certainly going to be an opportunity cost when you consider that you’re going to feel like you’re on the road twice as much as you actually are. It’s hard to have two homes during the season and feel like you’re ever really coming home from a road trip.”

For Warren Cromartie, an Expos outfielder and first baseman from 1974 to ’83, the split-season option is more appealing. Cromartie is now the hitting coach for the Yomiuri Giants in Japan, but he has maintained close ties to Montreal, gathering an investment group to bring a team back to the city , which has staged popular spring training exhibitions and is targeting the Yankees for a visit next spring."

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., one of the race’s leading candidates, also once faced questions about his ability to serve in public office because of a serious medical problem. In 1988, as a 45-year-old senator from Delaware , he experienced a near fatal rupture of an aneurysm in an artery in his brain . Shortly after his emergency surgery for the aneurysm, he had a second one removed before it could burst. Because new cerebral aneurysms can develop years later in a tiny percentage of individuals, some experts suggested that Mr. Biden be examined for any new aneurysms when Barack Obama selected him as his running mate. At the time, Mr. Biden’s doctor said that he did not need further testing because he had recovered fully and done well for 20 years.

Mr. Sanders is certainly not the first candidate whose presidential campaign was disrupted by a medical emergency. In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley made an unexpected visit to a hospital in the San Francisco Bay Area for atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm abnormality, which he did not disclose until after the incident. After canceling a few events, Mr. Bradley, now 76, resumed his campaign, but he eventually dropped out of the race after losing the New Hampshire primary. A poll of New Hampshire voters revealed concern about how he had handled the disclosure of his health iss ue .

Still, M r. Sanders’s case is unusual in many respects: He is a leading candidate recovering from a heart attack at age 78 who must compete in an intensely competitive primary while also holding down a demanding job as senator . Indeed, Mr. Sanders’s disruption comes amid increased pressure to bolster voter support with strong challenges from Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, and it is unclear at what pace Mr. Sanders will carry on his campaign.

“Bernie will be scrutinized very carefully in the next month or two for his ability to come back and campaign as vigorously as he has done in the 2016 and current presidential campaigns,” said Ed Rollins, a former adviser to President Ronald Reagan. “He’ll be looked at a little differently” for things like being tired at the end of the day or stumbling in his delivery onstage, Mr. Rollins added.

“I have never known a politician or big moneyed guy or anyone who has had a first heart attack” not consider his mortality, Mr. Rollins added. Also, Mr. Sanders “surely will think about a running mate.”"

There is, I’d argue, an important clue in the “Obama rage” that swept Wall Street circa 2010. Objectively, the Obama administration was very good to the financial industry, even though that industry had just led us into the worst economic crisis since the 1930s. Major financial players were bailed out on lenient terms, and while bankers were subjected to a long-overdue increase in regulation, the new regulations have proved fairly easy for reputable firms to deal with.

Yet financial tycoons were furious with President Barack Obama because they felt disrespected. In truth, Obama’s rhetoric was very mild; all he ever did was suggest that some bankers had behaved badly, which no reasonable person could deny. But with great wealth comes great pettiness; Obama’s gentle rebukes provoked fury — and a huge swing in financial industry political contributions toward Republicans.

The point is that many of the superrich aren’t satisfied with living like kings, which they will continue to do no matter who wins next year’s election. They also expect to be treated like kings, lionized as job creators and heroes of prosperity, and consider any criticism an unforgivable act of lèse-majesté.

And for such people, the prospect of a Warren presidency is a nightmarish threat — not to their wallets, but to their egos. They can try to brush off someone like Bernie Sanders as a rabble-rouser. But when Warren criticizes malefactors of great wealth and proposes reining in their excesses, her evident policy sophistication — has any previous candidate managed to turn wonkiness into a form of charisma? — makes her critique much harder to dismiss.

If Warren is the nominee, then, a significant number of tycoons will indeed go for Trump; better to put democracy at risk than to countenance a challenge to their imperial self-esteem. But will it matter?

Maybe not. These days American presidential elections are so awash in money that both sides can count on having enough resources to saturate the airwaves.

Indeed, over-the-top attacks from the wealthy can sometimes be a political plus. That was certainly the case for F.D.R., who reveled in his plutocratic opposition: “They are unanimous in their hate for me — and I welcome their hatred.”"

Her largely white audience liked the pitch, responding with rapt silence and then with raucous applause when she talked candidly about her own accomplishments.

For years, prospective Democratic nominees came to Iowa to talk ethanol and pork subsidies and saved any rhetoric about the injustice of racial profiling for crowds in South Carolina and Nevada — the only early voting states where black and Latino voters made up a significant portion of the Democratic electorate.

But in the era of Mr. Trump, and after social movements such as Black Lives Matter pushed racial inequality to the forefront of national politics, it’s white Democrats in Iowa and New Hampshire — not black ones in South Carolina — who, to this point, are embracing the candidates who promise to upend society in the name of racial equity.

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has held a commanding lead in national polls with nonwhite Democrats, but surveys show that white liberals in Iowa and New Hampshire are less inclined to support him. At events for Mr. Biden , some white voters cite his confounding September debate answer on the legacy of slavery and previous Senate work with segregationists as reasons to support other candidates.

At events for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind. — two white candidates who have particularly excelled with college-educated liberals — supporters pointed to policies addressing racial inequalities as part of the candidates’ appeal.

These policies may give cover to those seeking to support a white candidate in a historically diverse Democratic field, which includes Ms. Harris, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, and former cabinet secretary Julián Castro — candidates who are themselves racial minorities and who are struggling to gain traction in the polls.

“My daughter is marrying an Asian man and diversity has become very important to me,” said Julie Neff, a 57-year-old Iowa Democrat who attended the Harris rally. Ms. Neff, who is white, said she was embarrassed that she started thinking about race and discrimination only later in life."

Journalists have been badgering Warren to get specific about how much taxes would have to go up to pay for Medicare for all. She has, with considerable justice, insisted that this is a bad way to frame the discussion, since any additional taxes would be offset by savings on the huge premiums workers and their employers now pay for private insurance — on average, more than $20,000 a year for a family plan.

The right question is whether the overall costs facing U.S. families would go up or down. Warren has been claiming that for most families, they would go down, but she hasn’t offered specifics. And this vagueness, which has started to seem like evasiveness, is more of a problem for her than it might be for other politicians. As I said, Warren has made policy seriousness a key aspect of her political persona, so her fogginess on health care really stands out.

The plan in the works will presumably try to dispel that fog, but doing so will be tricky. An independent estimate from the Urban Institute (which is, for what it’s worth, left-leaning) suggests that a highly comprehensive Medicare-for-all plan, similar to what Sanders is proposing, would substantially increase overall health spending, although a more modest plan wouldn’t.

But cost isn’t the only issue — in fact, I’m not sure how important it really is, given that full abolition of private insurance remains unlikely in practice. Also, let’s get real: If Warren gets the Democratic nomination, the outcome of the general election isn’t going to hinge on dueling think tank estimates.

The election might, however, hinge on the support of people who have good private coverage and would be nervous about making a leap into the unknown, no matter how many facts and figures Warren deploys.

So what I’ll want to see is whether Warren gives herself and her party enough flexibility to assuage these concerns. I’m not sure what form that flexibility might take. Maybe something like an extended transition period, with greatly enhanced Obamacare (which might actually be politically doable) in the interim?

Whatever Warren comes up with, this is a crucial moment. There are many excellent things in her overall policy agenda; but she won’t get a chance to do those things unless she can extricate herself from what looks like a health policy trap.

Zuckerberg would take Warren to court over a Facebook breakup plan

In leaked audio conversations with Facebook employees, Mark Zuckerberg can be heard saying he would sue Senator Elizabeth Warren if she moved to break up Facebook, Matt Stevens of the NYT reports.

Ms. Warren has said she would split up big tech companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon if she becomes president.

“If she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,” Mr. Zuckerberg said in recordings from a July internal meeting published by The Verge. “Does that still suck for us? Yeah.”

The recordings pit a leading Democrat candidate for president against a tech giant “at a time when Silicon Valley in general and Facebook in particular continue to be scrutinized for their efforts to combat disinformation and prevent election interference in 2020 and beyond,” Mr. Stevens writes."

Bret: Wavering. A few of my arguments against impeachment no longer look as good to me now as they did two weeks ago. Public sentiment in favor of the inquiry is growing, even among a few Republicans, which makes the impeachment process itself less likely to be a purely partisan process. The evidence of presidential malfeasance is also growing. That’s an argument to let the process continue, see what we learn and keep an open mind. And if the impeachment process really wounds Trump, it might invite a really serious Republican primary challenge.

And I think there’s a potentially winning lane for him if Joe Biden fades as the leading moderate in the race.

Gail: I can definitely imagine Buttigieg being the Democratic nominee down the road — in another four or eight or 12 years. And I think it’s very smart for him to be running, introducing himself to the public and ratcheting up his profile.

Elizabeth Warren “s ticks by her story,” USA Today said. She “stands by account,” NBC News explained and “defends” it, according to The Wall Street Journal. CBS News put it this way: Warren “insists she was fired from a teaching job nearly 50 years ago because she was pregnant. A series of reports have questioned the story she’s been telling on the campaign trail.”

These descriptions all create an impression that Warren’s story is at least questionable and perhaps misleading. But the evidence suggests otherwise. From my reading of the stories, she has been telling the truth all along.

This mini-controversy has instead ended up highlighting problems not with Warren but with media coverage and political discourse. I see at least three:

Balance over accuracy. It is certainly true, as CBS noted, that some people have questioned Warren’s account. A story in the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative publication, did so, as did a writer for Jacobin, a socialist publication. But to say that stories have raised questions is not the same thing as saying the questions are good ones."

Facebook is too powerful

The anti-monopolist spirit that animates Ms. Warren’s policy has found an unlikely vessel in Chris Hughes, who created Facebook with Mr. Zuckerberg when the two were roommates at Harvard. In a nearly 6,000-word Op-Ed for The Times, Mr. Hughes argues that Mr. Zuckerberg, whom he considers a “good, kind person,” simply has more influence over how businesses and people relate than any individual should. (Here are five takeaways from his piece.) “Mark’s power,” he says, “is unprecedented and un-American,” and must be curtailed. He writes:

Facebook has earned the prize of domination. It is worth half a trillion dollars and commands, by my estimate, more than 80 percent of the world’s social networking revenue. It is a powerful monopoly, eclipsing all of its rivals and erasing competition from the social networking category.

Mr. Hughes contends that Facebook’s dominance prohibits would-be entrepreneurs from creating alternative social networks, suffocating innovation and restricting consumer choice. The damage extends to industries beyond tech, including journalism, whose business model was broken by Facebook’s and Google’s capture of digital advertising revenue. In warning about the dangers of Facebook’s monopolistic ambitions, Mr. Hughes cites Tim Wu, a Columbia Law School professor and the author of “The Curse of Bigness,” who told Wired’s editor, Nicholas Thompson:

Mark Zuckerberg wrote an email when he was acquiring Instagram that was disclosed in the New York Post, and it suggests he was buying Instagram because he saw it as a competitive threat. Now, it is a felony under U.S. law to buy companies that you believe are competitive threats to you. … The American way is that we believe in competition and that companies should fight it out, not buy each other when there’s serious competition.

But the most pernicious aspect of Facebook’s hegemony, Mr. Hughes says, is Mr. Zuckerberg’s “unilateral control over speech.” He points as an example to Mr. Zuckerberg’s 2017 decision to stop Facebook Messenger from being used in Myanmar to spread calls for the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims. At the same time, United Nations investigators and human rights groups said that the company didn’t do nearly enough and, in its negligence, actively facilitated what has since been deemed a genocide.

“Mark knows that this is too much power,” Mr. Hughes writes.

Breaking up Facebook isn’t a silver bullet

Breaking up Facebook isn’t enough, as even Mr. Hughes admits, since it won’t address some of society’s greatest grievances with the platform, argues Evelyn Douek in Slate. On the issue of election security, she writes:

If we’re worried about Russia or other foreign powers using Facebook and other social media platforms to influence elections — as Sen. Elizabeth Warren mentions when making her case for breakup — then we also need to acknowledge that these influence campaigns are often sophisticated, cross-platform operations that require well-resourced, expert and coordinated responses. No one has made a good case for how breakup and competition would aid these efforts.

Ms. Douek also agrees with Mr. Hughes that Mr. Zuckerberg’s control over speech is deeply troubling. But she fails to see how increased competition would have helped in Myanmar, where the military purposefully spread violent propaganda. Authoritarianism and ethnic hatred are not problems the market can solve, nor are “the most intractable issues about how to moderate speech on any individual platform.”

User privacy, Shira Ovide argues in Bloomberg, is another issue that breaking apart the Facebook platform from Instagram and WhatsApp wouldn’t fix. She writes:

Does a core Facebook with perhaps 1 billion users have less ability to harvest information such as people’s web-surfing habits and physical locations as they roam around with smartphones? No, it doesn’t.

Both Ms. Douek and Ms. Ovide are open to breaking up Facebook to keep markets competitive, but they see trustbusting as somewhat beside the point of regulation and democratic oversight. They share this perspective with the tech journalist Kara Swisher, who has called in The Times for a national privacy law as well as increased funding for the agencies already charged with regulating the tech sector.

Dipayan Ghosh, a co-director of the Platform Accountability Project at the Harvard Kennedy School, goes one step further, claiming that Facebook should be treated as a public utility, like water and electric companies. He writes in the Harvard Business Review, “Facebook and firms like it have become natural monopolies that necessitate a novel, stringent set of regulations to obstruct their capitalistic overreaches and protect the public against ingrained economic exploitation.”

Facebook is being vilified

Reports of Facebook’s monopoly are exaggerated, writes Bloomberg’s editorial board. Dominance in a market, it says, should not be mistaken for a lack of competition:

As successful as Facebook is, there’s little stopping other companies from doing things better. In fact, they already are: Nearly all of Facebook’s constituent services — messaging, video sharing and so forth — face competition from apps around the world.

Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, has argued that the company faces a great deal of competition from Chinese tech companies, which would benefit from a policy like Ms. Warren’s. “You could break us up, you could break other tech companies up, but you actually don’t address the underlying issues people are concerned about,” she said in May.

What’s more, writes CNBC’s Matt Rosoff, calls to break up Facebook or regulate it like a public utility ignore the fact that it isn’t strictly necessary to modern life as water and electricity are:

Hughes and others have cited historical precedents such as the government’s breakup of Standard Oil and AT&T as a justification for stricter antitrust regulation against tech giants. But these companies not only had clear monopolies with pricing power that hurt consumers, they also offered products that were vital to the economy. … Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp are only three of many ways people can communicate digitally, and while many people spend hours every week using them, they are replaceable and inessential.

In the end, writes Jim Geraghty for National Review, the fault is not in our tech overlords, but in ourselves:"

Paul Krugman is right that a single option version of “Medicare for all” that abolishes existing private health care plans would be politically hazardous. Many of the more than half of the population that is covered by some kind of private health insurance will reflexively not like being told that they will be forced to drop their coverage. Remember how much blowback President Barack Obama received when the media reported that his vow that “ i f you like your health care plan, you can keep it” was not actually true.

Just imagine how many will feel if they are told that they won’t be permitted to keep their health insurance coverage even if they like it. If Senator Elizabeth Warren is indeed so worried about protecting her left flank from Senator Bernie Sanders that she won’t support a less absolutist “public option” plan, then the Democratic Party should choose a different candidate.

Re “Warren Vows to Unveil Single-Payer Specifics” (news article, Oct. 21) and “Favoring Medicare for All, and the Taxes to Pay for It” (news article, Oct. 19):

The media have done a disservice by focusing on raising of taxes to pay for a single-payer health care system rather than focusing on total costs. Currently people pay large sums for health insurance premiums, co-pays, deductibles and prescription drugs. Worse, under the present system, it is estimated that abou t 30 percent of health care costs are for administration, which is double the percentage in Canada.

Under Medicare for all, premiums, co-pays and deductibles would be eliminated. Additionally, the federal government would be able to negotiate drug prices, leading to substantial cost reductions. Taxes will go up, but overall costs to everyone except the very wealthy will go down with a single-payer system. That is, nearly all health care costs will be included in taxes, with minimal other costs for health care."

For Facebook, the situation is tricky. The social media company has struggled in recent years with what to allow and disallow on its site, especially after revelations that Russian operatives used the platform during the 2016 presidential election to post disinformation to inflame the American electorate. Facebook has moved to clamp down on false content. Yet when the company removes or buries messages, ads, photos and videos, it is often called out for bias and censorship. Facebook has faced particular wrath from conservatives, who have said the social network intentionally suppresses what they say.

“Facebook believes political speech should be protected,” a spokesman for Facebook said on Saturday. “If Senator Warren wants to say things she knows to be untrue, we believe Facebook should not be in the position of censoring that speech.”

Truth in social media advertising is likely to become a bigger issue ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Mr. Zuckerberg is scheduled to speak about Facebook’s political speech policies this coming week at Georgetown University.

Presidential candidates have been spending huge sums on ads on Facebook and other social media platforms to reach voters. Some campaigns have focused on advertising specifically on Facebook given its sheer size — it has more than 2.2 billion users worldwide — and the ability to spread ads and content cheaply and quickly across the platform."

Mr. Zuckerberg believes Facebook would prevail. Nevertheless, the situation would “still suck for us,” he said during a leaked closed-door Q&A session with employees published by The Verge.

Few should be surprised that a tech billionaire is concerned about a candidate like Ms. Warren even in an election that’s about 400 days away. For one, Mr. Zuckerberg is a long-term thinker, credited with being among the best at seeing around corners in a fast-moving industry. His firm is one of a handful of tech giants targeted for breakup by Ms. Warren and others who believe the Facebooks, Googles, Amazons and Apples have grown too powerful.

Here’s a sure bet for a 2020 presidential race that will throw plenty of curveballs: Mr. Zuckerberg and his peers running Silicon Valley’s megafirms aren’t the only executives feeling a bit uneasy about a White House potentially occupied by Ms. Warren.

Multiple polls indicate Ms. Warren’s campaign is gaining traction, and that momentum has wealthy donors warning the Democratic Party her nomination would prompt them to leave their wallets in their pockets. Many of those wallets belong to company owners, influential shareholders, top executives and board members.

Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst for Raymond James Financial Inc., told me this week the changing dynamics in the election was a dominant topic in recent days. “I had many more conversations about Elizabeth Warren in the last week than I did about impeachment.”

Mr. Mills was a longtime congressional staffer, working on legislative and regulatory issues that spanned taxes to banking to trade, and spent time as a Senate staffer working on small business and entrepreneurship. He said Ms. Warren’s progressive agenda will hurt health care, financial services and energy.

“We’re all worrying about it,” Rob Parmentier, the CEO of Wisconsin-based Marquis Yachts, told me Friday morning when I asked about Ms. Warren’s campaign. He was headed to a meeting with boat dealers in Florida. Mr. Parmentier operates in an industry hit hard by tariffs resulting from President Trump’s stance with the European Union. He says pain from trade wars pales in comparison to policies held by Ms. Warren that are viewed as anti-business.

Ms. Warren celebrates her track record of holding big companies accountable and pushing for changes that could curb executive pay and corporate profits. She is well known for imposing tight financial rules as chairwoman of the Congressional Oversight Panel following the financial crisis. She is in favor of single-payer health care, wealth taxes and a Green New Deal for energy policy.

Scott Porter, president of Formula Boats (one of Mr. Parmentier’s rivals), said manufacturers have enjoyed a strong economic backdrop during the Trump administration, and the president’s deregulation push has eased the burden of operating a manufacturing company in the Midwest during the past three years.

“I ran this business during the Obama administration,” Mr. Porter said. “We don’t want to go back to anything like that,” referring to certain rules governing businesses. Messrs. Porter and Parmentier expressed concerns about more taxation on customers, which could slow demand for high-dollar boats, and other policies Ms. Warren may pursue that could slow the economy. Both executives are part of a marine association that will work to strengthen support for Mr. Trump by outlining recent gains in employment, consumer spending power and corporate health.

Lori Calvasina, RBC Capital Markets’s head of U.S. equities strategy, said recent jitters in the stock market indicate investors are showing concern about a Warren presidency and its potential impact on markets. “People are starting to wake up to the risk” she said. As shareholders—including major institutional investors—express concern, top executives will be pressed to demonstrate they aren’t asleep at the wheel.

“Businesses can’t just be cloistered,” Neil Malhotra, a Stanford Graduate School of Business professor who has studied the political views of senior executives, said. Even if a CEO holds to primarily liberal views, he or she may need to oppose a Democratic candidate who is viewed as being anti-business.

Analysts, CEOs, former legislators and academics point to Mr. Trump’s time in office as Exhibit A of how much influence the White House can wield in everyday corporate life. Even as Mr. Trump has rolled back regulations that were long seen as harmful to business and cut taxes, he has also pursued immigration and trade changes that put a short-term crimp on profits, hiring and other operations. Many CEOs have been careful to maintain a cordial relationship with Mr. Trump in public and behind closed doors.

“When Trump became president, absolutely everything was in play,” Mr. Mills said. Many companies, including Harley-Davidson Inc., learned the hard lesson of being on the wrong side of the administration’s strategy. Harley executives first cozied up to Mr. Trump shortly after he was elected, but Mr. Trump tweeted negative messages about the motorcycle maker in the summer of 2018 after it said it will be forced to move production of some bikes offshore due to rising tariffs.

Going to battle against Ms. Warren will take an equally delicate touch. When Mr. Zuckerberg’s comments about Ms. Warren started circulating, for instance, she retweeted a montage of television clips where commentators and Peter Thiel, a popular venture capitalist, suggested Corporate America is afraid of her. “I’m Elizabeth Warren and I approved this message,” she posted.

She also went directly after Mr. Zuckerberg, saying “what would really suck is if we don’t fix the corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.” The tweet won nearly 50,000 likes.

“The more that folks in power come out against Warren, the more power she gets,” Mr. Mills said. “When Wall Street mega donors say ‘anybody but her,’ that’s free advertising.”

The current controversy stems from two separate but related events. The first revolves around leaked audio of Mark Zuckerberg speaking privately to employees at recent town hall meetings, where he called Senator Elizabeth Warren’s plans to break up Facebook an “existential” threat to the company and one he would fight. The second is a recent announcement by Facebook that it is exempting political figures from its policy forbidding spreading misinformation in advertisements (yes, politicians spreading false claims in their ads is just a part of the political conversation, according to Facebook).

Both developments have attracted the ire of Warren who, in a series of tweets this week, argued that the public has a right to know how Facebook “intends to use their influence in this election” and implied that Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebook might be intentionally emboldening the Trump campaign by relaxing advertising rules. Fellow Democrats echoed the concerns: Seema Nanda, C.E.O. of the Democratic National Committee, told CNN that the social network’s ad policy “is a serious missed opportunity by Facebook.” At the same time, old fears that the company’s “I Voted” button, which has proved effective at boosting get-out-the-vote efforts, could give an outsize advantage to Mr. Trump are recirculating.

But Ms. Warren’s concerns miss a key point about the social network’s roles in elections.

Yes, Facebook’s willingness to let politicians lie sets a worrying precedent. And yes, lack of oversight into the platform’s decisions opens up a host of plausible election interference conspiracies. But Facebook’s essential threat to democracy isn’t that Mr. Zuckerberg will intervene on behalf of his preferred candidate — it’s more fundamental than that. Mark Zuckerberg need not intervene, because Facebook, the platform, will do so instinctively. With its algorithmic mandate of engagement over all else, Facebook has redefined what it means to be a good candidate — and provided a distinct natural advantage to those who distort the truth and seek to divide.

Few politicians have evidenced this phenomenon better than President Trump, the natural Facebook candidate. He’s light on policy but heavy on the sort of sweeping imagery that translates so easily to memes (some of his memes, like “The Wall,” eventually do become policy). Almost every iteration of his messaging is the type of polarizing content that is candy for Facebook’s algorithms."

Focusing only on taxes is pointless. But in a larger way, she’s wrong.

The No. 1 reason to question her version of Medicare for All — in which private health insurance would be eliminated — is its political viability. It would be an enormous disruption to the health care system, and history shows that health care disruptions are very hard to pass and usually unpopular at first. Polls show that her plan is already unpopular, and it would be a bigger disruption than Obamacare or Bill Clinton’s failed plan.

Given all that, she needs to engage with the political realities — with how she would overcome people’s resistance to giving up their health insurance for a larger new program that, yes, would require a tax increase.

I think Warren has run an excellent campaign on the whole, and I think she has the most thoughtful agenda for addressing the stagnating living standards of most Americans. I’m surprised that she has chosen to focus so much of her candidacy on the most aggressive version of Medicare for All. But she has. Now it’s time for her to tell voters how she will deal with the politics of passing it.

In my view, her best answer involves finding a way to signal her openness to a transition, in which people who want to keep their private insurance can do so (and taxes don’t yet need to rise) while Medicare initially expands voluntarily. That idea is hugely popular."

Eighty percent of white workers said their managers were white, while 38 percent of nonwhite workers had a manager of the same race. The results were based on a subset of 20,400 survey respondents from 81 of the nation’s largest retail and food service companies.

The researchers used a novel technique to find survey takers: They placed ads on Facebook. The full sample is of workers at 120 of the largest retail and food service companies in the United States, industries that employ one-fifth of American workers. It is not a random sample, but they said it is reflective of the retail and food service work force. It is much larger than any other survey of this group of workers and provides more fine-grained data. Social scientists not involved in the research said it was carefully done and convincing.

Two-thirds of workers said they received less than two weeks’ notice of their schedules, and 15 percent had less than 72 hours of notice. Eighty percent said they had little or no input into their schedules. A third said they wanted more hours than they were assigned.

Not knowing when they will work worsens the challenges of people living on a low income, the survey found.

Over all, hourly workers described going hungry, not being able to pay bills, scrambling to arrange child care, losing housing, losing sleep and feeling stressed and unhealthy. But those with unpredictable schedules were twice as likely to report hardships as those with stable schedules — even when they earned the same wages, worked the same number of hours and had the same employers.

Re “Race Takes Turn as Warren Faces Barrage Onstage” (front page, Oct. 16):

After watching all the Democratic debates, I am left with the following sentiments that I believe are shared by many Democrats:

My heart is with Bernie Sanders because what he says about America and what needs to be done is absolutely true. My head is with Elizabeth Warren because she is Bernie lite, a progressive who is more electable than Bernie since she is less scary to suburban Republicans and independents. And my fear puts me with Uncle Joe, because he may be most likely to beat President Trump in the swing Rust Belt states, and the thought of four more years of Trumpism is unspeakable.

But I felt the same way about Hillary Clinton and look how that turned out.

The others do nothing for this 65-year-old longtime Democrat. So how do I vote? I don’t know.

What struck me most about Tuesday night was how articulate all of the candidates were in expressing their positions compared with the muddled thoughts and language we’ve heard from President Trump ever since he appeared on the national stage.

I watched the debate in a venue sponsored by supporters of Pete Buttigieg. He had some good moments. Then I wondered how he would stack up against Mr. Trump one on one: Would Americans appreciate Pete’s depth and calm or rally to re-elect the pompous bully Trump?"

Denise Bauer, a former ambassador to Belgium, said there was an urgency in the air. “We need him to get the nomination because he’s the one who can win,” she said, adding “We are all going to try to raise every single dollar we can.”

Some donors played down the importance of the very currency that had brought them to Philadelphia in the first place for what the campaign called a “finance committee forum,” questioning, for instance, whether Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders had the other political assets needed to seriously challenge Mr. Biden. In a sign of the attendees’ significant financial firepower, Mr. Biden himself addressed the several dozen donors who came to the retreat on Saturday, rallying them for 45 minutes about the months ahead, people there said. The campaign kept the session with Mr. Biden behind closed doors, despite pledging to open his fund-raising events to reporters. The campaign said this event with Mr. Biden’s biggest bundlers was different because no money was actually raised.

On Friday afternoon, the donors received a tour of Mr. Biden’s downtown Philadelphia office before decamping to the second floor of The Continental Mid-town, a retro-style bar a few blocks away where they sported shiny “Joe 2020” pins and sipped from an open bar. On Saturday, there were a series of closed-door briefings, with updates from most of Mr. Biden’s top brass, including his campaign manager, Greg Schultz, and former chief of staff as vice president, Steve Ricchetti, about the run-up to the Iowa caucuses through Super Tuesday, including delegate math and digital tactics, according to attendees, who were asked to keep the proceedings private.

But the challenge facing Ms. Warren, if past primaries are any indication, isn’t those rivals. It is whether she will hit a wall: the rank and file of the Democratic primary electorate.

In primary after primary, the candidates of the party’s left-liberal activists have failed to win the more typical members of the Democratic Party. These voters don’t show up at rallies or post on political Twitter. They are more moderate. They are disproportionately nonwhite; Southern; and less likely to have graduated from college. But in the modern era, they have usually had the votes to decide the nomination. In August, t hey even had the votes to sway an Iowa straw poll to Joe Biden when other candidates attracted far bigger crowds at the same fai r.

To win the nomination, Ms. Warren will need to advance beyond her factional base to a broader coalition.

Discussions of aging have been all-but-inescapable on the campaign trail. Since he entered the race, Mr. Biden has been dogged by questions about his physical fitness and condition — concerns he has tried to alleviate by bounding through parade routes and shaking dozens of hands in steamy summer weather. Mr. Sanders keeps a blistering campaign schedule that often includes multiple events in multiple cities each day. And supporters of Ms. Warren gush about her vitality, bragging about the hundreds of selfies she takes with supporters after each appearance.

“I was just amazed that when you first came out here, Senator Warren, that you ran up those steps the way that you did, and all this energy and stamina that you have,” Nikita L. Jackson, a Rock Hill, S.C., city councilwoman , said as she praised Ms. Warren to a crowd at a town hall event on Saturday.

None of the Democratic candidates have been particularly eager to delve into the details of their health. Aides to Mr. Sanders released a brief statement noting that he “was found to have a blockage in one artery and two stents were successfully inserted,” a fairly common procedure in the United States. Like his rivals, Mr. Sanders has not yet released his medical records, though all three have vowed to do so before the Iowa caucuses in February.

With little actual medical information, even minor irregularities in how candidates appear have prompted a flurry of age-related speculation. When Mr. Sanders hit his head on the edge of a glass shower door, his campaign explained that he had received a cut requiring stitches but stressed that he did not fall. Mr. Biden appeared to be moving his mouth in a strange fashion during the last debate, which led to questions about whether he wore dentures. At Mr. Biden’s campaign events, voters question whether his verbal missteps can be attributed to his age.

At Wednesday night’s rally, Mr. Biden took a swipe at some of his Democratic opponents who had accused him of focusing too much on Mr. Trump and not enough on issues facing voters.

Mr. Biden’s team has been alarmed by reports that Mr. Trump’s supporters plan to launch an aggressive advertising campaign to portray the former vice president as the person who had acted improperly — despite the lack of any evidence to support that claim."

He did so again on Friday when he was asked whether his son’s work in Ukraine represented a conflict of interest. Pointing a finger at the questioner he said: “Let’s focus on the problem. Focus on this man, what he’s doing, that no president has ever done. No president!” The Trump campaign was soon circulating a clip of the episode.

For his allies, it is both poignant and painful that Mr. Biden’s family is again at the heart of his public identity. He lost his first wife and daughter, and nearly lost his two sons, in a car accident in the weeks after he was elected to the Senate in 1972. His final years as vice president, as well as his hopes to run for president in 2016, were overwhelmed by his elder son Beau’s death from brain cancer.

Jim Mowrer, a former Democratic congressional candidate from Iowa who served with Beau Biden in the military, said he spoke to Hunter Biden early this year and got the impression he was trying to focus on personal matters rather than the campaign. Mr. Mowrer said he saw the elder Mr. Biden in Iowa last month and they discussed not Hunter but his other son, Beau.

“Beau’s death is very, very fresh in his mind, and so now these attacks on Hunter are even more unsettling,” Mr. Mowrer said.

A big bet on South Carolina

The politics of Ukraine and impeachment have been so costly for Mr. Biden, in part, because he is confronting so many other challenges in the Democratic race : a struggle to excite liberal primary voters, an ascendant rival in Ms. Warren and a decline in fund-raising that has forced him to spend even more time appealing to donors in cities hundreds of miles from the early primary states.

Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, Greg Schultz, acknowledged some of those problems in a briefing for Democratic donors at Morgan Stanley’s New York office last month. Mr. Schultz assured the group that they had a path to the nomination that depended on winning South Carolina — the fourth primary state — and then scoring big victories in the Super Tuesday primaries in March."
