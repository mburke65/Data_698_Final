She’s run a substantive campaign, and the press loves her gotta-plan-for-everything approach almost as much as her steady rise in the polls.

Joe Biden? The left can’t stand him. The Nation just ran an “anti-endorsement” urging Biden to drop out, saying he’d been “picking up where the Obama administration left off: a restoration of business as usual for the K Street lobbyists and Wall Street speculators.”

MEDIA TRUMPET KENTUCKY VOTE AS TRUMP FAVORITE FACES DEFEAT

But Warren would be the scourge of the big bankers, checks all the progressive boxes and isn’t a white male to boot. No wonder Bill Gates is openly worrying that she’ll soak him for $100 billion.

Sure, the Massachusetts senator is starting to get a tad more scrutiny since she unveiled a $20-trillion plan to pay for Medicare for All, after months of finessing journalists’ questions on the issue. And there was an “SNL” skit with Kate McKinnon portraying her as a know-it-all playing with funny money—not exactly Alec Baldwin territory.

But these have been dwarfed by glowing profiles of her time in Oklahoma, or at Harvard, or even as a bankruptcy lawyer, and how she developed into a fierce consumer advocate.

So why is a founding editor of Politico suggesting the press is giving her short shrift?

The argument John Harris makes in his new column is that reporters talk to downbeat Democrats who are chattering about Warren and “her embrace of mandatory ‘Medicare for All.’ By these lights: The plan is wildly expensive, unrealistic, frightening to moderate voters in key swing states who want to dump Trump but need reassurance before empowering a liberal in the Oval Office.”

After all, how much of an albatross would it be in a fall campaign when more voters learn that Warren would kick 150 million Americans off private insurance in favor of a massive government-run program?

Harris, a former Washington Post reporter, concludes that “the more pervasive force shaping coverage of Washington and elections is what might be thought of as centrist bias, flowing from reporters and sources alike. It is a headwind for Warren, Sanders, the ‘squad’ on Capitol Hill, even for Trump. This bias is marked by an instinctual suspicion of anything suggesting ideological zealotry, an admiration for difference-splitting, a conviction that politics should be a tidier and more rational process than it usually is.”

Harris admits to this bias, and then challenges himself to provide the other side.

Warren, he writes, “is ready to divide the county and her party over the proposition that a much more aggressive role for government is needed to bring business to heel and protect individuals and the global climate from the predations of a free market…Fundamental societal change comes from people burning with grievances, obsessed with remedies, ready to demolish old power arrangements to achieve their ends.”

In other words, it’s risky and aggressive candidates who wind up changing society, such as Trump in 2016, not the wise and seasoned incrementalists. In fact, it’s the media establishment and Beltway mandarins that have brought us such debacles as the Iraq war and 2008 financial meltdown.

Well, maybe. But first you’ve gotta get elected. And Democrats have to decide whether Warren represents their best shot.

Meanwhile, the Washington Post takes some relatively mild criticism of Warren from Biden and Pete Buttigieg to ask whether they are getting into “one of the most fraught areas for a female candidate: Is she likable?”

Buttigieg criticized Warren’s “my way or the highway approach” and said she is “so absorbed in the fighting that it is as though fighting were the purpose.” Biden said she reflects “an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics.”

These are garden-variety jabs in politics. They’re not saying she’s personally angry. They’re saying she’s a rigid ideologue who doesn’t like compromise—just what you’d expect from rivals occupying the moderate lane.

If even policy-based criticism of Elizabeth Warren is ruled suspect, she’ll sail to the nomination, despite the misgivings of the media and political establishment."

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., made a deportation moratorium part of his immigration plan.

The response from Senator Warren, D-Mass., came after a question at a town hall in North Carolina. A woman, who spoke in Spanish, told Warren about her husband, who she says was arrested for drug possession, served his sentence and was then detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). She asked if any moratorium would include those with criminal records.

SANDERS' IMMIGRATION PLAN: HALT DEPORTATIONS, ABOLISH ICE, WELCOME 50K 'CLIMATE MIGRANTS,' GIVE WELFARE TO ALL

“So I am open to suspending deportations, particularly as a way to push Congress for comprehensive immigration reform,” Warren responded. “I believe that what we’re doing right now, with ICE focusing on people who do not pose a threat -- that when ICE comes into our communities, takes our neighbors, our friends, our family members -- that they do not make this country safer.”

Warren said she wants ICE to focus on things like fighting terrorism and tackling the import of drugs such as fentanyl. She also said she opposes the Trump administration’s view, which she summarized as ""anyone who has violated any law means they can’t even be considered to stay.”

She did not say if that moratorium would include any exceptions for those with convictions for violent or other serious crimes.

Warren’s push for a deportation moratorium comes a day after Sanders issued his own sweeping immigration plan, one that would impose a moratorium on deportations, ""break up"" existing immigration enforcement agencies, grant full welfare access to illegals and welcome a minimum of 50,000 “climate migrants” in the first year of a Sanders administration.

According to the plan, President Sanders would stop deportations until there was a full audit of ""current and past practices and policies."" He would also break up Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Matters to do with deportation and enforcement would return to the Department of Justice, customs matters to the Treasury and naturalization and citizenship to the State Department.

Warren was asked if she would break up those agencies, but said only that they need to be “reorganized within the system” and reformed.

WARREN $52T 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' PLAN REVEALED: CAMPAIGN STILL CLAIMS NO MIDDLE-CLASS TAX HIKES NEEDED

“ICE and CBP need to be completely reformed. They should not be spending their resources on things that don't pose a threat to the United States, they should not be spending their resources on scooping up neighbors and friends who pose no real threat,” she told reporters. ""They need to be spending their resources on container shipping, on contraband that comes into this country, on terrorists. Not on people who are here with their families, and trying to live peacefully and make a living among us.”

Sanders' plan also opens up all welfare and government services to include illegal immigrants, promising that his “Medicare-for-all” and “College-for-all” plans would both be available regardless of immigration status.

Warren, who announced her $52 trillion “Medicare-for-all” plan last week, reiterated that that plan would include illegal immigrants.

“Medicare-for-all, as I've put together, covers everyone regardless of immigration status and that's it,” she said.

In particular, she said it would make a lot more sense once those illegal immigrants are on a ""pathway to citizenship"" she has as part of her plan to legalize those in the country illegally.

""If you're on a path to citizenship, we just fixed a big part of deportation, right?"" she said. ""Why wouldn't we want you to have healthcare?""

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has called the level of income and wealth inequality in the United States ""grotesque."" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., frequently calls for a leveling of the economic playing field and rails against a U.S. economy that is, ""doing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top.""

As a solution to this apparent unfairness, Sanders and Warren, two of the top 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, have proposed significant new taxes that they say target the wealthy and large corporations. On Fox Nation's ""Deep Dive,"" Wall Street Journal columnist Mary Anastasia O'Grady and a panel of experts took on ""income inequality"" in America and debated whether or not it justifies the Democrats' proposals.

""[Income inequality] measures don't actually tell you the information you want to know about whether a country is a just country,"" said Ian Vasquez, who is the director of the Cato Institute's Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity.

""The United States by standard inequality measures is just as unequal as the Congo,"" he continued. ""Yet the United States ranks among the best countries in the United Nations' human development indicators. It has the rule of law. It's got a government that works relatively well. There are freedoms here and opportunities here and we're much, much more prosperous. That's not at all the case in Congo.""

In fact, as the Cato Institute notes, the common measurement used to determine income inequality indicates that the U.S., Sweden, and Denmark have similar levels of inequality. But despite that,self-described ""Democratic-socialist"" Sanders has hailed Sweden and Denmark as a model for the U.S.

Phil Magness, a senior research fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research, argued that measurements of Americans' ability to improve their economic circumstances are far better indicators of economic fairness in society than is income inequality.

""The mobility issue is the key statistic that we'd have to look to here,"" he said. ""The Census just released a big study a couple of weeks ago that showed that, yes, the middle class was getting smaller, but it was only getting smaller because people were moving from the middle class into the upper class over time.""

""You think about who are the richest billionaires in America. It's Mark Zuckerberg, who created a company out of his dorm room at Harvard,"" said Magness. ""It's Bill Gates, who created a company basically out of his garage. These are people that are self-made. They started out in a much lower quintile than, you know, a robber baron of the past who inherited his wealth.""

O'Grady asked why Warren and others are harping on the income inequality narrative if it is not a practical measurement.

VARNEY: MEDIA 'PANIC' OVER ELIZABETH WARREN'S 'MAJOR GAFFE THAT CANNOT BE TAKEN BACK'

""The narrative of inequality can be used as a political tool,"" said Roberto Salinas-Leon, who is the director of the Center for Latin America at Atlas Network. ""Basically what you're doing there is you're inflaming rage and you're using visceral narratives rather than constructive narratives or reasoned discourse to try and solve our problems.""

In addition, Magness argued that Sanders and Warren are attempting to hide their true intentions from voters, because their big-government proposals would dramatically raise taxes, as former Obama administration treasury adviser Steven Rattner recently noted in the New York Times.

""Taxes are unpopular. Politicians have not had success historically running on, 'I'm going to raise taxes.' They do try to change the narrative here,"" Magness said. ""This is why inequality becomes kind of this catch-all phrase for a whole litany of other programs.""

""Because someone else is going to be taxed not me, right?"" offered O'Grady.

""Exactly,"" agreed Magness. ""I think the way that they're trying to play it out politically is using the inequality mantra as this catch-all phrase for just a standard litany of traditional progressive left-leaning policies that have failed in the past.""

48% PAYROLL TAX NEEDED TO FUND WARREN'S BIG GOVERNMENT PROPOSALS: TAX EXPERT

""It almost seems like they're these Democratic politicians are marketing a free lunch... As we know, there is no such thing,"" said O'Grady.

""What's ironic about some of these programs, especially the social spending programs like Social Security, Medicare and so on, is that while they reduce income inequality, they apparently, according to a number of studies, increase wealth inequality,"" noted Vasquez. ""Because people have a disincentive... to save. They can count on these government programs unlike the rich and they're also taxed... so it reduces the savings and assets of most people, except the rich.""

Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are locked in a race to the left that could leave either struggling to attract the center in a general election, and former Vice President Joe Biden is facing lingering doubts about his campaign's strength.

The billionaire Bloomberg, despite previously ruling out a run, is expected to file paperwork this week designating himself as a candidate in Alabama’s Democratic presidential primary. In a statement, his political adviser Howard Wolfson said bluntly that Bloomberg was worried the current crop of 2020 hopefuls is not “well positioned” to beat President Trump next November.

BLOOMBERG EXPECTED TO FILE PAPERWORK TO ENTER 2020 ALABAMA DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY

""In 2018 [Bloomberg] spent more than $100 million to help elect Democrats to ensure that Congress began to hold the President accountable,"" Wolfson said. ""And this year he helped Democrats win control of both houses of the Virginia legislature.""

He added: ""We now need to finish the job and ensure that Trump is defeated -- but Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to do that.""

That’s a view shared by a number of Democratic strategists and commentators. While Biden remains near the top of the polls, questions about his age, fitness and fundraising ability have shadowed him, and he has been savaged by the party’s left-flank for his more moderate positions on questions such as health care, immigration and even working with Republicans.

“This is a thunderclap,” Obama strategist David Axelrod tweeted about the Bloomberg news. “And not exactly a vote of confidence from leading moderate in durability of @JoeBiden campaign.”

Trump, meanwhile, predicted that Bloomberg would hurt Biden, and indicated he looked forward to the prospect of a Bloomberg candidacy.

“There’s no one I would rather run against than Little Michael,” Trump told reporters, while also casting doubt on Bloomberg's ability to prevail in the primaries.

It remains unclear whether Bloomberg, running from the center-left, could command the kind of primary support necessary to rise in the packed field, even spending his own fortune to do it.

One possibility, as Trump suggested, is that he'd draw just enough support from Biden to boost a more liberal candidate such as Warren, D-Mass., or Sanders. I-Vt. -- whose big-spending policy prescriptions have also raised alarm about general election viability.

“There’s more anxiety than ever,” Connie Schultz, a journalist who is married to Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, told The New York Times last month. Brown has also been eyed by some Democrats as a possible late entrant to the race.

“We’re both getting the calls. I’ve been surprised by some who’ve called me,” Schultz said.

Last Friday, Warren released her “Medicare-for-all” plan, coming with an eyewatering price tag of $52 trillion (including $20 trillion in new spending over the next decade) and a promise not to raise taxes on the middle class -- a claim met with deep skepticism from across the political spectrum. But centrists were also scathing about how the plan would play out in swing states.

“This is going to cause down-ballot damage in swing districts and states if she’s the nominee,” Colorado State Rep. Bri Buentello told Politico.

Sanders, meanwhile, on Thursday released his immigration plan -- a grab bag of far-left items including a deportation freeze, full welfare access for illegal immigrants, the dismantling of federal immigration agencies, and the promise to accept a minimum of 50,000 “climate migrants” in the first year of a Sanders administration.

While those plans have been cheered by left-wing activists, it is far from clear how well they would go down in swing states any Democrat needs to win in order to beat Trump.

While current national polling suggests most of the main 2020 candidates would beat Trump next year, there are warning signs in the polling data for Democrats -- apart from the general caveat that most polling also showed Trump losing in 2016, and he didn’t.

The swing states generally show a tighter race against Trump. A New York Times/Siena College survey in six battleground states released Friday shows that Democrats there also prefer a more moderate pick. A majority, 55 percent, said they wanted a candidate more moderate than most Democrats, and 62 percent wanted a candidate who would try and find common ground with Republicans.

“With Trump looming, there is genuine concern that the horse many have bet on may be pulling up lame and the horse who has sprinted out front may not be able to win,” Axelrod told the Times last month.

The idea that Bloomberg’s entrance into the 2020 race is a response to the deficiencies of the current field has been greeted by glee by Republicans.

“Really? Another one?"" Republican National Committee Rapid Response Director Steve Guest tweeted. “The fact that Michael Bloomberg feels the need to run for president underscores the weak Democrat field and shows that Democrats know they can’t compete with @realDonaldTrump in 2020.”

There are other signs that Democrats on the sidelines are nervous about the current field. Hillary Clinton has been the subject of a series of rumors that she may throw her hat in the race -- a prospect that seemed unthinkable a year ago. The Washington Post, meanwhile, reported that former Attorney General Eric Holder is considering stepping into the race too.

The consideration of any of these politicians may reflect sheer personal ambition as much as concern about the field -- but the fact they're even flirting with a run at this late stage indicates they see an opening for that reason.

It remains to be seen whether Bloomberg will jump all the way in. The next major deadline he faces is in New Hampshire, where the deadline for candidates to put their name on the ballot is Nov. 11. Bloomberg aides tell Fox News there’s no word yet on whether the former New York City mayor will come to New Hampshire to file. But they add that they'll do ""everything necessary to keep all of our options open.”

Team Bloomberg is also reaching out to top Granite State Democrats. Longtime New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley told Fox News that he’s been contacted. But others have pushed back on the idea that what Democratic voters want is even more candidates to choose from.

Longtime New Hampshire based Democratic consultant James Demers – who’s backing Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey this cycle – said that “anybody and everybody has a right to run if they want to but I’m hearing voters more and more saying ‘I really want this field to winnow down to six or seven so I can process who’s running and they’re not asking for the field to grow.’

“So I think it’s a high-stakes game for anyone to get in this late in the game because that’s not where the voters’ heads are,” he said.

And the former vice president dismissed suggestions that a likely candidacy by the billionaire business mogul and former New York City mayor is a reflection of his own performance as he runs for the White House.

Biden was in New Hampshire on Friday to file to place his name on the first-in-the-nation presidential primary ballot. His appearance came the morning after news that Bloomberg filed his paperwork on Friday – ahead of a deadline – to designate himself as a candidate in Alabama’s Democratic presidential primary.

BLOOMBERG MOVE UNDERSCORES DEMOCRATIC PARTY CONCERN OVER CURRENT 2020 FIELD

Bloomberg -- a former independent who registered last year as a Democrat -- flirted with a presidential bid early this year but in March ruled out a run. His top advisers said on Thursday that he changed his mind because he worried the current crop of 2020 hopefuls were not “well-positioned” to beat President Trump next November.

“I welcome him in the race. Michael's a solid guy and let's see where it goes. I have no problem with him getting in the race,” the former vice president told reporters.

Biden shot down talk that Bloomberg is likely to launch a Democratic nomination bid because Biden’s own campaign is struggling. Some recent polls have suggested the frontrunner is losing ground to rivals like Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.

“In terms of he's running because of me, the last polls I looked at, I'm pretty far ahead,” he emphasized.

And Biden took a shot at reporters, saying, “I know you guys like this fiction about how things have closed down and everything's moving.”

Asked by Fox News if he’s talked with Bloomberg in recent days, the former vice president appeared to confirm the two have had a recent conversation, saying “I've spoken with Michael a lot.”

But he refused to elaborate, saying “it would be inappropriate of me to tell you about any conversations I had or didn't have with him about whether or not he was going to run.”

If Bloomberg launches a campaign, he could quickly spend millions on his own behalf. Biden – who’s long pushed for publicly funded elections and who’s struggled with his fundraising compared to some of his top 2020 rivals – didn’t directly answer when asked if he was concerned.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL RACE

Instead, Biden praised Bloomberg’s contributions to the efforts to curb gun violence and to combat climate change.

Calling him an “honorable guy,” Biden said, “Michael Bloomberg has put a lot of money behind things that causes I care a lot about from dealing with keeping guns off the street and assault weapons, et cetera. He's done a lot for dealing with a whole range of issues.”

The conventional wisdom is Bloomberg – who like Biden is considered more moderate than others in the race - could take votes away from Biden. But longtime New Hampshire Sen. Lou D’Allesandro, a top Granite State Biden supporter, dismissed such concerns.

“Our guy is solid at this point in time,” the state senator stressed.

He said that Democrats in the state weren’t clamoring for another candidate to enter the race, noting they “are very satisfied with the current field of candidates.”

Biden -- accompanied by former four-term Democratic Gov. John Lynch -- passed through a cauldron of supporters packed into the halls of the historic New Hampshire Statehouse as he arrived to file. And after he filed, he headlined a rally with supporters.

While Biden remains at the fore in national polling, he’s slightly behind top-tier rivals Sanders of Vermont and Warren of Massachusetts in the latest New Hampshire survey. The two progressive standard-bearers hail from states seen as New Hampshire neighbors.

Biden emphasized that “it's really important that you do well in the first four states. It could be enough to make you a nominee. It could be enough to keep you in the race. It could be enough to take you out of the race.”

And he stressed that “I plan on trying to win New Hampshire. I'm not here to come in second. I never entered anything to come in second.”

A couple of hours before Biden’s appearance, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang filed to place his name on the primary ballot.

While complimenting Bloomberg, Yang predicted that “I do think that he’s going to have an uphill climb in the race, in part because of New Hampshire, where the people here in New Hampshire love to meet a candidate in person, take their temperature, look into their eyes, sometimes have them in their living room. I don’t think that’s going to be possible with Mike.”

And Yang – who’s campaigned extensively in the state over the past year and a half – emphasized that “there are some things money cannot buy and you can’t replace thousands of conversations in New Hampshire and in the early states with advertising. It’s just not possible. I welcome Mike into the race in the sense that he is a great American leader and has a lot to offer but I think he’s got his work cut out for him”

New Hampshire is the next major deadline Bloomberg faces. The deadline for candidates to file to place their name on the first-in-the nation presidential primary is next Friday, November 11.

Bloomberg aides told Fox News that there’s no word yet on whether the former New York City mayor will come to New Hampshire to file. But they added that they'll do ""everything necessary to keep all of our options open.”

But Bloomberg’s reached out to some top Granite State Democrats. Longtime New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Ray Buckley told Fox News that he received a call from Bloomberg."

The recent announcement of a breakthrough treatment for cystic fibrosis represents but the latest example of American innovation delivering for patients — innovation that a government-run health care system could destroy.

As the mother of a 5-year-old daughter with cystic fibrosis, I recognize the very real challenges she and the other 30,000 Americans with cystic fibrosis face every day: The daily breathing treatments and chest physical therapy to maintain lung function, the numerous oral and inhaled medications, the constant fear of developing respiratory infections, and the grim future of a life expectancy that averages just 44 years.

CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS, DOCTORS CELEBRATE FDA'S 'LIFE-CHANGING' APPROVAL OF NEW TREATMENT

Trikafta, the new treatment recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, targets the genes that cause cystic fibrosis patients to build up mucus in their lungs and organs.

For the 90 percent of cystic fibrosis patients with genes that respond to Trikafta – many of whom previously lacked access to effective therapies – this drug could turn cystic fibrosis into a more readily managed chronic disease.

As a result, many cystic fibrosis patients could now have the promise of an average life expectancy, if not a completely normal life.

As thrilling as Trikafta sounds for my daughter, I worry about whether patients like her would have access to this drug under Democratic proposals for a single-payer health care system.

For instance, Britain’s single-payer system spent the past four years denying patients access to another cystic fibrosis drug, Orkambi. While American patients have accessed Orkambi since 2015, only in the past month did the National Health Service finally allow 5,000 cystic fibrosis British patients to access a drug the government had previously dubbed “unaffordable.”

When Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., finally released details of her single-payer health care plan, a prominent name appeared on the document: Donald Berwick.

Berwick, whom even a Democratic-run Senate would not confirm to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, spent much of his career defending the kind of rationing systems that the British National Health Service used for years to deny cystic fibrosis patients access to Orkambi.

In fact, Berwick, who won a knighthood for his work in Britain’s government-run health system, said that ""the decision is not whether or not we will ration care – the decision is whether we will ration with our eyes open.""

A statement like Berwick’s is frightening and should scare anyone who knows someone with a costly disease.

Trikafta took three decades to develop. Scientists first isolated the genetic defect that causes cystic fibrosis in 1989. Vertex, which developed the treatment, has set a high price tag for Trikafta, at $311,000. But a treatment that can extend life expectancy for cystic fibrosis patients by decades, while also improving the quality of life for my daughter and patients like her, is still worthwhile even at that price.

A government-run health care system could block Americans’ access to treatments like Trikafta – or, worse yet, stifle medical innovation altogether, and discourage companies from creating breakthroughs in the first place.

""We have a fractured American family,"" Sheindlin began, adding she believed that while there are people like Maher who despise President Trump, there are also others who ""adore"" the president. She went on to blast lawmakers on Capitol Hill for their lack of legislating.

""The parties have become so angry with each other that nothing is happening,"" Sheindlin, a 77-year-old retired family court judge, whose popular TV show has been airing for nearly 25 years, observed. ""The American public is paying for a very expensive system -- an executive, a judicial branch of government, and Congress -- and we're not getting anything done.

""I don't see a big-city Jew exciting the vote in Alabama or a lot of the country,"" Maher elaborated. ""The election is going to be decided in six states and they're not named New York. ... We're talking about Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan, Florida.""

… [+2578 chars]",Michael Bloomberg’s top political adviser announced late Friday that the former New York City mayor and billionaire business mogul won’t campaign in the early voting presidential primary and caucus states if he enters the 2020 Democratic race for president.,2019-11-08,Fox News,"Bloomberg won’t campaign in early voting states if he runs for president, aide says",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bloomberg-wont-campaign-in-early-voting-states-if-he-runs-for-president-aide-says,"Michael Bloomberg’s top political adviser announced late Friday that the former New York City mayor and billionaire business mogul won’t campaign in the early voting presidential primary and caucus states if he enters the 2020 Democratic race for president.

""If we run, we are confident we can win in states voting on Super Tuesday and beyond, where we will start on an even footing. But the late timing of our entry means that many candidates already have a big head start in the four early states, where they've spent months and months campaigning and spending money,” Bloomberg adviser Howard Wolfson said in a statement.

BIDEN ON BLOOMBERG: 'I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH HIM GETTING IN THE RACE'

“We have enormous respect for the Democratic primary process and many friends in those states, but our plan is to run a broad-based, national campaign,” he added.

Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina are the first four states to kick off the presidential nominating calendar. They are scheduled to hold their caucuses and primaries in February of next year, ahead of the rest of the country.

Top-tier candidates Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, former Vice President Joe Biden, and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg have built up strong organizations – with plenty of boots on the ground - in the early voting states.

Bloomberg flirted with a presidential bid early this year – including a swing through New Hampshire - but in March ruled out a 2020 White House run. His top advisers said on Thursday that he changed his mind because he worried the current crop of 2020 hopefuls were not “well positioned” to beat President Trump next November.

On Friday, Bloomberg aides filed paperwork in Alabama to designate him as a candidate in that state’s Democratic presidential primary just ahead of the deadline.

Bloomberg aides told Fox News the next primary ballot deadline he faces as he takes concrete steps towards launching a White House bid is Tuesday in Arkansas

But it's all but certain Bloomberg won’t travel to New Hampshire before the November 15 deadline for candidates to place their name on the ballot in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary.

Minutes after Bloomberg’s announcement, New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Ray Buckley responded.

“We are disappointed and frankly very surprised that any candidate would launch a campaign for the White House where their path doesn't run through New Hampshire or any of the other early states,” Buckley wrote.

“New Hampshire and other early state voters are some of the most engaged voters in the country,"" the longtime state party chair added. ""They ask tough questions that prepare the candidates for what's to come in the general election. It's unfortunate that Michael Bloomberg doesn't want to participate in this invaluable, important, and unique primary process and be tested the same way that the other Democratic candidates have been and will be.""

And Iowa Democratic Party chair Troy Price tweeted that ""it's disappointing to hear that Mayor Bloomberg doesn’t plan on competing in Iowa’s first-in-the-nation caucuses or the other three early nominating states.""

Retail campaigning is a crucial compenent of campaign politics in Iowa and New Hampshire, with some voters in both states often meeting and asking qusetions of the candidates multiple times during the course of a presidential primary cycle.

If Bloomberg follows through and officially enters the race, he's expected to spend millions of his own money on his White House bid, lauching TV and digital ads from coast to coast as he likely runs a national campaign.

But Democratic presidential contender Andrew Yang, who's campaigned extensively in Iowa and New Hampshire over the past year and a half, predicted that Bloomberg is ""going to have a uphill climb in the race.""

Speaking to reporters after he filed to place his name on the New Hampshire primary ballot - hours before Bloomberg's announced decision to skip the early voting states - Yang said “there are somethings money cannot buy and you can’t replace thousands of conversations in New Hampshire and in the early states with advertising. It’s just not possible.""

""I welcome Mike into the race in the sense that he is a great American leader and has a lot to offer but I think he’s got his work cut out for him,"" Yang added."

In an interview with PBS News Hour on Friday, Biden said that although he would not reverse President Trump's decision to move the embassy at this point, he said: ""I wouldn't have done it in the first place.""

A person close to Biden's campaign told Fox News on Thursday that Biden's comments are ""not out of synch with the position that he's had"" but rather are a criticism of the way Trump handled the decision, which drew the ire of Palestinians who also stake claim to the land.

BIDEN DROPS TO FOURTH AMONG IOWA DEMOCRATS, NEW POLL SHOWS

""His objection was not to the move but to the way it was done. It should have been made in the context of a larger deal that achieved important concessions for the peace process,"" the source told Fox News.

Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Biden said in a statement to Axios that ""Vice President Biden would not move the American embassy back to Tel Aviv, but he would re-open our consulate in East Jerusalem to engage the Palestinians.""

In 2018, Trump made good on a main campaign promise to appease his conservative and evangelical base by formally recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moving the embassy to the city.

Biden backed numerous pieces of legislation passed by the Senate during his tenure as a representative from Deleware that supported both moving the embassy and recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel-- a law that was waived by Trump's predecessors.

“Joe Biden spent literally decades promising to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, only to fail when he had eight years as vice president to do it. President Trump made a similar promise, but unlike Joe Biden, he actually stuck to his word and got it done,” Trump campaign national press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement to Fox News on Thursday.

During former President Barack Obama's campaign in 2008, Biden said ""it's been my position for years,"" to have Jerusalem recognized as the undivided capital city of Israel.

""Jerusalem must be the capital of Israel. Whatever decision the Israelis make, that's a decision we'll support,” Biden said at the time.

“I think we should move the embassy, but you don't have a [Israeli] government asking us to move the embassy there. Let them make the judgment,” he added.

Biden's flip flop on the issue marks yet another attempt by the candidate to align himself with left-leaning voters by reversing his previously held stances, which has drawn the ire of other Democratic contenders vying for the nomination.

Biden, who has remained in the lead according to most national polls but is neck and neck with two other candidates-- Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.-- came under fire for changing his decades-long position on the Hyde Amendment in June.

His 2020 Democratic rivals criticized Biden's previous support as a senator for the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funds to subsidize abortions except for cases of rape, incest or when a woman's life is endangered -- a notion some of his campaign rivals fear has a disproportionate impact on minority communities.

Biden reversed his stance on the controversial piece of legislation at a campaign rally, saying he ""can no longer support an amendment that makes"" a woman's right to an abortion ""dependent on someone's ZIP code.""

HIPSTERS, HENRY, HOGS AND HOW TO LOSE AN ELECTION

As the weather turns nippy here in our nation’s capital we cannot resist thinking of Bob Hope’s great old line: “It’s so cold in Washington that the politicians actually have their hands in their own pockets.” In order to keep the blood pumping, what do you say to a serving of news nuggets?



- Oh, Michael Bloomberg. The former New York mayor and multi-billionaire is a national political figure in the same way that Brooklyn hipsters are leading a national cultural trend. It seems true if you live in the media universe of the NYT, “Morning Joe” and Vanity Fair think pieces. In what is at least his third flirtation with a presidential run in this cycle alone, Bloomberg is using his wealth to start to secure ballot access for next year’s primaries… Just in case. This was met with huge response across the media spectrum. But our default position remains, “So what?” We’d imagine that Bloomberg would open up in something like sixth place if he did declare. And as Tom Steyer has shown a willingness to burn bales of money hardly guarantees forward momentum. The consultants who have bought second homes stoking Bloomberg’s presidential fantasies are likely the only ones to benefit from this, ahem, bloomlet.



- But what if he really does jump in? If Bloomberg gets any kind of traction the obvious beneficiary is Elizabeth Warren. The bellyaching from old-guard Democrats like David Axelrod about front-runner Joe Biden has helped draw Bloomberg closer to the race. But what do these mandarins think would happen if Bloomberg really got in? He wouldn’t be drawing votes from Warren, that’s for sure. His only path forward would be to cut Biden off at the knees, further splitting the moderate vote. There are no perfect candidates, that’s a fact the Democratic donor class had better figure out if they’re really serious about winning in 2020.



- One of the strategies Republicans are reportedly weighing to deflect criticism of President Trump’s Ukrainian fiasco is to scapegoat three Trump insiders: U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, Rudy Giuliani and White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. The idea would be to say that three had gone rogue and exceeded the president’s desires. Mulvaney, as it turned out, was quite right in the Oct. 17 press conference that was denounced and derided. His stated position – that Trump had leaned on his Ukrainian counterpart about Joe Biden, that aid to the country was conditioned on cooperation, that politics are part of foreign policy and that everybody needed to “get over it” – has become the de facto position of the GOP and administration. It makes sense to torch Giuliani, who has only been bad news for Trump. Sondland is already acting as a free agent. But it seems more than a little dangerous to try to punish the chief of staff just now.



- As Michael Kinsley long ago taught us about Washington: “The scandal isn't what's illegal, the scandal is what's legal.” A great piece in the WSJ today from reporters Thomas Grove and Alan Cullison illustrates one of the slimiest realities of life in Washington. There’s been a great deal of focus on how Hunter Biden cashed in on his father’s influence with wealthy foreigners seeking favorable treatment from the U.S. government. But like many others, Burisma, the Ukrainian firm at the center of the scandal, pumped big money into official Washington through multiple channels. The slop bucket sloshes on think tanks, lobbyists, message mavens and other influence peddlers. It’s all perfectly legal and perfectly putrid. But from Beijing to Riyadh to Moscow to Mexico City, rich and powerful folks know that the hogs will line up at the trough in Washington every time. Oink, oink.



- We were dubious about the near-universal predictions that Jeff Sessions’ effort to reclaim his Alabama Senate seat would run into a buzz saw of opposition from his erstwhile tormenter, President Trump. Sessions’ rivals were quick to blast him for alleged disloyalty to Trump and most coverage focused on how Trump would play in the primary. But given his first opportunity to lace into Sessions in today’s installment of “Chopper Talk” Trump gave Sessions a pass and even praised his former attorney general for – what else – saying nice things about him. It makes perfect sense to us. Sessions endured all the slings and arrows of Trumps abuse without complaint and had only praise for his former boss in his campaign announcement. If Trump gets in the Alabama political swamp he might lose again, as he did backing Luther Strange in 2017, or help disgraced former Judge Roy Moore win the nomination again in a divided field.



- The American Enterprise Institute’s Matthew Continetti is always a must-read for us. Few political writers, left, right or center, can match his combination of gifts of language and perception while maintaining the requisite honest self-appraisal to avoid dogmatism. His analysis of this week’s Virginia election results is perfect proof: “As Virginia has moved into the Democratic column, the state Republican Party has become more populist, more nationalist, and more culturally conservative. The dwindling number of Republicans who spoke the language of suburbia could not escape their party's national reputation for hostility to immigrants and opposition to progressive ideals. A similar process occurred in states like California, Colorado, and Nevada. It may also be underway in Arizona and Texas (!).”



- How about a little shameless self-promotion? You can hear Chris on the most recent installment of Jonah Goldberg’s Remnant podcast. It’s got it all: Cutting edge analysis, cured meat, “Caddyshack” and the dangers of political determinism. Listen here.



- Writing at the NYT Timothy Egan explores the dangers of “insufferable wokeness” for Democrats looking to win converts ahead of the 2020 election. “It’s no mystery why so many Democrats can no longer connect to the white working class. Progressives promise free college, free health care, free child care, and scream in bafflement, What’s wrong with you people? No doubt, some of those people are racist and xenophobic. But many others simply feel insulted and dismissed.” Democrats interested in forging a winning coalition ought to read Egan right after they finish watching Aziz Ansari’s latest comedy special “Right Now.” And if they don’t have time for that, just try the one-minute clip of former President Barack Obama who reminded listeners: “This idea of purity and you’re never compromised and you’re always politically ‘woke’ and all that stuff. You should get over that quickly.” More addition, less division, please.



- Speaking of good things to watch, we loved director David Michôd’s interpretation of William Shakespeare’s “Henry V.” The film, called “The King,” distributed by Netflix and starring Timothée Chalamet, is wonderful in many ways, not the least of which is in rescuing the character John Falstaff from the clammy clutches of venal buffoonery in which so many directors have placed him. But the obvious great omission is one of Shakespeare’s finest speeches: The St. Crispin’s Day speech from Henry before the Battle of Agincourt. There is perhaps no finer, fuller expression of patriotism and the duty of men at arms than the speech. But we know that Chalamet’s take on Hal wouldn’t allow for such heroic orations. And who would want to follow Kenneth Branagh’s unsurpassable performance? So by all means watch “The King,” but maybe also take three minutes to watch Branagh raise the banner – “we few, we happy few, we band of brothers” – to get in the right spirit this Veteran’s Day weekend.



THE RULEBOOK: RULES ARE RULES

“When men, engaged in unjustifiable pursuits, are aware that obstructions may come from a quarter which they cannot control, they will often be restrained by the bare apprehension of opposition, from doing what they would with eagerness rush into, if no such external impediments were to be feared.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 73



TIME OUT: ALLES KLAR, HERR KOMMISSAR?

WSJ: “On the evening of Nov. 9, 1989, an unremarkable East German functionary named Günter Schabowski bungled an assignment – and accidentally helped bring down the Berlin Wall. … At a press conference that was broadcast live … [Schabowski] broached the topic only in the final minutes, after a stultifying, hourlong description of the East German regime’s internal debates. … Then a reporter asked about travel possibilities for East Germans. Schabowski initially answered in soporific fashion, with frequent pauses and ‘uhs.’ But then he mumbled that the party had decided ‘to issue a regulation that will make it possible for every citizen…to emigrate.’ A reporter shouted, ‘When does that go into force?’ The interruption visibly irritated Schabowski, who fumbled with his briefing papers to search for the answer. His aide finally pointed out the relevant page, and Schabowski read the text aloud so rapidly as to be almost incomprehensible… Someone shouted again, ‘When does that go into force?’ Schabowski scanned the unfamiliar text again and picked out some of its words: ‘Immediately…without delay.’ … Caught unprepared, the secret police, border guards and military forces scrambled to reassert their power, but it was too little, too late.”

POLL: BATTLEGROUND DEMS WANT MODERATE NOMINEE

NYT: “Democrats in the country’s most pivotal general election battlegrounds prefer a moderate presidential nominee who would seek common ground with Republicans rather than pursue an ambitious, progressive agenda, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll of primary voters across six states. As the Democratic candidates intensify their argument over how best to defeat President Trump, their core voters in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona and Florida are counseling them to pursue a political middle ground. A majority of those surveyed said they wanted a Democratic nominee who is more moderate than most Democrats, and they overwhelmingly preferred one who would bridge the partisan divide in Washington. The party’s voters are more evenly split on the scale of change they are seeking from their nominee: 49 percent said they preferred a candidate who would return politics in Washington to normal, while 45 percent hope for one who will bring fundamental change to American society.”



Report: Steyer aide offered money for endorsements in Iowa - AP: “A top aide to Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer in Iowa privately offered campaign contributions to local politicians in exchange for endorsing his White House bid, according to multiple people with direct knowledge of the conversations. The overtures from Pat Murphy, a former state House speaker who is serving as a top adviser on Steyer’s Iowa campaign, aren’t illegal — though payments for endorsements would violate campaign finance laws if not disclosed. There’s no evidence that any Iowans accepted the offer or received contributions from Steyer’s campaign as compensation for their backing. But the proposals could revive criticism that the billionaire Steyer is trying to buy his way into the White House. Several state lawmakers and political candidates said they were surprised Steyer’s campaign would think he could purchase their support.”



DEMS DISCUSS OPTIONS FOR ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT

ABC News: “House Democrats have considered drafting as many as three articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, as they prepare to take their Ukraine impeachment inquiry public next week… No decisions have been made, and what happens will ultimately be shaped by the conclusions and findings of the ongoing impeachment inquiry. … Democrats have floated the possibility of charging Trump with abuse of power for efforts to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s family and the 2016 election, as well as obstruction of Congress for the administration’s refusal to comply with subpoenas for records and witness testimony. They have also weighed an obstruction of justice charge centered on the president’s efforts to obstruct former special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. Mueller’s findings in the second volume of his report, focused on obstruction, are repeatedly referenced in the report accompanying their resolution laying out the impeachment inquiry.”



Mulvaney defies subpoena - Fox News: “Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney on Friday defied a subpoena to appear before House committees for a deposition as part of the ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Trump. Mulvaney was called to testify on Friday at 9 a.m., but did not show up. Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., subpoenaed Mulvaney after the White House rejected the original request for him to appear. Schiff, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., and Oversight Committee Acting Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., had wanted to hear from the top White House official, claiming he had ‘substantial first-hand knowledge and information’ relevant to the inquiry.”



Drucker: Republicans see Mark Meadows angling for Mulvaney’s job - WashEx: “There is growing talk on Capitol Hill that Mark Meadows is angling to become the next White House chief of staff amid signs President Trump has been unhappy with the current acting holder of the position, Mick Mulvaney. The conservative Republican congressman in recent days accompanied Trump to New York to attend a mixed martial arts fight and then joined the president a couple of days later for a campaign rally in Lexington, Kentucky — trips and locales with no connection to the Republican congressman’s western North Carolina House district. Meadows, like Trump, was a real estate developer before entering politics and has played a key role in defending the president against impeachment. … ‘Of course that’s what he wants,’ a Republican congressman told the Washington Examiner, requesting anonymity in order to speak candidly. At least one White House aide shares that opinion.”



Judge orders Trump to pay $2 million to charities over foundation misuse -WaPo: “A New York judge on Thursday ordered President Trump to pay $2 million in damages for misusing funds from a tax-exempt charity — taking the charity’s money to pay debts for his for-profit businesses, to boost his 2016 campaign and to buy a painting of himself, according to court documents. That order, from state Judge Saliann Scarpulla, settled a lawsuit filed against Trump last year by the New York attorney general. It marked an extraordinary moment: The president of the United States acknowledged in a court filing that he had failed to follow basic laws about how charities should be governed. Previously, Trump had insisted the charity was run properly and the suit was a partisan sham. ‘Mr. Trump owed fiduciary duties to the Foundation,’ Scarpulla wrote in the order, meaning duties to safeguard the foundation’s money. ‘Mr. Trump breached his fiduciary duty to the Foundation.’”



OUTSIDE GROUPS SWAMP VULNERABLE GOP SENATORS

Politico: “A quartet of new nonprofit groups has already spent millions of dollars hammering four of the most vulnerable Republican senators on the ballot next year, sparking a wave of concern among strategists trying to protect the GOP’s slim three-seat Senate majority in 2020. Outside groups in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and Iowa have already spent or booked over $1 million in each state — and in some cases much more, according to Advertising Analytics — on advertising criticizing the senators, more than doubling the spending from Republican-aligned groups trying to respond. And in one state, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) has faced the onslaught without any backup from Republican allies. … [The U.S. Chamber of Commerce] is partnering with state affiliates to boost Sens. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) with six-figure ad buys amid the spending deluge against them, running positive ads focused on local issues there and in North Carolina, where Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) faces a primary and a general election challenge.”



Pressure grows on Bevin to put up proof or concede - Lexington [Ky.] Herald Leader: “A growing number of Republican lawmakers are urging Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, a fellow Republican, to either provide evidence of the voting ‘irregularities’ he has alleged or concede Tuesday’s election to Gov.-elect Andy Beshear, who defeated him by 5,189 votes. ‘The best thing to do, the right thing to do, is for Governor Bevin to concede the election today so we can move on,’ said Rep. Jason Nemes, R-Louisville. … Bevin bolstered that speculation Wednesday by claiming that thousands of absentee ballots were counted illegally without presenting any proof to back up his claim. Republicans in the legislature aren’t buying it.Nemes said he has not seen much support for an election challenge among his Republican colleagues in the House, largely because the governor has not backed up his claims. None of the lawmakers the Herald-Leader spoke to Thursday said they had seen evidence to support Bevin’s claims.”



GOP candidate in Louisiana’s governor’s race sees fundraising boost - AP: “Republican businessman Eddie Rispone is raking in more campaign cash after becoming the lone GOP contender in the Louisiana governor’s race against Democratic incumbent John Bel Edwards. Rispone, owner of an industrial contracting firm, had largely self-financed his campaign in the primary election as he competed with another Republican, U.S. Rep. Ralph Abraham, for dollars. But that’s changing since Rispone reached the Nov. 16 runoff and the competition between the Republican challenger and the Deep South’s only Democratic governor tightened. Finance reports filed with the state ethics administration office Wednesday night show Rispone raised just under $3 million from donors in the latest period, which began shortly before the primary election and ended Oct. 27.”

THANKSGIVING COULDN’T COME AT A BETTER TIME

News 12 New Jersey: “Wild turkeys are running amok at an over-55 community in Ocean County [N.J.]. Residents say turkeys in a large flock are blocking their doorways, pecking at cars and behaving aggressively. ‘I can't get out of my door,’ says one resident. ‘Sometimes I can't get out of my car. They go to attack you.’ Just in time for Thanksgiving, an aggressive gaggle of 40 to 60 wild turkeys is terrorizing the community in the Holiday City section of town. Residents say that shooing the birds away doesn't help, and that they actually bite. Some say that the turkeys have even broken windows in people's houses. Meanwhile, Toms River says its animal control officers are powerless to stop the turkeys because they are not licensed to trap wildlife. A spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection said that Fish and Game is aware of the situation but did not have further information or comment.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“Of all the great imperial powers, America is probably the least imperially minded. Britain and France, at their height, would have stayed in the Gulf after such an extraordinary military victory to rearrange the map and establish themselves as hegemons. The United States, in contrast, could not wait to get out and go home.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in The New Republic on July 29, 1991.

The recent announcement of a breakthrough treatment for cystic fibrosis represents but the latest example of American innovation delivering for patients — innovation that a government-run health care system could destroy.

As the mother of a 5-year-old daughter with cystic fibrosis, I recognize the very real challenges she and the other 30,000 Americans with cystic fibrosis face every day: The daily breathing treatments and chest physical therapy to maintain lung function, the numerous oral and inhaled medications, the constant fear of developing respiratory infections, and the grim future of a life expectancy that averages just 44 years.

CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS, DOCTORS CELEBRATE FDA'S 'LIFE-CHANGING' APPROVAL OF NEW TREATMENT

Trikafta, the new treatment recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, targets the genes that cause cystic fibrosis patients to build up mucus in their lungs and organs.

For the 90 percent of cystic fibrosis patients with genes that respond to Trikafta – many of whom previously lacked access to effective therapies – this drug could turn cystic fibrosis into a more readily managed chronic disease.

As a result, many cystic fibrosis patients could now have the promise of an average life expectancy, if not a completely normal life.

As thrilling as Trikafta sounds for my daughter, I worry about whether patients like her would have access to this drug under Democratic proposals for a single-payer health care system.

For instance, Britain’s single-payer system spent the past four years denying patients access to another cystic fibrosis drug, Orkambi. While American patients have accessed Orkambi since 2015, only in the past month did the National Health Service finally allow 5,000 cystic fibrosis British patients to access a drug the government had previously dubbed “unaffordable.”

When Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., finally released details of her single-payer health care plan, a prominent name appeared on the document: Donald Berwick.

Berwick, whom even a Democratic-run Senate would not confirm to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, spent much of his career defending the kind of rationing systems that the British National Health Service used for years to deny cystic fibrosis patients access to Orkambi.

In fact, Berwick, who won a knighthood for his work in Britain’s government-run health system, said that ""the decision is not whether or not we will ration care – the decision is whether we will ration with our eyes open.""

A statement like Berwick’s is frightening and should scare anyone who knows someone with a costly disease.

Trikafta took three decades to develop. Scientists first isolated the genetic defect that causes cystic fibrosis in 1989. Vertex, which developed the treatment, has set a high price tag for Trikafta, at $311,000. But a treatment that can extend life expectancy for cystic fibrosis patients by decades, while also improving the quality of life for my daughter and patients like her, is still worthwhile even at that price.

A government-run health care system could block Americans’ access to treatments like Trikafta – or, worse yet, stifle medical innovation altogether, and discourage companies from creating breakthroughs in the first place.

My daughter, and other individuals like her who are fighting for their lives, deserve the best health care that American innovation can provide. Here’s hoping that she never faces the prospect of a government-run health care system that could cut off her access to critically important care."

""We have a fractured American family,"" Sheindlin began, adding she believed that while there are people like Maher who despise President Trump, there are also others who ""adore"" the president. She went on to blast lawmakers on Capitol Hill for their lack of legislating.

""The parties have become so angry with each other that nothing is happening,"" Sheindlin, a 77-year-old retired family court judge, whose popular TV show has been airing for nearly 25 years, observed.

Democrats prepare to go public with their impeachment probe. But will the televised hearings change anything?

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALIF.: Those open hearings will be an opportunity for the American people to evaluate the witnesses for themselves. But also to learn firsthand about the facts of the president's misconduct.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: They've gone out of their way to find the people that hate President Trump the most.

WALLACE: After weeks of closed-door testimony, lawmakers will question witnesses in public about whether the president abused his office to get oppo research from Ukraine.

We'll ask two members of the committee leading inquiry, Republican Will Hurd, a moderate whose actions will be watched closely by other members of his party, and Democrat Sean Patrick Maloney.

Then, former New York City mayor and billionaire businessman, Michael Bloomberg, weighs a late entry into the Democratic race for president.

TRUMP: He's not going to do well but I think he's going to hurt Biden actually. Little Michael will fail.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: And hello again from FOX News in Washington.

The House Democratic effort to impeach President Trump moves into a key new phase this week, public hearings, in which career government officials will testify on camera about how President Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.

The big question: will this change the dynamic of the inquiry that so far has remained strictly partisan?

In a moment, we'll speak with two members of the House Intelligence Committee that will hold the made-for-TV hearings, Republican Will Hurd and Democrat Sean Patrick Maloney.

But, first, let's bring in Ellison Barber, who has the latest from the White House -- Ellison.

ELLISON BARBER, CORRESPONDENT: Chris, one of the first witnesses we expect to hear from this week is a career diplomat who testified behind closed doors. It was his understanding that everything, military aid and an Oval Office visit, was contingent on Ukraine investigating the Bidens in 2016.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

BARBER: The 45th president cheered at the game of the century hours before the start of the week that could turn his political future upside down. Three public hearings are set to take place on two different dates. On Wednesday, the House Intelligence Committee will hear from a top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine and a top State Department official. On Friday, the former ambassador to Ukraine.

House Democrats released their closed door testimonies this week. William Taylor's arguably the most explosive. The career the diplomat testified it was his clear understanding security assistance money would not come until the president of Ukraine committed to pursue the investigations President Trump wanted.

President Trump continues to call the inquiry --

TRUMP: The witch hunt continues --

BARBER: But claims his party is on the same page.

TRUMP: The Republicans have never been so united.

BARBER: Congressional Republicans want to hear from at least 14 witnesses, including former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter and the whistle- blower whose complaint help initiate the impeachment inquiry.

Chairman Adam Schiff responding with a warning: The committee will not serve as vehicles to carry out sham investigations into the Bidens or debunked conspiracies about 2016.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

BARBER: Rules approved by the House essentially give Democrats veto power here. It witnesses must be approved by the chairman of the Intelligence Committee or the full committee -- Chris.

WALLACE: Ellison Barber, reporting from the White House -- Ellison, thank you.

BARBER: You bet.

WALLACE: Joining me now, Congressman Will Hurd, a Republican member of the House Intel Committee that will conduct those public hearings this week.

Congressman Hurd, the top Republican on House Intel, Devin Nunes, says that he would like to call the whistle-blower, the unnamed whistle-blower, to testify in public in these hearings.

And here's what President Trump has to say about the whistle-blower.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: The whistle-blower is a disgrace to our country, a disgrace, and the whistle-blower, because of that, should be revealed.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Now, the whistle-blower reportedly works for the CIA, where you worked for almost a decade.

Should his identity be revealed? Should be he called to testify in public?

REP. WILL HURD, R-TX: I think we should be protecting the identity of the whistle-blower. I've said that from the very beginning, because how we treat this whistle-blower will impact whistle-blowers in the future. Having this whistle-blower law on the books is important. It's an important checks and balance not only in the Intelligence Committee, but our government.

But what I do would like to see happen is for Adam Schiff, Chairman Schiff, the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, to answer questions about what was his engagement with the whistle-blower before the information, his (ph) -- the whistle-blower's allegations were transmitted to the -- to Congress.

He has misled the American public earlier in the year on what he knew about -- or the contact that he had with the whistle-blower. So if you want to protect the identity of the whistle-blower, I think it's important for Chairman Schiff to answer questions about his interactions with them (ph).

WALLACE: What to think about as the Republicans are seeking, calling Hunter Biden, the vice president -- the former vice president's son, as a witness?

HURD: I would love to hear from Hunter Biden, I would love to hear from other Americans that served on the board of Burisma. I'm curious to know of someone who doesn't have any experience in Ukraine nor experience in a natural gas company becomes (ph) on the board of a natural gas company in Ukraine.

You know, this is -- we also need to hear and understand the corruption. We know corruption in the Ukraine is an issue. And Ambassador Taylor has said that in his testimony. Dr. Hill has said that in her testimony. This is something that was a concern even in this current new administration in Ukraine.

So, hearing from people that can help provide insights into that, since that is, you know, central to this conversation would be -- would be valuable.

WALLACE: Now, Congressman Schiff responded last night to the GOP witness list that had been offered by Chairman Nunes and here's what Schiff said: The Intel Committee will not be used, quote, to carry out the same sham investigations into the Bidens and 2016 that the president wanted Ukraine to conduct.

Given that response, Congressman Hurd, what does that say about the fairness of a process that the Democrats are running and holding these hearings?

HURD: Unfortunately, Chris, this has been a partisan exercise from the very beginning. When one piece of information comes, people that don't like the president say, oh, this is an example for impeachment. People that support the president say, this is a -- you know, evidence of an exoneration.

I think we should just turn over every rock and pursue every lead to ultimately get to the truth. And it's unfortunate that the Democrats on the committee and the Democrats in the House have created this partisan exercise.

In a normal hearing, the minority, the folks that are not in power, have the ability to offer a witness. We can't do that in this case.

Under previous impeachment inquiries, the minority and the president has had the opportunity to call witnesses, be involved.

You -- the majority of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and Chairman Schiff has prevented some of the lawyers for the administration to come in and be there with the folks that were -- that were testifying. That's not a fair process.

If we're interested in trying to uncover the truth, then let's not -- let's not put our thumb on the scale. But unfortunately, that's what this process has been and what's even crazier is there trying to have this completed by the end of the year, and I think we only have 16 or 17 legislative days left in the year. Half of those days are what's called ""fly-in, fly-out"" days where people are coming in from their location.

So, to try to get that, try to pass NAFTA, to fund the government -- to try to do all that in that short period of time, I think that's next to impossible.

WALLACE: You -- you talk about the extreme partisanship, maybe on both sides, Republicans and Democrats. You are not -- while you're supportive of the president, you are not a party line supportive. You oppose some of his policies, for instance, constructing the border wall. You've opposed and have spoken out against some of his language during his time in office.

For you, what specifically do you want to learn from these hearings?

HURD: So, I think talk about impeachment has been premature. I think impeachment is one of the most important and consequential things a member of Congress can do. And I think there's 535 different opinions on what impeachment is. To evaluate -- to evaluate that question I think it's a violation of the law.

So, I want to see, does this establish a criminal intent? And yes, for me, I agree when I agree, I disagree when I disagree.

And having spent nine-and-a-half years as an undercover officer in the CIA, I was a guy in the back alleys collecting intelligence. I also did this to embassies. I know how embassies work.

And the fact that Ukrainian officials weren't contacting their U.S. counterparts until August 29th, when they read in -- I believe it was a political article about aid being withheld. That was the first time that any Ukrainian had contacted a State Department or government official about this. That was more than a month after the July 25th phone call between the president and President Zelensky.

WALLACE: So --

(CROSSTALK)

HURD: What do I want to see?

WALLACE: Go ahead, sir.

HURD: Go ahead, Chris.

WALLACE: No, you go ahead.

HURD: What -- what I want to see is their inability to establish criminal intent. Do the Ukrainians know that this -- you know, this was some kind of a quid pro quo?

You know, when you look at our relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine over the last three years, there's been no more aid going to Ukraine this year than -- in this administration than the previous administration. Ukraine is an important partner.

WALLACE: Let me ask you specifically though about this because there seem to be two issues that were part of the quid pro quo. One was military aid. One was the meeting that the Ukrainians very much wanted between their President Zelensky and President Trump.

All three of the witnesses that are going to testify this week -- you see them up there, William Taylor, George Kent, Marie Yovanovitch, all career foreign service officers, said there was a clear connection between support for Ukraine, at various forms of the U.S. support for Ukraine, and Ukraine investigating the Democrats.

If you are satisfied that that is true, that there was this connection, this nexus, is that an impeachable offense?

HURD: Well, I don't know if it was necessarily investigate the Democrats, right? I think it was investigation of corruption. And so, people have made assumption of what is --

WALLACE: Forgive me, sir, but specifically --

HURD: Sure.

WALLACE: -- what President Trump said on that July 25th phone call was investigate the Democratic role in the 2016 election, whether they were involved in hacking the DNC server and also, specifically, the Bidens and Burisma.

HURD: Well, on the 2016 elections -- now, some of that information was based on what has been kind of fringe thinking. But back when even Democrats start investigating the Russian involvement on 2016 elections, there was a Ukraine nexus.

And so, trying to get to the bottom of that, is that a violation of the law? Now, was that an understanding based on debunked information? Yes. But is that a violation of the law? I don't think so.

You mentioned of the Bidens --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: But specifically, sir, the question, is if there was a quid pro quo, U.S. aid for Ukraine was going to depend on their doing these investigations of political rivals of the president. Is that an impeachable offense?

HURD: I think if you're trying to get information on a political rival to use in a political campaign is not something a president or any official should be doing. I think everybody has -- most Republicans have said that that would be a violation of the law.

WALLACE: So, that, in your view, if that were established to your satisfaction, if, I repeat, that would be an impeachable offense?

HURD: I believe that's something that would make it -- make it -- have to truly consider whether impeachment is the right tool or not.

WALLACE: And we will see what happens this week and whether or not it persuades you.

Congressman Hurd, thank you so much. Thanks for your time. Good to talk with you, sir.

HURD: Thank you, Chris.

WALLACE: Up next, we'll get reaction from a Democrat on the Intelligence Committee about what some say is his party's timetable to impeach the president before the end of the year.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: House Republicans have complained for weeks about Democrats interviewing key witnesses in the impeachment probe behind closed doors. Well, now, the public hearings are about to start. The GOP is still complaining.

Let's bring in Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, a Democrat on the Intelligence Committee.

Congressman, as I discussed with Congressman Hurd, Republicans have now put out their written list of witnesses. It includes Hunter Biden, the unnamed whistle-blower, and Nellie Ohr, who folks may remember, she worked for Fusion GPS, which sought information from sources in Ukraine in 2016 and put up the Steele dossier.

Will Democrats agree to call any of these witnesses? And if you don't, what does that say about the fairness of this entire proceeding?

REP. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY, D-N.Y.: Well, I can't speak for the chairman, but what I can tell you is that I think we will end up calling some of the witnesses on that list. And here's my test -- my test is, do these witnesses have important information, knowledge, or evidence about the president's conduct? And if it passes that test, then we should call them, sure.

WALLACE: So, let's ask specifically. Hunter Biden, Nellie Ohr, the unnamed whistle-blower -- do any of them pass that test and therefore should be called?

MALONEY: The first two, no. The third one, you've just heard Congressman Hurd give a very eloquent explanation of why we don't force the revelation of a whistle-blower's identity. So, no in all three cases, but for different reasons.

WALLACE: Well, I mean, let's -- let's focus on Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden is at the center of this. There are allegations of corruption. You know, there certainly are questions why a fellow named Hunter Biden would get a big job in Ukraine when his father was then the vice president and conducting relations with Ukraine.

Isn't that a fair person to talk to?

MALONEY: Well, let me ask you, Mr. Wallace, what information Mr. Biden, Hunter Biden, a private citizen who was broke no laws by serving on the board of directors, would have about the president's withholding of military aid to Ukraine? In other words, he has no knowledge of what the president did or didn't do here, that is the subject of the impeachment inquiry.

There are certainly questions, of course, and many people have asked them, but it's not relevant to this week's hearings.

WALLACE: So, you know, I don't have the list right in front of me, but you obviously saw it. You're a member of the committee. Which member of the Republican potential witnesses would you agree to call?

MALONEY: Again, there are witnesses on the Republican list who have been interviewed in depositions already and, of course, those transcripts are going to be released fully. And so, I would expect the witnesses who have been interviewed, because they have material information, would be likely called in public, but again, those are not --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: For instance, Kurt Volker, who was a special emissary to Ukraine?

MALONEY: Mr. Volker testified for the committee, so did Mr. Morrison. Those witnesses are on the list. Mr. Hale is similarly a witness who's been interviewed, is on the list. Those are the witnesses I have in mind.

But again, this is not my decision. I can't speak for the chairman, but those witnesses do have material information about the president's conduct in this case. That's the proper focus of this inquiry.

And if I could just say, Chris, you know, I hope your viewers will keep an open mind. You know, this is Veterans Day weekend, God bless all who serve and where the country's uniform as my dad did, as my grandfather did.

You know, these are also military veterans. Ambassador Taylor was an infantry officer with 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam, served in combat.

WALLACE: Right.

MALONEY: West Point graduate. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman earned a Purple Heart in Iraq.

These are -- these are veterans and credible witnesses. I hope people will keep an open mind and hear their testimony unfiltered and read the transcript. By all means, they are all coming out in public.

WALLACE: All right. Let's talk about another -- apparently non-witness at this point and that his national security advisor -- former national security advisor John Bolton. Here is what his lawyer wrote this week to the committee: Bolton was involved, according to his lawyer, in many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far.

Continuing the quote: If the House chooses not to pursue through subpoena the testimony of Ambassador Bolton, let the record be clear, that is the House's decision.

Isn't -- Congressman, isn't John Bolton perhaps the best witness other than the president as to what was going on inside the Oval Office? And why on earth wouldn't you wait to see what he has to say?

MALONEY: We have -- we have invited Ambassador Bolton to appear, and that sounds like a nervous lawyer to me, because they are -- they are refusing to honor a legal request to provide relevant testimony.

WALLACE: Wait, wait, wait --

MALONEY: Excuse me --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: Wait a minute. Let me just -- wait a minute. But the point is he has gone to a judge and said, you tell us, I got an order from the White House, I got an order from Congress, you tell me what to do.

MALONEY: Right. Mr. Wallace, that's not how it works. You show up and you respond to a subpoena or you go to a judge and get it quashed, or you show up and you invoke a legitimate privilege and refused to answer a particular question.

It is unprecedented to say, you, Congress, go to a judge and tell me to appear. That's not how it works, and Ambassador Bolton is a better lawyer than that. He knows that personally.

WALLACE: Wait. That isn't what they're doing. They're not saying, Congress, go to the judge. They are going to the judge.

That's what they did with Charles Kupperman, another one of the clients who was an assistant to a deputy to Bolton and Bolton -- they are going to the judge and they're saying, judge, we've got these competing claims, you tell us what to do. They're not asking the House to do anything.

MALONEY: Mr. Wallace, I agree with you that he has important information and we would love to hear from Ambassador Bolton. I think the public deserves to hear from Ambassador Bolton, who remember call this a drug deal and wanted nothing to do with it, who instructed his subordinates to report this conversations to the lawyers at the White House because he knew they were improper.

Ambassador Bolton does have important information. I don't understand why the White House has instructed him not to cooperate. You should ask them.

WALLACE: Yes. I guess what I'm saying is this is an impeachment. This isn't just oversight. This is the potential impeachment of the president of the United States.

There is going to be a court hearing in early December, Charles Kupperman, the deputy to Bolton and Bolton now would be part of that suit.

Why not wait -- we're talking about a month, exactly a month, to find out what a judge says? Why wouldn't, when you're talking about the impeachment of the president, why wouldn't the House Intelligence Committee be willing to wait to find out such key evidence?

MALONEY: Again, we would love to have Mr. Bolton's evidence. There's nothing preventing him from giving it. But remember -- oh, and by the way, any notion that that's going to be favorable to the president I think is debunked by everything in the public domain already.

Ambassador Bolton called this a drug deal. I'm not sure the president will want to hear from Ambassador Bolton, but we sure do.

But here's the point. The point is, do we have sufficient evidence from credible witnesses that we're going to present in public testimony to move forward with an inquiry which may result in a referral to the Senate, where there will be a trial, where witnesses like Ambassador Bolton will have an opportunity again to provide the information they know. I encourage them to do it now, I encourage them to do it then and I don't think it will be favorable to the president. It is Ambassador Bolton who saw clearly how abusive and inappropriate the president's conduct was.

WALLACE: You know, he's not going to be -- testify because you guys have a timetable that you want to get this done by the end of the year.

Let me ask you a couple questions to finish this up. President Trump now says that he is going to release the transcript of a phone call -- not the July 25th a phone call that we've already seen but an earlier phone call in April just after President Zelensky was inaugurated between the two presidents.

What value does not transcript have for your committee and your investigation?

MALONEY: Well, I don't know of any evidence that would be relevant from the first phone call except that it was a routine phone call to congratulate the president. If the president wants to release it, that's fine. I don't think it's relevant to this investigation.

WALLACE: Let's turn to the public hearings this week. You've got three witnesses testifying, we've already seen the transcripts of their interviews. People know what they're going to say.

Is the argument that you're basically -- people are going to read the book but they're going to see the movie? Because that didn't work out very well in the Robert Mueller testimony.

MALONEY: Well, Mr. Wallace, the point is that the Republicans have been demanding for weeks that the public be able to see this testimony. So, you know, they should take yes for an answer. I think it's very important that the public be able to judge for itself.

And I really encourage your viewers to just watch the hearings. Read the transcripts or watch it live and make up your own minds. You won't have any filter. You won't have the press or politicians in the way. You'll have witnesses giving opening statements.

And these are military veterans. These are career nonpartisan civil servants. The first witness, Ambassador Bill Taylor --

(CROSSTALK)

MALONEY: Excuse me, is an appointee of a Republican president who serve this country in the military. I think we should give him a chance.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: Sir, you've already made that point and I would like to get -- I'm running out of time, I'd like to get one last question in if I might.

Here's what President Trump says about all those witnesses. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: The testimony has all been fine. I mean, for the most part, I never even heard of these people. I have no idea who they are. It seems that nobody has any first-hand knowledge, there is no firsthand knowledge.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: The president does have a point. None of these officials actually talked to the president.

When we think back to John Dean with Richard Nixon, he took us into the Oval Office. He told what he told the president and what the president told him.

As the president says, all of the information we're going to hear this week is secondhand. Is that enough to impeach a president?

MALONEY: Well, Mr. Wallace, if you're talking about this week -- but, of course, there witnesses like Ambassador Sondland, who spoke directly to the president. There are other witnesses who have refused to cooperate.

By the way, the State Department has refused to produce all the notes and corroborating evidence, but there are absolutely direct witnesses to the president's phone call. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman was on the call and went immediately to the embassy legal department because he knew it was wrong, what he heard. That's a military veteran.

There are a lot of people with direct knowledge and it's -- honestly, if I can say, it is heartbreaking to hear the president, any American president, deride an important process where reliable witnesses are giving information. It's also heartbreaking to realize once you see this evidence that any American president would engage in misconduct. You know, it gives me no pleasure to tell you the American president has abused his office and he should be accountable.

WALLACE: Well, as you say, people are going to get to see for themselves this week.

Congressman Maloney, thank you, thanks for joining us. And, of course, FOX News will cover the hearings this week live.

MALONEY: Thank you.

WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss whether anything will change now that the public will hear from these witnesses themselves.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: Coming up, Democratic front runner Joe Biden reacts to Michael Bloomberg looking at a run for the White House.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: In terms of he's running because of me, the last polls I looked at, I'm pretty far ahead.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel how a Bloomberg campaign would shake up the Democratic race. That's next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALIF.: Those open hearings will be an opportunity for the American people to evaluate the witnesses for themselves, but also to learn firsthand about the facts of the president's misconduct.

REP. MARK MEADOWS, R-N.C.: As we are more testimony, in fact the testimony that we're hearing today, it's actually getting easier to defend the president.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff and Republican Congressman Mark Meadows setting very different expectations for this week's public impeachment hearings.

And it's time now for our Sunday group. GOP strategist Karl Rove, Mo Elleithee of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service, former Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards, and Senator Mitch McConnell's former chief of staff, Josh Holmes.

Congresswoman Edwards, let me start with you.

What do you expect these public hearings to accomplish? We know what these witnesses are going to say. They -- we -- they -- their opening statements were leaked. Their full hours long transcripts have been -- have been put out there for anybody who's interested to read. They've been widely covered. It doesn't seem to have moved anybody. I mean the Democrats are foursquare in favor of impeachment and there doesn't seem to have been a single vote that's been swayed so far at least by House Republicans in favor of impeachment.

So what's the point?

DONNA EDWARDS, FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN, D-MD: Well, I mean, now it's time for the American people to see the evidence. I mean let's admit it, even -- I've read some of the transcripts but haven't read all of them and I think for the American people to be able to see these witnesses, to know their, you know, their backgrounds and that they are public servants and that they have a sense of duty coming before the committee, and I think that that will be really compelling.

And, you know, maybe it's not about swaying individual members of Congress right now, but it's about making sure that the American people put it out there because Congress are followers, right? They'll follow the public. And I think that it's really important for the American people to hear the lawlessness and the unconstitutional behavior of the president of the United States.

WALLACE: Karl, let's talk about the -- what we're going to hear in terms of the testimony this week. You worked in a White House. We're going to hear from three career foreign service officers. One of them, William Taylor, a military veteran, has served presidents since 1985. Ronald Reagan. They're going to talk about an off the books foreign policy. They're going to talk about an ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, who was smeared and recalled because of comments that were being made, a campaign being run by Rudy Giuliani, allegedly. They're going to hear about a link between U.S. support for Ukraine and Ukraine conducting investigations of the president's political rivals.

Obviously there's another side to the story, but that story, does it bother you?

KARL ROVE, CONTRIBUTOR: Well, as somebody who served in the White House, it does bother me, yes. But, on the other hand, there is constant friction between the State Department and an administration. We saw this during the Iraq War, where we had the people in the State Department leaking against the administration's policy. But, look, that's going to be the sideshow.

The thing that's going to happen when we have this testimony is, is that the Republicans are going to be able to ask questions. Think about where we've been. We have selective leaks of what -- of what these people said, which is done to spin it as much as possible against the president. Then we have their entire transcripts, which most people don't read. Now we're going to have televised hearings in which they're going to be able to say their piece and it's going to have an impact, but there also going to be questioned. And the questioning is going to get to, you know, we have a quid. Military aid and assistance for Ukraine. And we have a quo. And that quo is, investigative the Bidens and any other American involved in corruption. But so far we don't have the pro, the for, that is to say that what we know today is, is that the Ukrainians were never aware of a delay in their aid until they were given the aid and told that it had been delayed. And we never had that grant of the aid predicated upon them making a commitment to investigate Joe Biden.

And we're -- and the failure of the Democrats -- Schiff's statement last night was very problematic because the American people are going to want to hear about Joe Biden and Hunter Biden and Devon Archer (ph) and this stinky situation involving Burisma. And if the Democrats say, we're not going to allow you to have those people called, it's just going to simply add to the impression that this is a partisan witch hunt.

WALLACE: Mo.

MO ELLEITHEE, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS AND PUBLIC SERVICE: Ambassador Sondland did revise his testimony to say he did inform the Ukrainians that the aid would likely be contingent on this. So that's -- that's about where we are on that point.

Look, ultimately, I agree with the congresswoman, that now the American people get to see this stuff. And if you think about this politically and what actually -- you know, based on the very few precedents we have in American history on this, looking back on Richard Nixon, Republicans were with him. Republican voters were with him up until the very end. The day he left, the polling show that about 30 percent of Republicans thought he should be removed from office. But that 30 percent was a significant number because that's what put a lot of pressure on the Republican members of the Senate, when Barry Goldwater finally broke with the president and went to him and said, Mr. President, you know I've been your guy but it's become unsustainable for us. Right now you don't see that kind of breaking from Republican voters.

So the question becomes, do these hearings, as the congresswoman was saying, begin to mobilize and catalyze Republican voters? We know it's doing it for Democrats and we know it's doing it for independent voters.

WALLACE: But here's the question I have, and let me bring in Josh on this, because I understand that, you know, we pay much more attention to the leaks, we pay much more attention to the transcripts than most people do, but they are out there and they have been widely reported. They've been the lead on the evening news. They've been on the front page of the papers. And so far, Josh, it hasn't moved a single Republican vote.

JOSH HOLMES, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: Nor has it moved the Republican primary electorate. I mean I think, Mo, you have a good point there and what ultimately did in Nixon was his party basically beginning to turn on him. If you look at the American people right now, in particular the Republican primary electorate, not only are they not moving away from the president, it's heartening. I mean you've got numbers in 85 plus in terms of their view of this being a quote/unquote witch hunt.

So I -- look, we're a long way away from Republicans moving away from President Trump and embracing an impeachment inquiry. My guess is an open hearing in the House will only serve to exacerbate that. I don't think there's any chance that this is going to come off looking like a fair hearing or something that the president has had basically his say in.

WALLACE: I mean, that is the concern, I mean, that it hasn't moved the needle. And we've gotten a lot of information so far. I don't -- I mean I understand a TV -- well, I don't know if I understand because we -- everybody kept saying, you know, they won't read the book, they'll watch the movie and the Mueller hearing turned out to be a disaster for Democrats, I think we would agree.

So let's assume that this is more effective than Robert Mueller as a -- as a witness. Does it really move the needle? Because it hasn't so far, congresswoman.

EDWARDS: Well, look, this is actually very different kinds of behavior even than what we saw in the Mueller report. I mean we have a president of the United States who withheld aid from an ally who was, you know, on the front lines against our chief adversary. And I think when the American people here that it wasn't -- this isn't about 2016, this is about what is happening right now in 2020 prospectively for the 2020 election. And I think that these witnesses are going to make all the difference.

I mean when you look at a lieutenant colonel, Vindman, for example, you know, he'll be there and he'll be in his dress blues and, you know, fully decorated, raising his hand saying that he's telling the truth.

I defy Republicans to challenge on that. They are not challenging on the substance, they are challenging on process, and that is a loser argument.

WALLACE: All right, you get the final word.

ROVE: Process matters, fairness matters, that's why Nixon went down because the process was fair. This is not fair. They won't allow the -- they've got allowed the president any of the rights granted to President Clinton during his impeachment, or any of the rights granted to President Nixon during his impeachment.

And I love the fact -- I love the fact that the Democrats are now decrying the president's decision not to move aid -- lethal aid rapidly to Ukraine. After all, the previous administration, a Democratic administration, did nothing to send lethal aid to Ukraine and the nonlethal aid they refused to fly into Ukraine on C-130s because they didn't want U.S. military presence in Ukraine. So they drop them off in Poland and citizens had to take that nonlethal aid and put it in the back of their little vehicles and trucks and convey it to Ukraine.

WALLACE: OK.

ROVE: So this president at least had the guts to give the Ukrainians the lethal aid needed to stave off the Russian attempts to subvert that country.

WALLACE: Well, I think this is probably going to end up being a game changer and we're -- it will be a bipartisan game changer.

Panel, we have to take a break here. When we come back, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg looks ready to make a late entry into the 2020 Democratic race. Can he win the nomination?

Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the impact of a Bloomberg candidacy? Just go to FaceBook or Twitter at “Fox News Sunday” and we may use your question on the air.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm a New Yorker and I know a con when I see one.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: There's nobody I'd rather run against the little Michael.

SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Tonight we say to Michael Bloomberg and other billionaires, sorry, you ain't gonna buy this election!

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Well, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg getting pretty strong push back from both President Trump and Democratic Candidate Bernie Sanders on a possible run for the White House.

And we're back now with the panel.

Mo, let me start with you.

Does Michael Bloomberg have a realistic path to the Democratic nomination, and what do you think of what his strategists say if he does get in, and it seems likely will, his plan, skip the first four, skip Iowa, skip New Hampshire, and basically begin your campaign on Super Tuesday in early March?

ELLEITHEE: Yes, look, it's an uphill climb, I would think, for -- for Mayor Bloomberg. And there's no evidence -- we've never seen anyone who has successfully tried to skip the early states and go on to win the nomination. Not at least in the modern era. We've seen candidates who have tried to skip a state, skip Iowa and go straight to New Hampshire, skip New Hampshire and so to South Carolina --

WALLACE: Rudy Giuliani wanted to skip them all and go to Florida. That doesn't work out so well.

ELLEITHEE: Right, it just doesn't -- it doesn't work out so well.

But I think what Bloomberg is hoping here is that he can position himself to be sort of the moderate's last line of defense against the Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders wing of the party. That if Biden stumbles and is falling behind --

WALLACE: And right now he's in fourth place in Iowa and -- and not leading in New Hampshire either.

ELLEITHEE: And that whoever sort of stumbles out of those early states is going to be spent in terms of resources and organization. And those later states, to his credit, are sort of more air war states than they are ground game states. He's got the money to invest heavily in advertising, that he can be the guy who can sort of be the moderates' last line of defense. I think -- I'm a little skeptical that it works, but it is a strategy that, you know, that if Biden stumbles, it looks like he's going to, you know, try to put himself in position to execute.

WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel and on the possibility that Michael Bloomberg will get into this race, we got this on Facebook from Brad Yates. He writes, how does Bloomberg's stance on corporations stand against the current Democrat party's push toward socialism?

Congressman Edwards, how do you answer Brad basically on the -- on the question, is he just way too far to the right for this current Democratic Party?

EDWARDS: Well, I think that -- I mean I think that's a reasonable question but, look, there's no push toward socialism in the Democratic Party. But I do think that there is an understandable concern about income inequality and the -- a Michael Bloomberg candidacy actually puts that front and center. And the question of, are we going to allow 749 billionaires to control all of the wealth of 60 percent, the bottom 60 percent of Americans? And I think that's a legitimate debate for Democrats to have. We've been having that in our -- within our party.

WALLACE: How about the argument that billionaires like Bill Gates, like Michael Bloomberg, create enormous wealth and tremendous job opportunity and that that's actually what kind of feeds the bulldog?

EDWARDS: Absolutely they do and I worked for a corporation early in my career and I think that that is important.

But the question is, how do you pay your fair share to make certain that other Americans can aspire to their highest dreams too? Creating that wealth but also creating other opportunities for other Americans. I think that is a front and center debate of the Democratic Party and I think Michael Bloomberg's candidacy puts it right there in the middle.

And, you know, I'm looking forward to the debate because I think we've been engaged in this conversation for a long time and it's going to be important for any Democrat who wins in the Democratic primary to be able to unite the party. And I'm really not sure that a Michael Bloomberg is a candidate that can come and unite all of the factions of the Democratic Party.

WALLACE: All right, let's turn to the elections that were held this last Tuesday night, which were very interesting, where Democrats took control of the Virginia legislature for the first time in a quarter century and also it appears, although the Republican governor of Kentucky still won't concede, it appears that the Democrats have won the governor's seat in Kentucky.

President Trump talked in Kentucky, campaigning for the Republican governor the night before. Here's what he said.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: You've got to vote, because if you lose, it sends a really bad message. And if you lose, they're going to say, Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: So, Karl, how worried should the president and Republicans be, not so much about those specific results and those specific races, but what you saw and you saw it in 2018 and you saw it again here, the suburbs. The suburbs in Virginia. The suburbs in Kentucky. The suburbs in Pennsylvania, around Philadelphia, this continuing move away from a Republican Party to the Democrats?

ROVE: Yes, and, look, all suburbs are not the same. You mentioned Kentucky. In Kentucky you had a very --

WALLACE: You brought your whiteboard?

ROVE: I brought the whiteboard for the first time appearance on “Fox News Sunday.”

In the governor's race, the Republican got 48.8 percent of the vote. Right below him on the ballot is a fresh first-time candidate, African-American Republican candidate for attorney general, who gets 57.8 percent of the vote and 75,000 votes ahead of the guy above him on the ballot, runs nine points ahead of him. The rest of the ticket for agriculture commissioner, auditor, secretary of state and treasurer --

WALLACE: My goodness, this is Kentucky. It's a pretty red state.

ROVE: I understand. I understand. But the point is, is that in the suburbs, those candidates run 11 to 12 points ahead of the Republican candidate for governor and for the first time in the modern era the Republicans take all those down ballot offices, which says, if you've got good candidates who make an appeal, they can carry the Republican suburbs.

WALLACE: OK.

ROVE: But, warning, negative, southeast Pennsylvania, Montgomery Bucks (ph), Delaware and Chester, Republican strongholds. The Democrats took Delaware County for the first time. The county council is 5-0 Democrat. First time they've had a majority on the county council since the civil war.

And then in Virginia, we've known about northern Virginia fading away from the Republicans. In this election it was the Richmond suburbs of Henrico (ph) and Chesterfields (ph). The Republicans have got a problem in the suburbs and Kentucky says if you right -- run the right kind of campaign and have the right kind of Democrat, you can win. But (INAUDIBLE) a problem.

WALLACE: I want to -- I want to bring Josh in.

There's the continuing fallout from Elizabeth Warren's continuing plans, spending, taxing trillions of dollars. And there was blowback this week from two relatively surprising sources. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BILL GATES, CO-FOUNDER, MICROSOFT: When you say I should pay a hundred billion, OK, then I'm starting to do a little math about what I have left over.

JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, JP MORGAN CHASE: I don't like vilifying anybody. I -- you know, I think we should applaud successful people.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Josh, Bill Gates and Jamie Dimon, who's the CEO of JP Morgan, are certainly rich, but they are not conservatives by any stretch of the imagination. What does that say to you? I mean, obviously, they're two billionaires who are -- I guess Dimon's not a billionaire, but two rich guys. What does that say to you about their problems that Elizabeth Warren will have with her tax and spend policies in a general election?

HOLMES: I think the best sign that Elizabeth Warren has a real problem with sort of your center left Democratic constituency is the fact that we started this segment talking about Michael Bloomberg. I mean Michael Bloomberg said back in February that as long as Joe Biden is in this race and feels like he's got a comfortable hold on the nomination, he's not interested in running. But if the Democratic Party looks like it's auguring towards nominating somebody who's in that sort of left wing, sort of more extreme category --

WALLACE: But we should point out Michael Bloomberg's another billionaire.

HOLMES: Sure. Absolutely.

But here's the -- here's the point. The point is, is that Joe -- this all says a lot more about Joe Biden then it says about anything else. Joe Biden is now in a place where he has lost his hold on the Democratic primary electorate and the Democratic primary electorate is looking for an Elizabeth Warren. That's what -- you know, with all due respect to Bill Gates --

WALLACE: (INAUDIBLE) Elizabeth Warren or --

HOLMES: No, no, with all -- with all due respect to Bill Gates and all the other billionaires who have critiques about where the Democratic Party is, the Democratic primary electorate is saying loud and clear for anybody who will listen, we like Elizabeth Warren. We like Bernie Sanders. We have had five or six candidates try the center rode here and we have run them out of town in this -- in this primary electorate.

ELLEITHEE: You've got Biden and Buttigieg --

EDWARDS: Joe Biden --

ELLEITHEE: Are -- are doing about as well combined as Warren and Sanders are doing combined.

HOLMES: Well, he's -- look, he's lost --

ROVE: One's at seven and one's at 20.

ELLEITHEE: The moderates --

ROVE: And the other two are at 18 and 22.

ELLEITHEE: Not in Iowa. In Iowa those four are clustered very closely together.

Look, in 2018, more center left Democrats won congressional primaries than far left Democrats won congressional primaries with a primary (INAUDIBLE).

HOLMES: But it's not happening in the 2020 cycle. And I've got to tell you, people --

ROVE: There's a lot more far left Democrats won primaries in 2020 than won in 2018 or 2016.

ELLEITHEE: We'll see.

EDWARDS: This hasn't shaken out yet, so -- I mean it hasn't shaken out at all and everything's still (INAUDIBLE).

WALLACE: So the battle continues. Thank you all, panel. See you next Sunday.

Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week,"" the dedication it takes to escort the nation's bravest to their final resting place.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: On this Veterans Day weekend, we want to introduce you to a special military unit whose mission is to pay final tribute to the men and women who have defended our freedom. Here is our ""Power Player of the Week.""

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

CAPTAIN ZACKARY STEELMAN, U.S. ARMY OLD GUARD CAISSON PLATOON: It's our honor to be able to provide them the best ceremony that they deserve and that their families deserve, to just pay it back to them the way that they've paid it to us.

WALLACE: Captain Zackary Steelman is talking about the Old Guard Caisson Platoon that bears the casket for military funerals at Arlington National Cemetery.

Two teams go out, one with white horses, one with black. Each participating in as many as four funerals a day. But the platoon is determined every one will be special.

STEELMAN: That family isn't going to get a second funeral. We have to put as much effort and time into making sure every detail of what we do is the best we can make it.

Do what you've got to do.

WALLACE: A squad is up at 4:30 each morning to make sure it's perfect. The horses are sprayed till they glean. The tack is shined. And so is the caisson that carried a canon back in the First World War.

Then, the horses are hitched up. The lead team that takes the caisson through the cemetery, the swing team that gets around tight corners, and the wheel team that acts as breaks. Then, they call out the mission.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Attention to orders! Zero nine, grant (ph) the 12 alpha, colonel, United States Air Force.

Swing?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ready!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Lead?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ready!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wheel?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ready!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Caisson forward! Out (ph)!

WALLACE (on camera): Why do you have to do all of that?

STEELMAN: Well, it's not that we have to do any of those things, sir, it's really that we get to do those things. We're about to perform a funeral and we're about to perform the mission for that family and we want to make sure that we're doing it to the absolute best ability that we have for them.

WALLACE (voice over): The caisson platoon is part of presidential funerals. A riderless horse named Black Jack was in John Kennedy's procession. When he stepped on his handlers toe, the soldier kept marching.

In 2004, the military honors were for Ronald Reagan. The riderless horse was named Sergeant York, he is still part of the platoon.

STEELMAN: Sergeant York is the oldest horse that we have here in the barn. He's actually 29.

WALLACE (on camera): Twenty-nine?

STEELMAN: Yes, sir.

WALLACE: Reagan used to say that there's nothing as good for the inside of a man as the outside of a horse.

STEELMAN: Yes, sir.

WALLACE: He would have loved this one.

WALLACE (voice over): Captain Steelman signed up for the Army's armor branch. When he joined the caisson platoon, he had never been on a horse. Now he thinks it's as important as any other mission.

WALLACE (on camera): How long do you want to keep being in the caisson platoon.

STEELMAN: If I could, sir, I'd be here for the rest of my life. I absolutely love this job.

I get to see soldiers every single day put in a lot of hard work for someone they really don't even know. I'm honored to be able to bring them to their final resting place. And it's just an honor to be a part of that specific mission.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: Horses in the caisson platoon are put up for adoption after the service is complete. And right now Elvira, a member of the swing team for 16 years, is available. If you want to find out more, please go to our website, foxnewssunday.com.

And before we go, here's a live look at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Our colleagues at Fox NFL Sunday there for a special Veterans Day broadcast as a salute to the troops.

And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next “Fox News Sunday.”

Dimon, who is worth $1.6 billion according to Forbes, spoke with CBS's Lesley Stahl on ""60 Minutes"", where he touched on the causes of the 2008 financial crash, the American economy and cancer survival.

Stahl asked Dimon: ""So Elizabeth Warren said in Iowa the other day, 'Our democracy has been hijacked by the rich and powerful,' and you jumped in and said this week about her that she was 'vilifying successful people and having harsh words for Wall Street bankers.'""

Dimon responded: ""Most people are good, not all of 'em,"" adding, ""I think you should vilify Nazis, but you shouldn't vilify people who worked hard to accomplish things. And so my comment is, I think it's American society – we're just attacking each other all the time.""

Dimon, who has been at the helm of America's biggest bank since 2005, has publicly spatted with Warren about the topic of billionaires, with the CEO saying in the past: ""She uses some pretty harsh words — some would say vilifies successful people. We should applaud successful people.""

In the ""60 Minutes"" interview, which aired on Sunday, Dimon also criticized Trump's tax cuts — despite the policy boosting JPMorgan profits $3.7 billion. JPMorgan has crushed earnings targets this year, with the last quarter results boasting a record level of revenue.

""I would not have cut the tax on the rich. I would've extended the Earned Income Tax Credit instead – which is like a negative income tax credit for lower-paid people,"" said Dimon in the interview.

He added: ""We probably should change the minimum wage, which I don't think has been changed for like 10 or 15 years. There are solutions to these problems. The problems are real. It does not mean Free Enterprise is bad.""

Dimon was also quizzed on his pay by Stahl in the heated exchange below:

Lesley Stahl: ""Let's talk about the wage gap in this country between the rich and almost everybody else. How much of a problem do you see that?""

Jamie Dimon: ""I think it's a huge problem and I think the wealthy have been getting wealthier too much, in many ways. So middle-class incomes have been kinda flat for maybe 15 years or so. And that's not particularly good in America. But in particular, at the low end, 40% of Americans make $15 an hour or less. They've particularly been left behind.""

Lesley Stahl: ""You're talking about people who earn very little money. Listen to this statistic. Compensation for executives, CEOs, grew 940%, 940%, in the last 40 years. Your average worker, so middle class, middle class, grew 12%.""

Jamie Dimon: ""We haven't done a good job growing our economy. And that would fix a lot of that problem.""

Lesley Stahl: ""Executive pay: Last year you were paid $31 million. Too high?""

Jamie Dimon: ""The board sets mine. I have nothing to do with it.""

Lesley Stahl: ""Well, you could return some of it.""

Jamie Dimon: ""I could. Is that gonna solve any of those problems?""

Lesley Stahl: ""I don't know.""

Jamie Dimon: ""Is it going to solve any of those problems?""

Lesley Stahl: ""No but you could set an example and say, ""I'm not going to take all that money. I don't need it.""

Jamie Dimon: ""I could. I'm going to leave it to the board to set my comp. Not you, not the press--""

Lesley Stahl: ""You've answered every one of my questions but this one you're fobbing off.'

Jamie Dimon: ""Yeah, the board has to do it.""

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.): “You have said that there’s already enough evidence for President Trump to be impeached and removed from office. But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate?”

In a new interview with CBS News’ Norah O’Donnell, former Ambassador Nikki Haley, made a related argument:

“I think the biggest thing that bothers me is the American people should decide this. Why [do] we have a bunch of people in Congress making this decision?”

Those familiar with American Civics 101 probably realize the reason “a bunch of people in Congress” are working on an impeachment inquiry is because that’s how the process is supposed to work under the U.S. Constitution. What’s more, we have “a bunch of people in Congress” grappling with how to address presidential abuses because “the American people” decided to put the House of Representatives in the hands of a Democratic majority – made up of members who ran on a platform of holding Trump accountable.

I’m going to assume that Haley, a former top member of Donald Trump’s team, knows all of this. I’ll also assume that the point she intended to make was about delaying judgment on the president’s apparent misconduct until Election Day 2020. Indeed, the former South Carolina governor added on Twitter over the weekend, “This is a decision for the American people.”

It’s an increasingly popular pitch in GOP circles. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), who’ll retire from elected office next year, recently argued, “An election, which is just around the corner, is the right way to decide who should be president.” Similarly, Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas), the ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee, added yesterday, “Let the American people decide this in less than a year.”

At face value, this may seem like one of the GOP’s less ridiculous arguments. Trump was caught crossing the line, and if voters have a problem with the president’s abuses, they can vote for someone new next November. If, on the other hand, voters are unmoved, the electorate can make that clear, too.

There are, however, a couple of serious flaws with this.

NBC News’ First Read team published an item in September about the Ukraine scandal, just as it was starting to break, that stuck with me:

If this is what this looks like … then it’s arguably worse than Watergate, when the dirty tricks were being conducted by Americans against Americans. But this time, is the dirty trick a sitting president dangling aid to a foreign country to get it to investigate a rival campaign? We learned from 2016 that the Trump campaign will do whatever it takes to win. Do national Democrats – who believe defeating Trump in 2020, not impeaching him, is the best way to remove him from office – understand what else we might see over the next 14 months?

The Trump campaign will do whatever it takes to win. That, in a nutshell, is why the scandal can’t wait. One of the key pillars of the whole controversy has been a simple fact: Trump intended to cheat in the election by way of an extortion scheme. The president, rightly or wrongly, saw Joe Biden as a credible electoral threat, which led him to push a vulnerable foreign ally to cook up some dirt Republicans could use before Election Day.

To let this go unpunished is to effectively encourage the president who knows no limits, and believes there can be no checks on his misconduct, to keep exploring other cheating options.

The broader national goal should be to ensure that the United States has a free and fair election next year. Trump has already taken steps that are fundamentally at odds with that goal.

It’s not as if the president has rolled out some kind of “mea culpa” defense, acknowledging poor judgment, and assuring the public that he intends to stop trying to screw around with the 2020 cycle. On the contrary, Trump has done largely the opposite, insisting his actions were “perfect,” permissible, and literally unimpeachable.

As New York’s Jon Chait recently put it, “Using his foreign-policy authority to leverage dirt on Americans who oppose him is not a mistake, it is Trump’s ongoing campaign strategy. Either he will be removed from office over it, or he will use that strategy to try to win reelection.”

To ask “the American people” to decide the proper resolution is to assume the president intends to play fair over the next 12 months. Trump has already made it painfully obvious that he has a very different plan in mind."

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., put America's billionaires front-and-center on the campaign trail last week and mocked those speaking out against her proposed wealth tax.

""Boy, there are some billionaires who don't like this,"" Warren said Friday in Goose Creek, South Carolina. ""I think I hurt someone's feelings... This is sad. So... people are saying, 'Oh, I'm just mean to the billionaires.""

Among those speaking out against Warren's proposals last week were Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. Dimon even suggested Warren may have been vilifying ""successful people.""

On Fox Nation's ""Deep Dive,"" Stephen Moore, a former senior economic adviser to President Trump and a distinguished visiting fellow for the Heritage Foundation's Project for Economic Growth, took on Warren's case against America's wealthiest.

""The vast majority of people in the top 1 percent... [t]hey own, operate or invest in small businesses,"" Moore said. ""They are the job creators and the wealth creators of our economy.""

""Look at what Bill Gates and a person like Jeff Bezos have done,"" Moore added. ""They've created hundreds and thousands of jobs. They've created... higher incomes... I hate this bashing of the rich.""

Moore argued that policymakers should be more focused on growing the economy than redistributing the wealth of some Americans through higher taxes.

""What I care about is -- as John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan used to say -- let's create a rising tide that lifts all boats. And, I think under Trump, that's what's happening. You know, we're seeing all income groups benefit from this expansion,"" he said.

John Grace, the founder and president of Investors Advantage Corp., argued that the growing disparity between the wealth of Americans needed to be addressed.

""I think it's worth noting in 1962, when we look at the top 1 percent versus the bottom 99 percent, at that point, it was pretty equal, 30 to 34 percent was the share of wealth,"" Grace said. ""By 2016, the top 1 percent is garnering over 40 percent of the wealth and the bottom 90 percent is generating a whopping 20 percent of the wealth. So, one has dramatically increased.""

SANDERS, WARREN 'INCOME INEQUALITY' ARGUMENT IS BOGUS: EXPERT PANEL EXPLAINS

In conclusion, Moore said he saw Warren's proposals as more punitive than productive.

""My friend, [economist] Art Laffer, says, 'You want a tax system that tries to make poor people rich, not make rich people poor.' Sometimes I think some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have that wrong,"" he said.

""There are certain problems out there. But... all I'm hearing from the Democrats right now is, sock it to the rich and give it to the poor... Income redistribution is not an economic growth plan,"" Moore concluded.

On Veterans Day, several candidates rolled out proposals to meet the needs of America's 20 million former service members.

Trump, speaking in New York City's Veterans Day Parade, praised the strength of the U.S. military and the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, saying the nation's veterans ""risked everything for us. Now it is our duty to serve and protect them every single day of our lives."" More than 100 protesters booed and held black balloons that read ""support our troops, impeach.""

Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said female veterans and service members have been neglected, including on concerns about sexual harassment and women's health. Women are the military's fastest-growing subgroup.

""I think leadership plays a huge role so absolutely I'd seek to name a woman to lead VA,"" Buttigieg, a former Navy intelligence officer, said in an interview with The Associated Press. His comments went a step beyond his 21-page wide-ranging plan released on Monday.

""The president has let veterans down,"" Buttigieg said.

Of the Cabinet and Cabinet-level roles, four have never been held by a woman: Veterans Affairs, Defense, Treasury and White House chief of staff. Buttigieg says he'd take a close look at appointing a female defense secretary as well.

Former Vice President Joe Biden said he would seek to build on substantial gains for vets that were started under the Obama-Biden administration, such as stemming homelessness and improving mental health care.

Biden said he would ""restore trust"" in the VA after failed leadership, putting in place at least one full-time women's primary care physician at each VA medical center to boost women's health care and provide $300 million to better understand the impact of traumatic brain injury.

He said as president he would publish a comprehensive strategy to address veterans' suicide within his first 200 days in office and hire additional staff to ensure that in his first year of office wait times for vets at risk of suicide are reduce to zero.

""Our veterans deserve leaders who will fight for them as ardently and as forcefully as they have fought for us,"" Biden wrote in a Veterans Day statement with his wife Jill.

In a dig at Trump, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders released a video on Monday highlighting his role in working with the late Republican Sen. John McCain, a decorated war hero, to pass legislation that included the Veterans Choice program in 2014.

Trump routinely takes credit for being the first to enact the Choice program, ignoring the fact that it was signed into law by President Barack Obama. What Trump got done was an expansion of the program achieved by McCain and Sanders.

That expanded program, one of Trump's signature accomplishments, seeks to steer more veterans over the next decade to private-sector doctors outside the VA.

Sanders, a former chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee who voted against Trump's plan, says the expanded program goes too far in its investments in the private sector, rather than core VA health care , which many veterans view as better suited to treat battlefield injuries such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Sanders joins Buttigieg and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in urging increases in doctor pay to attract top VA candidates and fill 49,000 VA positions that have sat vacant as the Trump administration promoted private health care options.

Sanders said he would fill those vacancies in his first year as president and provide at least $62 billion in new funding to repair and modernize VA facilities to provide cutting-edge care.

""We will not dismantle or privatize the VA. We will expand and improve the VA,"" Sanders said Monday.

Buttigieg told the AP that he would look at rolling back some of the Trump administration's rules expanding Choice.

All the Democratic candidates who have articulated veterans' plans call for added funding and training for suicide prevention.

Currently, about 20 veterans die by suicide each day, a rate basically unchanged during the Trump administration. Trump earlier this year directed a Cabinet-level task force to develop a broader roadmap for veterans' suicide prevention, due out next spring.

Buttigieg, like Warren, would seek to improve responses to sexual assault in the military by shifting prosecution from military commanders to independent prosecutors. He also wants to put particular focus on stemming homelessness among women vets, many of whom may have experienced sexual trauma.

He pointed to his seven-month deployment in Afghanistan in 2014 and watching the impact a female general had ""culturally"" on the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force.

""When a leadership body is more gender diverse, it makes better decisions. So I would absolutely be looking at that,"" Buttigieg told the AP. He's previously pledged to appoint women to at least 50% of his Cabinet positions.

While veterans overall have strongly backed Trump throughout his presidency, views vary widely by party, gender and age, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of 2018 midterm voters. In particular, younger veterans and women generally were more skeptical of Trump, who received multiple draft deferments to avoid going to Vietnam.

Currently, about 10% of the nation's veterans are female. In the U.S. military forces, about 17% of those enlisted are women, up from about 2% in 1973."

WHY BIDEN EXCELS NATIONALLY, STRUGGLES IN EARLY STATES

Politico: “Joe Biden is the clear frontrunner in the 2020 Democratic race for president. Or he’s faltering, slipping into fourth place as he loses ground to Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and an ascendant Pete Buttigieg. Those alternate realities are playing out in real time — reflected in Biden’s solid standing atop national polls versus his middling performance in Iowa and New Hampshire surveys on the other. The disparity is at once a source of frustration to Biden’s team and one of hope to rivals holding out for an utter collapse by the former vice president in the two earliest nominating states. The explanations for the discrepancy run the gamut. The white Iowa and New Hampshire electorates play against Biden’s strength among ideological moderates and African Americans, some defenders argue. Skeptics say it shows that the voters watching him most closely are underwhelmed. There's the fact that Biden pulled back on early state ad spending — both on TV and digitally — while competitors ramped up. Finally, the Trump factor: The president's reelection campaign has been running anti-Biden ads on TV in Iowa and more broadly over social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube.”



Biden super PAC issues memo warning in early states - Politico: “A super PAC supporting Joe Biden warned Saturday that the Trump campaign is seeking to take down the former vice president in early state contests with a barrage of negative ads. ‘Trump is spending considerable sums in the early states, particularly Iowa, in a hope to stop Biden’s momentum before he can get to the states where his coalition works to his benefit,’ Democratic strategist Steve Schale wrote in a memo obtained by POLITICO. … The memo from Unite the Country super PAC … lays out the candidate's consistent strength in national Democratic primary polls and in matchups with President Donald Trump in battleground states. It also points to Biden’s steady lead in South Carolina and Nevada, the latter two of the four early nominating state, which have a far more diverse electorate than Iowa and New Hampshire. Wins there would give Biden momentum heading into the 14 Super Tuesday primaries, the memo states.”



Klobuchar says a woman with Buttigieg's experience wouldn't make debate stage - Fox News: “Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., didn’t spare any punches on Sunday when going after fellow 2020 presidential primary candidate Pete Buttigieg – saying that a woman with the South Bend, Ind., mayor’s experience would not be on the debate stage. Klobcuhar, who has been polling in the middle of the still-crowded field of Democrats, argued during an appearance on CNN’s ‘State of the Union’ that while every candidate in her party has been more qualified to lead the country than President Trump, she doubted a woman with the same resume as Buttigieg would be given a chance at running for president. ‘Of the women on the stage, I’m focusing here on my fellow women senators, Sens. Harris and Warren and myself. Do I think we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience that he had? No, I don’t,’ Klobuchar said in reference to Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.”



#YangGang: Now what? - NYT: “Enthusiasm for Mr. [Andrew] Yang is probably most palpable here in New Hampshire where the entrepreneur has repeatedly polled around 5 percent, his strongest showing in an early-voting state. … All of which leaves Mr. Yang and his senior campaign staff — some of whom, before this, had never run a campaign of any kind — with a new quandary: What do we do now? … But moving forward, Mr. Yang said he wants his message to become ‘more human-based’ — perhaps a necessary shift for a candidate seeking a broader audience who has thus far focused much of his attention on robots. His vision of a ‘human-based’ campaign, he said, involves talking more about the way he thinks his signature pitch can really change lives. … The strategic pivot — the most significant in the campaign to date — is most clearly exemplified by the new television ad Mr. Yang’s team put on the air Thursday in Iowa. They spent more than $1 million on the ad buy, the kind of seven-figure sum they did not have available to them for the long first few phases of his run.”



New venue chosen for December Dem debate - Politico: “The Democratic presidential debate in December has been moved to Loyola Marymount University, after controversy over a labor fight upended plans to host the prime-time event at the University of California, Los Angeles. POLITICO and PBS NewsHour, the sponsors of the Dec. 19 debate, announced the change after the Democratic National Committee said Wednesday that UCLA would no longer serve as the venue because of an ongoing dispute between the school and its largest employee union. … Six Democratic White House contenders have so far qualified to appear on stage: Vice President Joe Biden; Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.”

TIME OUT: THE HISTORY OF VETERANS DAY

NYT: “On Nov. 11, 1918, the Allied nations and Germany signed an armistice ending the fighting in the Great War, which had killed more than 15 million people. A year later, King George V of England proclaimed that date Armistice Day, to be marked with two minutes of silence at 11 a.m., the hour the agreement had gone into effect. ‘King Asks British to Pause Two Minutes on Armistice Day,’ The New York Times wrote in a front-page headline on Nov. 7, 1919. Days later, the paper reported that Americans would be observing the day, too, with ceremonies around the country. In a special message to the nation in 1919, President Woodrow Wilson noted the monumental changes that the fierce and bloody war had provoked. The European Allies fought for more than four years, and the Americans for more than a year and a half. None would ever be the same. … In 1954, in response to calls for recognition of veterans of World War II and the Korean War, President Dwight D. Eisenhower changed the name of the holiday to Veterans Day. A 1968 law moved the observance of the holiday to the fourth Monday in October, but that was unpopular, and in 1975, President Gerald Ford signed a law moving it back to Nov. 11. The law took effect in 1978.”

REP. PETER KING ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT

Fox News: “Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., the powerful 14-term congressman who once chaired the House Committee on Homeland Security, announced Monday he will not seek reelection in 2020. King, in a statement Monday, said his ‘prime reason’ for retiring ‘was that after 28 years of spending four days a week in Washington, D.C., it is time to end the weekly commute and be home in Seaford.’ ‘This was not an easy decision. But there is a season for everything and Rosemary and I decided that, especially since we are both in good health, it is time to have the flexibility to spend more time with our children and grandchildren,’ he said. … The 75-year-old congressman said his decades in Congress have been ‘an extraordinary experience.’ He currently serves as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, which he served as chair from 2005-2006 and again from 2011-2012… King is one of several Republicans — four senators and 17 other House members — who have announced plans to not seek reelection.”



Sessions’ feels support from 11 GOP senators in open letter - Politico: “Nearly a dozen of Jeff Sessions' former GOP Senate colleagues are backing his run for Senate, according to a letter obtained by POLITICO. In an ‘open letter to conservatives’ on Sessions' candidacy for Alabama's Senate race next year, 11 Republican senators say that Sessions is a ‘man of his word. And we know he is devoted to serving the people of Alabama.’ … The letter is signed by GOP Sens. Richard Shelby of Alabama, Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, Pat Roberts of Kansas, Mike Enzi of Wyoming, Mike Crapo of Idaho, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, John Barrasso of Wyoming, Roy Blunt of Missouri, John Boozman of Arkansas, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Deb Fischer of Nebraska. Roberts, Enzi and Isakson are all retiring this year or next. Barrasso and Blunt are the Nos. 3 and 4 GOP leaders, respectively, in the Senate GOP.”



Steve Knight eyes old seat after Katie Hill resignation - Fox News: “The two-term Republican who was ousted in 2018 by Katie Hill announced on his website Sunday that he will attempt to win back his old seat. ‘I am proud to return to public service and deliver the type of representation our district deserves,’ Steve Knight posted on his website. Hill defeated Knight by 9 points in California’s 25th District in November. Hill-- a centrist-- was seen as a rising Democratic star because the district is seen as one of a few in the state that could be carried by a Republican. Henry Olsen, a columnist in the Washington Post, wrote a piece last month that questioned whether or not the state was ‘reopening’ the doors to Republicans. He pointed out that the district was a Republican stronghold before President Trump. He also called the election—which will likely occur on March 3, a possible bellwether for Republicans.”



Kentucky Republicans losing patience with Gov. Bevin - Louisville [Ky.] Courier Journal: “Republican Senate President Robert Stivers believes Gov. Matt Bevin should concede his loss to Democrat Andy Beshear if next week's recanvas doesn't significantly change the vote totals. ‘It’s time to call it quits and go home, say he had a good four years and congratulate Gov.-elect Beshear,’ Stivers said in a brief Friday interview at the Capitol. Bevin finished 5,189 votes behind Beshear in Tuesday's gubernatorial election but has refused to concede the race, requesting a recanvas of the vote that will take place Nov. 14. … Stivers said if Bevin chooses to contest the election by calling a special session of the General Assembly and making a case that there was illegal activity, lawmakers would have to hear the dispute under the state constitution.”



The political deadlock in states for 2020 - NYT: “Acrimonious deadlocks have become the new normal in Wisconsin, one of three Midwestern states where Democrats ended full Republican control last year by flipping governorships. Gov. Tony Evers’s defeat of Scott Walker, whose success at pushing Wisconsin sharply to the right prompted a brief presidential bid, has given Democrats a new foothold this year in a region where they had been mostly sidelined. Yet with attention turning to the presidential election, in which Wisconsin voters are seen as playing a decisive role, divided power has given way to frustrated impasse, with little chance for either party to hold up state policymaking as the showcase it once was here. … In Wisconsin, Michigan and Kansas, Democrats’ victories last November came after a period of extraordinary, sustained Republican success. Going into the 2018 election, Republicans controlled the governor’s offices and the full legislatures in 10 of 12 Midwestern states. … Though the purpling of Midwestern statehouses since last November has served as a check on Republican power, it has hardly led to a bonanza of liberal legislating.”



HOUSE GOP PREPARES FOR IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS

Politico: “House Republicans are gearing up for a blockbuster showdown with Democrats as the impeachment probe enters its most visible phase yet, with GOP lawmakers and staffers from key committees plotting with leadership to launch their counterattack. To prepare for this week’s public hearings, Republican leaders have moved one of President Donald Trump’s fiercest Hill defenders to the House Intelligence Committee and have lined up an explosive witness list for the upcoming proceedings, offering some clues into their defense strategy. The transcripts released last week from closed-door interviews with impeachment witnesses also provide a window into how the GOP plans to approach the high-stakes hearings. Republicans will try to paint the Democratically led process as politically motivated and minimize Trump's role in the quest to persuade Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. And they will also try to keep the heat off Trump by attacking the Bidens and pushing other conspiracy theories about the elections.”



Mulvaney makes last-minute move to join impeachment testimony lawsuit - WaPo: “White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney’s last-minute effort to join a lawsuit that could determine whether senior administration officials testify in the impeachment inquiry was an unwelcome surprise to former top national security aides, highlighting internal divisions among President Trump’s advisers in the face of the probe. Former national security adviser John Bolton’s advisers and allies were taken aback to learn late Friday that Mulvaney had gone to court seeking to join a separation-of-powers lawsuit filed against Trump and the House leadership, according to people familiar with their views, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing inquiry. The suit was filed by Bolton’s former deputy, Charles Kupperman, who is asking a federal judge to determine whether a congressional subpoena takes precedence over a White House order not to comply with the inquiry. Bolton is willing to testify if the judge rules in favor of the House, The Washingon Post previously reported.”



Pergram: The ‘impeachment resolution,’ and Dems' fight over its meaning - Fox News: “It didn’t matter what that resolution was called or wasn’t called a few weeks ago. Congress has descended into impeachapalooza. There’s no quibbling about what’s consuming Capitol Hill. Some Democrats may fret about the political ramifications of impeachment. Leaders like Pelosi and Hoyer may try to parse words about impeachment, but we’re well past the point of no return now. Impeachment is now the political equivalent of the Popeye’s chicken sandwich. Nothing commands as much attention.”

NOT SO GOLDEN SPONGE CAKE

KARE11: “Every school has its tradition. One of the most unique ones belongs to a school in Maine that has run an ongoing experiment for 43 years: How long can a Twinkie survive? The experiment at George Stevens Academy in Blue Hill, Maine, started in 1976. During a lesson about food additives and preservatives, science teacher Roger Bennatti was asked by a student how long a Twinkie would last. Bennatti didn't know. So, of course, he tested it. … More than 43 years later, the Twinkie is still at the school… That golden cake has darkened and greyed and the spongy holes are more prevalent. But it's mostly kept it's shape. ‘The Twinkie has become much like me. It's older, it's grayer and it's more flaky,’ said Bennatti, who is now retired. … So how has it lasted this long? The obvious answer is preservatives. But even with that, a Hostess spokesperson told Reuters the modern-day Twinkie has a shelf life of 65 days.”

CHRIS WALLACE, ANCHOR: I'm Chris Wallace.

Democrats prepare to go public with their impeachment probe. But will the televised hearings change anything?

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALIF.: Those open hearings will be an opportunity for the American people to evaluate the witnesses for themselves. But also to learn firsthand about the facts of the president's misconduct.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: They've gone out of their way to find the people that hate President Trump the most.

WALLACE: After weeks of closed-door testimony, lawmakers will question witnesses in public about whether the president abused his office to get oppo research from Ukraine.

We'll ask two members of the committee leading inquiry, Republican Will Hurd, a moderate whose actions will be watched closely by other members of his party, and Democrat Sean Patrick Maloney.

Then, former New York City mayor and billionaire businessman, Michael Bloomberg, weighs a late entry into the Democratic race for president.

TRUMP: He's not going to do well but I think he's going to hurt Biden actually. Little Michael will fail.

WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel how Bloomberg's possible move could reshape the Democratic campaign.

And our ""Power Player of the Week"", the iconic horse-drawn caisson performing a solemn duty honoring our nation's fallen veterans.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: And hello again from FOX News in Washington.

The House Democratic effort to impeach President Trump moves into a key new phase this week, public hearings, in which career government officials will testify on camera about how President Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.

The big question: will this change the dynamic of the inquiry that so far has remained strictly partisan?

In a moment, we'll speak with two members of the House Intelligence Committee that will hold the made-for-TV hearings, Republican Will Hurd and Democrat Sean Patrick Maloney.

But, first, let's bring in Ellison Barber, who has the latest from the White House -- Ellison.

ELLISON BARBER, CORRESPONDENT: Chris, one of the first witnesses we expect to hear from this week is a career diplomat who testified behind closed doors. It was his understanding that everything, military aid and an Oval Office visit, was contingent on Ukraine investigating the Bidens in 2016.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

BARBER: The 45th president cheered at the game of the century hours before the start of the week that could turn his political future upside down. Three public hearings are set to take place on two different dates. On Wednesday, the House Intelligence Committee will hear from a top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine and a top State Department official. On Friday, the former ambassador to Ukraine.

House Democrats released their closed door testimonies this week. William Taylor's arguably the most explosive. The career the diplomat testified it was his clear understanding security assistance money would not come until the president of Ukraine committed to pursue the investigations President Trump wanted.

President Trump continues to call the inquiry --

TRUMP: The witch hunt continues --

BARBER: But claims his party is on the same page.

TRUMP: The Republicans have never been so united.

BARBER: Congressional Republicans want to hear from at least 14 witnesses, including former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter and the whistle- blower whose complaint help initiate the impeachment inquiry.

Chairman Adam Schiff responding with a warning: The committee will not serve as vehicles to carry out sham investigations into the Bidens or debunked conspiracies about 2016.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

BARBER: Rules approved by the House essentially give Democrats veto power here. It witnesses must be approved by the chairman of the Intelligence Committee or the full committee -- Chris.

WALLACE: Ellison Barber, reporting from the White House -- Ellison, thank you.

BARBER: You bet.

WALLACE: Joining me now, Congressman Will Hurd, a Republican member of the House Intel Committee that will conduct those public hearings this week.

Congressman Hurd, the top Republican on House Intel, Devin Nunes, says that he would like to call the whistle-blower, the unnamed whistle-blower, to testify in public in these hearings.

And here's what President Trump has to say about the whistle-blower.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: The whistle-blower is a disgrace to our country, a disgrace, and the whistle-blower, because of that, should be revealed.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Now, the whistle-blower reportedly works for the CIA, where you worked for almost a decade.

Should his identity be revealed? Should be he called to testify in public?

REP. WILL HURD, R-TX: I think we should be protecting the identity of the whistle-blower. I've said that from the very beginning, because how we treat this whistle-blower will impact whistle-blowers in the future. Having this whistle-blower law on the books is important. It's an important checks and balance not only in the Intelligence Committee, but our government.

But what I do would like to see happen is for Adam Schiff, Chairman Schiff, the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, to answer questions about what was his engagement with the whistle-blower before the information, his (ph) -- the whistle-blower's allegations were transmitted to the -- to Congress.

He has misled the American public earlier in the year on what he knew about -- or the contact that he had with the whistle-blower. So if you want to protect the identity of the whistle-blower, I think it's important for Chairman Schiff to answer questions about his interactions with them (ph).

WALLACE: What to think about as the Republicans are seeking, calling Hunter Biden, the vice president -- the former vice president's son, as a witness?

HURD: I would love to hear from Hunter Biden, I would love to hear from other Americans that served on the board of Burisma. I'm curious to know of someone who doesn't have any experience in Ukraine nor experience in a natural gas company becomes (ph) on the board of a natural gas company in Ukraine.

You know, this is -- we also need to hear and understand the corruption. We know corruption in the Ukraine is an issue. And Ambassador Taylor has said that in his testimony. Dr. Hill has said that in her testimony. This is something that was a concern even in this current new administration in Ukraine.

So, hearing from people that can help provide insights into that, since that is, you know, central to this conversation would be -- would be valuable.

WALLACE: Now, Congressman Schiff responded last night to the GOP witness list that had been offered by Chairman Nunes and here's what Schiff said: The Intel Committee will not be used, quote, to carry out the same sham investigations into the Bidens and 2016 that the president wanted Ukraine to conduct.

Given that response, Congressman Hurd, what does that say about the fairness of a process that the Democrats are running and holding these hearings?

HURD: Unfortunately, Chris, this has been a partisan exercise from the very beginning. When one piece of information comes, people that don't like the president say, oh, this is an example for impeachment. People that support the president say, this is a -- you know, evidence of an exoneration.

I think we should just turn over every rock and pursue every lead to ultimately get to the truth. And it's unfortunate that the Democrats on the committee and the Democrats in the House have created this partisan exercise.

In a normal hearing, the minority, the folks that are not in power, have the ability to offer a witness. We can't do that in this case.

Under previous impeachment inquiries, the minority and the president has had the opportunity to call witnesses, be involved.

You -- the majority of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and Chairman Schiff has prevented some of the lawyers for the administration to come in and be there with the folks that were -- that were testifying. That's not a fair process.

If we're interested in trying to uncover the truth, then let's not -- let's not put our thumb on the scale. But unfortunately, that's what this process has been and what's even crazier is there trying to have this completed by the end of the year, and I think we only have 16 or 17 legislative days left in the year. Half of those days are what's called ""fly-in, fly-out"" days where people are coming in from their location.

So, to try to get that, try to pass NAFTA, to fund the government -- to try to do all that in that short period of time, I think that's next to impossible.

WALLACE: You -- you talk about the extreme partisanship, maybe on both sides, Republicans and Democrats. You are not -- while you're supportive of the president, you are not a party line supportive. You oppose some of his policies, for instance, constructing the border wall. You've opposed and have spoken out against some of his language during his time in office.

For you, what specifically do you want to learn from these hearings?

HURD: So, I think talk about impeachment has been premature. I think impeachment is one of the most important and consequential things a member of Congress can do. And I think there's 535 different opinions on what impeachment is. To evaluate -- to evaluate that question I think it's a violation of the law.

So, I want to see, does this establish a criminal intent? And yes, for me, I agree when I agree, I disagree when I disagree.

And having spent nine-and-a-half years as an undercover officer in the CIA, I was a guy in the back alleys collecting intelligence. I also did this to embassies. I know how embassies work.

And the fact that Ukrainian officials weren't contacting their U.S. counterparts until August 29th, when they read in -- I believe it was a political article about aid being withheld. That was the first time that any Ukrainian had contacted a State Department or government official about this. That was more than a month after the July 25th phone call between the president and President Zelensky.

WALLACE: So --

(CROSSTALK)

HURD: What do I want to see?

WALLACE: Go ahead, sir.

HURD: Go ahead, Chris.

WALLACE: No, you go ahead.

HURD: What -- what I want to see is their inability to establish criminal intent. Do the Ukrainians know that this -- you know, this was some kind of a quid pro quo?

You know, when you look at our relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine over the last three years, there's been no more aid going to Ukraine this year than -- in this administration than the previous administration. Ukraine is an important partner.

WALLACE: Let me ask you specifically though about this because there seem to be two issues that were part of the quid pro quo. One was military aid. One was the meeting that the Ukrainians very much wanted between their President Zelensky and President Trump.

All three of the witnesses that are going to testify this week -- you see them up there, William Taylor, George Kent, Marie Yovanovitch, all career foreign service officers, said there was a clear connection between support for Ukraine, at various forms of the U.S. support for Ukraine, and Ukraine investigating the Democrats.

If you are satisfied that that is true, that there was this connection, this nexus, is that an impeachable offense?

HURD: Well, I don't know if it was necessarily investigate the Democrats, right? I think it was investigation of corruption. And so, people have made assumption of what is --

WALLACE: Forgive me, sir, but specifically --

HURD: Sure.

WALLACE: -- what President Trump said on that July 25th phone call was investigate the Democratic role in the 2016 election, whether they were involved in hacking the DNC server and also, specifically, the Bidens and Burisma.

HURD: Well, on the 2016 elections -- now, some of that information was based on what has been kind of fringe thinking. But back when even Democrats start investigating the Russian involvement on 2016 elections, there was a Ukraine nexus.

And so, trying to get to the bottom of that, is that a violation of the law? Now, was that an understanding based on debunked information? Yes. But is that a violation of the law? I don't think so.

You mentioned of the Bidens --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: But specifically, sir, the question, is if there was a quid pro quo, U.S. aid for Ukraine was going to depend on their doing these investigations of political rivals of the president. Is that an impeachable offense?

HURD: I think if you're trying to get information on a political rival to use in a political campaign is not something a president or any official should be doing. I think everybody has -- most Republicans have said that that would be a violation of the law.

WALLACE: So, that, in your view, if that were established to your satisfaction, if, I repeat, that would be an impeachable offense?

HURD: I believe that's something that would make it -- make it -- have to truly consider whether impeachment is the right tool or not.

WALLACE: And we will see what happens this week and whether or not it persuades you.

Congressman Hurd, thank you so much. Thanks for your time. Good to talk with you, sir.

HURD: Thank you, Chris.

WALLACE: Up next, we'll get reaction from a Democrat on the Intelligence Committee about what some say is his party's timetable to impeach the president before the end of the year.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: House Republicans have complained for weeks about Democrats interviewing key witnesses in the impeachment probe behind closed doors. Well, now, the public hearings are about to start. The GOP is still complaining.

Let's bring in Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, a Democrat on the Intelligence Committee.

Congressman, as I discussed with Congressman Hurd, Republicans have now put out their written list of witnesses. It includes Hunter Biden, the unnamed whistle-blower, and Nellie Ohr, who folks may remember, she worked for Fusion GPS, which sought information from sources in Ukraine in 2016 and put up the Steele dossier.

Will Democrats agree to call any of these witnesses? And if you don't, what does that say about the fairness of this entire proceeding?

REP. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY, D-N.Y.: Well, I can't speak for the chairman, but what I can tell you is that I think we will end up calling some of the witnesses on that list. And here's my test -- my test is, do these witnesses have important information, knowledge, or evidence about the president's conduct? And if it passes that test, then we should call them, sure.

WALLACE: So, let's ask specifically. Hunter Biden, Nellie Ohr, the unnamed whistle-blower -- do any of them pass that test and therefore should be called?

MALONEY: The first two, no. The third one, you've just heard Congressman Hurd give a very eloquent explanation of why we don't force the revelation of a whistle-blower's identity. So, no in all three cases, but for different reasons.

WALLACE: Well, I mean, let's -- let's focus on Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden is at the center of this. There are allegations of corruption. You know, there certainly are questions why a fellow named Hunter Biden would get a big job in Ukraine when his father was then the vice president and conducting relations with Ukraine.

Isn't that a fair person to talk to?

MALONEY: Well, let me ask you, Mr. Wallace, what information Mr. Biden, Hunter Biden, a private citizen who was broke no laws by serving on the board of directors, would have about the president's withholding of military aid to Ukraine? In other words, he has no knowledge of what the president did or didn't do here, that is the subject of the impeachment inquiry.

There are certainly questions, of course, and many people have asked them, but it's not relevant to this week's hearings.

WALLACE: So, you know, I don't have the list right in front of me, but you obviously saw it. You're a member of the committee. Which member of the Republican potential witnesses would you agree to call?

MALONEY: Again, there are witnesses on the Republican list who have been interviewed in depositions already and, of course, those transcripts are going to be released fully. And so, I would expect the witnesses who have been interviewed, because they have material information, would be likely called in public, but again, those are not --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: For instance, Kurt Volker, who was a special emissary to Ukraine?

MALONEY: Mr. Volker testified for the committee, so did Mr. Morrison. Those witnesses are on the list. Mr. Hale is similarly a witness who's been interviewed, is on the list. Those are the witnesses I have in mind.

But again, this is not my decision. I can't speak for the chairman, but those witnesses do have material information about the president's conduct in this case. That's the proper focus of this inquiry.

And if I could just say, Chris, you know, I hope your viewers will keep an open mind. You know, this is Veterans Day weekend, God bless all who serve and where the country's uniform as my dad did, as my grandfather did.

You know, these are also military veterans. Ambassador Taylor was an infantry officer with 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam, served in combat.

WALLACE: Right.

MALONEY: West Point graduate. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman earned a Purple Heart in Iraq.

These are -- these are veterans and credible witnesses. I hope people will keep an open mind and hear their testimony unfiltered and read the transcript. By all means, they are all coming out in public.

WALLACE: All right. Let's talk about another -- apparently non-witness at this point and that his national security advisor -- former national security advisor John Bolton. Here is what his lawyer wrote this week to the committee: Bolton was involved, according to his lawyer, in many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far.

Continuing the quote: If the House chooses not to pursue through subpoena the testimony of Ambassador Bolton, let the record be clear, that is the House's decision.

Isn't -- Congressman, isn't John Bolton perhaps the best witness other than the president as to what was going on inside the Oval Office? And why on earth wouldn't you wait to see what he has to say?

MALONEY: We have -- we have invited Ambassador Bolton to appear, and that sounds like a nervous lawyer to me, because they are -- they are refusing to honor a legal request to provide relevant testimony.

WALLACE: Wait, wait, wait --

MALONEY: Excuse me --

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: Wait a minute. Let me just -- wait a minute. But the point is he has gone to a judge and said, you tell us, I got an order from the White House, I got an order from Congress, you tell me what to do.

MALONEY: Right. Mr. Wallace, that's not how it works. You show up and you respond to a subpoena or you go to a judge and get it quashed, or you show up and you invoke a legitimate privilege and refused to answer a particular question.

It is unprecedented to say, you, Congress, go to a judge and tell me to appear. That's not how it works, and Ambassador Bolton is a better lawyer than that. He knows that personally.

WALLACE: Wait. That isn't what they're doing. They're not saying, Congress, go to the judge. They are going to the judge.

That's what they did with Charles Kupperman, another one of the clients who was an assistant to a deputy to Bolton and Bolton -- they are going to the judge and they're saying, judge, we've got these competing claims, you tell us what to do. They're not asking the House to do anything.

MALONEY: Mr. Wallace, I agree with you that he has important information and we would love to hear from Ambassador Bolton. I think the public deserves to hear from Ambassador Bolton, who remember call this a drug deal and wanted nothing to do with it, who instructed his subordinates to report this conversations to the lawyers at the White House because he knew they were improper.

Ambassador Bolton does have important information. I don't understand why the White House has instructed him not to cooperate. You should ask them.

WALLACE: Yes. I guess what I'm saying is this is an impeachment. This isn't just oversight. This is the potential impeachment of the president of the United States.

There is going to be a court hearing in early December, Charles Kupperman, the deputy to Bolton and Bolton now would be part of that suit.

Why not wait -- we're talking about a month, exactly a month, to find out what a judge says? Why wouldn't, when you're talking about the impeachment of the president, why wouldn't the House Intelligence Committee be willing to wait to find out such key evidence?

MALONEY: Again, we would love to have Mr. Bolton's evidence. There's nothing preventing him from giving it. But remember -- oh, and by the way, any notion that that's going to be favorable to the president I think is debunked by everything in the public domain already.

Ambassador Bolton called this a drug deal. I'm not sure the president will want to hear from Ambassador Bolton, but we sure do.

But here's the point. The point is, do we have sufficient evidence from credible witnesses that we're going to present in public testimony to move forward with an inquiry which may result in a referral to the Senate, where there will be a trial, where witnesses like Ambassador Bolton will have an opportunity again to provide the information they know. I encourage them to do it now, I encourage them to do it then and I don't think it will be favorable to the president. It is Ambassador Bolton who saw clearly how abusive and inappropriate the president's conduct was.

WALLACE: You know, he's not going to be -- testify because you guys have a timetable that you want to get this done by the end of the year.

Let me ask you a couple questions to finish this up. President Trump now says that he is going to release the transcript of a phone call -- not the July 25th a phone call that we've already seen but an earlier phone call in April just after President Zelensky was inaugurated between the two presidents.

What value does not transcript have for your committee and your investigation?

MALONEY: Well, I don't know of any evidence that would be relevant from the first phone call except that it was a routine phone call to congratulate the president. If the president wants to release it, that's fine. I don't think it's relevant to this investigation.

WALLACE: Let's turn to the public hearings this week. You've got three witnesses testifying, we've already seen the transcripts of their interviews. People know what they're going to say.

Is the argument that you're basically -- people are going to read the book but they're going to see the movie? Because that didn't work out very well in the Robert Mueller testimony.

MALONEY: Well, Mr. Wallace, the point is that the Republicans have been demanding for weeks that the public be able to see this testimony. So, you know, they should take yes for an answer. I think it's very important that the public be able to judge for itself.

And I really encourage your viewers to just watch the hearings. Read the transcripts or watch it live and make up your own minds. You won't have any filter. You won't have the press or politicians in the way. You'll have witnesses giving opening statements.

And these are military veterans. These are career nonpartisan civil servants. The first witness, Ambassador Bill Taylor --

(CROSSTALK)

MALONEY: Excuse me, is an appointee of a Republican president who serve this country in the military. I think we should give him a chance.

(CROSSTALK)

WALLACE: Sir, you've already made that point and I would like to get -- I'm running out of time, I'd like to get one last question in if I might.

Here's what President Trump says about all those witnesses. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: The testimony has all been fine. I mean, for the most part, I never even heard of these people. I have no idea who they are. It seems that nobody has any first-hand knowledge, there is no firsthand knowledge.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: The president does have a point. None of these officials actually talked to the president.

When we think back to John Dean with Richard Nixon, he took us into the Oval Office. He told what he told the president and what the president told him.

As the president says, all of the information we're going to hear this week is secondhand. Is that enough to impeach a president?

MALONEY: Well, Mr. Wallace, if you're talking about this week -- but, of course, there witnesses like Ambassador Sondland, who spoke directly to the president. There are other witnesses who have refused to cooperate.

By the way, the State Department has refused to produce all the notes and corroborating evidence, but there are absolutely direct witnesses to the president's phone call. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman was on the call and went immediately to the embassy legal department because he knew it was wrong, what he heard. That's a military veteran.

There are a lot of people with direct knowledge and it's -- honestly, if I can say, it is heartbreaking to hear the president, any American president, deride an important process where reliable witnesses are giving information. It's also heartbreaking to realize once you see this evidence that any American president would engage in misconduct. You know, it gives me no pleasure to tell you the American president has abused his office and he should be accountable.

WALLACE: Well, as you say, people are going to get to see for themselves this week.

Congressman Maloney, thank you, thanks for joining us. And, of course, FOX News will cover the hearings this week live.

MALONEY: Thank you.

WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss whether anything will change now that the public will hear from these witnesses themselves.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: Coming up, Democratic front runner Joe Biden reacts to Michael Bloomberg looking at a run for the White House.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: In terms of he's running because of me, the last polls I looked at, I'm pretty far ahead.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel how a Bloomberg campaign would shake up the Democratic race. That's next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALIF.: Those open hearings will be an opportunity for the American people to evaluate the witnesses for themselves, but also to learn firsthand about the facts of the president's misconduct.

REP. MARK MEADOWS, R-N.C.: As we are more testimony, in fact the testimony that we're hearing today, it's actually getting easier to defend the president.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff and Republican Congressman Mark Meadows setting very different expectations for this week's public impeachment hearings.

And it's time now for our Sunday group. GOP strategist Karl Rove, Mo Elleithee of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service, former Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards, and Senator Mitch McConnell's former chief of staff, Josh Holmes.

Congresswoman Edwards, let me start with you.

What do you expect these public hearings to accomplish? We know what these witnesses are going to say. They -- we -- they -- their opening statements were leaked. Their full hours long transcripts have been -- have been put out there for anybody who's interested to read. They've been widely covered. It doesn't seem to have moved anybody. I mean the Democrats are foursquare in favor of impeachment and there doesn't seem to have been a single vote that's been swayed so far at least by House Republicans in favor of impeachment.

So what's the point?

DONNA EDWARDS, FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN, D-MD: Well, I mean, now it's time for the American people to see the evidence. I mean let's admit it, even -- I've read some of the transcripts but haven't read all of them and I think for the American people to be able to see these witnesses, to know their, you know, their backgrounds and that they are public servants and that they have a sense of duty coming before the committee, and I think that that will be really compelling.

And, you know, maybe it's not about swaying individual members of Congress right now, but it's about making sure that the American people put it out there because Congress are followers, right? They'll follow the public. And I think that it's really important for the American people to hear the lawlessness and the unconstitutional behavior of the president of the United States.

WALLACE: Karl, let's talk about the -- what we're going to hear in terms of the testimony this week. You worked in a White House. We're going to hear from three career foreign service officers. One of them, William Taylor, a military veteran, has served presidents since 1985. Ronald Reagan. They're going to talk about an off the books foreign policy. They're going to talk about an ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, who was smeared and recalled because of comments that were being made, a campaign being run by Rudy Giuliani, allegedly. They're going to hear about a link between U.S. support for Ukraine and Ukraine conducting investigations of the president's political rivals.

Obviously there's another side to the story, but that story, does it bother you?

KARL ROVE, CONTRIBUTOR: Well, as somebody who served in the White House, it does bother me, yes. But, on the other hand, there is constant friction between the State Department and an administration. We saw this during the Iraq War, where we had the people in the State Department leaking against the administration's policy. But, look, that's going to be the sideshow.

The thing that's going to happen when we have this testimony is, is that the Republicans are going to be able to ask questions. Think about where we've been. We have selective leaks of what -- of what these people said, which is done to spin it as much as possible against the president. Then we have their entire transcripts, which most people don't read. Now we're going to have televised hearings in which they're going to be able to say their piece and it's going to have an impact, but there also going to be questioned. And the questioning is going to get to, you know, we have a quid. Military aid and assistance for Ukraine. And we have a quo. And that quo is, investigative the Bidens and any other American involved in corruption. But so far we don't have the pro, the for, that is to say that what we know today is, is that the Ukrainians were never aware of a delay in their aid until they were given the aid and told that it had been delayed. And we never had that grant of the aid predicated upon them making a commitment to investigate Joe Biden.

And we're -- and the failure of the Democrats -- Schiff's statement last night was very problematic because the American people are going to want to hear about Joe Biden and Hunter Biden and Devon Archer (ph) and this stinky situation involving Burisma. And if the Democrats say, we're not going to allow you to have those people called, it's just going to simply add to the impression that this is a partisan witch hunt.

WALLACE: Mo.

MO ELLEITHEE, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS AND PUBLIC SERVICE: Ambassador Sondland did revise his testimony to say he did inform the Ukrainians that the aid would likely be contingent on this. So that's -- that's about where we are on that point.

Look, ultimately, I agree with the congresswoman, that now the American people get to see this stuff. And if you think about this politically and what actually -- you know, based on the very few precedents we have in American history on this, looking back on Richard Nixon, Republicans were with him. Republican voters were with him up until the very end. The day he left, the polling show that about 30 percent of Republicans thought he should be removed from office. But that 30 percent was a significant number because that's what put a lot of pressure on the Republican members of the Senate, when Barry Goldwater finally broke with the president and went to him and said, Mr. President, you know I've been your guy but it's become unsustainable for us. Right now you don't see that kind of breaking from Republican voters.

So the question becomes, do these hearings, as the congresswoman was saying, begin to mobilize and catalyze Republican voters? We know it's doing it for Democrats and we know it's doing it for independent voters.

WALLACE: But here's the question I have, and let me bring in Josh on this, because I understand that, you know, we pay much more attention to the leaks, we pay much more attention to the transcripts than most people do, but they are out there and they have been widely reported. They've been the lead on the evening news. They've been on the front page of the papers. And so far, Josh, it hasn't moved a single Republican vote.

JOSH HOLMES, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: Nor has it moved the Republican primary electorate. I mean I think, Mo, you have a good point there and what ultimately did in Nixon was his party basically beginning to turn on him. If you look at the American people right now, in particular the Republican primary electorate, not only are they not moving away from the president, it's heartening. I mean you've got numbers in 85 plus in terms of their view of this being a quote/unquote witch hunt.

So I -- look, we're a long way away from Republicans moving away from President Trump and embracing an impeachment inquiry. My guess is an open hearing in the House will only serve to exacerbate that. I don't think there's any chance that this is going to come off looking like a fair hearing or something that the president has had basically his say in.

WALLACE: I mean, that is the concern, I mean, that it hasn't moved the needle. And we've gotten a lot of information so far. I don't -- I mean I understand a TV -- well, I don't know if I understand because we -- everybody kept saying, you know, they won't read the book, they'll watch the movie and the Mueller hearing turned out to be a disaster for Democrats, I think we would agree.

So let's assume that this is more effective than Robert Mueller as a -- as a witness. Does it really move the needle? Because it hasn't so far, congresswoman.

EDWARDS: Well, look, this is actually very different kinds of behavior even than what we saw in the Mueller report. I mean we have a president of the United States who withheld aid from an ally who was, you know, on the front lines against our chief adversary. And I think when the American people here that it wasn't -- this isn't about 2016, this is about what is happening right now in 2020 prospectively for the 2020 election. And I think that these witnesses are going to make all the difference.

I mean when you look at a lieutenant colonel, Vindman, for example, you know, he'll be there and he'll be in his dress blues and, you know, fully decorated, raising his hand saying that he's telling the truth.

I defy Republicans to challenge on that. They are not challenging on the substance, they are challenging on process, and that is a loser argument.

WALLACE: All right, you get the final word.

ROVE: Process matters, fairness matters, that's why Nixon went down because the process was fair. This is not fair. They won't allow the -- they've got allowed the president any of the rights granted to President Clinton during his impeachment, or any of the rights granted to President Nixon during his impeachment.

And I love the fact -- I love the fact that the Democrats are now decrying the president's decision not to move aid -- lethal aid rapidly to Ukraine. After all, the previous administration, a Democratic administration, did nothing to send lethal aid to Ukraine and the nonlethal aid they refused to fly into Ukraine on C-130s because they didn't want U.S. military presence in Ukraine. So they drop them off in Poland and citizens had to take that nonlethal aid and put it in the back of their little vehicles and trucks and convey it to Ukraine.

WALLACE: OK.

ROVE: So this president at least had the guts to give the Ukrainians the lethal aid needed to stave off the Russian attempts to subvert that country.

WALLACE: Well, I think this is probably going to end up being a game changer and we're -- it will be a bipartisan game changer.

Panel, we have to take a break here. When we come back, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg looks ready to make a late entry into the 2020 Democratic race. Can he win the nomination?

Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the impact of a Bloomberg candidacy? Just go to FaceBook or Twitter at “Fox News Sunday” and we may use your question on the air.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm a New Yorker and I know a con when I see one.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: There's nobody I'd rather run against the little Michael.

SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Tonight we say to Michael Bloomberg and other billionaires, sorry, you ain't gonna buy this election!

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Well, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg getting pretty strong push back from both President Trump and Democratic Candidate Bernie Sanders on a possible run for the White House.

And we're back now with the panel.

Mo, let me start with you.

Does Michael Bloomberg have a realistic path to the Democratic nomination, and what do you think of what his strategists say if he does get in, and it seems likely will, his plan, skip the first four, skip Iowa, skip New Hampshire, and basically begin your campaign on Super Tuesday in early March?

ELLEITHEE: Yes, look, it's an uphill climb, I would think, for -- for Mayor Bloomberg. And there's no evidence -- we've never seen anyone who has successfully tried to skip the early states and go on to win the nomination. Not at least in the modern era. We've seen candidates who have tried to skip a state, skip Iowa and go straight to New Hampshire, skip New Hampshire and so to South Carolina --

WALLACE: Rudy Giuliani wanted to skip them all and go to Florida. That doesn't work out so well.

ELLEITHEE: Right, it just doesn't -- it doesn't work out so well.

But I think what Bloomberg is hoping here is that he can position himself to be sort of the moderate's last line of defense against the Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders wing of the party. That if Biden stumbles and is falling behind --

WALLACE: And right now he's in fourth place in Iowa and -- and not leading in New Hampshire either.

ELLEITHEE: And that whoever sort of stumbles out of those early states is going to be spent in terms of resources and organization. And those later states, to his credit, are sort of more air war states than they are ground game states. He's got the money to invest heavily in advertising, that he can be the guy who can sort of be the moderates' last line of defense. I think -- I'm a little skeptical that it works, but it is a strategy that, you know, that if Biden stumbles, it looks like he's going to, you know, try to put himself in position to execute.

WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel and on the possibility that Michael Bloomberg will get into this race, we got this on Facebook from Brad Yates. He writes, how does Bloomberg's stance on corporations stand against the current Democrat party's push toward socialism?

Congressman Edwards, how do you answer Brad basically on the -- on the question, is he just way too far to the right for this current Democratic Party?

EDWARDS: Well, I think that -- I mean I think that's a reasonable question but, look, there's no push toward socialism in the Democratic Party. But I do think that there is an understandable concern about income inequality and the -- a Michael Bloomberg candidacy actually puts that front and center. And the question of, are we going to allow 749 billionaires to control all of the wealth of 60 percent, the bottom 60 percent of Americans? And I think that's a legitimate debate for Democrats to have. We've been having that in our -- within our party.

WALLACE: How about the argument that billionaires like Bill Gates, like Michael Bloomberg, create enormous wealth and tremendous job opportunity and that that's actually what kind of feeds the bulldog?

EDWARDS: Absolutely they do and I worked for a corporation early in my career and I think that that is important.

But the question is, how do you pay your fair share to make certain that other Americans can aspire to their highest dreams too? Creating that wealth but also creating other opportunities for other Americans. I think that is a front and center debate of the Democratic Party and I think Michael Bloomberg's candidacy puts it right there in the middle.

And, you know, I'm looking forward to the debate because I think we've been engaged in this conversation for a long time and it's going to be important for any Democrat who wins in the Democratic primary to be able to unite the party. And I'm really not sure that a Michael Bloomberg is a candidate that can come and unite all of the factions of the Democratic Party.

WALLACE: All right, let's turn to the elections that were held this last Tuesday night, which were very interesting, where Democrats took control of the Virginia legislature for the first time in a quarter century and also it appears, although the Republican governor of Kentucky still won't concede, it appears that the Democrats have won the governor's seat in Kentucky.

President Trump talked in Kentucky, campaigning for the Republican governor the night before. Here's what he said.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: You've got to vote, because if you lose, it sends a really bad message. And if you lose, they're going to say, Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: So, Karl, how worried should the president and Republicans be, not so much about those specific results and those specific races, but what you saw and you saw it in 2018 and you saw it again here, the suburbs. The suburbs in Virginia. The suburbs in Kentucky. The suburbs in Pennsylvania, around Philadelphia, this continuing move away from a Republican Party to the Democrats?

ROVE: Yes, and, look, all suburbs are not the same. You mentioned Kentucky. In Kentucky you had a very --

WALLACE: You brought your whiteboard?

ROVE: I brought the whiteboard for the first time appearance on “Fox News Sunday.”

In the governor's race, the Republican got 48.8 percent of the vote. Right below him on the ballot is a fresh first-time candidate, African-American Republican candidate for attorney general, who gets 57.8 percent of the vote and 75,000 votes ahead of the guy above him on the ballot, runs nine points ahead of him. The rest of the ticket for agriculture commissioner, auditor, secretary of state and treasurer --

WALLACE: My goodness, this is Kentucky. It's a pretty red state.

ROVE: I understand. I understand. But the point is, is that in the suburbs, those candidates run 11 to 12 points ahead of the Republican candidate for governor and for the first time in the modern era the Republicans take all those down ballot offices, which says, if you've got good candidates who make an appeal, they can carry the Republican suburbs.

WALLACE: OK.

ROVE: But, warning, negative, southeast Pennsylvania, Montgomery Bucks (ph), Delaware and Chester, Republican strongholds. The Democrats took Delaware County for the first time. The county council is 5-0 Democrat. First time they've had a majority on the county council since the civil war.

And then in Virginia, we've known about northern Virginia fading away from the Republicans. In this election it was the Richmond suburbs of Henrico (ph) and Chesterfields (ph). The Republicans have got a problem in the suburbs and Kentucky says if you right -- run the right kind of campaign and have the right kind of Democrat, you can win. But (INAUDIBLE) a problem.

WALLACE: I want to -- I want to bring Josh in.

There's the continuing fallout from Elizabeth Warren's continuing plans, spending, taxing trillions of dollars. And there was blowback this week from two relatively surprising sources. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BILL GATES, CO-FOUNDER, MICROSOFT: When you say I should pay a hundred billion, OK, then I'm starting to do a little math about what I have left over.

JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, JP MORGAN CHASE: I don't like vilifying anybody. I -- you know, I think we should applaud successful people.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WALLACE: Josh, Bill Gates and Jamie Dimon, who's the CEO of JP Morgan, are certainly rich, but they are not conservatives by any stretch of the imagination. What does that say to you? I mean, obviously, they're two billionaires who are -- I guess Dimon's not a billionaire, but two rich guys. What does that say to you about their problems that Elizabeth Warren will have with her tax and spend policies in a general election?

HOLMES: I think the best sign that Elizabeth Warren has a real problem with sort of your center left Democratic constituency is the fact that we started this segment talking about Michael Bloomberg. I mean Michael Bloomberg said back in February that as long as Joe Biden is in this race and feels like he's got a comfortable hold on the nomination, he's not interested in running. But if the Democratic Party looks like it's auguring towards nominating somebody who's in that sort of left wing, sort of more extreme category --

WALLACE: But we should point out Michael Bloomberg's another billionaire.

HOLMES: Sure. Absolutely.

But here's the -- here's the point. The point is, is that Joe -- this all says a lot more about Joe Biden then it says about anything else. Joe Biden is now in a place where he has lost his hold on the Democratic primary electorate and the Democratic primary electorate is looking for an Elizabeth Warren. That's what -- you know, with all due respect to Bill Gates --

WALLACE: (INAUDIBLE) Elizabeth Warren or --

HOLMES: No, no, with all -- with all due respect to Bill Gates and all the other billionaires who have critiques about where the Democratic Party is, the Democratic primary electorate is saying loud and clear for anybody who will listen, we like Elizabeth Warren. We like Bernie Sanders. We have had five or six candidates try the center rode here and we have run them out of town in this -- in this primary electorate.

ELLEITHEE: You've got Biden and Buttigieg --

EDWARDS: Joe Biden --

ELLEITHEE: Are -- are doing about as well combined as Warren and Sanders are doing combined.

HOLMES: Well, he's -- look, he's lost --

ROVE: One's at seven and one's at 20.

ELLEITHEE: The moderates --

ROVE: And the other two are at 18 and 22.

ELLEITHEE: Not in Iowa. In Iowa those four are clustered very closely together.

Look, in 2018, more center left Democrats won congressional primaries than far left Democrats won congressional primaries with a primary (INAUDIBLE).

HOLMES: But it's not happening in the 2020 cycle. And I've got to tell you, people --

ROVE: There's a lot more far left Democrats won primaries in 2020 than won in 2018 or 2016.

ELLEITHEE: We'll see.

EDWARDS: This hasn't shaken out yet, so -- I mean it hasn't shaken out at all and everything's still (INAUDIBLE).

WALLACE: So the battle continues. Thank you all, panel. See you next Sunday.

Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week,"" the dedication it takes to escort the nation's bravest to their final resting place.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WALLACE: On this Veterans Day weekend, we want to introduce you to a special military unit whose mission is to pay final tribute to the men and women who have defended our freedom. Here is our ""Power Player of the Week.""

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

CAPTAIN ZACKARY STEELMAN, U.S. ARMY OLD GUARD CAISSON PLATOON: It's our honor to be able to provide them the best ceremony that they deserve and that their families deserve, to just pay it back to them the way that they've paid it to us.

WALLACE: Captain Zackary Steelman is talking about the Old Guard Caisson Platoon that bears the casket for military funerals at Arlington National Cemetery.

Two teams go out, one with white horses, one with black. Each participating in as many as four funerals a day. But the platoon is determined every one will be special.

STEELMAN: That family isn't going to get a second funeral. We have to put as much effort and time into making sure every detail of what we do is the best we can make it.

Do what you've got to do.

WALLACE: A squad is up at 4:30 each morning to make sure it's perfect. The horses are sprayed till they glean. The tack is shined. And so is the caisson that carried a canon back in the First World War.

Then, the horses are hitched up. The lead team that takes the caisson through the cemetery, the swing team that gets around tight corners, and the wheel team that acts as breaks. Then, they call out the mission.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Attention to orders! Zero nine, grant (ph) the 12 alpha, colonel, United States Air Force.

Swing?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ready!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Lead?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ready!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wheel?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ready!

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Caisson forward! Out (ph)!

WALLACE (on camera): Why do you have to do all of that?

STEELMAN: Well, it's not that we have to do any of those things, sir, it's really that we get to do those things. We're about to perform a funeral and we're about to perform the mission for that family and we want to make sure that we're doing it to the absolute best ability that we have for them.

WALLACE (voice over): The caisson platoon is part of presidential funerals. A riderless horse named Black Jack was in John Kennedy's procession. When he stepped on his handlers toe, the soldier kept marching.

In 2004, the military honors were for Ronald Reagan. The riderless horse was named Sergeant York, he is still part of the platoon.

STEELMAN: Sergeant York is the oldest horse that we have here in the barn. He's actually 29.

WALLACE (on camera): Twenty-nine?

STEELMAN: Yes, sir.

WALLACE: Reagan used to say that there's nothing as good for the inside of a man as the outside of a horse.

STEELMAN: Yes, sir.

WALLACE: He would have loved this one.

WALLACE (voice over): Captain Steelman signed up for the Army's armor branch. When he joined the caisson platoon, he had never been on a horse. Now he thinks it's as important as any other mission.

WALLACE (on camera): How long do you want to keep being in the caisson platoon.

STEELMAN: If I could, sir, I'd be here for the rest of my life. I absolutely love this job.

I get to see soldiers every single day put in a lot of hard work for someone they really don't even know. I'm honored to be able to bring them to their final resting place. And it's just an honor to be a part of that specific mission.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

WALLACE: Horses in the caisson platoon are put up for adoption after the service is complete. And right now Elvira, a member of the swing team for 16 years, is available. If you want to find out more, please go to our website, foxnewssunday.com.

And before we go, here's a live look at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Our colleagues at Fox NFL Sunday there for a special Veterans Day broadcast as a salute to the troops.

And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next “Fox News Sunday.”

JPMorgan's CEO, Jamie Dimon, in an interview with CBS, doubled down on his retort against Elizabeth Warren.

""I think you should vilify Nazis, but you shouldn't vilify people who worked hard to accomplish things,"" Dimon said.

Dimon, who is worth about $1.6 billion, was also quizzed on his $31 million salary, saying it wasn't up to him.

View Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

JPMorgan's CEO, Jamie Dimon, in an interview with CBS doubled down on his retort against Elizabeth Warren.

Dimon, who is worth $1.6 billion according to Forbes, spoke with CBS's Lesley Stahl on ""60 Minutes"", where he touched on the causes of the 2008 financial crash, the American economy and cancer survival.

Stahl asked Dimon: ""So Elizabeth Warren said in Iowa the other day, 'Our democracy has been hijacked by the rich and powerful,' and you jumped in and said this week about her that she was 'vilifying successful people and having harsh words for Wall Street bankers.'""

Dimon responded: ""Most people are good, not all of 'em,"" adding, ""I think you should vilify Nazis, but you shouldn't vilify people who worked hard to accomplish things. And so my comment is, I think it's American society – we're just attacking each other all the time.""

Dimon, who has been at the helm of America's biggest bank since 2005, has publicly spatted with Warren about the topic of billionaires, with the CEO saying in the past: ""She uses some pretty harsh words — some would say vilifies successful people. We should applaud successful people.""

In the ""60 Minutes"" interview, which aired on Sunday, Dimon also criticized Trump's tax cuts — despite the policy boosting JPMorgan profits $3.7 billion. JPMorgan has crushed earnings targets this year, with the last quarter results boasting a record level of revenue.

""I would not have cut the tax on the rich. I would've extended the Earned Income Tax Credit instead – which is like a negative income tax credit for lower-paid people,"" said Dimon in the interview.

He added: ""We probably should change the minimum wage, which I don't think has been changed for like 10 or 15 years. There are solutions to these problems. The problems are real. It does not mean Free Enterprise is bad.""

Dimon was also quizzed on his pay by Stahl in the heated exchange below:

Lesley Stahl: ""Let's talk about the wage gap in this country between the rich and almost everybody else. How much of a problem do you see that?""

Jamie Dimon: ""I think it's a huge problem and I think the wealthy have been getting wealthier too much, in many ways. So middle-class incomes have been kinda flat for maybe 15 years or so. And that's not particularly good in America. But in particular, at the low end, 40% of Americans make $15 an hour or less. They've particularly been left behind.""

Lesley Stahl: ""You're talking about people who earn very little money. Listen to this statistic. Compensation for executives, CEOs, grew 940%, 940%, in the last 40 years. Your average worker, so middle class, middle class, grew 12%.""

Jamie Dimon: ""We haven't done a good job growing our economy. And that would fix a lot of that problem.""

Lesley Stahl: ""Executive pay: Last year you were paid $31 million. Too high?""

Jamie Dimon: ""The board sets mine. I have nothing to do with it.""

Lesley Stahl: ""Well, you could return some of it.""

Jamie Dimon: ""I could. Is that gonna solve any of those problems?""

Lesley Stahl: ""I don't know.""

Jamie Dimon: ""Is it going to solve any of those problems?""

Lesley Stahl: ""No but you could set an example and say, ""I'm not going to take all that money. I don't need it.""

Jamie Dimon: ""I could. I'm going to leave it to the board to set my comp. Not you, not the press--""

Lesley Stahl: ""You've answered every one of my questions but this one you're fobbing off.'

Jamie Dimon: ""Yeah, the board has to do it.""

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.): You have said that there’s already enough evidence for President… [+4411 chars]","To ask ""the American people"" to decide the proper resolution of the Ukraine scandal is to assume the president intends to play fair over the next 12 months.",2019-11-11,MSNBC,Why the question of Trump's impeachment can't wait for Election Day,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/why-the-question-trumps-impeachment-cant-wait-election-day,"About a month ago, at the start of the most recent Democratic presidential primary debate, CNN’s Anderson Cooper began the event by posing a familiar question to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.): “You have said that there’s already enough evidence for President Trump to be impeached and removed from office. But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn’t it be the voters who determine the president’s fate?”

In a new interview with CBS News’ Norah O’Donnell, former Ambassador Nikki Haley, made a related argument:

“I think the biggest thing that bothers me is the American people should decide this. Why [do] we have a bunch of people in Congress making this decision?”

Those familiar with American Civics 101 probably realize the reason “a bunch of people in Congress” are working on an impeachment inquiry is because that’s how the process is supposed to work under the U.S. Constitution. What’s more, we have “a bunch of people in Congress” grappling with how to address presidential abuses because “the American people” decided to put the House of Representatives in the hands of a Democratic majority – made up of members who ran on a platform of holding Trump accountable.

I’m going to assume that Haley, a former top member of Donald Trump’s team, knows all of this. I’ll also assume that the point she intended to make was about delaying judgment on the president’s apparent misconduct until Election Day 2020. Indeed, the former South Carolina governor added on Twitter over the weekend, “This is a decision for the American people.”

It’s an increasingly popular pitch in GOP circles. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), who’ll retire from elected office next year, recently argued, “An election, which is just around the corner, is the right way to decide who should be president.” Similarly, Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas), the ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee, added yesterday, “Let the American people decide this in less than a year.”

At face value, this may seem like one of the GOP’s less ridiculous arguments. Trump was caught crossing the line, and if voters have a problem with the president’s abuses, they can vote for someone new next November. If, on the other hand, voters are unmoved, the electorate can make that clear, too.

There are, however, a couple of serious flaws with this.

NBC News’ First Read team published an item in September about the Ukraine scandal, just as it was starting to break, that stuck with me:

If this is what this looks like … then it’s arguably worse than Watergate, when the dirty tricks were being conducted by Americans against Americans. But this time, is the dirty trick a sitting president dangling aid to a foreign country to get it to investigate a rival campaign? We learned from 2016 that the Trump campaign will do whatever it takes to win. Do national Democrats – who believe defeating Trump in 2020, not impeaching him, is the best way to remove him from office – understand what else we might see over the next 14 months?

The Trump campaign will do whatever it takes to win. That, in a nutshell, is why the scandal can’t wait. One of the key pillars of the whole controversy has been a simple fact: Trump intended to cheat in the election by way of an extortion scheme. The president, rightly or wrongly, saw Joe Biden as a credible electoral threat, which led him to push a vulnerable foreign ally to cook up some dirt Republicans could use before Election Day.

To let this go unpunished is to effectively encourage the president who knows no limits, and believes there can be no checks on his misconduct, to keep exploring other cheating options.

The broader national goal should be to ensure that the United States has a free and fair election next year. Trump has already taken steps that are fundamentally at odds with that goal.

It’s not as if the president has rolled out some kind of “mea culpa” defense, acknowledging poor judgment, and assuring the public that he intends to stop trying to screw around with the 2020 cycle. On the contrary, Trump has done largely the opposite, insisting his actions were “perfect,” permissible, and literally unimpeachable.

As New York’s Jon Chait recently put it, “Using his foreign-policy authority to leverage dirt on Americans who oppose him is not a mistake, it is Trump’s ongoing campaign strategy. Either he will be removed from office over it, or he will use that strategy to try to win reelection.”

To ask “the American people” to decide the proper resolution is to assume the president intends to play fair over the next 12 months. Trump has already made it painfully obvious that he has a very different plan in mind."

Here's why,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-elizabeth-warren-wall-street-big-tech-enemies,"One thing we know for sure about Elizabeth Warren, above all else, is that on economic questions, she's a sincere populist. Warren is deeply distressed by income inequality. She profoundly distrusts Wall Street and Big Tech. She hates monopolies and massive multi-generational concentrations of wealth.

So if you're a private equity chieftain, for example, or a weed-smoking ""trustafarian"" living off family money in Jackson Hole, you've got to be terrified of Elizabeth Warren.

How could you not be terrified? Listen to her talk:

BIDEN EDGES RIVALS, BUTTIGIEG JOINS TOP TIER IN NEW NEW HAMPSHIRE POLL

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, R-Mass. and 2020 presidential candidate: Now they've got their fortunes and their money managers and their PR ...

And they're getting richer, faster and faster and faster, and everybody else is getting left behind.

The wealth tax -- the two-cent wealth tax. God, I love that wealth tax, right?

I'm not willing to give up and let a handful of monopolists dominate our economy and our democracy. It's time to fight back.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER

""Oh, it's time to fight back against the monopolists who dominate our economy!"" Sound familiar? Actually, that's not too far from what Donald Trump ran on in 2016, back before Paul Ryan and the Ayn Rand people got ahold of his economic program.

But this time around, Elizabeth Warren plans to steal that message -- the Trump message really. Warren claims that she is the radical populist here. She is the disruptor.

But is she? Let's see.

Emily Tisch Sussman is a woke liberal who often appears in cable television to talk about Democratic politics. Nice person, but she is the daughter of two billionaires. So you'd think that Emily Tisch Sussman would hate Elizabeth Warren.

But she doesn't. Instead, she demands that you support Elizabeth Warren. or else you're sexist. Here's what she said recently:

Emily Tisch Sussman, Democratic activist: I actually heard -- overheard -- someone saying what I thought was an interesting point: That basically at this point, if you are still supporting [Bernie] Sanders as opposed to Warren, it's kind of showing your sexism because she has more detailed plans and her plans have evolved.

I thought it was an interesting point. And I think there may be something to it.

Yes, there might be something to it. If you don't support Warren, you're a sexist!

Now, keep in mind, you just saw one of the richest people on Planet Earth demanding that you support Elizabeth Warren for president. Surprising, right?

Elizabeth Warren is really just this season's Hillary Clinton -- faithful party robot, stalwart defender of the prerogatives of the establishment.

Well, actually, it turns out that some of Warren's most fervent supporters are the very people she claims she wants to fight. Well, that's weird.

So, for example, in the third quarter of this year, Elizabeth Warren raised more money from Silicon Valley, from those ""monopolists"" she claims to hate, than anybody else running for president.

Spotify's CEO is an Elizabeth Warren fan; so is Silicon Valley venture capitalist and billionaire Chris Sacca. He has already maxed out to her campaign. Really? The billionaires supporting her?

Then last month, Charlie Gasparino over on Fox Business reported that Elizabeth Warren's campaign is making overtures to finance moguls on Wall Street seeking contributions -- and some of them are responding.

But wait a second. Why would Elizabeth Warren's enemies -- and these have got to be her enemies, she attacks them all the time on the campaign trail -- why would her enemies fund her campaign?

We will give you five seconds to think about it, but the answer, of course, is they're not really her enemies. They understand that Warren doesn't really mean what she says. They know that Warren's populism is a facade and underneath it all, she is really just this season's Hillary Clinton -- faithful party robot, stalwart defender of the prerogatives of the establishment.

That's what it seems like she really is.

Is she?

* After nearly three decades on Capitol Hill, 75-year-old Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) announced this morning that he’ll retire at the end of this Congress. King’s Long Island district is considered competitive and will likely be a key 2020 congressional battleground.

* On a related note, Bevin hasn’t been able to substantiate his allegations of voting “irregularities,” but his allies are assisting in the search for “suspicious activity or voter fraud.”

* There was one unresolved state House race in Virginia, which Democrat Nancy Guy appears to have won. As a result, the Democratic majority in the House of Delegates will be 55-45.

* On a related note, this summarized recent electoral developments in Virginia nicely: “A GOP candidate hasn’t won statewide office in Virginia since 2009. On Tuesday, Democrats gained majorities in both houses of the General Assembly for the first time in a generation; the House of Delegates swung from a 66-34 Republican edge in 2017 to a 55-45 Democratic advantage for next year’s session.”

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., put America's billionaires front-and-center on the campaign trail last week and mocked those speaking out against her proposed wealth tax.

""Boy, there are some billionaires who don't like this,"" Warren said Friday in Goose Creek, South Carolina. ""I think I hurt someone's feelings... This is sad. So... people are saying, 'Oh, I'm just mean to the billionaires.""

Among those speaking out against Warren's proposals last week were Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. Dimon even suggested Warren may have been vilifying ""successful people.""

On Fox Nation's ""Deep Dive,"" Stephen Moore, a former senior economic adviser to President Trump and a distinguished visiting fellow for the Heritage Foundation's Project for Economic Growth, took on Warren's case against America's wealthiest.

""The vast majority of people in the top 1 percent... [t]hey own, operate or invest in small businesses,"" Moore said. ""They are the job creators and the wealth creators of our economy.""

""Look at what Bill Gates and a person like Jeff Bezos have done,"" Moore added. ""They've created hundreds and thousands of jobs. They've created... higher incomes... I hate this bashing of the rich.""

Moore argued that policymakers should be more focused on growing the economy than redistributing the wealth of some Americans through higher taxes.

""What I care about is -- as John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan used to say -- let's create a rising tide that lifts all boats. And, I think under Trump, that's what's happening. You know, we're seeing all income groups benefit from this expansion,"" he said.

John Grace, the founder and president of Investors Advantage Corp., argued that the growing disparity between the wealth of Americans needed to be addressed.

""I think it's worth noting in 1962, when we look at the top 1 percent versus the bottom 99 percent, at that point, it was pretty equal, 30 to 34 percent was the share of wealth,"" Grace said. ""By 2016, the top 1 percent is garnering over 40 percent of the wealth and the bottom 90 percent is generating a whopping 20 percent of the wealth. So, one has dramatically increased.""

SANDERS, WARREN 'INCOME INEQUALITY' ARGUMENT IS BOGUS: EXPERT PANEL EXPLAINS

In conclusion, Moore said he saw Warren's proposals as more punitive than productive.

""My friend, [economist] Art Laffer, says, 'You want a tax system that tries to make poor people rich, not make rich people poor.' Sometimes I think some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have that wrong,"" he said.

""There are certain problems out there. But... all I'm hearing from the Democrats right now is, sock it to the rich and give it to the poor... Income redistribution is not an economic growth plan,"" Moore concluded.

The survey – from Quinnipiac University – also suggested that South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has joined Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders in the top tier of contenders in New Hampshire.

According to the poll – which was released Monday – Biden stood at 20 percent support among likely Democratic primary voters in the Granite State.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENITAL CAMPAIGN

Warren, who hailed from neighboring Massachusetts, had the backing of 16 percent, with Buttigieg at 15 percent. Sanders – who’s long lived in neighboring Vermont and who crushed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire’s 2016 presidential primary – registered at 14 percent.

The survey showed Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii at 6 percent, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 4 percent and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and billionaire businessman and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer each at 3 percent. No other candidate in the large field of Democrats seeking to unseat President Trump topped 1 percent.

The Quinnipiac poll differed from a University of New Hampshire survey for CNN that was conducted in late October. Sanders topped that poll, at 21 percent, with Warren at 18 percent, Biden at 15 percent and Buttigieg at 10 percent.

Granite Staters traditionally have been known as late deciders, and with just under three months to go until New Hampshire’s February primary, that’s reflected in the new survey. Fourteen percent of those questioned said they were undecided, and nearly two-thirds of those who said they’re backing a candidate suggested they might change their mind before the primary day.

BLOOMBERG FACES HIGH HURDLES IF HE JUMPS INTO WHITE HOUSE RACE

The poll was conducted as former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg started taking steps toward jumping into the presidential nomination race. Aides to the billionaire business mogul and environmental and gun control crusader said Friday that if Bloomberg were to run, he’d likely skip campaigning in New Hampshire and the three other early voting states in the primary and caucus presidential nominating calendar.

According to the survey, only 2 percent said they would definitely vote for Bloomberg if he ran, with 37 percent saying they’d consider backing him. A majority – 54 percent – said they definitely would not vote for Bloomberg.

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted November 6-10, with 1,134 New Hampshire likely Democratic primary voters questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s margin of error was plus or minus 3.8 percentage points."

After panderfest forums, boring speeches and inconclusive debates, many Dems now sound like Peggy Lee as they ask, “Is that all there is?”

While most remain wildly enthusiastic about defeating Trump, they are far from ready to unite behind a single candidate. Even worse, the ideological split in the party is so serious that it might not be healed before Election Day.

The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., stands at 22 percent among likely Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa, according to the Monmouth University survey, with former Vice President Joe Biden at 19 percent, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 18 percent and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 13 percent.

Buttigieg’s 3-percentage-point advantage over Biden is within the poll’s margin of error, but represents a remarkable surge in recent months.

BUTTIGIEG JOINS TOP-TIER OF CONTENDERS IN NEW POLL IN NEW HAMPSHIRE

Buttigieg has soared 14 points since Monmouth’s last survey in Iowa, which was conducted in August. Biden’s dropped 7 points, Warren’s edged down 2 points, and Sanders has jumped 5 points from the August survey.

The Monmouth survey, released on Tuesday, is the latest in Iowa to indicate Buttigieg has joined the top tier of candidates, at least in that state. A Quinnipiac University survey in Iowa released last week showed Warren at 20 percent, Buttigieg at 19 percent, Sanders at 17 percent and Biden at 15 percent.

Buttigieg, the longest of longshots for the nomination when he launched his campaign at the beginning of the year, first soared in the spring to middle-tier status. The U.S. Naval Reserve veteran who served in Afghanistan and who would be the first openly gay president if elected surged again over the past month to reach top-tier status.

“Buttigieg is emerging as a top pick for a wide variety of Iowa Democrats. While he has made nominally bigger gains among older caucus-goers, you really can’t pigeonhole his support to one particular group. He is doing well with voters regardless of education or ideology,” said Patrick Murray, the director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute.

THE LATEST POLLING FROM FOX NEWS

The survey indicates Sen. Amy Klobuchar from neighboring Minnesota at 5 percent, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, and billionaire businessman and environmental advocate Tom Steyer each at 3 percent, and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii at 2 percent. The rest of the large field of Democratic White House hopefuls registered at 1 percent or less. Support for Harris dropped by 9 points since the August poll, while the rest of the candidates stood within a point or two of their August standing.

The poll’s release comes as former New York City mayor and billionaire business mogul Mike Bloomberg takes concrete steps toward launching a Democratic presidential campaign. The survey indicates that among Iowa Democrats, Bloomberg has a 17 percent favorable rating and 48 percent unfavorable rating.

“Reports suggest that Bloomberg will skip the February contests if he does get into the race. With dismal numbers like these, it’s easy to see why. But I really cannot imagine that Democrats in the Super Tuesday states would be significantly more receptive to him than Iowa voters,” Murray said.

BLOOMBERG'S BARRIERS TO RUNNING AND WINNING THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION

The Monmouth University poll was conducted Nov. 7-11, with 451 Iowa voters likely to take part in the state’s Democratic presidential caucuses questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s margin of error is plus or minus 4.6 percentage points."

Guy Benson: It's Tuesday, November 12, 2019. Welcome to The Guy Bensons show. I'm Guy Benson live in Washington, D.C., coming to you coast to coast. Always appreciate you being here. Guy Benson, Show Dot.com is our Web site. We've got a big lineup for you on this Tuesday. Eli Lake will be here, Juan Williams as well. Oh, some news about my alma mater, Northwestern, not making me happy. A big embarrassing scandal at the journalism school or at least a student newspaper. I will address all of that coming up. But we begin today's show with a first time guest. We are pleased to welcome Senator John Cornyn, senior senator from the great state of Texas, a Republican. He serves on the Judiciary Committee, the Finance Committee, the Intelligence Committee. He's also seeking reelection next year. Senator, thanks for being here.

Sen. Cornyn: Thanks, guy. Good to be with you.

Guy Benson: Well, I have to ask you, the biggest news of the day, at least here in Washington, people are anticipating tomorrow the kickoff of open hearings, public hearings in the impeachment process over on the other side of Capitol Hill. As you take a look at this process unfolding from down the hall in the Senate, what would it, in your view, a fair process look like in the House? And if they move forward with impeachment, which I think they probably will. What would a fair trial process look like in the Senate?

Sen. Cornyn: Well, unfortunately, Guy, Nancy Pelosi knew that if you produced a partisan articles of impeachment, that it would taint, taint this whole process in the eyes of the American people and be unsuccessful in the Senate, where it requires two thirds of the Senate to vote, to convict and remove. And fortunately, I don't think there's anything they can do at this point to restore the impression that this is a fair and fair process. I think finally, after Adam Schiff has been interviewing people behind closed doors and then selectively leaking information that supports their narrative, finally they're going to open it to the public. But I don't think anybody should be under the illusion that this is is a fair process, by the way. This is would be the fourth time in American history where this process has been started and none of them have resulted in the forced removal of a president. Obviously, President Clinton resigned. Excuse me. Nixon resigned. Clinton was not removed. And so during this one year before the next election, and basically eliminating the possibility of doing anything else constructive during this time period strikes me as is is a futile act.

Guy Benson: I mean, I struggle to envision a scenario where the Democrats don't impeach the president, the president, and kick it over to the upper chamber. If that happens, if and when that happens, do you think the process of a trial would look at least somewhat similar to what we saw in the late 90s with Bill Clinton?

Sen. Cornyn: Yes. I think what happened then is Tom Daschle and Trent Lott negotiated essentially a standing order or a process by which the evidence was presented by the impeachment managers. And then the president's lawyers got to respond, which lasted basically five weeks. But this is going to be kind of an out of body experience, I think, for most Americans watching senators sit there, not being able to speak with the chief justice presiding over this partisan enterprise. I just why would call the call the Senate, the jury here. Ordinarily, you would think of a jury as being disinterested and impartial. But obviously, this is a partisan process from start to finish. It's not going to work. And unfortunately, with Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff are going to further divide the country with no nothing really to show for it in the end.

Guy Benson: No, Senator, I can imagine some of your colleagues in the Senate who are running for president. I think it might be very difficult for them to sit there speechless, literally not able to talk. Given the political season that we are all in. Last question on this. You're on the Intelligence Committee in the Senate. Talk about the distinction, because over in the House now, for years it has been extremely partisan, extremely acrimonious in the House Intelligence Committee. But that really hasn't been the case in the Senate with Chairman Burr and Ranking Member Warner. It seems like it's been a lot more collegial and professional and serious. Why?

Sen. Cornyn: Well, I appreciate you saying that. I think it's because I think we all see the the benefit to the Senate as an institution into the country and the intelligence community for us to try not to let this the important work that we do fall victim to partisan wrangling. I don't think this is covered the House with glory even under the previous when Republicans were in the majority. Unfortunately. The house is a little more rambunctious than the upper chamber, sometimes referred to as the House of Lords, but are. But that's something we work very hard to try to do throughout a very difficult investigation over the Russian Russian act. The active measures during the 2016 campaign and beyond. We haven't always succeeded, but we've certainly tried.

Guy Benson: Senator, you represent Texas, a huge border state. I'm wondering your reaction to some of the really extraordinary violence that we've seen south of the border in recent days, including one of the major cartels effectively defeating Mexican forces in a battle and being forced to release drug kingpins son from custody and then this really horrific massacre of American citizens. That has to be something of concern. And I think it underscores when when people talk about border security, it's not just a political talking point. There are some very dangerous realities in a country that is sitting. Exactly. You know, due south of your state.

Sen. Cornyn: Exactly. Well, obviously, under Lopez Obrador, he essentially as waved a white flag when it comes to taking on the cartels. And they are very big and powerful and well-armed and they are wealthy and well organized. And they their tentacles reach into all aspects of Mexican life, including the government. And it is a growing concern. Ordinarily, the cartels would not and would not try to attack Americans because they would realize that would raise the visibility of their activities in a way that would get some unwanted attention. But right now, Mexico controls a little more than half of their landmass. Almost half of their landmass is controlled by the cartels, including all the region adjacent to the U.S. Mexico border. We can't ignore this because we are we we're for better or for worse, joined together by that common border. And our economies are are very dependent on one another. But I think we're all trying to figure out what comes next. Because we can't allow Americans to be targeted in Mexico and just have us do nothing in response. So we're trying to figure that one out right now. But this really raises the whole concern to a new level.

Guy Benson: Senator Cornyn, another issue separately that you've been talking about quite a lot recently involves drug prices, which is not necessarily a sexy topic for talk radio, where everyone gets heated and passionate, but it's a pocketbook issue that matters to millions of people, especially senior citizens. And you seem to be frustrated at the moment because there's a bipartisan bill that's way late, at least for now. Talk about the bill and what's happening.

Sen. Cornyn: Well, this is once something that I thought that the administration was interested in tackling. Certainly Republicans and Democrats see this as a pocketbook issue. And we're hearing a lot from our constituents about their high out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs. We did pass a bill unanimously through the Judiciary Committee has to do with patent patent thickets. It's called where drug companies will file tens, sometimes more than 100 individual patents and in a way to discourage any generic competition. For example, there's a drug humerus, which is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in the world. And it's a wonder drug. But the company who patented it has more than 120 separate patents on the same molecule. And in Europe, there are four competitors in place. So obviously we need more competition and to bring down prices and produce more affordable medications for our people. And it's a it's something I'm afraid is falling quickly, falling the casualty to impeachment mania. But in this specific instance, I've gone to the floor with Richard Blumenthal, my Democratic colleague from Connecticut, and it's been blocked by Senator Schumer. We're going to be back again this week to try to have some political accountability for blocking this common sense bill.

Guy Benson: What is his justification for blocking it?

Sen. Cornyn: Well, I think because he can and because he doesn't want Republicans to get any credit for anything positive in this area during an election cycle, election year coming up on an election. But I think we're going to try to smoke him out later this week. And in the end, I don't think you'll be able to sustain his position blocking it, because it's not it's not a partisan bill, but it is one that will actually lower drug costs for consumers. And I think that's a hard position to sustain.

Guy Benson: Senator, on that point, right, I'm all for choice and competition. I'm a. Capitalist I'm someone who believes in all of those fundamental values when it comes to an issue like the development of new miracle drugs. Right. I can understand if you bring in generic competitors, prices come down for the American people. I'm all for that. I'm in favor of that, of course. The counter argument that you sometimes hear from the pharmaceutical companies is it takes and this is true. It takes huge amounts of money to in research and development to innovate and create new drugs. And if they can't sort of get the benefit, the windfall from doing so, it disincentive Vice's research, development and innovation. What are the protections that these types of laws have to make sure that innovation isn't immediately sort of ripped off by competitors?

Sen. Cornyn: Well, you accurately described, I think, our intellectual property protection system under our under the Constitution that the you can patent something and you have exclusive rights to sell it for a period of time. The question is whether that time can be artificially extended by gamesmanship rather than by by the by the traditional patent protection period after which there is competition by generic generic competitors. And so they can recoup the costs of their research and development of these lifesaving drugs. We don't want to discourage innovation and we do want to protect intellectual property. But after a point there, it really becomes a matter of them maintaining their exclusive right to sell something by by artificially precluding that kind of competition, which we know in the end ultimately will benefit consumers and bring down prices, too.

Guy Benson: Senator, on health care, one of your colleagues running for president, Elizabeth Warren, has openly conceded. She has said that her single payer health care plan would make health care, private health care coverage illegal for 180 million people. She's openly considered that it would kill 2 million jobs. She has openly conceded that it would apply and be given by the taxpayers to illegal immigrants. She's she's admitting these things. And I wonder what you make of that. Not just on substance, but as a political matter.

Sen. Cornyn: Well, it's surreal to hear the here. After many years of arguing the Affordable Care Act was somehow the panacea that was going to solve all of our health care concerns. To hear Elizabeth Warren and other other radicals in her party say that's not good enough anymore, we want to take full control over your health care choices. And it will have the consequence that you just described, an incredible increase in costs and longer lines. By the way. And would would would destroy the private health insurance that 180 or so million people get from their employer. I think, you know, the Democrats have lost control of their party to their to their radical base. Nancy Pelosi has lost control of them and leading it to this ill, ill considered impeachment process, partisan impeachment process. But it looks like the base of the party is supporting Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. And these things like the Green New Deal, Medicare for all, which are just completely unrealistic, will break break the bank and will concede more control to the federal government and less freedom for individuals to choose what they think is best for themselves and their families.

Guy Benson: Senator Cornyn, last question briefly. Jeff Sessions announcing he wants his old job back. You served with him for a long time, a senator from Alabama. Your thoughts on him jumping back into the race, having served as attorney general for a while?

Sen. Cornyn: Well, Jeff Sessions is a friend of mine, and I did serve with him for a long time in the Senate before he became attorney general. Obviously, he got crosswise with the president when he recused himself from the from the investigation over the Russian activities. I believe he did had no choice but to do that under Department of Justice guidelines. I think he's he's conducted himself honorably to the best of his ability. He hadn't attacked the president, which I think is smart. And he's decided to go back and run and serve the people of Alabama. And I wish him well.

Guy Benson: Senator John Cornyn of Texas. We really appreciate your time. We'd love to have you back, sir.

Sen. Cornyn: I'd love to come back. Thank you. Thank you very much.

Guy Benson: We'll make that happen. And we'll take a quick break as we just get going. It's Tuesday. It's the Guy Benson Show. Don't go anywhere."
31,Associated Press,Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg says if elected he'd like to name a woman to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs for the first time as 2020 hopefuls take aim at President Donald Trump's record on stemming military suicide and helping fema… [+5426 chars],Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg says if elected he'd like to name a woman to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs for the first time as 2020 hopefuls take aim at President Donald Trump's record on stemming military suicide and helping fema…,2019-11-11,Fox News,Buttigieg backs female as VA secy as Dems release vet plans,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/buttigieg-backs-female-as-va-secy-as-dems-release-vet-plans,"Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg says if elected he'd like to name a woman to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs for the first time as 2020 hopefuls take aim at President Donald Trump's record on stemming military suicide and helping female vets.

On Veterans Day, several candidates rolled out proposals to meet the needs of America's 20 million former service members.

Trump, speaking in New York City's Veterans Day Parade, praised the strength of the U.S. military and the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, saying the nation's veterans ""risked everything for us. Now it is our duty to serve and protect them every single day of our lives."" More than 100 protesters booed and held black balloons that read ""support our troops, impeach.""

Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said female veterans and service members have been neglected, including on concerns about sexual harassment and women's health. Women are the military's fastest-growing subgroup.

""I think leadership plays a huge role so absolutely I'd seek to name a woman to lead VA,"" Buttigieg, a former Navy intelligence officer, said in an interview with The Associated Press. His comments went a step beyond his 21-page wide-ranging plan released on Monday.

""The president has let veterans down,"" Buttigieg said.

Of the Cabinet and Cabinet-level roles, four have never been held by a woman: Veterans Affairs, Defense, Treasury and White House chief of staff. Buttigieg says he'd take a close look at appointing a female defense secretary as well.

Former Vice President Joe Biden said he would seek to build on substantial gains for vets that were started under the Obama-Biden administration, such as stemming homelessness and improving mental health care.

Biden said he would ""restore trust"" in the VA after failed leadership, putting in place at least one full-time women's primary care physician at each VA medical center to boost women's health care and provide $300 million to better understand the impact of traumatic brain injury.

He said as president he would publish a comprehensive strategy to address veterans' suicide within his first 200 days in office and hire additional staff to ensure that in his first year of office wait times for vets at risk of suicide are reduce to zero.

""Our veterans deserve leaders who will fight for them as ardently and as forcefully as they have fought for us,"" Biden wrote in a Veterans Day statement with his wife Jill.

In a dig at Trump, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders released a video on Monday highlighting his role in working with the late Republican Sen. John McCain, a decorated war hero, to pass legislation that included the Veterans Choice program in 2014.

Trump routinely takes credit for being the first to enact the Choice program, ignoring the fact that it was signed into law by President Barack Obama. What Trump got done was an expansion of the program achieved by McCain and Sanders.

That expanded program, one of Trump's signature accomplishments, seeks to steer more veterans over the next decade to private-sector doctors outside the VA.

Sanders, a former chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee who voted against Trump's plan, says the expanded program goes too far in its investments in the private sector, rather than core VA health care , which many veterans view as better suited to treat battlefield injuries such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Sanders joins Buttigieg and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in urging increases in doctor pay to attract top VA candidates and fill 49,000 VA positions that have sat vacant as the Trump administration promoted private health care options.

Sanders said he would fill those vacancies in his first year as president and provide at least $62 billion in new funding to repair and modernize VA facilities to provide cutting-edge care.

""We will not dismantle or privatize the VA. We will expand and improve the VA,"" Sanders said Monday.

Buttigieg told the AP that he would look at rolling back some of the Trump administration's rules expanding Choice.

All the Democratic candidates who have articulated veterans' plans call for added funding and training for suicide prevention.

Currently, about 20 veterans die by suicide each day, a rate basically unchanged during the Trump administration. Trump earlier this year directed a Cabinet-level task force to develop a broader roadmap for veterans' suicide prevention, due out next spring.

Buttigieg, like Warren, would seek to improve responses to sexual assault in the military by shifting prosecution from military commanders to independent prosecutors. He also wants to put particular focus on stemming homelessness among women vets, many of whom may have experienced sexual trauma.

He pointed to his seven-month deployment in Afghanistan in 2014 and watching the impact a female general had ""culturally"" on the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force.

""When a leadership body is more gender diverse, it makes better decisions. So I would absolutely be looking at that,"" Buttigieg told the AP. He's previously pledged to appoint women to at least 50% of his Cabinet positions.

While veterans overall have strongly backed Trump throughout his presidency, views vary widely by party, gender and age, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of 2018 midterm voters. In particular, younger veterans and women generally were more skeptical of Trump, who received multiple draft deferments to avoid going to Vietnam.

Currently, about 10% of the nation's veterans are female. In the U.S. military forces, about 17% of those enlisted are women, up from about 2% in 1973."
32,Paul Steinhauser,"CONCORD, N.H. – Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer is far from thrilled that fellow billionaire Mike Bloomberg might enter the race for the party’s 2020 nomination.

After Steyer filed to place his name on the New Hampshire presidential primary ballot, the one-time hedge fund manager turned billionaire environmental and progressive advocate took a shot at Bloomberg while answering questions from reporters.

BLOOMBERG FACES HIGH HURDLES IF HE LAUNCHES 2020 BID

""I’ve traveled around full time for seven years and listened, said Steyer, who created the influential grassroots advocacy organization NextGenAmerica in 2013 and who has been one of the leaders of the push to impeach President Trump. “I feel as if anyone who doesn’t do that kind of traveling and face to face talking to Americans and more than that, listening to Americans, I don’t know how you could really in good conscience run for president.""

“I feel as if, as a Democrat, I’ve said about Michael Bloomberg, if he can’t accept the idea of a wealth tax, if he doesn’t embrace it, he doesn’t understand that inequality is at the heart of the problems in America right now, then I don’t think he should run, because I don’t think he can represent the Democratic Party,"" Steyer added.

Steyer was in New Hampshire on the same day that Bloomberg filed to place his name on the ballot in Arkansas, hours ahead of that state’s presidential primary filing deadline. On Friday, Bloomberg’s name was placed on the primary ballot in Alabama an hour ahead of that state’s filing deadline.

SANDERS BLASTS BLOOMBERG

Bloomberg – the former Republican-turned-independent New York City mayor -- changed his voter registration to Democrat last year. He flirted with a presidential bid early this year but ruled out a run in March. His top advisers said last week that the media and business mogul changed his mind because he worried the current crop of 2020 Democratic White House contenders were not “well positioned” to beat Trump next November.

Steyer announced in January that he wouldn’t run for president but later changed his mind. Since launching his campaign in July, he’s spent at least $47 million on his White House bid, mostly on TV commercials.

Asked by Fox News if he’ll spend another $47 million on his campaign, Steyer said “at the beginning of this campaign our staff estimated that we’d spend $100 million. Do I think that that was a good guess? I have no idea.”

He went on to emphasize the importance of this presidential election, saying “when people ask me ‘What are you willing to put into this? How much do you care?’ unlimited.”

Steyer – who is pulling in the mid-single digits, far behind the top-tier contenders – noted that the race is “probably more open today than it was three months ago or six months ago ... It’s more unsettled today than when I started. I don’t think I’m going to be the last person to enter this race.”

Montana Gov. Steve Bullock – a long-shot for the nomination - also filed to place his name on the New Hampshire primary ballot Tuesday, doing so a couple of hours before Steyer.

When asked about Bloomberg and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, who is also reportedly mulling a late entry into the Democratic race, Bullock emphasized that Democrats “have to win back places we lost. I think I can do it ... I don’t know that another coastal person running is going to make that much of a difference. Look, we already have one candidate from Massachusetts [Elizabeth Warren]. Do we need another? We already have one billionaire running [Steyer], do we need another?”"

WHY BIDEN EXCELS NATIONALLY, STRUGGLES IN EARLY STATES

Politico: “Joe Biden is the clear frontrunner in the 2020 Democratic race for president. Or he’s faltering, slipping into fourth place as he loses ground to Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and an ascendant Pete Buttigieg. Those alternate realities are playing out in real time — reflected in Biden’s solid standing atop national polls versus his middling performance in Iowa and New Hampshire surveys on the other. The disparity is at once a source of frustration to Biden’s team and one of hope to rivals holding out for an utter collapse by the former vice president in the two earliest nominating states. The explanations for the discrepancy run the gamut. The white Iowa and New Hampshire electorates play against Biden’s strength among ideological moderates and African Americans, some defenders argue. Skeptics say it shows that the voters watching him most closely are underwhelmed. There's the fact that Biden pulled back on early state ad spending — both on TV and digitally — while competitors ramped up. Finally, the Trump factor: The president's reelection campaign has been running anti-Biden ads on TV in Iowa and more broadly over social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube.”



Biden super PAC issues memo warning in early states - Politico: “A super PAC supporting Joe Biden warned Saturday that the Trump campaign is seeking to take down the former vice president in early state contests with a barrage of negative ads. ‘Trump is spending considerable sums in the early states, particularly Iowa, in a hope to stop Biden’s momentum before he can get to the states where his coalition works to his benefit,’ Democratic strategist Steve Schale wrote in a memo obtained by POLITICO. … The memo from Unite the Country super PAC … lays out the candidate's consistent strength in national Democratic primary polls and in matchups with President Donald Trump in battleground states. It also points to Biden’s steady lead in South Carolina and Nevada, the latter two of the four early nominating state, which have a far more diverse electorate than Iowa and New Hampshire. Wins there would give Biden momentum heading into the 14 Super Tuesday primaries, the memo states.”



Klobuchar says a woman with Buttigieg's experience wouldn't make debate stage - Fox News: “Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., didn’t spare any punches on Sunday when going after fellow 2020 presidential primary candidate Pete Buttigieg – saying that a woman with the South Bend, Ind., mayor’s experience would not be on the debate stage. Klobcuhar, who has been polling in the middle of the still-crowded field of Democrats, argued during an appearance on CNN’s ‘State of the Union’ that while every candidate in her party has been more qualified to lead the country than President Trump, she doubted a woman with the same resume as Buttigieg would be given a chance at running for president. ‘Of the women on the stage, I’m focusing here on my fellow women senators, Sens. Harris and Warren and myself. Do I think we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience that he had? No, I don’t,’ Klobuchar said in reference to Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.”



#YangGang: Now what? - NYT: “Enthusiasm for Mr. [Andrew] Yang is probably most palpable here in New Hampshire where the entrepreneur has repeatedly polled around 5 percent, his strongest showing in an early-voting state. … All of which leaves Mr. Yang and his senior campaign staff — some of whom, before this, had never run a campaign of any kind — with a new quandary: What do we do now? … But moving forward, Mr. Yang said he wants his message to become ‘more human-based’ — perhaps a necessary shift for a candidate seeking a broader audience who has thus far focused much of his attention on robots. His vision of a ‘human-based’ campaign, he said, involves talking more about the way he thinks his signature pitch can really change lives. … The strategic pivot — the most significant in the campaign to date — is most clearly exemplified by the new television ad Mr. Yang’s team put on the air Thursday in Iowa. They spent more than $1 million on the ad buy, the kind of seven-figure sum they did not have available to them for the long first few phases of his run.”



New venue chosen for December Dem debate - Politico: “The Democratic presidential debate in December has been moved to Loyola Marymount University, after controversy over a labor fight upended plans to host the prime-time event at the University of California, Los Angeles. POLITICO and PBS NewsHour, the sponsors of the Dec. 19 debate, announced the change after the Democratic National Committee said Wednesday that UCLA would no longer serve as the venue because of an ongoing dispute between the school and its largest employee union. … Six Democratic White House contenders have so far qualified to appear on stage: Vice President Joe Biden; Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.”

TIME OUT: THE HISTORY OF VETERANS DAY

NYT: “On Nov. 11, 1918, the Allied nations and Germany signed an armistice ending the fighting in the Great War, which had killed more than 15 million people. A year later, King George V of England proclaimed that date Armistice Day, to be marked with two minutes of silence at 11 a.m., the hour the agreement had gone into effect. ‘King Asks British to Pause Two Minutes on Armistice Day,’ The New York Times wrote in a front-page headline on Nov. 7, 1919. Days later, the paper reported that Americans would be observing the day, too, with ceremonies around the country. In a special message to the nation in 1919, President Woodrow Wilson noted the monumental changes that the fierce and bloody war had provoked. The European Allies fought for more than four years, and the Americans for more than a year and a half. None would ever be the same. … In 1954, in response to calls for recognition of veterans of World War II and the Korean War, President Dwight D. Eisenhower changed the name of the holiday to Veterans Day. A 1968 law moved the observance of the holiday to the fourth Monday in October, but that was unpopular, and in 1975, President Gerald Ford signed a law moving it back to Nov. 11. The law took effect in 1978.”

REP. PETER KING ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT

Fox News: “Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., the powerful 14-term congressman who once chaired the House Committee on Homeland Security, announced Monday he will not seek reelection in 2020. King, in a statement Monday, said his ‘prime reason’ for retiring ‘was that after 28 years of spending four days a week in Washington, D.C., it is time to end the weekly commute and be home in Seaford.’ ‘This was not an easy decision. But there is a season for everything and Rosemary and I decided that, especially since we are both in good health, it is time to have the flexibility to spend more time with our children and grandchildren,’ he said. … The 75-year-old congressman said his decades in Congress have been ‘an extraordinary experience.’ He currently serves as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, which he served as chair from 2005-2006 and again from 2011-2012… King is one of several Republicans — four senators and 17 other House members — who have announced plans to not seek reelection.”



Sessions’ feels support from 11 GOP senators in open letter - Politico: “Nearly a dozen of Jeff Sessions' former GOP Senate colleagues are backing his run for Senate, according to a letter obtained by POLITICO. In an ‘open letter to conservatives’ on Sessions' candidacy for Alabama's Senate race next year, 11 Republican senators say that Sessions is a ‘man of his word. And we know he is devoted to serving the people of Alabama.’ … The letter is signed by GOP Sens. Richard Shelby of Alabama, Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, Pat Roberts of Kansas, Mike Enzi of Wyoming, Mike Crapo of Idaho, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, John Barrasso of Wyoming, Roy Blunt of Missouri, John Boozman of Arkansas, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Deb Fischer of Nebraska. Roberts, Enzi and Isakson are all retiring this year or next. Barrasso and Blunt are the Nos. 3 and 4 GOP leaders, respectively, in the Senate GOP.”



Steve Knight eyes old seat after Katie Hill resignation - Fox News: “The two-term Republican who was ousted in 2018 by Katie Hill announced on his website Sunday that he will attempt to win back his old seat. ‘I am proud to return to public service and deliver the type of representation our district deserves,’ Steve Knight posted on his website. Hill defeated Knight by 9 points in California’s 25th District in November. Hill-- a centrist-- was seen as a rising Democratic star because the district is seen as one of a few in the state that could be carried by a Republican. Henry Olsen, a columnist in the Washington Post, wrote a piece last month that questioned whether or not the state was ‘reopening’ the doors to Republicans. He pointed out that the district was a Republican stronghold before President Trump. He also called the election—which will likely occur on March 3, a possible bellwether for Republicans.”



Kentucky Republicans losing patience with Gov. Bevin - Louisville [Ky.] Courier Journal: “Republican Senate President Robert Stivers believes Gov. Matt Bevin should concede his loss to Democrat Andy Beshear if next week's recanvas doesn't significantly change the vote totals. ‘It’s time to call it quits and go home, say he had a good four years and congratulate Gov.-elect Beshear,’ Stivers said in a brief Friday interview at the Capitol. Bevin finished 5,189 votes behind Beshear in Tuesday's gubernatorial election but has refused to concede the race, requesting a recanvas of the vote that will take place Nov. 14. … Stivers said if Bevin chooses to contest the election by calling a special session of the General Assembly and making a case that there was illegal activity, lawmakers would have to hear the dispute under the state constitution.”



The political deadlock in states for 2020 - NYT: “Acrimonious deadlocks have become the new normal in Wisconsin, one of three Midwestern states where Democrats ended full Republican control last year by flipping governorships. Gov. Tony Evers’s defeat of Scott Walker, whose success at pushing Wisconsin sharply to the right prompted a brief presidential bid, has given Democrats a new foothold this year in a region where they had been mostly sidelined. Yet with attention turning to the presidential election, in which Wisconsin voters are seen as playing a decisive role, divided power has given way to frustrated impasse, with little chance for either party to hold up state policymaking as the showcase it once was here. … In Wisconsin, Michigan and Kansas, Democrats’ victories last November came after a period of extraordinary, sustained Republican success. Going into the 2018 election, Republicans controlled the governor’s offices and the full legislatures in 10 of 12 Midwestern states. … Though the purpling of Midwestern statehouses since last November has served as a check on Republican power, it has hardly led to a bonanza of liberal legislating.”



HOUSE GOP PREPARES FOR IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS

Politico: “House Republicans are gearing up for a blockbuster showdown with Democrats as the impeachment probe enters its most visible phase yet, with GOP lawmakers and staffers from key committees plotting with leadership to launch their counterattack. To prepare for this week’s public hearings, Republican leaders have moved one of President Donald Trump’s fiercest Hill defenders to the House Intelligence Committee and have lined up an explosive witness list for the upcoming proceedings, offering some clues into their defense strategy. The transcripts released last week from closed-door interviews with impeachment witnesses also provide a window into how the GOP plans to approach the high-stakes hearings. Republicans will try to paint the Democratically led process as politically motivated and minimize Trump's role in the quest to persuade Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. And they will also try to keep the heat off Trump by attacking the Bidens and pushing other conspiracy theories about the elections.”



Mulvaney makes last-minute move to join impeachment testimony lawsuit - WaPo: “White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney’s last-minute effort to join a lawsuit that could determine whether senior administration officials testify in the impeachment inquiry was an unwelcome surprise to former top national security aides, highlighting internal divisions among President Trump’s advisers in the face of the probe. Former national security adviser John Bolton’s advisers and allies were taken aback to learn late Friday that Mulvaney had gone to court seeking to join a separation-of-powers lawsuit filed against Trump and the House leadership, according to people familiar with their views, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing inquiry. The suit was filed by Bolton’s former deputy, Charles Kupperman, who is asking a federal judge to determine whether a congressional subpoena takes precedence over a White House order not to comply with the inquiry. Bolton is willing to testify if the judge rules in favor of the House, The Washingon Post previously reported.”



Pergram: The ‘impeachment resolution,’ and Dems' fight over its meaning - Fox News: “It didn’t matter what that resolution was called or wasn’t called a few weeks ago. Congress has descended into impeachapalooza. There’s no quibbling about what’s consuming Capitol Hill. Some Democrats may fret about the political ramifications of impeachment. Leaders like Pelosi and Hoyer may try to parse words about impeachment, but we’re well past the point of no return now. Impeachment is now the political equivalent of the Popeye’s chicken sandwich. Nothing commands as much attention.”

NOT SO GOLDEN SPONGE CAKE

KARE11: “Every school has its tradition. One of the most unique ones belongs to a school in Maine that has run an ongoing experiment for 43 years: How long can a Twinkie survive? The experiment at George Stevens Academy in Blue Hill, Maine, started in 1976. During a lesson about food additives and preservatives, science teacher Roger Bennatti was asked by a student how long a Twinkie would last. Bennatti didn't know. So, of course, he tested it. … More than 43 years later, the Twinkie is still at the school… That golden cake has darkened and greyed and the spongy holes are more prevalent. But it's mostly kept it's shape. ‘The Twinkie has become much like me. It's older, it's grayer and it's more flaky,’ said Bennatti, who is now retired. … So how has it lasted this long? The obvious answer is preservatives. But even with that, a Hostess spokesperson told Reuters the modern-day Twinkie has a shelf life of 65 days.”

GOP ON DEFENSE AHEAD OF PUBLIC IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS

Fox News: “Three top Republicans serving on panels involved in the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry into President Trump penned a memo to GOP members on those committees outlining ‘key points of evidence’ from the closed-door inquiry ahead of public hearings slated to begin Wednesday. Addressed to the GOP members of the House Intelligence Committee, House Oversight Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee, the memo outlines arguments in defense of Trump. It makes the case that Democrats failed to present any evidence of quid pro quo in Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. They say Trump had a ‘deep-seated, genuine and reasonable skepticism of Ukraine and U.S. taxpayer-funded foreign aid’ due to the country's history of ‘pervasive corruption’ since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The memo points out that both Trump and Zelensky have said they felt no pressure during the call. Another piece of evidence cited by the memo's authors is that Ukrainian government officials interfered in the 2016 presidential election in opposition to Trump in an effort to sway the race in favor of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a claim that Trump has made but has not been proven.”



Schiff warns GOP about going after Bidens - Fox News: “House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff set the stage for the first public hearings as part of the impeachment inquiry by vowing to keep questions at Wednesday's lead-off session focused on the Ukraine controversy -- in an implicit shot at Republican members who have signaled an interest in turning the tables on Democrats as they defend President Trump. … Notably, he cited rules for the investigation that would keep it focused on alleged attempts by the president to seek politically advantageous investigations from a foreign government, and whether he sought to cover it up. The first hearings in the public phase of the impeachment inquiry will feature testimony from State Department official George Kent and top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor on Wednesday. Later this week, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich will appear.”



Mulvaney reverses course, will follow Trump’s order not to cooperate - WaPo: “On the eve of the first public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry, President Trump complained that Democrats are relying on ‘2nd and 3rd hand witnesses,’ while a memo by Republican staff previewed how they plan to defend him. … In morning tweets, Trump, meanwhile, said that both Bidens should be called as witnesses in the public hearings that begin Wednesday with testimony from two State Department officials. … Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney no longer plans to seek a judge’s ruling on whether he should testify in the impeachment inquiry and will instead follow Trump’s order not to cooperate. In a court filing Tuesday, Mulvaney’s lawyer said Mulvaney is reversing course and would not file suit seeking a court opinion on whether he must comply with a House subpoena.”

TIME OUT: REVISITING A PIVOTAL WWII BATTLE

Smithsonian: “‘At the present time we have only enough water for two weeks. Please supply us immediately,’ read the message sent by American sailors stationed at Midway, a tiny atoll located roughly halfway between North America and Asia, on May 20, 1942. The plea for help, however, was a giant ruse; the base was not, in fact, low on supplies. When Tokyo Naval Intelligence intercepted the dispatch and relayed the news onward … their American counterparts finally confirmed what they had long suspected: Midway and ‘AF,’ cited by the Japanese as the target of a major upcoming military operation, were one and the same. This codebreaking operation afforded the United States a crucial advantage at what would be the Battle of Midway, a multi-day naval and aerial engagement fought between June 3 and 7, 1942. … Midway, a new movie from director Roland Emmerich … traces the trajectory of the early Pacific campaign from the December 7, 1941, bombing of Pearl Harbor to the Halsey-Doolittle Raid in April 1942, the Battle of the Coral Sea in May of that same year, and, finally, Midway itself.”

BUTTIGIEG SURGES TO FIRST PLACE IN IOWA

Monmouth University: “South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg has joined former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at the top of the leaderboard in the third Monmouth University Poll of the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses. Buttigieg’s gains since the summer have been across the board, with increasing support coming from nearly every demographic group. Regardless, less than one-third of likely caucusgoers say that they are firmly set on their choice of candidate and most would not be too disappointed if they had to switch their support. The poll also finds that Mike Bloomberg receives a chilly reception among Hawkeye State Democrats as he considers whether to make a late entry into the nomination contest. Four candidates are currently vying for the top spot in Iowa’s caucuses – Buttigieg (22%), Biden (19%), Warren (18%), and Sanders (13%). Compared to Monmouth’s August poll, Buttigieg has gained 14 points (up from 8%)…”



Sanders falls to fourth in Granite State - Quinnipiac University: “With less than 100 days to go, former Vice President Joe Biden has an edge in New Hampshire's Democratic primary for president, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today. Biden receives support from 20 percent of New Hampshire likely Democratic primary voters, with Senator Elizabeth Warren getting 16 percent, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg getting 15 percent, and Sen. Bernie Sanders at 14 percent. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard gets 6 percent, businessman Andrew Yang gets 4 percent, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar and businessman Tom Steyer are each at 3 percent. No other candidate tops 1 percent, and 14 percent of likely voters are undecided. Independent voters, known as ‘undeclared voters’ in New Hampshire, who are likely to vote in the Democratic primary are divided in their top choice. Biden receives 16 percent support among these voters, while Sanders and Buttigieg get 14 percent each, and Warren and Gabbard receive 10 percent each.”



Mark Sanford drops out of presidential race - The [Charleston, S.C.] Post and Courier: “Former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford dropped out of the race for president just moments ago, ending his protest bid 60 days after it began. In a noon press conference at the New Hampshire Statehouse, Sanford announced his long-shot run is ending after previously declaring he would spend most of November campaigning in the Granite State, site of the nation’s first primary. The move came after Sanford failed to collect much of a following, especially as President Donald Trump remains the favorite of most Republican voters nationally and while Washington is gearing up for impeachment hearings. Sanford said the impeachment inquiry surrounding the president had sucked the proverbial oxygen out of the 2020 debate. ‘You gotta be a realist, and what I did not anticipate is an impeachment,’ he said, adding he is suspending the campaign and will look for other ways to advance his stance against the deficit.”



Former governor of Massachusetts considering bid - NYT: “Former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts has told Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democratic officials that he is considering making a last-minute entry into the 2020 presidential race, according to three Democrats familiar with the conversations, the latest evidence of how unsettled the party’s primary is less than three months before the Iowa caucuses. Mr. Patrick, a respected two-term governor and one of the highest-profile black leaders in the party, has told some of the Democratic officials that he doesn’t think any of the candidates have established political momentum and that he thinks there is an opening for somebody who can unite both liberal and moderate voters, according to Democrats who have spoken to him. He and some of his top advisers had a meeting Sunday in Boston to discuss what a campaign would look like, according to two Democrats.”



Sen. Michael Bennet expanding campaign in N.H. - WMUR: “While another Democratic presidential candidate is cutting back her effort in New Hampshire and still another is pulling out of the state entirely, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet is expanding his presence and making a bold commitment. The Bennet campaign currently has one New Hampshire office, in Manchester, and small number of staffers in the state. But that’s about to change. The Bennet campaign told WMUR on Monday that within the next several weeks, it will open three new offices, including a new office in Manchester, and is currently ‘aggressively hiring’ additional Granite State staffers. Bennet made a public commitment. ‘Spending time with New Hampshire voters has made me a better candidate,’ he said in a statement shared with WMUR.”



Milwaukee DNC replaces top fundraiser - Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: “There's been a quiet shakeup in the leadership of the fundraising team for next year's Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. Out as the Host Committee's fundraising director is Marcus Switzer, a 32-year-old Milwaukee native who served as deputy national fundraising director for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016. Switzer has returned to Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaign team. Switzer held the post for about six months. Replacing him is Leah Israel, a 36-year-old Chicago native who worked as a fundraiser for U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat. … In her new post as fundraising director, Israel is taking on the daunting task of raising up to $70 million for next July's big event.”



SUPREME COURT DIVIDED OVER FUTURE OF DACA

Fox News: “The future of the DACA program for young illegal immigrants remained uncertain as the Supreme Court on Tuesday appeared to lack consensus on whether the Trump administration's plans to rescind legal protections for so-called Dreamers were proper. The cases were debated during 80 minutes of tense oral arguments. No side appeared to command a clear majority of justices over what has become a major test of executive power on the contentious issue of immigration reform. At issue is the Obama-era program known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. It was created under executive order and gives about 700,000 people brought as children to the United States illegally --or on visas that later were overstayed -- the opportunity to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and become eligible for a work permit. Hundreds of Dreamers and their supporters rallied outside the court. Members of Congress were among those watching the arguments inside.”



LA. GOVERNOR’S RACE SEES RECORD NUMBER IN EARLY VOTING

Monroe [La.] News Star: “Louisiana loves voting early with voters coming close to setting an all-time record last week for the Nov. 16 governor's election. In all, 489,654 cast early ballots for the Nov. 16 runoff between Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards and Republican Baton Rouge businessman Eddie Rispone in a race generally considered a tossup. That's 100,000 plus more ballots than were cast early for the Oct. 12 primary that whittled the field to Edwards and Rispone. ‘This is a sea change between what existed previously,’ said Pearson Cross, a University of Louisiana at Lafayette political science professor. ‘I think it's a good thing that spurs turnout.’ … Early voting isn't likely to hit 40% of the total for the Nov. 16 election, but it could account for a third or more of total votes cast. Trump will headline another rally at 7 p.m. Thursday at the CenturyLink Center in Bossier City.”



Widow Rep. Elijah Cummings announces campaign for husband's seat - Fox News: “The widow of late Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said on Monday that she will launch a campaign to win her husband’s seat as representative of Maryland’s 7th Congressional District. Maryland Democratic Party Chairwoman Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, 48, initially told The Baltimore Sun that she would formally announce her campaign on Tuesday, nearly a month after her husband died of cancer on Oct. 17 at age 68. … In her first televised interview since her husband’s death, Rockeymoore Cummings said on MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show Monday evening that she and her husband decided about six months ago that she would be the best fit to carry on his legacy and vision for the Baltimore district.

MARATHON MAN

BBC: “A British man has become the first person to run a marathon in every country in the world. Nick Butter, 30, from Bristol, [England] has run 196 marathons in 196 countries after starting in Canada in January 2018 and finishing in Greece on Sunday. He was inspired to do it to raise funds for Prostate Cancer UK after a friend was diagnosed with the disease. Mr. Butter said he was ‘overwhelmed’ to have finished, after he crossed the finishing line of the Athens marathon. He said he was ‘very tired’ after completing the challenge, which took 674 days and involved visiting an average of just over two countries a week. … He chose Athens for his final run due to it being ‘the home of the marathon.’ Mr. Butter, originally from Dorset, [England] crossed the line with his friend Kevin Webber, who has prostate cancer and who inspired him to take up the challenge.”

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts reiterated her strong support for the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry into President Trump.

Warren, who was in New Hampshire Wednesday to file to place her name on the Granite State's presidential primary ballot, also took another shot at former New York City mayor and billionaire business and media mogul Mike Bloomberg, who’s taking steps towards jumping into the Democratic race.

And she told Fox News that a potential entry this week by former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick wouldn’t complicate her own White House bid.

FOX NEWS COVERAGE OF THE TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

Warren – one of the first Democratic White House hopefuls to call for Trump’s impeachment -- told reporters after filing that “I believe it is appropriate for this impeachment inquiry to go forward. I think it should have happened earlier, but we're here now. Let’s do it.”

When asked if she had been watching the testimony from the televised public hearing, Warren said: “I just haven’t been able to catch up with it. Fortunately, I will catch up tonight.”

If the Democratic-controlled House impeaches the president, the GOP-led Senate would then hold a trial which could lead to Trump’s removal from office. Such a trial would probably keep Warren and the other Senate Democrats running for president off the campaign trail during the weeks leading up to the first nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire.

""I have Constitutional responsibilities,"" Warren said. ""I took an oath of office, as did everyone in Congress and part of that oath of office is the basic principle that no one is above the law. That includes the president of the United States. And if the House goes forward and sends an impeachment over to the Senate, then I will be there for the trial.”

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Warren told Fox News that she hadn’t talked with Patrick in recent days and said “no” when asked if the fellow Massachusetts Democrat’s potential entry into the race would complicate her own campaign. When asked about Patrick's years working at investment firm Bain Capital, Warren answered “I’m not here to criticize other Democrats. I’m here to talk about why I’m running for president.”

Patrick is likely to announce his candidacy on Thursday by video or social media, multiple outlets reported on Wednesday. He would then travel to neighboring New Hampshire on Friday the last day for candidates to file to place their names on the primary ballot.

Patrick isn’t the only Democrat likely to launch a campaign at this late date in the primary cycle. Bloomberg has placed his name on the presidential primary ballots in Alabama and Arkansas in recent days as he moves closer to launching a White House run.

I believe that what our election should be about is grassroots. How you build something all across New Hampshire, all across the country, and that we really shouldn’t have elections that are about billionaires calling all the shots, whether they’re reaching into their pockets to fund their own elections or whether they’re counting on getting other people to run,"" said Warren, who’s been critical of Bloomberg in recent days.

“I’ve noticed that billionaires go on TV and cry,"" she added. ""Other billionaires encourage their billionaire buddies to jump into the race.""

Warren may have been referring to billionaire Omega Advisors CEO Leon Cooperman, who lamented during an interview on CNBC last week that Trump is dividing and polarizing Americans while Warren is pushing “Idiocy.” Like many other billionaires, Cooperman has heavily criticized Warren’s proposed tax on the richest Americans, calling it a “bankrupt concept.”"

BIDEN EDGES RIVALS, BUTTIGIEG JOINS TOP TIER IN NEW NEW HAMPSHIRE POLL

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, R-Mass. and 2020 presidential candidate: Now they've got their fortunes and their money managers and their PR ...

And they're getting richer, faster and faster and faster, and everybody else is getting left behind.

The wealth tax -- the two-cent wealth tax. God, I love that wealth tax, right?

I'm not willing to give up and let a handful of monopolists dominate our economy and our democracy. It's time to fight back.

""Oh, it's time to fight back against the monopolists who dominate our economy!"" Sound familiar? Actually, that's not too far from what Donald Trump ran on in 2016, back before Paul Ryan and the Ayn Rand people got ahold of his economic program.

But this time around, Elizabeth Warren plans to steal that message -- the Trump message really. Warren claims that she is the radical populist here. She is the disruptor.

But is she? Let's see.

Emily Tisch Sussman is a woke liberal who often appears in cable television to talk about Democratic politics. Nice person, but she is the daughter of two billionaires. So you'd think that Emily Tisch Sussman would hate Elizabeth Warren.

But she doesn't. Instead, she demands that you support Elizabeth Warren. or else you're sexist. Here's what she said recently:

Emily Tisch Sussman, Democratic activist: I actually heard -- overheard -- someone saying what I thought was an interesting point: That basically at this point, if you are still supporting [Bernie] Sanders as opposed to Warren, it's kind of showing your sexism because she has more detailed plans and her plans have evolved.

I thought it was an interesting point. And I think there may be something to it.

Yes, there might be something to it. If you don't support Warren, you're a sexist!

Now, keep in mind, you just saw one of the richest people on Planet Earth demanding that you support Elizabeth Warren for president. Surprising, right?

Elizabeth Warren is really just this season's Hillary Clinton -- faithful party robot, stalwart defender of the prerogatives of the establishment.

Well, actually, it turns out that some of Warren's most fervent supporters are the very people she claims she wants to fight. Well, that's weird.

So, for example, in the third quarter of this year, Elizabeth Warren raised more money from Silicon Valley, from those ""monopolists"" she claims to hate, than anybody else running for president.

Spotify's CEO is an Elizabeth Warren fan; so is Silicon Valley venture capitalist and billionaire Chris Sacca. He has already maxed out to her campaign. Really? The billionaires supporting her?

Then last month, Charlie Gasparino over on Fox Business reported that Elizabeth Warren's campaign is making overtures to finance moguls on Wall Street seeking contributions -- and some of them are responding.

But wait a second. Why would Elizabeth Warren's enemies -- and these have got to be her enemies, she attacks them all the time on the campaign trail -- why would her enemies fund her campaign?

We will give you five seconds to think about it, but the answer, of course, is they're not really her enemies. They understand that Warren doesn't really mean what she says. They know that Warren's populism is a facade and underneath it all, she is really just this season's Hillary Clinton -- faithful party robot, stalwart defender of the prerogatives of the establishment.

That's what it seems like she really is.

Is she?

The survey – from Quinnipiac University – also suggested that South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has joined Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders in the top tier of contenders in New Hampshire.

According to the poll – which was released Monday – Biden stood at 20 percent support among likely Democratic primary voters in the Granite State.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENITAL CAMPAIGN

Warren, who hailed from neighboring Massachusetts, had the backing of 16 percent, with Buttigieg at 15 percent. Sanders – who’s long lived in neighboring Vermont and who crushed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire’s 2016 presidential primary – registered at 14 percent.

The survey showed Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii at 6 percent, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 4 percent and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and billionaire businessman and environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer each at 3 percent. No other candidate in the large field of Democrats seeking to unseat President Trump topped 1 percent.

The Quinnipiac poll differed from a University of New Hampshire survey for CNN that was conducted in late October. Sanders topped that poll, at 21 percent, with Warren at 18 percent, Biden at 15 percent and Buttigieg at 10 percent.

Granite Staters traditionally have been known as late deciders, and with just under three months to go until New Hampshire’s February primary, that’s reflected in the new survey. Fourteen percent of those questioned said they were undecided, and nearly two-thirds of those who said they’re backing a candidate suggested they might change their mind before the primary day.

BLOOMBERG FACES HIGH HURDLES IF HE JUMPS INTO WHITE HOUSE RACE

The poll was conducted as former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg started taking steps toward jumping into the presidential nomination race. Aides to the billionaire business mogul and environmental and gun control crusader said Friday that if Bloomberg were to run, he’d likely skip campaigning in New Hampshire and the three other early voting states in the primary and caucus presidential nominating calendar.

According to the survey, only 2 percent said they would definitely vote for Bloomberg if he ran, with 37 percent saying they’d consider backing him. A majority – 54 percent – said they definitely would not vote for Bloomberg.

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted November 6-10, with 1,134 New Hampshire likely Democratic primary voters questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s margin of error was plus or minus 3.8 percentage points."

It's as old as hate',https://www.foxnews.com/media/mike-rowe-elizabeth-warren-billionaires-wealth-tax,"There is no mystery behind escalating criticism of American's wealthiest citizens during the 2020 presidential campaign, said TV host and actor Mike Rowe.

""It's not a new thing. It's as old as hate. You know, the trick is we just got to figure out who we hate this week,"" argued Rowe on Fox Nation's ""Reality Check with David Webb.""

In September, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., tweeted, ""Billionaires should not exist."" Fellow 2020 contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., was accused by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon of ""vilifying successful people"" and Warren has been cheered on the campaign trail for mocking billionaires' objections to her proposals.

""Who can we blame? That's the game,"" Rowe told Fox Nation host David Webb.

""This country has been successful because ... it was business and industry and expansion, whether in agriculture and technology, hard work, you know, people taking risk,"" observed Webb, saying that many in the media appear to be stoking Americans' ""envy"" of their fellow countrymen.

""For me, you know, it's even more human,"" continued Rowe. ""I think on some level, we wind up resenting everything we rely on. It's only a matter of time. But if you walk resentment back, it almost always comes from some kind of dependency.""

The former ""Dirty Jobs"" host said that the recent planned power outrages in California provided an example of resentment in action.

""Last week, I was without power for four days and a lot of my neighbors realized all of a sudden, 'Wait a second, nothing works.'"" he recalled. ""That makes people very angry. And they don't know who to blame. So they flip off the linemen. You know, they blame PG&E. They blame the politicians. They blame everything.""

""But deep down, what's really going on is they just got a reminder that they utterly rely on a little plastic switch and the miracle that happens when they flip it and they're not in control of any of that. They don't have a generator. They don't have the means to fix the problem,"" said Rowe, suggesting that resentment is being turned on the wealthy by those who believe that the economic system is not working for them.

SANDERS, WARREN 'INCOME INEQUALITY' ARGUMENT IS BOGUS: EXPERT PANEL EXPLAINS

Rowe suggested that Americans must empower themselves by re-evaluating the definition of a good job in America. He started the ""Mike Rowe Works Foundation,"" which educates people about, ""millions of 'shovel ready' jobs for a society that doesn’t encourage people to pick up a shovel.""

""We've got over 7 million jobs in this country... that we need to fill,"" observed Webb. ""And in order to fill those jobs, we've got to get people through the right education.""

""Look on 'Dirty Jobs,' I failed in this area. I could have done a better job,"" admitted Rowe. ""But of the 300 people we featured, 40 were multimillionaires. Nobody knows it because they were covered in crap because they were crawling through a sewer or working in a septic tank. We don't associate optically any level of success with somebody who's covered in filth... reminding people of that is important,"" he concluded.

The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., stands at 22 percent among likely Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa, according to the Monmouth University survey, with former Vice President Joe Biden at 19 percent, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 18 percent and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 13 percent.

Buttigieg’s 3-percentage-point advantage over Biden is within the poll’s margin of error, but represents a remarkable surge in recent months.

BUTTIGIEG JOINS TOP-TIER OF CONTENDERS IN NEW POLL IN NEW HAMPSHIRE

Buttigieg has soared 14 points since Monmouth’s last survey in Iowa, which was conducted in August. Biden’s dropped 7 points, Warren’s edged down 2 points, and Sanders has jumped 5 points from the August survey.

The Monmouth survey, released on Tuesday, is the latest in Iowa to indicate Buttigieg has joined the top tier of candidates, at least in that state. A Quinnipiac University survey in Iowa released last week showed Warren at 20 percent, Buttigieg at 19 percent, Sanders at 17 percent and Biden at 15 percent.

Buttigieg, the longest of longshots for the nomination when he launched his campaign at the beginning of the year, first soared in the spring to middle-tier status. The U.S. Naval Reserve veteran who served in Afghanistan and who would be the first openly gay president if elected surged again over the past month to reach top-tier status.

“Buttigieg is emerging as a top pick for a wide variety of Iowa Democrats. While he has made nominally bigger gains among older caucus-goers, you really can’t pigeonhole his support to one particular group. He is doing well with voters regardless of education or ideology,” said Patrick Murray, the director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute.

THE LATEST POLLING FROM FOX NEWS

The survey indicates Sen. Amy Klobuchar from neighboring Minnesota at 5 percent, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, and billionaire businessman and environmental advocate Tom Steyer each at 3 percent, and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii at 2 percent. The rest of the large field of Democratic White House hopefuls registered at 1 percent or less. Support for Harris dropped by 9 points since the August poll, while the rest of the candidates stood within a point or two of their August standing.

The poll’s release comes as former New York City mayor and billionaire business mogul Mike Bloomberg takes concrete steps toward launching a Democratic presidential campaign. The survey indicates that among Iowa Democrats, Bloomberg has a 17 percent favorable rating and 48 percent unfavorable rating.

“Reports suggest that Bloomberg will skip the February contests if he does get into the race. With dismal numbers like these, it’s easy to see why. But I really cannot imagine that Democrats in the Super Tuesday states would be significantly more receptive to him than Iowa voters,” Murray said.

BLOOMBERG'S BARRIERS TO RUNNING AND WINNING THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION

The Monmouth University poll was conducted Nov. 7-11, with 451 Iowa voters likely to take part in the state’s Democratic presidential caucuses questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s margin of error is plus or minus 4.6 percentage points."

IMPEACHMENT SHOW DEBUTS

Fox News: “Diplomats testifying on the opening day of impeachment inquiry hearings delivered a stark account Wednesday of President Trump’s pursuit of political ‘investigations’ in Ukraine and attorney Rudy Giuliani’s alleged meddling in that country, while Republicans panned the entire process as a ‘low-rent Ukrainian sequel’ to the Russia collusion case. For his part, Trump spent much of the day meeting with the visiting Turkish president, saying he was too busy to watch the historic hearing. … But in between the sparring among lawmakers was extensive testimony from the two lead-off witnesses, State Department official George Kent and top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor.”



GOP Senators skip - AP: “Millions of Americans are expected to watch on live TV Wednesday as the House kicks off public hearings on whether to impeach President Donald Trump. Just don’t expect many Republican senators to be among them, if a quick sampling of them is to be believed. Of eight Senate Republicans questioned Tuesday evening, seven said they wouldn’t watch Wednesday’s start of the Democratic-led process or suggested it wasn’t a priority. ‘Tomorrow I’m going to be paying attention to what we’re doing in the Senate,’ said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said he’d be chairing an Environment and Public Works Committee session.”



What will impeachment mean for 2020 Dems? - Politico: “The degree to which the Democrats in Congress who are running the impeachment inquiry are disconnected from their colleagues running for president cannot be overstated. Impeachment and the presidential primary are like two planets slowly pulled together by gravity that are finally about to collide — nobody seems to know who will survive impact. … ‘This is kind of like if Roland Emmerich decided to make a movie about American politics,’ said a senior Biden adviser, speaking of the German filmmaker known for his disaster films. ‘No one would have predicted that we are potentially looking at a January where six Democratic presidential candidates are potentially serving on a jury in which Donald Trump is the defendant.’”



Trump wanted to fire inspector general for disloyalty - NYT: “President Trump has discussed dismissing the intelligence community’s inspector general, Michael Atkinson, because Mr. Atkinson reported a whistle-blower’s complaint about Mr. Trump’s interactions with Ukraine to Congress after concluding it was credible, according to four people familiar with the discussions. Mr. Trump first expressed his dismay about Mr. Atkinson around the time the whistle-blower’s complaint became public in September. In recent weeks, he has continued to raise with aides the possibility of firing him, one of the people said. The president has said he does not understand why Mr. Atkinson shared the complaint, which outlined how Mr. Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Mr. Trump’s political rivals at the same time he was withholding military aid from the country. He has said he believes Mr. Atkinson, whom he appointed in 2017, has been disloyal, one of the people said.”



Trump welcomes Turkish strongman Erdogan - AP: “Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and President Donald Trump met Wednesday as relations between the NATO allies are at their lowest point in decades, with Turkey drifting closer to Russia and Ankara facing a Washington backlash over its offensive against Kurds in Syria. Erdogan and Trump have a difficult agenda. They will discuss Turkey’s decision to buy a Russian air defense system despite its membership in NATO and its incursion into neighboring Syria to attack Kurdish forces who have fought with the U.S. against the Islamic State group. The issues threaten to jeopardize a potentially lucrative trade deal between the two countries. The leaders’ scheduled afternoon news conference, following a meeting with Republican lawmakers at the White House, will give Trump a stage to counter the first public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry.”

TIME OUT: FINDING THE ‘LOST CITY’

NatGeo: “In 1976 a group of Colombian archaeologists and their guides embarked on a grueling mission to save and ancient site from looters. Swinging machetes, they inched their way over the thick, jungled foothills of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta near Colombia’s Caribbean coast. … Their mission was urgent: Authorities had been tipped off that a major archaeological site had been found by huaqueros, archaeological looters. Items from the site had already begun appearing on the antiquities black market. The team needed to bring the site under state control before more damage was done to the country’s heritage. The team was trying to reach an area that is generally known as Teyuna, which they had taken to calling a more informal name: Ciudad Perdida, ‘lost city.’ The Tairona had abandoned many of their settlements in the late 1600s, but their descendants who still live in the Sierra Nevada had never really considered the city lost.”

HILLARY OPEN TO 2020 RUN: ‘I THINK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME’

USA Today: “Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to close the door on the possibility of entering the 2020 presidential race, telling an interviewer Tuesday, ‘I never say never to anything.’ The 2016 Democratic presidential nominee was asked during a BBC Radio interview if she was ‘100%’ certain she would not run again. Clinton replied that she thinks ‘all the time about what kind of president I would have been, and what I would have done differently, and what I think it would have meant to our country and the world.’ ‘So of course, I think about it. I think about it all the time,’ she said. … ‘I will certainly tell you, I'm under enormous pressure from many, many, many people to think about it,’ she said. ‘But as of this moment, sitting here in this studio talking to you, that is absolutely not in my plans.’”



Buttigieg’s New Hampshire plan counts on indies - Politico: “As Pete Buttigieg boarded his campaign bus … a New Hampshire voter stopped him to ask if campaign staffers were hawking ‘Republicans for Pete’ stickers yet. They aren’t. But Buttigieg, who’s staking out center-left ground in the Democratic presidential primary, is trying to build a coalition of unaffiliated voters to go along with Democrats and make a surprise splash in the open-primary state featuring two senators-next-door, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, campaigning on the left. At town halls during his latest swing across New Hampshire, Buttigieg name-checked ‘future former Republicans’ in the same breath as ‘progressives and moderates ... ready for some kind of change.’ His organizers are targeting independent voters from the new field offices Buttigieg opened this fall. And while Buttigieg is polling well in both Iowa and New Hampshire right now … the presence of non-Democrats in the New Hampshire Democratic primary — unlike Iowa’s closed caucus system — could prove decisive in a tight Democratic nominating race...”



But South Carolina looms - National Review: “…a big question hanging over Buttigieg’s head is whether he can make sufficient inroads with African-American primary voters to capture the nomination. Black voters make up about a quarter of the Democratic primary electorate, but two thirds of South Carolina primary voters are black, and Buttigieg remains stuck in the single digits in the Palmetto State. … Buttigieg’s weakness in South Carolina is partly a function of the fact that Joe Biden, former vice president to America’s first black president, retains a commanding lead among black voters. But Buttigieg’s weakness is also partly a function of his sexual orientation, as David Catanese reported in The State last month: ‘Internal focus groups conducted by Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign this summer reveal a possible reason why he is struggling with African-American voters: some see his sexuality as a problem.’”



Sanders tries to sway Hispanic lawmakers - Politico: “Bernie Sanders met privately with Hispanic lawmakers on Tuesday. Sanders, who has aggressively courted Latino voters in his 2020 bid for the White House, is the third presidential candidate to sit down with Latino members under the auspices of BOLD PAC, the fundraising arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren have also talked with BOLD PAC. Sanders spoke about immigration, Medicare for All, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and other issues, including his family’s immigrant roots. A Latino caucus member in the room said several undecided lawmakers were present, and that Sanders did not exclusively talk about economic issues.”



Patrick could complicate Warren’s campaign - Politico: “When Elizabeth Warren was asked to name three African Americans she'd choose for her presidential cabinet last week, she pointed to her friend Deval Patrick as one of them. But the former Massachusetts governor had other ideas. Around the same time, the former governor and a handful of close allies were huddling not far from Warren's campaign headquarters, plotting a surprise entry into the Democratic primary. The now-public prospect of his candidacy — and its potential effect on Warren, who has recently emerged as a Democratic frontrunner — is suddenly the subject of intense speculation among the Massachusetts political class. … His potential entry into the Democratic primary undoubtedly puts a strain on their relationship. Several Massachusetts Democrats — who declined to go on the record because of the sensitive nature of the issue — viewed reports that Patrick was preparing to join the field as an affront to Warren, who has been running hard for nearly a year.”



Is there a path for Bloomberg or Patrick? - NYT: “Both men have concluded in recent weeks that Mr. Biden, the former vice president, is not the imposing adversary they had expected him to be, interviews with aides and allies show. Both also believe there is room in the race for a more dynamic candidate who is closer to the political middle than Mr. Biden’s two most prominent challengers, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders. Should Mr. [Michael] Bloomberg and Mr. Patrick enter the race, they would test that proposition in different ways: Mr. Bloomberg with a powerfully funded campaign that would take on President Trump directly and contest the biggest states on the primary map from the start; Mr. Patrick with an insurgent candidacy that would begin in next-door New Hampshire and run through South Carolina, where black voters are likely to decide the primary.”

“For those who continually ask, you should just expect that we will continue to make news every day. So don’t ask ‘what’s on tap?’ Just know something’s on tap.” – A House Democratic aide working on the impeachment inquiry said during a conference call with Hill reporters, per Time magazine.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Normally, I hate doing housework, but these days I would rather vacuum than listen to the news. Fortunately, I have the Halftime Report to bring some sanity and understanding to the process. I have a question that I can't seem to find an answer to, and with your vast experience, I was hoping that you know the answer. There is so much argument over who the Democrats will let the Republicans call as witnesses. When it goes to trial in the Senate won't they be able to call whoever they want to testify and uncover anything the Democrats are trying to hide? By the way, I would gladly trade you some good KC BBQ for a few of those pepperoni rolls you are so fond of.” – Tom Steele, Bates City, Mo.



[Ed. note: You are on, Mr. Steele! And yes, you’re quite right about the witness-list histrionics. This is, as they would say in Gregsville, some stuff people say. (Though they don’t really say “stuff.”) Republicans want to reinforce their preferred narrative: This is a kangaroo court and Democrats are denying the president due process. Everything at hand will be pressed into service of that goal.]



“Could Joe Biden's lead in national polling, but not in individual states, be explained by how well he piles up voters in a few very large states e. g. New York, Illinois, and California?” – Tom Snyder, Frankfort, Ill.



[Ed. note: There might be some truth in that, Mr. Snyder. But a couple of things to remember: Good pollsters look for representative geographical distributions. That should be somewhat of a control on that phenomenon. But the larger consideration is that we don’t have any evidence that Biden runs better in these places. We have basically no useful polling in Illinois, but the polling we have from California and New York shows Biden running neck and neck with Sen. Elizabeth Warren. National polling tells me that Biden’s base isn’t geographic as much as it is demographic. He does best with non-white voters, especially women. If a Democratic candidate had to choose any bloc on which to base his or her candidacy, that would be the one to pick.]



“So the Democrats have moved their December debate to Loyola Marymount. What are they thinking? It's a fine school but Roman Catholic. You know, the institution with no women priests, the one steadfastly opposed to abortion, gay marriage, etc.” – Stuart Barr, Durham, N.C.



[Ed. note: But Will Joe Biden take communion while he’s there?]



“Chris, It occurs to me that polls and surveys (now a routine part of everybody's lives) supports and reinforces the identity politics of the far left. There was a time (in my distant past) when surveys, etc. only identified people by partisan segment (Democrat, Republican, Independent) and location. Beyond that, we were all ‘Americans.’ Now we go much deeper into who people are by describing their demographic associations. While the factions that the founding fathers warned against undoubtedly benefit, they do so by knowing which demographic groups to target and shape their messages accordingly. … I was raised believing that voting was my opportunity to express my view regarding who would be best for the WHOLE country. I NEVER hear that point of view anymore either in the family, in the classroom, in the media. I rarely hear it in political ads. Your thoughts?” – Eric Hutchins, Santa Barbara, Calif.



[Ed. note: I don’t know how much of this phenomenon you can lay at the feet of public pollsters. The revolution in public opinion research began more than 40 years ago as marketing gurus demanded better ways to sell floor wax, Ford Granadas and Funyuns. People with carpets don’t need floor wax, people who only drive Chevys don’t care about Granadas and Funyuns, while not broadly popular, have a hugely devoted core of enthusiasts. So companies decided it would be worth spending money to find out how to target the hardwood-floor-having-Ford-loving-Funyun-scarfing population rather than just wasting money on broad-spectrum ads. Back then it was about finding the right magazines and television shows in which to advertise. In time, the same kind of market research being used in corporate America made it over to the far-less-lucrative world of politics. Politics had always been about message targeting based on the demographics of various precincts. Since the birth of the republic, politicians targeted their messages to the constituents of various precincts. Gerrymandering, after all, has been with us from the start. But thanks to marketing magic, by the turn of the 21st century, campaigns were able to engage in “micro-targeting,” in which they could zero in on specific demographic subsets in geographic areas. Are you a gun-rights zealot but live in an overwhelmingly Democratic neighborhood? Are you usually an indifferent Republican-leaner, but are ardently pro-choice? Campaigns became increasingly able to zero in on you with ads, calls and mail. The trend exploded with the birth of online advertising. That all would be happening however public pollsters conducted their work. By the way, the reason polls have to pay attention to demographics – gender, ethnicity, income, education, etc. – is so that we end up with samples that are actually representative of the country. If you knew that there were 100 purple marbles, 50 green marbles and 25 orange marbles in a pouch and pulled five oranges in a row you might start to wonder about your sampling methods.]



“With the potential for a 3-way tie at the top of the Democrat pack, do you think Michael Bloomberg is counting on being the compromise candidate at a brokered convention? By at least getting his name in, he is signaling his availability when they realize ‘none of the above’ can win.” – Sheila Willis, Toronto, Canada



[Ed. note: I think there’s quite a bit to that, Ms. Willis. And hey, why not? The median net worth for an American household is, according to the Federal Reserve, just shy of $100,000. Bloomberg is worth something like $50 billion. If he spent, let’s say, $50 million on a just-in-case candidacy that would be .1 percent of his fortune – the equivalent of $100 for the average family.]



“Yes, Branagh’s ‘St Crispin’s Day’ speech is worth a look. But so is the night-before-battle scene where Henry wanders through the camp in disguise to gauge the spirit of the troops. Branagh does not hold back on the moral ambivalence of the original Shakespeare. In contrast, Sir Laurence Olivier, commissioned by Churchill in wartime, had to tone the camp scene down in his 1944 version. And Olivier’s ‘St Crispin’s Day’ speech is also stirring for this Veteran’s Day, but in a different style.” – John McNeill Lee, Walnut Creek, Calif.



[Ed. note: Good notes all, Mr. Lee!]



“Chris, I didn't know where to send this now that you’re off twitter. Since I get the Halftime Report I figured this is as good a place as any. … I'm a Midwestern boy and in trying to find my father a solid gift for Christmas last year I needed a new plan. … My first place to start was with bacon. My father (as with most Midwestern men) loves bacon. So I set out with my Google Fu to find the best there is to offer. Seemed that most signs pointed to one man and his amazing Tennessee smoked bacon and hams. Bentons County Hickory Smoked Bacon is said to be some amazing stuff. … I in no way work for Bentons or have any affiliation with them, I’m just a fan of wonderful bacon. I ordered him a box and he was so blown away I had to get myself one after the holidays to test the hype. It's some awesome stuff. … So if you have not heard of this amazing goodness I thought I would throw it on your radar… I hope you and your family have a wonderful set of holidays.” – Matt Ladd, Arlington, Va.



[Ed. note: I have many times enjoyed Benton’s delicious bacon and hams, Mr. Ladd. I, myself, prefer Edwards of Virginia, but then again, my tastes run more toward country ham over bacon for luxury cured meats. Benton’s ham is marvelous, too. But you may want to check out a bone-in Wigwam ham from Edwards this year. Pure ambrosia. And unlike the bacon, when you’re done, you can make bean soup!]

WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU LEMONS…

The Island Packet: “Parrish Brown thought it was strange when the Hilton Head Island [S.C.] McDonald’s worker paused as he ordered a sweet tea with light ice and extra lemon. ‘Extra lemon?’ the drive-thru worker asked in an odd voice. Brown later figured out what the ‘extra lemon’ was about when he discovered quite a bit of weed inside his sweet tea — after he drank it, at work. The 24-year-old Charleston man called the Beaufort County Sheriff’s Office … to report the incident. ‘I have never had weed a day in my life, so immediately after I started drinking it, I started to feel weird and it didn’t taste like something I recognized,” Brown said. … Finally … he opened up the lid only to find something he wasn’t expecting: three bags of marijuana. … ‘I kept being like ‘I swear, there is weed in my sweet tea!’’ he said. ‘The officer asked me why I drank it and I was like, ‘Well, I was thirsty!’”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“…History has been unkind to every stripe of utopian thinking. But it is not just that we have failed to achieve the messianic future. Even the democratic present is under widespread assault.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in a 2017 essay “The Authoritarian Temptation,” published in his posthumous book, “The Point of It All.”

Guy Benson: It's Tuesday, November 12, 2019. Welcome to The Guy Bensons show. I'm Guy Benson live in Washington, D.C., coming to you coast to coast. Always appreciate you being here. Guy Benson, Show Dot.com is our Web site. We've got a big lineup for you on this Tuesday. Eli Lake will be here, Juan Williams as well. Oh, some news about my alma mater, Northwestern, not making me happy. A big embarrassing scandal at the journalism school or at least a student newspaper. I will address all of that coming up. But we begin today's show with a first time guest. We are pleased to welcome Senator John Cornyn, senior senator from the great state of Texas, a Republican. He serves on the Judiciary Committee, the Finance Committee, the Intelligence Committee. He's also seeking reelection next year. Senator, thanks for being here.

Sen. Cornyn: Thanks, guy. Good to be with you.

Guy Benson: Well, I have to ask you, the biggest news of the day, at least here in Washington, people are anticipating tomorrow the kickoff of open hearings, public hearings in the impeachment process over on the other side of Capitol Hill. As you take a look at this process unfolding from down the hall in the Senate, what would it, in your view, a fair process look like in the House? And if they move forward with impeachment, which I think they probably will. What would a fair trial process look like in the Senate?

Sen. Cornyn: Well, unfortunately, Guy, Nancy Pelosi knew that if you produced a partisan articles of impeachment, that it would taint, taint this whole process in the eyes of the American people and be unsuccessful in the Senate, where it requires two thirds of the Senate to vote, to convict and remove. And fortunately, I don't think there's anything they can do at this point to restore the impression that this is a fair and fair process. I think finally, after Adam Schiff has been interviewing people behind closed doors and then selectively leaking information that supports their narrative, finally they're going to open it to the public. But I don't think anybody should be under the illusion that this is is a fair process, by the way. This is would be the fourth time in American history where this process has been started and none of them have resulted in the forced removal of a president. Obviously, President Clinton resigned. Excuse me. Nixon resigned. Clinton was not removed. And so during this one year before the next election, and basically eliminating the possibility of doing anything else constructive during this time period strikes me as is is a futile act.

Guy Benson: I mean, I struggle to envision a scenario where the Democrats don't impeach the president, the president, and kick it over to the upper chamber. If that happens, if and when that happens, do you think the process of a trial would look at least somewhat similar to what we saw in the late 90s with Bill Clinton?

Sen. Cornyn: Yes. I think what happened then is Tom Daschle and Trent Lott negotiated essentially a standing order or a process by which the evidence was presented by the impeachment managers. And then the president's lawyers got to respond, which lasted basically five weeks. But this is going to be kind of an out of body experience, I think, for most Americans watching senators sit there, not being able to speak with the chief justice presiding over this partisan enterprise. I just why would call the call the Senate, the jury here. Ordinarily, you would think of a jury as being disinterested and impartial. But obviously, this is a partisan process from start to finish. It's not going to work. And unfortunately, with Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff are going to further divide the country with no nothing really to show for it in the end.

Guy Benson: No, Senator, I can imagine some of your colleagues in the Senate who are running for president. I think it might be very difficult for them to sit there speechless, literally not able to talk. Given the political season that we are all in. Last question on this. You're on the Intelligence Committee in the Senate. Talk about the distinction, because over in the House now, for years it has been extremely partisan, extremely acrimonious in the House Intelligence Committee. But that really hasn't been the case in the Senate with Chairman Burr and Ranking Member Warner. It seems like it's been a lot more collegial and professional and serious. Why?

Sen. Cornyn: Well, I appreciate you saying that. I think it's because I think we all see the the benefit to the Senate as an institution into the country and the intelligence community for us to try not to let this the important work that we do fall victim to partisan wrangling. I don't think this is covered the House with glory even under the previous when Republicans were in the majority. Unfortunately. The house is a little more rambunctious than the upper chamber, sometimes referred to as the House of Lords, but are. But that's something we work very hard to try to do throughout a very difficult investigation over the Russian Russian act. The active measures during the 2016 campaign and beyond. We haven't always succeeded, but we've certainly tried.

Guy Benson: Senator, you represent Texas, a huge border state. I'm wondering your reaction to some of the really extraordinary violence that we've seen south of the border in recent days, including one of the major cartels effectively defeating Mexican forces in a battle and being forced to release drug kingpins son from custody and then this really horrific massacre of American citizens. That has to be something of concern. And I think it underscores when when people talk about border security, it's not just a political talking point. There are some very dangerous realities in a country that is sitting. Exactly. You know, due south of your state.

Sen. Cornyn: Exactly. Well, obviously, under Lopez Obrador, he essentially as waved a white flag when it comes to taking on the cartels. And they are very big and powerful and well-armed and they are wealthy and well organized. And they their tentacles reach into all aspects of Mexican life, including the government. And it is a growing concern. Ordinarily, the cartels would not and would not try to attack Americans because they would realize that would raise the visibility of their activities in a way that would get some unwanted attention. But right now, Mexico controls a little more than half of their landmass. Almost half of their landmass is controlled by the cartels, including all the region adjacent to the U.S. Mexico border. We can't ignore this because we are we we're for better or for worse, joined together by that common border. And our economies are are very dependent on one another. But I think we're all trying to figure out what comes next. Because we can't allow Americans to be targeted in Mexico and just have us do nothing in response. So we're trying to figure that one out right now. But this really raises the whole concern to a new level.

Guy Benson: Senator Cornyn, another issue separately that you've been talking about quite a lot recently involves drug prices, which is not necessarily a sexy topic for talk radio, where everyone gets heated and passionate, but it's a pocketbook issue that matters to millions of people, especially senior citizens. And you seem to be frustrated at the moment because there's a bipartisan bill that's way late, at least for now. Talk about the bill and what's happening.

Sen. Cornyn: Well, this is once something that I thought that the administration was interested in tackling. Certainly Republicans and Democrats see this as a pocketbook issue. And we're hearing a lot from our constituents about their high out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs. We did pass a bill unanimously through the Judiciary Committee has to do with patent patent thickets. It's called where drug companies will file tens, sometimes more than 100 individual patents and in a way to discourage any generic competition. For example, there's a drug humerus, which is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in the world. And it's a wonder drug. But the company who patented it has more than 120 separate patents on the same molecule. And in Europe, there are four competitors in place. So obviously we need more competition and to bring down prices and produce more affordable medications for our people. And it's a it's something I'm afraid is falling quickly, falling the casualty to impeachment mania. But in this specific instance, I've gone to the floor with Richard Blumenthal, my Democratic colleague from Connecticut, and it's been blocked by Senator Schumer. We're going to be back again this week to try to have some political accountability for blocking this common sense bill.

Guy Benson: What is his justification for blocking it?

Sen. Cornyn: Well, I think because he can and because he doesn't want Republicans to get any credit for anything positive in this area during an election cycle, election year coming up on an election. But I think we're going to try to smoke him out later this week. And in the end, I don't think you'll be able to sustain his position blocking it, because it's not it's not a partisan bill, but it is one that will actually lower drug costs for consumers. And I think that's a hard position to sustain.

Guy Benson: Senator, on that point, right, I'm all for choice and competition. I'm a. Capitalist I'm someone who believes in all of those fundamental values when it comes to an issue like the development of new miracle drugs. Right. I can understand if you bring in generic competitors, prices come down for the American people. I'm all for that. I'm in favor of that, of course. The counter argument that you sometimes hear from the pharmaceutical companies is it takes and this is true. It takes huge amounts of money to in research and development to innovate and create new drugs. And if they can't sort of get the benefit, the windfall from doing so, it disincentive Vice's research, development and innovation. What are the protections that these types of laws have to make sure that innovation isn't immediately sort of ripped off by competitors?

Sen. Cornyn: Well, you accurately described, I think, our intellectual property protection system under our under the Constitution that the you can patent something and you have exclusive rights to sell it for a period of time. The question is whether that time can be artificially extended by gamesmanship rather than by by the by the traditional patent protection period after which there is competition by generic generic competitors. And so they can recoup the costs of their research and development of these lifesaving drugs. We don't want to discourage innovation and we do want to protect intellectual property. But after a point there, it really becomes a matter of them maintaining their exclusive right to sell something by by artificially precluding that kind of competition, which we know in the end ultimately will benefit consumers and bring down prices, too.

Guy Benson: Senator, on health care, one of your colleagues running for president, Elizabeth Warren, has openly conceded. She has said that her single payer health care plan would make health care, private health care coverage illegal for 180 million people. She's openly considered that it would kill 2 million jobs. She has openly conceded that it would apply and be given by the taxpayers to illegal immigrants. She's she's admitting these things. And I wonder what you make of that. Not just on substance, but as a political matter.

Sen. Cornyn: Well, it's surreal to hear the here. After many years of arguing the Affordable Care Act was somehow the panacea that was going to solve all of our health care concerns. To hear Elizabeth Warren and other other radicals in her party say that's not good enough anymore, we want to take full control over your health care choices. And it will have the consequence that you just described, an incredible increase in costs and longer lines. By the way. And would would would destroy the private health insurance that 180 or so million people get from their employer. I think, you know, the Democrats have lost control of their party to their to their radical base. Nancy Pelosi has lost control of them and leading it to this ill, ill considered impeachment process, partisan impeachment process. But it looks like the base of the party is supporting Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. And these things like the Green New Deal, Medicare for all, which are just completely unrealistic, will break break the bank and will concede more control to the federal government and less freedom for individuals to choose what they think is best for themselves and their families.

Guy Benson: Senator Cornyn, last question briefly. Jeff Sessions announcing he wants his old job back. You served with him for a long time, a senator from Alabama. Your thoughts on him jumping back into the race, having served as attorney general for a while?

Sen. Cornyn: Well, Jeff Sessions is a friend of mine, and I did serve with him for a long time in the Senate before he became attorney general. Obviously, he got crosswise with the president when he recused himself from the from the investigation over the Russian activities. I believe he did had no choice but to do that under Department of Justice guidelines. I think he's he's conducted himself honorably to the best of his ability. He hadn't attacked the president, which I think is smart. And he's decided to go back and run and serve the people of Alabama. And I wish him well.

Guy Benson: Senator John Cornyn of Texas. We really appreciate your time. We'd love to have you back, sir.

Sen. Cornyn: I'd love to come back. Thank you. Thank you very much.

Guy Benson: We'll make that happen. And we'll take a quick break as we just get going. It's Tuesday. It's the Guy Benson Show. Don't go anywhere."

After Steyer filed to place his name on the New Hampshire presidential primary ballot, the one-time hedge fund manager turned billionaire environmental and progressive advocate took a shot at Bloomberg while answering questions from reporters.

BLOOMBERG FACES HIGH HURDLES IF HE LAUNCHES 2020 BID

""I’ve traveled around full time for seven years and listened, said Steyer, who created the influential grassroots advocacy organization NextGenAmerica in 2013 and who has been one of the leaders of the push to impeach President Trump. “I feel as if anyone who doesn’t do that kind of traveling and face to face talking to Americans and more than that, listening to Americans, I don’t know how you could really in good conscience run for president.""

“I feel as if, as a Democrat, I’ve said about Michael Bloomberg, if he can’t accept the idea of a wealth tax, if he doesn’t embrace it, he doesn’t understand that inequality is at the heart of the problems in America right now, then I don’t think he should run, because I don’t think he can represent the Democratic Party,"" Steyer added.

Steyer was in New Hampshire on the same day that Bloomberg filed to place his name on the ballot in Arkansas, hours ahead of that state’s presidential primary filing deadline. On Friday, Bloomberg’s name was placed on the primary ballot in Alabama an hour ahead of that state’s filing deadline.

SANDERS BLASTS BLOOMBERG

Bloomberg – the former Republican-turned-independent New York City mayor -- changed his voter registration to Democrat last year. He flirted with a presidential bid early this year but ruled out a run in March. His top advisers said last week that the media and business mogul changed his mind because he worried the current crop of 2020 Democratic White House contenders were not “well positioned” to beat Trump next November.

Steyer announced in January that he wouldn’t run for president but later changed his mind. Since launching his campaign in July, he’s spent at least $47 million on his White House bid, mostly on TV commercials.

Asked by Fox News if he’ll spend another $47 million on his campaign, Steyer said “at the beginning of this campaign our staff estimated that we’d spend $100 million. Do I think that that was a good guess? I have no idea.”

He went on to emphasize the importance of this presidential election, saying “when people ask me ‘What are you willing to put into this? How much do you care?’ unlimited.”

Steyer – who is pulling in the mid-single digits, far behind the top-tier contenders – noted that the race is “probably more open today than it was three months ago or six months ago ... It’s more unsettled today than when I started. I don’t think I’m going to be the last person to enter this race.”

Montana Gov. Steve Bullock – a long-shot for the nomination - also filed to place his name on the New Hampshire primary ballot Tuesday, doing so a couple of hours before Steyer.

When asked about Bloomberg and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, who is also reportedly mulling a late entry into the Democratic race, Bullock emphasized that Democrats “have to win back places we lost. I think I can do it ... I don’t know that another coastal person running is going to make that much of a difference. Look, we already have one candidate from Massachusetts [Elizabeth Warren]. Do we need another? We already have one billionaire running [Steyer], do we need another?”"

GOP ON DEFENSE AHEAD OF PUBLIC IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS

Fox News: “Three top Republicans serving on panels involved in the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry into President Trump penned a memo to GOP members on those committees outlining ‘key points of evidence’ from the closed-door inquiry ahead of public hearings slated to begin Wednesday. Addressed to the GOP members of the House Intelligence Committee, House Oversight Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee, the memo outlines arguments in defense of Trump. It makes the case that Democrats failed to present any evidence of quid pro quo in Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. They say Trump had a ‘deep-seated, genuine and reasonable skepticism of Ukraine and U.S. taxpayer-funded foreign aid’ due to the country's history of ‘pervasive corruption’ since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The memo points out that both Trump and Zelensky have said they felt no pressure during the call. Another piece of evidence cited by the memo's authors is that Ukrainian government officials interfered in the 2016 presidential election in opposition to Trump in an effort to sway the race in favor of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a claim that Trump has made but has not been proven.”



Schiff warns GOP about going after Bidens - Fox News: “House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff set the stage for the first public hearings as part of the impeachment inquiry by vowing to keep questions at Wednesday's lead-off session focused on the Ukraine controversy -- in an implicit shot at Republican members who have signaled an interest in turning the tables on Democrats as they defend President Trump. … Notably, he cited rules for the investigation that would keep it focused on alleged attempts by the president to seek politically advantageous investigations from a foreign government, and whether he sought to cover it up. The first hearings in the public phase of the impeachment inquiry will feature testimony from State Department official George Kent and top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor on Wednesday. Later this week, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich will appear.”



Mulvaney reverses course, will follow Trump’s order not to cooperate - WaPo: “On the eve of the first public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry, President Trump complained that Democrats are relying on ‘2nd and 3rd hand witnesses,’ while a memo by Republican staff previewed how they plan to defend him. … In morning tweets, Trump, meanwhile, said that both Bidens should be called as witnesses in the public hearings that begin Wednesday with testimony from two State Department officials. … Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney no longer plans to seek a judge’s ruling on whether he should testify in the impeachment inquiry and will instead follow Trump’s order not to cooperate. In a court filing Tuesday, Mulvaney’s lawyer said Mulvaney is reversing course and would not file suit seeking a court opinion on whether he must comply with a House subpoena.”

TIME OUT: REVISITING A PIVOTAL WWII BATTLE

Smithsonian: “‘At the present time we have only enough water for two weeks. Please supply us immediately,’ read the message sent by American sailors stationed at Midway, a tiny atoll located roughly halfway between North America and Asia, on May 20, 1942. The plea for help, however, was a giant ruse; the base was not, in fact, low on supplies. When Tokyo Naval Intelligence intercepted the dispatch and relayed the news onward … their American counterparts finally confirmed what they had long suspected: Midway and ‘AF,’ cited by the Japanese as the target of a major upcoming military operation, were one and the same. This codebreaking operation afforded the United States a crucial advantage at what would be the Battle of Midway, a multi-day naval and aerial engagement fought between June 3 and 7, 1942. … Midway, a new movie from director Roland Emmerich … traces the trajectory of the early Pacific campaign from the December 7, 1941, bombing of Pearl Harbor to the Halsey-Doolittle Raid in April 1942, the Battle of the Coral Sea in May of that same year, and, finally, Midway itself.”

BUTTIGIEG SURGES TO FIRST PLACE IN IOWA

Monmouth University: “South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg has joined former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at the top of the leaderboard in the third Monmouth University Poll of the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses. Buttigieg’s gains since the summer have been across the board, with increasing support coming from nearly every demographic group. Regardless, less than one-third of likely caucusgoers say that they are firmly set on their choice of candidate and most would not be too disappointed if they had to switch their support. The poll also finds that Mike Bloomberg receives a chilly reception among Hawkeye State Democrats as he considers whether to make a late entry into the nomination contest. Four candidates are currently vying for the top spot in Iowa’s caucuses – Buttigieg (22%), Biden (19%), Warren (18%), and Sanders (13%). Compared to Monmouth’s August poll, Buttigieg has gained 14 points (up from 8%)…”



Sanders falls to fourth in Granite State - Quinnipiac University: “With less than 100 days to go, former Vice President Joe Biden has an edge in New Hampshire's Democratic primary for president, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today. Biden receives support from 20 percent of New Hampshire likely Democratic primary voters, with Senator Elizabeth Warren getting 16 percent, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg getting 15 percent, and Sen. Bernie Sanders at 14 percent. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard gets 6 percent, businessman Andrew Yang gets 4 percent, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar and businessman Tom Steyer are each at 3 percent. No other candidate tops 1 percent, and 14 percent of likely voters are undecided. Independent voters, known as ‘undeclared voters’ in New Hampshire, who are likely to vote in the Democratic primary are divided in their top choice. Biden receives 16 percent support among these voters, while Sanders and Buttigieg get 14 percent each, and Warren and Gabbard receive 10 percent each.”



Mark Sanford drops out of presidential race - The [Charleston, S.C.] Post and Courier: “Former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford dropped out of the race for president just moments ago, ending his protest bid 60 days after it began. In a noon press conference at the New Hampshire Statehouse, Sanford announced his long-shot run is ending after previously declaring he would spend most of November campaigning in the Granite State, site of the nation’s first primary. The move came after Sanford failed to collect much of a following, especially as President Donald Trump remains the favorite of most Republican voters nationally and while Washington is gearing up for impeachment hearings. Sanford said the impeachment inquiry surrounding the president had sucked the proverbial oxygen out of the 2020 debate. ‘You gotta be a realist, and what I did not anticipate is an impeachment,’ he said, adding he is suspending the campaign and will look for other ways to advance his stance against the deficit.”



Former governor of Massachusetts considering bid - NYT: “Former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts has told Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democratic officials that he is considering making a last-minute entry into the 2020 presidential race, according to three Democrats familiar with the conversations, the latest evidence of how unsettled the party’s primary is less than three months before the Iowa caucuses. Mr. Patrick, a respected two-term governor and one of the highest-profile black leaders in the party, has told some of the Democratic officials that he doesn’t think any of the candidates have established political momentum and that he thinks there is an opening for somebody who can unite both liberal and moderate voters, according to Democrats who have spoken to him. He and some of his top advisers had a meeting Sunday in Boston to discuss what a campaign would look like, according to two Democrats.”



Sen. Michael Bennet expanding campaign in N.H. - WMUR: “While another Democratic presidential candidate is cutting back her effort in New Hampshire and still another is pulling out of the state entirely, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet is expanding his presence and making a bold commitment. The Bennet campaign currently has one New Hampshire office, in Manchester, and small number of staffers in the state. But that’s about to change. The Bennet campaign told WMUR on Monday that within the next several weeks, it will open three new offices, including a new office in Manchester, and is currently ‘aggressively hiring’ additional Granite State staffers. Bennet made a public commitment. ‘Spending time with New Hampshire voters has made me a better candidate,’ he said in a statement shared with WMUR.”



Milwaukee DNC replaces top fundraiser - Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: “There's been a quiet shakeup in the leadership of the fundraising team for next year's Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. Out as the Host Committee's fundraising director is Marcus Switzer, a 32-year-old Milwaukee native who served as deputy national fundraising director for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016. Switzer has returned to Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaign team. Switzer held the post for about six months. Replacing him is Leah Israel, a 36-year-old Chicago native who worked as a fundraiser for U.S. Sen.

Fox News: “The future of the DACA program for young illegal immigrants remained uncertain as the Supreme Court on Tuesday appeared to lack consensus on whether the Trump administration's plans to rescind legal protections for so-called Dreamers were proper. The cases were debated during 80 minutes of tense oral arguments. No side appeared to command a clear majority of justices over what has become a major test of executive power on the contentious issue of immigration reform. At issue is the Obama-era program known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. It was created under executive order and gives about 700,000 people brought as children to the United States illegally --or on visas that later were overstayed -- the opportunity to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and become eligible for a work permit. Hundreds of Dreamers and their supporters rallied outside the court. Members of Congress were among those watching the arguments inside.”



LA. GOVERNOR’S RACE SEES RECORD NUMBER IN EARLY VOTING

Monroe [La.] News Star: “Louisiana loves voting early with voters coming close to setting an all-time record last week for the Nov. 16 governor's election. In all, 489,654 cast early ballots for the Nov. 16 runoff between Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards and Republican Baton Rouge businessman Eddie Rispone in a race generally considered a tossup. That's 100,000 plus more ballots than were cast early for the Oct. 12 primary that whittled the field to Edwards and Rispone. ‘This is a sea change between what existed previously,’ said Pearson Cross, a University of Louisiana at Lafayette political science professor. ‘I think it's a good thing that spurs turnout.’ … Early voting isn't likely to hit 40% of the total for the Nov. 16 election, but it could account for a third or more of total votes cast. Trump will headline another rally at 7 p.m. Thursday at the CenturyLink Center in Bossier City.”

AUDIBLE: ‘THE ENEMY WITHIN’

“Our politics are paralyzing the country. We practice suspicion or contempt where trust is needed, imposing a sentence of anger and loneliness on others and ourselves. We scorch our opponents with language that precludes compromise. We brush aside the possibility that a person with whom we disagree might be right. We talk about what divides us and seldom acknowledge what unites us. … Contending viewpoints and vocal dissent are inevitable, and not the issue. … What is dangerous is not that people have serious differences. It is the tone—the snarl, the scorn, the lacerating despair.” – Former Defense Secretary James Mattis in his piece “The Enemy Within,” published in the Atlantic.

MARATHON MAN

BBC: “A British man has become the first person to run a marathon in every country in the world. Nick Butter, 30, from Bristol, [England] has run 196 marathons in 196 countries after starting in Canada in January 2018 and finishing in Greece on Sunday. He was inspired to do it to raise funds for Prostate Cancer UK after a friend was diagnosed with the disease. Mr. Butter said he was ‘overwhelmed’ to have finished, after he crossed the finishing line of the Athens marathon. He said he was ‘very tired’ after completing the challenge, which took 674 days and involved visiting an average of just over two countries a week. … He chose Athens for his final run due to it being ‘the home of the marathon.’ Mr. Butter, originally from Dorset, [England] crossed the line with his friend Kevin Webber, who has prostate cancer and who inspired him to take up the challenge.”

Deval Patrick (D) said he’d received encouragement to run for president in 2020, but he wasn’t prepared to subject his loved ones to “the cruelty of our elections process.” It came on the heels of related comments the former governor made to David Axelrod.

“It’s hard to see how you even get noticed in such a big, broad field without being shrill, sensational or a celebrity – and I’m none of those things and I’m never going to be any of those things,” Patrick said in a podcast interview.

That was then; this is now.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick announced Thursday that he will run for the Democratic nomination for president. His decision to enter the primary comes against the backdrop of the realities of the political calendar – the filing deadline in all-important New Hampshire is Friday – as well as continued consternation from some Democrats about whether the current field presents viable options to beat President Donald Trump in 2020.

The former two-term governor of Massachusetts will reportedly travel to New Hampshire this morning, where he’ll file for the nation’s first presidential primary in person.

For those keeping score, Patrick pushes the Democrats’ 2020 field back up to 18 members – it was starting to shrink a bit from historic highs – though he and Montana’s Steve Bullock are the only current or former governors in the race. (Washington’s Jay Inslee and Colorado’s John Hickenlooper also ran, but ended their campaigns months ago.)

What’s more, the field may yet grow larger: former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is inching closer to a national bid – he’s already filed for a couple of primaries – and former Attorney General Eric Holder is reportedly still weighing his 2020 options.

In terms of the calendar in a historical context, MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki added yesterday that Patrick is entering the race at the latest date of any presidential candidate since Pat Buchanan entered the 1992 Republican race on Dec. 10, 1991, though he did not win any primaries or caucuses. Gary Hart re-entered the 1988 Democratic race on Dec. 15, 1987, though he didn’t win any contests, either.

All of which serves as a reminder of the serious hurdles Patrick is facing.

In his favor, Patrick will be able to point to his successes as a two-term governor and his personal friendship with Barack Obama. Given the importance of the New Hampshire primary, it won’t hurt that the Massachusetts governor is from a neighboring state.

On the other hand, Patrick has limited national name recognition, no national operation, empty campaign coffers, little chance of making the next round of primary debates, and in New Hampshire he’ll face two rivals – Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren – who are also from neighboring states.

Complicating matters, I’m not altogether sure how Patrick will explain away his work with Bain Capital after Democratic criticisms of Mitt Romney’s work with the same private-equity firm in the recent past.

Presidential hopefuls who jump in late invariably fall short. Patrick may buck the trend, but the odds are not in his favor."

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts reiterated her strong support for the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry into President Trump.

Warren, who was in New Hampshire Wednesday to file to place her name on the Granite State's presidential primary ballot, also took another shot at former New York City mayor and billionaire business and media mogul Mike Bloomberg, who’s taking steps towards jumping into the Democratic race.

And she told Fox News that a potential entry this week by former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick wouldn’t complicate her own White House bid.

FOX NEWS COVERAGE OF THE TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

Warren – one of the first Democratic White House hopefuls to call for Trump’s impeachment -- told reporters after filing that “I believe it is appropriate for this impeachment inquiry to go forward. I think it should have happened earlier, but we're here now. Let’s do it.”

When asked if she had been watching the testimony from the televised public hearing, Warren said: “I just haven’t been able to catch up with it. Fortunately, I will catch up tonight.”

If the Democratic-controlled House impeaches the president, the GOP-led Senate would then hold a trial which could lead to Trump’s removal from office. Such a trial would probably keep Warren and the other Senate Democrats running for president off the campaign trail during the weeks leading up to the first nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire.

""I have Constitutional responsibilities,"" Warren said. ""I took an oath of office, as did everyone in Congress and part of that oath of office is the basic principle that no one is above the law. That includes the president of the United States. And if the House goes forward and sends an impeachment over to the Senate, then I will be there for the trial.”

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Warren told Fox News that she hadn’t talked with Patrick in recent days and said “no” when asked if the fellow Massachusetts Democrat’s potential entry into the race would complicate her own campaign. When asked about Patrick's years working at investment firm Bain Capital, Warren answered “I’m not here to criticize other Democrats. I’m here to talk about why I’m running for president.”

Patrick is likely to announce his candidacy on Thursday by video or social media, multiple outlets reported on Wednesday. He would then travel to neighboring New Hampshire on Friday the last day for candidates to file to place their names on the primary ballot.

Patrick isn’t the only Democrat likely to launch a campaign at this late date in the primary cycle. Bloomberg has placed his name on the presidential primary ballots in Alabama and Arkansas in recent days as he moves closer to launching a White House run.

I believe that what our election should be about is grassroots. How you build something all across New Hampshire, all across the country, and that we really shouldn’t have elections that are about billionaires calling all the shots, whether they’re reaching into their pockets to fund their own elections or whether they’re counting on getting other people to run,"" said Warren, who’s been critical of Bloomberg in recent days.

“I’ve noticed that billionaires go on TV and cry,"" she added. ""Other billionaires encourage their billionaire buddies to jump into the race.""

Warren may have been referring to billionaire Omega Advisors CEO Leon Cooperman, who lamented during an interview on CNBC last week that Trump is dividing and polarizing Americans while Warren is pushing “Idiocy.” Like many other billionaires, Cooperman has heavily criticized Warren’s proposed tax on the richest Americans, calling it a “bankrupt concept.”"

That’s according to a Fox News Poll of Nevada voters.

In the nomination contest, Biden receives the backing of 24 percent of Democratic caucusgoers, followed by Sanders and Elizabeth Warren each at 18 percent.

Next is Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent, Tom Steyer at 5 percent, Kamala Harris at 4 percent, Andrew Yang 3 percent, and Tulsi Gabbard and Amy Klobuchar at 2 percent apiece. Cory Booker and Julian Castro each get 1 percent.

Biden (23 percent) and Warren (21 percent) receive nearly equal backing among white caucusgoers, followed by Sanders (13 percent) and Buttigieg (12 percent).

The top picks among Hispanics are Sanders (31 percent) and Biden (24 percent), with Warren a distant third (10 percent). Buttigieg garners 1 percent.

Self-identified liberals prefer Biden (25 percent) and Warren (25 percent) over Sanders (18 percent) and Buttigieg (10 percent). Moderates and conservatives like Biden (24 percent) and Sanders (18 percent), with no others hitting double digits.

Sanders is the clear choice for those under age 45, while those 45 and over go for Biden.

CLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS

Nominating a candidate who can beat Trump (74 percent extremely important) is far more important to Nevada Democratic voters than one who shares their views on major issues (41 percent extremely important). Biden is the number one choice among both of those groups.

Caucusgoers split 46-46 percent between wanting a candidate who will build on former President Obama’s legacy and one who will take a new and different approach. Legacy voters go heavily for Biden, while those wanting a new approach give a slight edge to Sanders.

More Warren backers (67 percent) are extremely interested in the election than those supporting Biden (62 percent) and Sanders (47 percent).

On the other hand, Biden (70 percent) and Sanders (70 percent) have more “strong” supporters than Warren (61 percent).

Nevada’s February 22 Democratic caucus is 100 days away, soon after elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.

Fifty-three percent of Nevada voters rate the economy positively, including 22 percent calling it excellent. For comparison, 14 percent of voters nationally rate the economy as excellent.

Meanwhile, more disapprove (52 percent) than approve (45 percent) of the job Trump is doing. His 45 percent approval roughly matches his 2016 vote share, as Hillary Clinton won the Silver State 48-46 percent.

Women help drive Trump’s job rating underwater: 38 percent approve and 60 percent disapprove. Men approve by 53-43 percent, resulting in a 32-point gender gap.

Forty-three percent of Nevadans think Trump should be impeached and removed from office, 4 percent say impeached but not removed, and 46 percent oppose impeachment altogether.

The poll was conducted November 10-13, which includes one night after the House Intelligence Committee held televised hearings on impeachment Wednesday.

Despite Trump’s negative job rating, he remains competitive in potential matchups tested. Both Biden (47-40) and Sanders (47-40) have a 7-point advantage over Trump (outside the poll’s margin of error), and Warren is up by 3 (44-41). Buttigieg and Trump tie at 41 percent each. No candidate hits 50 percent and 13-18 percent are undecided or would back a third-party candidate.

Biden and Sanders do better against Trump in large part because of stronger support among men and Hispanics. Among men, Trump bests Biden by 5 points and Sanders by 4, yet he leads Warren by 12 points. Hispanics pick Biden and Sanders over Trump by 26 points, while Warren’s advantage is 18 points.

“These results reinforce the notion that Nevada remains a battleground state,” says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. “But the state’s underlying demographic changes make it challenging for Republicans.”

Warren and Buttigieg are likely hurt by some voters believing it is too soon for a woman (17 percent) or a gay president (41 percent).

Majorities of Nevada voters say the country is ready to elect a female president (76 percent), a Jewish president (67 percent), and a Latino/Hispanic president (67 percent). Views split 46-41 percent over electing a gay or lesbian.

Among Democrats: 83 percent feel the United States is ready to elect a woman president, 68 percent a Jewish leader, 68 percent a Latino/Hispanic candidate, and 53 percent a gay president.

While about two-thirds of Republicans say the country would elect a candidate who is female (66 percent), Jewish (67 percent) or Latino/Hispanic (65 percent), over half think the country isn’t ready for a gay president (35 yes vs. 51 no).

""It's not a new thing. It's as old as hate. You know, the trick is we just got to figure out who we hate this week,"" argued Rowe on Fox Nation's ""Reality Check with David Webb.""

In September, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., tweeted, ""Billionaires should not exist."" Fellow 2020 contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., was accused by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon of ""vilifying successful people"" and Warren has been cheered on the campaign trail for mocking billionaires' objections to her proposals.

""Who can we blame? That's the game,"" Rowe told Fox Nation host David Webb.

""This country has been successful because ... it was business and industry and expansion, whether in agriculture and technology, hard work, you know, people taking risk,"" observed Webb, saying that many in the media appear to be stoking Americans' ""envy"" of their fellow countrymen.

""For me, you know, it's even more human,"" continued Rowe. ""I think on some level, we wind up resenting everything we rely on. It's only a matter of time. But if you walk resentment back, it almost always comes from some kind of dependency.""

The former ""Dirty Jobs"" host said that the recent planned power outrages in California provided an example of resentment in action.

""Last week, I was without power for four days and a lot of my neighbors realized all of a sudden, 'Wait a second, nothing works.'"" he recalled. ""That makes people very angry. And they don't know who to blame. So they flip off the linemen. You know, they blame PG&E. They blame the politicians. They blame everything.""

""But deep down, what's really going on is they just got a reminder that they utterly rely on a little plastic switch and the miracle that happens when they flip it and they're not in control of any of that. They don't have a generator. They don't have the means to fix the problem,"" said Rowe, suggesting that resentment is being turned on the wealthy by those who believe that the economic system is not working for them.

SANDERS, WARREN 'INCOME INEQUALITY' ARGUMENT IS BOGUS: EXPERT PANEL EXPLAINS

Rowe suggested that Americans must empower themselves by re-evaluating the definition of a good job in America. He started the ""Mike Rowe Works Foundation,"" which educates people about, ""millions of 'shovel ready' jobs for a society that doesn’t encourage people to pick up a shovel.""

""We've got over 7 million jobs in this country... that we need to fill,"" observed Webb. ""And in order to fill those jobs, we've got to get people through the right education.""

""Look on 'Dirty Jobs,' I failed in this area. I could have done a better job,"" admitted Rowe. ""But of the 300 people we featured, 40 were multimillionaires. Nobody knows it because they were covered in crap because they were crawling through a sewer or working in a septic tank. We don't associate optically any level of success with somebody who's covered in filth... reminding people of that is important,"" he concluded.

That leads to tight races in 2020 ballot tests, according to a Fox News Poll of North Carolina voters.

In hypothetical matchups, Joe Biden edges Trump by two points and Bernie Sanders is up by one. The president tops Elizabeth Warren by one point and Pete Buttigieg by four. Each race is within the poll’s margin of error. There is added uncertainty considering no candidate hits 50 percent and 11-18 percent are undecided.

Trump topped Hillary Clinton by nearly 4 points in the Tar Heel State. Ninety-four percent of Republicans voted for him in 2016. Today, 91 percent of Republicans approve of the job he’s doing and 89 percent back him in the matchup against Biden.

“As North Carolina has grown in recent years, it’s developed into one of the most competitive states in the country,” says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who partners with Democrat Chris Anderson on the Fox News Poll. “It’s difficult to think of a scenario where Trump wins re-election without carrying the state.”

Roughly equal numbers of North Carolina voters approve (47 percent) of Trump’s job performance as disapprove (50 percent).

Forty-two percent want Trump impeached and removed from office, 3 percent say impeached but not removed, and 47 percent oppose impeachment. More Republicans (89 percent) oppose impeachment than Democrats favor (79 percent).

The poll was conducted November 10-13, which includes one night after the House Intelligence Committee held televised hearings Wednesday.

Turning to the Democratic race, strong support among African American voters gives Biden a commanding lead in North Carolina’s primary, which will be held March 3, 2020.

Overall, Biden captures 37 percent among Democratic primary voters, more than double the support of any competitor. Warren receives 15 percent and Sanders 14 percent.

Buttigieg garners 6 percent and Kamala Harris 4 percent. Cory Booker, Tulsi Gabbard, Tom Steyer, and Andrew Yang stand at 2 percent apiece. Michael Bennett, Steve Bullock, and Amy Klobuchar each receive 1 percent.

About half of black voters support Biden (49 percent). That’s more than 30 points higher than Warren and Sanders (12 percent each).

Biden also leads among voters over age 65 (+39 points), moderates (+20), and whites (+11).

The only group Warren wins is self-described “very liberals,” and even here she narrowly tops Sanders (by 4 points) and Biden (by 5 points).

Sanders’ only win is among voters under age 35, where he bests Biden by 10.

“Polling outside of the early states illustrates what broad goodwill Democratic primary voters have for Biden, especially among black voters,” says Anderson. “Places where campaigning is currently less intense, he starts with a built-in advantage that could pay dividends once the primaries move beyond the early states.”

North Carolina Democrats split 45-45 percent when choosing between a candidate who will build on former President Obama’s legacy and one who will take a new and different approach.

Biden is the favorite by 29 points among those wanting to build on Obama’s legacy and by 14 points for those favoring a new approach.

Meanwhile, 77 percent of Democratic primary voters say it is extremely important to nominate a candidate who can beat Trump compared to 41 percent who feel it is extremely important the nominee shares their views on major issues.

North Carolina Senate

By a 40-35 percent margin, North Carolina voters approve of the job Republican incumbent Thom Tillis is doing as their senator. One in four (25 percent) is unsure, including 22 percent of Republicans.

Elected in 2014, Tillis is facing two challengers in the senate primary. He leads with the support of 54 percent of GOP primary voters, while Garland Tucker receives 11 percent and Sandy Smith 4 percent. Twenty-six percent are undecided and 5 percent say other.

Things are more uncertain on the other side, as the three declared Democrats are all under 20 percent: Erica Smith receives 18 percent, Cal Cunningham 13 percent, and Trevor Fuller 10 percent. Most Democratic primary voters are undecided (49 percent) or say they will support someone else (10 percent).

Is the U.S. electorate an equal opportunity employer? Two-thirds of North Carolina voters think the country is ready to elect a woman president. That drops to 54 percent for a Jewish president, 49 percent a Latino/Hispanic president, and 30 percent a gay/lesbian president.

By a 24-point margin, more Democrats than Republicans believe the nation is ready for a woman president. Democrats are also more likely to say Americans are ready to elect someone who is Jewish (by 7 points), Latino/Hispanic (by 11 points), or gay (by 17 points).

Patrick, the former two-term governor of neighboring Massachusetts, said that he’s “a big, big fan of Joe Biden.”

But he noted that the former vice president’s “deep, deep, public empathy doesn’t always come through in this campaign.”

DEVAL PATRICK MAKES LATE ENTRY INTO 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

And he took another dig at Biden’s emphasis on ousting President Trump and returning to the normalcy of his eight years as President Barack Obama’s vice president.

""The instinct that his campaign seems to have to say, to project in effect ‘if we just get rid, if you will, of the incumbent, we can just go back to doing what we used to do,’ misses the moment,"" Patrick argued.

The late entry into the race by Patrick could present a threat to the former vice president. It appears Patrick will run a center-left campaign, fighting for the same voters that Biden and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg have been successfully courting. And he could give Biden a fight in the former vice president’s early voting state stronghold of South Carolina, where black voters make up a majority of the Democratic primary electorate.

Patrick could also pose problems for fellow Bay Stater Elizabeth Warren. The senator from Massachusetts is now a co-front-runner in the polls alongside Biden, with Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also part of the top tier of candidates in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire.

""I want to acknowledge my friendship and my enormous respect, in particular with Senator Warren,"" Patrick told Fox News. ""I talked to her last night and I think it was a kind of hard conversation for both of us frankly.”

Asked about the government-run programs that Warren and Sanders are proposing, such as ""Medicare-for-all,"" Patrick praised both of the populist Democratic standard-bearers but added: “I think that if we want solutions that last, they can’t be solutions that feel to the voting public as if they are just Democratic solutions.”

Despite his criticisms of Warren and Biden, Patrick insisted he didn’t want to play the role of a political pundit and emphasized: “Let me be clear about a ground rule for me going forward. I am not trying to climb up by trying to pull anyone else down.”

Patrick also told reporters that he wouldn’t object to an outside group – such as a super PAC that can accept unlimited contributions – assisting his campaign.

“It would be hard for me to see how we put all the resources together for an effective campaign without a PAC of some kind,” he said. “I wish it weren’t so. I wish campaigns weren’t as expensive and I wish that the influence of money that we’ve seen in Washington wasn’t as great as it is.”

Biden has been criticized by many of his rivals for not speaking out against a newly formed super PAC that’s hoping to raise millions of dollars on behalf of the former vice president’s White House bid.

Patrick acknowledged that joining the race late – Iowa kicks off the nominating calendar on Feb. 3, followed eight days later by New Hampshire – presents high hurdles.

“It’s a big and talented field,"" he said. ""It’s hard to break through not just because it’s this stage in the elections, in the campaigns, but it’s hard to break through without being a celebrity or sensational and I’m neither of those things.”

But he highlighted that “voters all across the country in some cases are just tuning in and in many cases haven’t made their decisions.”

And Patrick – a long-shot who went on to win the Massachusetts governorship in the 2006 election – emphasized that “I understand what we have to do but you know what, I’ve lived a political life and I would say as a black man, a whole life dealing with skepticism.”

Patrick served as U.S. Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division from 1994-1997 under President Bill Clinton. After serving his two terms as governor, Patrick took a job with Bain Capital, the Boston-based private investment firm that became a liability to Mitt Romney – Patrick’s predecessor as Massachusetts governor – during Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign. Patrick’s tenure at the firm will likely be in the spotlight in the 2020 race.

Asked about the liability, Patrick told reporters “I smile because when I was co-chair of the Obama-Biden campaign in 2012 and there was all the attacks on Bain Capital on account of Mitt Romney, I was asked about that and I didn’t buy it then and I don’t buy it now.

The former governor mulled launching a presidential campaign last year, assembling a team of advisers and enjoying the backing of some of former President Barack Obama’s top political aides. But late last year, Patrick announced he wouldn’t run, pointing to the “cruelty of our elections process.”

Patrick said “I was ready to go last year… we got really, really close.” But he noted that just two weeks before Thanksgiving, his wife Diane was diagnosed with uterine cancer “and it’s the sort of thing that brings you right back to earth and I felt that the right thing to do for her, for us, was to focus on that.”

He explained that his wife is now cancer free."

IMPEACHMENT SHOW DEBUTS

Fox News: “Diplomats testifying on the opening day of impeachment inquiry hearings delivered a stark account Wednesday of President Trump’s pursuit of political ‘investigations’ in Ukraine and attorney Rudy Giuliani’s alleged meddling in that country, while Republicans panned the entire process as a ‘low-rent Ukrainian sequel’ to the Russia collusion case. For his part, Trump spent much of the day meeting with the visiting Turkish president, saying he was too busy to watch the historic hearing. … But in between the sparring among lawmakers was extensive testimony from the two lead-off witnesses, State Department official George Kent and top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor.”



GOP Senators skip - AP: “Millions of Americans are expected to watch on live TV Wednesday as the House kicks off public hearings on whether to impeach President Donald Trump. Just don’t expect many Republican senators to be among them, if a quick sampling of them is to be believed. Of eight Senate Republicans questioned Tuesday evening, seven said they wouldn’t watch Wednesday’s start of the Democratic-led process or suggested it wasn’t a priority. ‘Tomorrow I’m going to be paying attention to what we’re doing in the Senate,’ said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said he’d be chairing an Environment and Public Works Committee session.”



What will impeachment mean for 2020 Dems? - Politico: “The degree to which the Democrats in Congress who are running the impeachment inquiry are disconnected from their colleagues running for president cannot be overstated. Impeachment and the presidential primary are like two planets slowly pulled together by gravity that are finally about to collide — nobody seems to know who will survive impact. … ‘This is kind of like if Roland Emmerich decided to make a movie about American politics,’ said a senior Biden adviser, speaking of the German filmmaker known for his disaster films. ‘No one would have predicted that we are potentially looking at a January where six Democratic presidential candidates are potentially serving on a jury in which Donald Trump is the defendant.’”



Trump wanted to fire inspector general for disloyalty - NYT: “President Trump has discussed dismissing the intelligence community’s inspector general, Michael Atkinson, because Mr. Atkinson reported a whistle-blower’s complaint about Mr. Trump’s interactions with Ukraine to Congress after concluding it was credible, according to four people familiar with the discussions. Mr. Trump first expressed his dismay about Mr. Atkinson around the time the whistle-blower’s complaint became public in September. In recent weeks, he has continued to raise with aides the possibility of firing him, one of the people said. The president has said he does not understand why Mr. Atkinson shared the complaint, which outlined how Mr. Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Mr. Trump’s political rivals at the same time he was withholding military aid from the country. He has said he believes Mr. Atkinson, whom he appointed in 2017, has been disloyal, one of the people said.”



Trump welcomes Turkish strongman Erdogan - AP: “Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and President Donald Trump met Wednesday as relations between the NATO allies are at their lowest point in decades, with Turkey drifting closer to Russia and Ankara facing a Washington backlash over its offensive against Kurds in Syria. Erdogan and Trump have a difficult agenda. They will discuss Turkey’s decision to buy a Russian air defense system despite its membership in NATO and its incursion into neighboring Syria to attack Kurdish forces who have fought with the U.S. against the Islamic State group. The issues threaten to jeopardize a potentially lucrative trade deal between the two countries. The leaders’ scheduled afternoon news conference, following a meeting with Republican lawmakers at the White House, will give Trump a stage to counter the first public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry.”

TIME OUT: FINDING THE ‘LOST CITY’

NatGeo: “In 1976 a group of Colombian archaeologists and their guides embarked on a grueling mission to save and ancient site from looters. Swinging machetes, they inched their way over the thick, jungled foothills of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta near Colombia’s Caribbean coast. … Their mission was urgent: Authorities had been tipped off that a major archaeological site had been found by huaqueros, archaeological looters. Items from the site had already begun appearing on the antiquities black market. The team needed to bring the site under state control before more damage was done to the country’s heritage. The team was trying to reach an area that is generally known as Teyuna, which they had taken to calling a more informal name: Ciudad Perdida, ‘lost city.’ The Tairona had abandoned many of their settlements in the late 1600s, but their descendants who still live in the Sierra Nevada had never really considered the city lost.”

HILLARY OPEN TO 2020 RUN: ‘I THINK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME’

USA Today: “Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to close the door on the possibility of entering the 2020 presidential race, telling an interviewer Tuesday, ‘I never say never to anything.’ The 2016 Democratic presidential nominee was asked during a BBC Radio interview if she was ‘100%’ certain she would not run again. Clinton replied that she thinks ‘all the time about what kind of president I would have been, and what I would have done differently, and what I think it would have meant to our country and the world.’ ‘So of course, I think about it. I think about it all the time,’ she said. … ‘I will certainly tell you, I'm under enormous pressure from many, many, many people to think about it,’ she said. ‘But as of this moment, sitting here in this studio talking to you, that is absolutely not in my plans.’”



Buttigieg’s New Hampshire plan counts on indies - Politico: “As Pete Buttigieg boarded his campaign bus … a New Hampshire voter stopped him to ask if campaign staffers were hawking ‘Republicans for Pete’ stickers yet. They aren’t. But Buttigieg, who’s staking out center-left ground in the Democratic presidential primary, is trying to build a coalition of unaffiliated voters to go along with Democrats and make a surprise splash in the open-primary state featuring two senators-next-door, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, campaigning on the left. At town halls during his latest swing across New Hampshire, Buttigieg name-checked ‘future former Republicans’ in the same breath as ‘progressives and moderates ... ready for some kind of change.’ His organizers are targeting independent voters from the new field offices Buttigieg opened this fall. And while Buttigieg is polling well in both Iowa and New Hampshire right now … the presence of non-Democrats in the New Hampshire Democratic primary — unlike Iowa’s closed caucus system — could prove decisive in a tight Democratic nominating race...”



But South Carolina looms - National Review: “…a big question hanging over Buttigieg’s head is whether he can make sufficient inroads with African-American primary voters to capture the nomination. Black voters make up about a quarter of the Democratic primary electorate, but two thirds of South Carolina primary voters are black, and Buttigieg remains stuck in the single digits in the Palmetto State. … Buttigieg’s weakness in South Carolina is partly a function of the fact that Joe Biden, former vice president to America’s first black president, retains a commanding lead among black voters. But Buttigieg’s weakness is also partly a function of his sexual orientation, as David Catanese reported in The State last month: ‘Internal focus groups conducted by Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign this summer reveal a possible reason why he is struggling with African-American voters: some see his sexuality as a problem.’”



Sanders tries to sway Hispanic lawmakers - Politico: “Bernie Sanders met privately with Hispanic lawmakers on Tuesday. Sanders, who has aggressively courted Latino voters in his 2020 bid for the White House, is the third presidential candidate to sit down with Latino members under the auspices of BOLD PAC, the fundraising arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren have also talked with BOLD PAC. Sanders spoke about immigration, Medicare for All, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and other issues, including his family’s immigrant roots. A Latino caucus member in the room said several undecided lawmakers were present, and that Sanders did not exclusively talk about economic issues.”



Patrick could complicate Warren’s campaign - Politico: “When Elizabeth Warren was asked to name three African Americans she'd choose for her presidential cabinet last week, she pointed to her friend Deval Patrick as one of them. But the former Massachusetts governor had other ideas. Around the same time, the former governor and a handful of close allies were huddling not far from Warren's campaign headquarters, plotting a surprise entry into the Democratic primary. The now-public prospect of his candidacy — and its potential effect on Warren, who has recently emerged as a Democratic frontrunner — is suddenly the subject of intense speculation among the Massachusetts political class. … His potential entry into the Democratic primary undoubtedly puts a strain on their relationship. Several Massachusetts Democrats — who declined to go on the record because of the sensitive nature of the issue — viewed reports that Patrick was preparing to join the field as an affront to Warren, who has been running hard for nearly a year.”



Is there a path for Bloomberg or Patrick? - NYT: “Both men have concluded in recent weeks that Mr. Biden, the former vice president, is not the imposing adversary they had expected him to be, interviews with aides and allies show. Both also believe there is room in the race for a more dynamic candidate who is closer to the political middle than Mr. Biden’s two most prominent challengers, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders. Should Mr. [Michael] Bloomberg and Mr. Patrick enter the race, they would test that proposition in different ways: Mr. Bloomberg with a powerfully funded campaign that would take on President Trump directly and contest the biggest states on the primary map from the start; Mr. Patrick with an insurgent candidacy that would begin in next-door New Hampshire and run through South Carolina, where black voters are likely to decide the primary.”

AUDIBLE: THESE GO TO 11

“For those who continually ask, you should just expect that we will continue to make news every day. So don’t ask ‘what’s on tap?’ Just know something’s on tap.” – A House Democratic aide working on the impeachment inquiry said during a conference call with Hill reporters, per Time magazine.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Normally, I hate doing housework, but these days I would rather vacuum than listen to the news. Fortunately, I have the Halftime Report to bring some sanity and understanding to the process. I have a question that I can't seem to find an answer to, and with your vast experience, I was hoping that you know the answer. There is so much argument over who the Democrats will let the Republicans call as witnesses. When it goes to trial in the Senate won't they be able to call whoever they want to testify and uncover anything the Democrats are trying to hide? By the way, I would gladly trade you some good KC BBQ for a few of those pepperoni rolls you are so fond of.” – Tom Steele, Bates City, Mo.



[Ed. note: You are on, Mr. Steele! And yes, you’re quite right about the witness-list histrionics. This is, as they would say in Gregsville, some stuff people say. (Though they don’t really say “stuff.”) Republicans want to reinforce their preferred narrative: This is a kangaroo court and Democrats are denying the president due process. Everything at hand will be pressed into service of that goal.]



“Could Joe Biden's lead in national polling, but not in individual states, be explained by how well he piles up voters in a few very large states e. g. New York, Illinois, and California?” – Tom Snyder, Frankfort, Ill.



[Ed. note: There might be some truth in that, Mr. Snyder. But a couple of things to remember: Good pollsters look for representative geographical distributions. That should be somewhat of a control on that phenomenon. But the larger consideration is that we don’t have any evidence that Biden runs better in these places. We have basically no useful polling in Illinois, but the polling we have from California and New York shows Biden running neck and neck with Sen. Elizabeth Warren. National polling tells me that Biden’s base isn’t geographic as much as it is demographic. He does best with non-white voters, especially women. If a Democratic candidate had to choose any bloc on which to base his or her candidacy, that would be the one to pick.]



“So the Democrats have moved their December debate to Loyola Marymount. What are they thinking? It's a fine school but Roman Catholic. You know, the institution with no women priests, the one steadfastly opposed to abortion, gay marriage, etc.” – Stuart Barr, Durham, N.C.



[Ed. note: But Will Joe Biden take communion while he’s there?]



“Chris, It occurs to me that polls and surveys (now a routine part of everybody's lives) supports and reinforces the identity politics of the far left. There was a time (in my distant past) when surveys, etc. only identified people by partisan segment (Democrat, Republican, Independent) and location. Beyond that, we were all ‘Americans.’ Now we go much deeper into who people are by describing their demographic associations. While the factions that the founding fathers warned against undoubtedly benefit, they do so by knowing which demographic groups to target and shape their messages accordingly. … I was raised believing that voting was my opportunity to express my view regarding who would be best for the WHOLE country. I NEVER hear that point of view anymore either in the family, in the classroom, in the media. I rarely hear it in political ads. Your thoughts?” – Eric Hutchins, Santa Barbara, Calif.



[Ed. note: I don’t know how much of this phenomenon you can lay at the feet of public pollsters. The revolution in public opinion research began more than 40 years ago as marketing gurus demanded better ways to sell floor wax, Ford Granadas and Funyuns. People with carpets don’t need floor wax, people who only drive Chevys don’t care about Granadas and Funyuns, while not broadly popular, have a hugely devoted core of enthusiasts. So companies decided it would be worth spending money to find out how to target the hardwood-floor-having-Ford-loving-Funyun-scarfing population rather than just wasting money on broad-spectrum ads. Back then it was about finding the right magazines and television shows in which to advertise. In time, the same kind of market research being used in corporate America made it over to the far-less-lucrative world of politics. Politics had always been about message targeting based on the demographics of various precincts. Since the birth of the republic, politicians targeted their messages to the constituents of various precincts. Gerrymandering, after all, has been with us from the start. But thanks to marketing magic, by the turn of the 21st century, campaigns were able to engage in “micro-targeting,” in which they could zero in on specific demographic subsets in geographic areas. Are you a gun-rights zealot but live in an overwhelmingly Democratic neighborhood? Are you usually an indifferent Republican-leaner, but are ardently pro-choice? Campaigns became increasingly able to zero in on you with ads, calls and mail. The trend exploded with the birth of online advertising. That all would be happening however public pollsters conducted their work. By the way, the reason polls have to pay attention to demographics – gender, ethnicity, income, education, etc. – is so that we end up with samples that are actually representative of the country. If you knew that there were 100 purple marbles, 50 green marbles and 25 orange marbles in a pouch and pulled five oranges in a row you might start to wonder about your sampling methods.]



“With the potential for a 3-way tie at the top of the Democrat pack, do you think Michael Bloomberg is counting on being the compromise candidate at a brokered convention? By at least getting his name in, he is signaling his availability when they realize ‘none of the above’ can win.” – Sheila Willis, Toronto, Canada



[Ed. note: I think there’s quite a bit to that, Ms. Willis. And hey, why not? The median net worth for an American household is, according to the Federal Reserve, just shy of $100,000. Bloomberg is worth something like $50 billion. If he spent, let’s say, $50 million on a just-in-case candidacy that would be .1 percent of his fortune – the equivalent of $100 for the average family.]



“Yes, Branagh’s ‘St Crispin’s Day’ speech is worth a look. But so is the night-before-battle scene where Henry wanders through the camp in disguise to gauge the spirit of the troops. Branagh does not hold back on the moral ambivalence of the original Shakespeare. In contrast, Sir Laurence Olivier, commissioned by Churchill in wartime, had to tone the camp scene down in his 1944 version. And Olivier’s ‘St Crispin’s Day’ speech is also stirring for this Veteran’s Day, but in a different style.” – John McNeill Lee, Walnut Creek, Calif.



[Ed. note: Good notes all, Mr. Lee!]



“Chris, I didn't know where to send this now that you’re off twitter. Since I get the Halftime Report I figured this is as good a place as any. … I'm a Midwestern boy and in trying to find my father a solid gift for Christmas last year I needed a new plan. … My first place to start was with bacon. My father (as with most Midwestern men) loves bacon. So I set out with my Google Fu to find the best there is to offer. Seemed that most signs pointed to one man and his amazing Tennessee smoked bacon and hams. Bentons County Hickory Smoked Bacon is said to be some amazing stuff. … I in no way work for Bentons or have any affiliation with them, I’m just a fan of wonderful bacon. I ordered him a box and he was so blown away I had to get myself one after the holidays to test the hype. It's some awesome stuff. … So if you have not heard of this amazing goodness I thought I would throw it on your radar… I hope you and your family have a wonderful set of holidays.” – Matt Ladd, Arlington, Va.



[Ed. note: I have many times enjoyed Benton’s delicious bacon and hams, Mr. Ladd. I, myself, prefer Edwards of Virginia, but then again, my tastes run more toward country ham over bacon for luxury cured meats. Benton’s ham is marvelous, too. But you may want to check out a bone-in Wigwam ham from Edwards this year. Pure ambrosia. And unlike the bacon, when you’re done, you can make bean soup!]

WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU LEMONS…

The Island Packet: “Parrish Brown thought it was strange when the Hilton Head Island [S.C.] McDonald’s worker paused as he ordered a sweet tea with light ice and extra lemon. ‘Extra lemon?’ the drive-thru worker asked in an odd voice. Brown later figured out what the ‘extra lemon’ was about when he discovered quite a bit of weed inside his sweet tea — after he drank it, at work. The 24-year-old Charleston man called the Beaufort County Sheriff’s Office … to report the incident. ‘I have never had weed a day in my life, so immediately after I started drinking it, I started to feel weird and it didn’t taste like something I recognized,” Brown said. … Finally … he opened up the lid only to find something he wasn’t expecting: three bags of marijuana. … ‘I kept being like ‘I swear, there is weed in my sweet tea!’’ he said. ‘The officer asked me why I drank it and I was like, ‘Well, I was thirsty!’”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“…History has been unkind to every stripe of utopian thinking. But it is not just that we have failed to achieve the messianic future. Even the democratic present is under widespread assault.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in a 2017 essay “The Authoritarian Temptation,” published in his posthumous book, “The Point of It All.”

WELCOME TO THE RACE DEVAL PATRICK

Fox News: “Former two-term Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick is jumping into the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Patrick declared his candidacy for the White House in a video on social media and in an email sent to supporters early Thursday. ‘I admire and respect the candidates in the Democratic field that bring a richness of ideas and experience and a depth of character that makes me proud to be a Democrat,’ Patrick said. ‘But if the character of the candidates is an issue in every election, this time is about the character of the country. So in the spirit of profound gratitude for all the country has given to me, with a determination to build a better, more sustainable, more inclusive American dream for the next generation, I am today announcing my candidacy for president of the United States.’ Patrick is expected to travel later on Thursday to neighboring New Hampshire to file for the state’s first-in-the-nation presidential primary. Friday is the last day for candidates to place their names on the primary ballot.”



Biden proposes $1.3 trillion infrastructure plan - Politico: “Joe Biden wants to spend $1.3 trillion on infrastructure as president, aiming to reduce carbon emissions, create jobs and shore up the ailing Highway Trust Fund with ‘new revenues’ in a plan released Thursday that's reminiscent of the Obama years. Biden’s 12-page plan promises to ‘ensure new revenues are secured to stabilize the Highway Trust Fund’ but doesn’t specify where those revenues would come from or how he would get political consensus for them. In many ways it's also a throwback to the administration of President Barack Obama, with planks related to ‘complete streets,’ repairing existing infrastructure before building new and calling for investments in transit and high-speed rail. The plan’s goal of working directly with cities, instead of always going through state departments of transportation as an intermediary, is another throwback.”



Pragmatic Klobuchar gaining ground - Time: “While Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have proffered revolutionary proposals—including free college tuition, nationwide student-debt cancellation and Medicare for All—[Amy] Klobuchar has staked out a platform defined by pragmatism. Her higher-education plan centers on free in-state community college and higher Pell Grant caps, and her health care proposal offers a public option through which people could purchase access to Medicare or Medicaid. …Klobuchar has seized the opportunity to brand herself as the moderate alternative—a take-your-vitamins realist in a field defined by idealism. There’s some evidence her strategy is working. In the six days after the October debate … Klobuchar’s campaign raked in $2.1 million… She has since become one of 10 candidates to qualify for the November debate in Atlanta, and one of six to qualify for the December one in Los Angeles. Her support in the Hawkeye State has swelled too.”



Post heart attack Sanders trying to rebound - NYT: “Before a campaign event last month, Bernie Sanders and his wife, Jane, went for an hourlong stroll around Green Castle Recreation Area, a lush park in central Iowa with evergreen trees and a small lake. … Ms. Sanders is ensuring that her husband is getting adequate rest, and he has been requesting fish for dinner instead of steak or ribs. … Some allies, aware that Mr. Sanders can appear rumpled, have even urged him to dress better — he has been wearing more stylish sweaters — and to rein in his previously unkempt hair. … His recuperative program has coincided with a vigorous push to reboot his campaign… He and his team recognize that his ability to beat his chief ideological rival, Elizabeth Warren, and the rest of the leading candidates depends in part on whether he can convince voters that his age, and his health, is not an issue.”



Warren attacks billionaires in new campaign ad - CNBC: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren is launching a new attack on the billionaires who have criticized her proposed taxes and policies with a new ad set to air on CNBC this week, according to a campaign aide. Titled ‘Elizabeth Warren Stands Up to Billionaires,’ the ad takes aim at longtime investor Leon Cooperman, former CEO of TD Ameritrade Joe Ricketts, former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel. The ad will premiere Thursday on CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street,’ which airs at 9 a.m. ET, and Jim Cramer’s ‘Mad Money,’ which airs at 6 p.m. ET, in all New York and Washington, D.C., markets, the aide added. The ad will be part of a digital buy, as well. … The ad opens with Warren telling a campaign rally: ‘It is time for a wealth tax.’ The ad then plays clips of the aforementioned billionaires.”



THE RULEBOOK: THE HOUSE REPRESENTS

“Under these reasonable limitations, the door of this part of the federal government is open to merit of every description, whether native or adoptive, whether young or old, and without regard to poverty or wealth, or to any particular profession of religious faith.” – Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, Federalist No. 52



TIME OUT: ‘CALL ME ISHMAEL.’

History: “Moby-Dick is now considered a great classic of American literature… Initially, though, the book about Captain Ahab and his quest to catch a giant white whale was a flop. Its author, Herman Melville was born in New York City in 1819. … Melville’s sixth book, Moby-Dick, was first published in October 1851 in London, in three volumes titled The Whale, and then in the U.S. a month later [on Nov. 14, 1851]. Melville had promised his publisher an adventure story similar to his popular earlier works, but instead, Moby-Dick was a tragic epic, influenced in part by Melville’s friend and Pittsfield, Massachusetts, neighbor, Nathaniel Hawthorne, whose novels include The Scarlet Letter. … Melville died in 1891, largely forgotten by the literary world. By the 1920s, scholars had rediscovered his work, particularly Moby-Dick, which would eventually become a staple of high school reading lists across the United States.”

FIRST DAY OF HEARINGS PUTS PRESSURE ON MODERATE DEMS

Fox News: “All eyes were on moderate House Democrats in swing districts Wednesday night, after the first day of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry against President Trump wrapped up with no major revelations -- but also highlighted weaknesses in Democrats' key witnesses, who relied primarily on second-hand information and never once interacted with the president. At one point in Wednesday's hearing, Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., even appeared to embrace hearsay testimony, claiming that ‘hearsay can be much better evidence than direct’ … It was unclear which of those limited exceptions would apply to Wednesday's testimony -- and whether Quigley's argument would persuade critical swing-vote Democrats. … Freshman Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich. -- who flipped a GOP district in 2018 that Trump won by 7 points in 2016 -- told Fox News that she was tentatively weighing all the evidence. ‘My constituents expect me to make an objective decision,’ Slotkin said as the hearings concluded…”



Pelosi says Trump committed bribery - Politico: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that President Donald Trump committed ‘bribery,’ an impeachable offense, by trying to force Ukraine into tarnishing a political rival to help him in the 2020 election. The speaker’s remark is one of her strongest statements yet on the scandal engulfing Trump that is threatening his presidency. Bribery is one of the specific crimes spelled out in the Constitution as an impeachable offense. ‘I am saying what the president has admitted to and said it’s perfect — it’s perfectly wrong. It’s bribery,’ Pelosi told reporters during her weekly press conference Thursday. … Still, Pelosi cautioned, she isn’t yet ready to say whether the House will vote to impeach Trump, an outcome many lawmakers think is all but certain to happen by the end of this year.”



Report: Republicans discuss prolonging Senate impeachment trial - WaPo: “Some Republican senators and their advisers are privately discussing whether to pressure GOP leaders to stage a lengthy impeachment trial beginning in January to scramble the Democratic presidential race — potentially keeping six contenders in Washington until the eve of the Iowa caucuses or longer. Those conversations about the timing and framework for a trial remain fluid and closely held, according to more than a dozen participants in the discussions. But the deliberations come as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) faces pressure from conservative activists to swat back at Democrats as public impeachment hearings began this week in the House. The discussions raise a potential hazard for the six Democratic senators running for president, who had previously planned on a final sprint out of Washington before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses and the Feb. 11 New Hampshire primary.”



Did anything new come from the hearings? - Fox News: “[Wednesday] offered one previously undisclosed allegation. Career diplomat William Taylor, the charge d’affaires in Kiev, offered testimony, for the first time that the president was overheard by a member of his staff on July 26 asking EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland about ‘the investigations,’ to which Sondland supposedly responded that ‘the Ukrainians were ready to move forward.’ Taylor said that following Sondland’s call with Trump, the member of his staff asked what Trump thought about Ukraine. ‘Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for,’ Taylor said, revealing new information from his prior testimony last month. ‘At the time I gave my deposition on October 22, I was not aware of this information. I am including it for completeness.’”



What’s next - AP: “Several more witnesses scheduled to testify in the House impeachment hearings over the next week are expected to say they too worried about President Donald Trump’s push for Ukraine to investigate Democrats as the U.S. withheld military aid from the country. … On Friday, lawmakers will hear from former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was ousted in May at Trump’s direction. … Eight more witnesses will testify next week, some in back-to-back hearings on the same day. Among them will be Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council … Gordon Sondland, Trump’s European Union ambassador … and Fiona Hill, a former Russia adviser to the White House who told lawmakers about national security adviser John Bolton’s concerns about Ukraine. … The public hearings are expected to last at least another week.”



White House brings in backup to unify strategy - WashEx: “Newly appointed White House aide Tony Sayegh will try to bring cohesion to a disorderly White House impeachment response… The Washington Examiner has learned that Sayegh, a former Treasury official, will work with the White House communications team, White House counsel Pat Cipollone and his staff, and other administration offices to develop and streamline a strategy to dispute allegations and make sure Republicans are on the same page. … Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi was brought in to partner with Sayegh and will be the media face of the anti-impeachment campaign, with plans to leverage her legal background to discredit allegations by House Democrats that the president abused his power in his dealings with Ukraine.”



The Judge’s Ruling: Impeachment and the Constitution - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano discusses the facts surrounding the impeachment hearings: “The House is operating under rules adopted in 2015, when Republicans ran the House. Schiff is no more secretive about or partisan against the president than my old boss, then-Judiciary chair Rep. Peter Rodino, was toward Nixon or then-Judiciary chair Rep. Henry Hyde was toward Clinton. Both acquired evidence from secret proceedings, and both decided to impeach before any public hearings were held. Impeachment is political, not juridical. Former President Gerald R. Ford was essentially right when he argued that under the Constitution impeachable offenses are whatever a majority of the House says they are -- for Nixon, covering up a break-in; for Clinton, lying about consensual sex; for Trump, solicitation, bribery and obstruction. Whose behavior was arguably the gravest?” More here.



JON HUNTSMAN ANNOUNCES THIRD RUN FOR UTAH GOVERNOR

The Salt Lake Tribune: “Former U.S. ambassador Jon Huntsman says he’s grown weary of the national political scene, with its ‘theatrics,’ time-wasting and dearth of meaningful action. Now, he’s asking Utah’s voters to return him to what he calls ‘the best job in the world’ — working as governor. ‘For a very long time, we’ve served our country in the top two diplomatic posts in the world. Now we feel it is time to give back to our home state again,’ Huntsman said on a campaign video posted Thursday morning. He’s vying for a third term as governor in the 2020 election, a little more than 10 years since he last held the post. He previously served as governor from 2005 to 2009. … News leaked Wednesday night that Huntsman would be kicking off his campaign Thursday, and he did with an early call-in to KSL radio and by launching his website and campaign materials.”



RNC jumps in to help Louisiana governor’s race - Politico: “The Republican National Committee is pouring another $1 million into the Louisiana governor’s race ahead of Saturday’s runoff — a move that comes amid mounting GOP concerns about losing a second major election in a conservative state in as many weeks. The last-minute spending doubles the committee’s investment in the race, where Republican Eddie Rispone is trying to unseat Democratic incumbent John Bel Edwards. President Donald Trump is set to headline a rally for Rispone in Louisiana on Thursday evening, barreling ahead despite worries within the GOP that Edwards is a slight favorite to win. Trump had bet that a GOP sweep in three gubernatorial races this fall would project political strength in the face of impeachment. But after Republican Gov. Matt Bevin’s apparent defeat in Kentucky last week, and with Rispone locked in a neck-and-neck race, the president is facing the possibility of losing two out of three.”

GOOD PIGGIES

NY Post: “These pigs have a nose for nose candy. Italy’s Il Tirreno reported that authorities believe wild boars in Tuscany have sniffed out some 20,000 euros (about $22,000) worth of cocaine buried in the woods near Montepulciano. Local police learned of the incident after tapping the phone lines of a suspected drug-trafficking group, who revealed the incident during one of their calls. The powder had been stored in jars and tucked into waterproof packages. Allegedly, a boar had stomped the earth where the jars had been buried, which caused the containers to burst, scattering the illicit stimulant across the forest floor. Local officials claim this particular gang is responsible for slinging some two kilograms of blow per month to club-goers around the cities of Arezzo and Siena between September 2018 and March 2019… The drug dealers — one Italian and three Albanians — have been arrested and face charges for drug trafficking.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“I don’t think the West needs to apologize — or pay — for having invented the steam engine. In fact, I’ve long favored a real climate-change pact, strong and enforceable, that would impose relatively uniform demands on China, India, the United States, the European Union and any others willing to join.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on June 8, 2017.

Castro and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas are two candidates who debated last month who will not appear on the debate stage for the next round next week. Castro failed to meet the threshold requirements set forth by Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, while O’Rourke dropped out of the race last month.

Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney and author Marianne Williamson also failed to qualify.

This month, candidates were required to have reached 3 percent support in at least four qualifying national polls since Sept. 13 or 5 percent in two early-nominating state polls since that date, while collecting contributions from at least 165,000 unique donors -- with at least 600 each in a minimum of 20 states.

CASTRO LAYS OFF STAFF IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SOUTH CAROLINA

Some candidates have criticized Perez for what they've viewed as overly stringent requirements. Some argue that the donor emphasis has forced them to spend disproportionately for online fundraising efforts that drain resources they could be using to reach voters in other ways.

Perez says hopefuls have had ample time to demonstrate their supporter, both in polls and through small-dollar contributors, and that any Democrat falling short this far into the campaign almost certainly isn’t positioned to win the nomination or defeat President Trump in November 2020.

Perez has announced even stiffer requirements for a Dec. 19 debate. The polling marks:4 percent in four national polls or 6 percent in two early state polls taken after Oct. 16. The donor threshold: 200,000 unique donors, with at least 800 from each of 20 states.

The top-tier candidates – former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg -- are not threatened by those goals. Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have met them as well.

But the higher targets put pressure on several other candidates to broaden their support or risk falling out of any reasonable contention with less than three months to go before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses.

Two new candidates also could be vying for December spots.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick launched his campaign Thursday and filed to appear on New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary ballot. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is considering a bid as well, already having filed paperwork for some Super Tuesday primaries.

Deval Patrick (D) said he’d received encouragement to run for president in 2020, but he wasn’t prepared to subject his loved ones to “the cruelty of our elections process.” It came on the heels of related comments the former governor made to David Axelrod.

“It’s hard to see how you even get noticed in such a big, broad field without being shrill, sensational or a celebrity – and I’m none of those things and I’m never going to be any of those things,” Patrick said in a podcast interview.

That was then; this is now.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick announced Thursday that he will run for the Democratic nomination for president. His decision to enter the primary comes against the backdrop of the realities of the political calendar – the filing deadline in all-important New Hampshire is Friday – as well as continued consternation from some Democrats about whether the current field presents viable options to beat President Donald Trump in 2020.

The former two-term governor of Massachusetts will reportedly travel to New Hampshire this morning, where he’ll file for the nation’s first presidential primary in person.

For those keeping score, Patrick pushes the Democrats’ 2020 field back up to 18 members – it was starting to shrink a bit from historic highs – though he and Montana’s Steve Bullock are the only current or former governors in the race. (Washington’s Jay Inslee and Colorado’s John Hickenlooper also ran, but ended their campaigns months ago.)

What’s more, the field may yet grow larger: former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is inching closer to a national bid – he’s already filed for a couple of primaries – and former Attorney General Eric Holder is reportedly still weighing his 2020 options.

In terms of the calendar in a historical context, MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki added yesterday that Patrick is entering the race at the latest date of any presidential candidate since Pat Buchanan entered the 1992 Republican race on Dec. 10, 1991, though he did not win any primaries or caucuses. Gary Hart re-entered the 1988 Democratic race on Dec. 15, 1987, though he didn’t win any contests, either.

All of which serves as a reminder of the serious hurdles Patrick is facing.

In his favor, Patrick will be able to point to his successes as a two-term governor and his personal friendship with Barack Obama. Given the importance of the New Hampshire primary, it won’t hurt that the Massachusetts governor is from a neighboring state.

On the other hand, Patrick has limited national name recognition, no national operation, empty campaign coffers, little chance of making the next round of primary debates, and in New Hampshire he’ll face two rivals – Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren – who are also from neighboring states.

Complicating matters, I’m not altogether sure how Patrick will explain away his work with Bain Capital after Democratic criticisms of Mitt Romney’s work with the same private-equity firm in the recent past.

Presidential hopefuls who jump in late invariably fall short. Patrick may buck the trend, but the odds are not in his favor."

That’s according to a Fox News Poll of Nevada voters.

In the nomination contest, Biden receives the backing of 24 percent of Democratic caucusgoers, followed by Sanders and Elizabeth Warren each at 18 percent.

Next is Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent, Tom Steyer at 5 percent, Kamala Harris at 4 percent, Andrew Yang 3 percent, and Tulsi Gabbard and Amy Klobuchar at 2 percent apiece. Cory Booker and Julian Castro each get 1 percent.

Biden (23 percent) and Warren (21 percent) receive nearly equal backing among white caucusgoers, followed by Sanders (13 percent) and Buttigieg (12 percent).

The top picks among Hispanics are Sanders (31 percent) and Biden (24 percent), with Warren a distant third (10 percent). Buttigieg garners 1 percent.

Self-identified liberals prefer Biden (25 percent) and Warren (25 percent) over Sanders (18 percent) and Buttigieg (10 percent). Moderates and conservatives like Biden (24 percent) and Sanders (18 percent), with no others hitting double digits.

Sanders is the clear choice for those under age 45, while those 45 and over go for Biden.

Nominating a candidate who can beat Trump (74 percent extremely important) is far more important to Nevada Democratic voters than one who shares their views on major issues (41 percent extremely important). Biden is the number one choice among both of those groups.

Caucusgoers split 46-46 percent between wanting a candidate who will build on former President Obama’s legacy and one who will take a new and different approach. Legacy voters go heavily for Biden, while those wanting a new approach give a slight edge to Sanders.

More Warren backers (67 percent) are extremely interested in the election than those supporting Biden (62 percent) and Sanders (47 percent).

On the other hand, Biden (70 percent) and Sanders (70 percent) have more “strong” supporters than Warren (61 percent).

Nevada’s February 22 Democratic caucus is 100 days away, soon after elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.

Fifty-three percent of Nevada voters rate the economy positively, including 22 percent calling it excellent. For comparison, 14 percent of voters nationally rate the economy as excellent.

Meanwhile, more disapprove (52 percent) than approve (45 percent) of the job Trump is doing. His 45 percent approval roughly matches his 2016 vote share, as Hillary Clinton won the Silver State 48-46 percent.

Women help drive Trump’s job rating underwater: 38 percent approve and 60 percent disapprove. Men approve by 53-43 percent, resulting in a 32-point gender gap.

Forty-three percent of Nevadans think Trump should be impeached and removed from office, 4 percent say impeached but not removed, and 46 percent oppose impeachment altogether.

The poll was conducted November 10-13, which includes one night after the House Intelligence Committee held televised hearings on impeachment Wednesday.

Despite Trump’s negative job rating, he remains competitive in potential matchups tested. Both Biden (47-40) and Sanders (47-40) have a 7-point advantage over Trump (outside the poll’s margin of error), and Warren is up by 3 (44-41). Buttigieg and Trump tie at 41 percent each. No candidate hits 50 percent and 13-18 percent are undecided or would back a third-party candidate.

Biden and Sanders do better against Trump in large part because of stronger support among men and Hispanics. Among men, Trump bests Biden by 5 points and Sanders by 4, yet he leads Warren by 12 points. Hispanics pick Biden and Sanders over Trump by 26 points, while Warren’s advantage is 18 points.

“These results reinforce the notion that Nevada remains a battleground state,” says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. “But the state’s underlying demographic changes make it challenging for Republicans.”

Warren and Buttigieg are likely hurt by some voters believing it is too soon for a woman (17 percent) or a gay president (41 percent).

Majorities of Nevada voters say the country is ready to elect a female president (76 percent), a Jewish president (67 percent), and a Latino/Hispanic president (67 percent). Views split 46-41 percent over electing a gay or lesbian.

Among Democrats: 83 percent feel the United States is ready to elect a woman president, 68 percent a Jewish leader, 68 percent a Latino/Hispanic candidate, and 53 percent a gay president.

While about two-thirds of Republicans say the country would elect a candidate who is female (66 percent), Jewish (67 percent) or Latino/Hispanic (65 percent), over half think the country isn’t ready for a gay president (35 yes vs. 51 no).

That leads to tight races in 2020 ballot tests, according to a Fox News Poll of North Carolina voters.

In hypothetical matchups, Joe Biden edges Trump by two points and Bernie Sanders is up by one. The president tops Elizabeth Warren by one point and Pete Buttigieg by four. Each race is within the poll’s margin of error. There is added uncertainty considering no candidate hits 50 percent and 11-18 percent are undecided.

Trump topped Hillary Clinton by nearly 4 points in the Tar Heel State. Ninety-four percent of Republicans voted for him in 2016. Today, 91 percent of Republicans approve of the job he’s doing and 89 percent back him in the matchup against Biden.

“As North Carolina has grown in recent years, it’s developed into one of the most competitive states in the country,” says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who partners with Democrat Chris Anderson on the Fox News Poll. “It’s difficult to think of a scenario where Trump wins re-election without carrying the state.”

Roughly equal numbers of North Carolina voters approve (47 percent) of Trump’s job performance as disapprove (50 percent).

Forty-two percent want Trump impeached and removed from office, 3 percent say impeached but not removed, and 47 percent oppose impeachment. More Republicans (89 percent) oppose impeachment than Democrats favor (79 percent).

The poll was conducted November 10-13, which includes one night after the House Intelligence Committee held televised hearings Wednesday.

Turning to the Democratic race, strong support among African American voters gives Biden a commanding lead in North Carolina’s primary, which will be held March 3, 2020.

Overall, Biden captures 37 percent among Democratic primary voters, more than double the support of any competitor. Warren receives 15 percent and Sanders 14 percent.

Buttigieg garners 6 percent and Kamala Harris 4 percent. Cory Booker, Tulsi Gabbard, Tom Steyer, and Andrew Yang stand at 2 percent apiece. Michael Bennett, Steve Bullock, and Amy Klobuchar each receive 1 percent.

About half of black voters support Biden (49 percent). That’s more than 30 points higher than Warren and Sanders (12 percent each).

Biden also leads among voters over age 65 (+39 points), moderates (+20), and whites (+11).

The only group Warren wins is self-described “very liberals,” and even here she narrowly tops Sanders (by 4 points) and Biden (by 5 points).

Sanders’ only win is among voters under age 35, where he bests Biden by 10.

“Polling outside of the early states illustrates what broad goodwill Democratic primary voters have for Biden, especially among black voters,” says Anderson. “Places where campaigning is currently less intense, he starts with a built-in advantage that could pay dividends once the primaries move beyond the early states.”

North Carolina Democrats split 45-45 percent when choosing between a candidate who will build on former President Obama’s legacy and one who will take a new and different approach.

Biden is the favorite by 29 points among those wanting to build on Obama’s legacy and by 14 points for those favoring a new approach.

Meanwhile, 77 percent of Democratic primary voters say it is extremely important to nominate a candidate who can beat Trump compared to 41 percent who feel it is extremely important the nominee shares their views on major issues.

North Carolina Senate

By a 40-35 percent margin, North Carolina voters approve of the job Republican incumbent Thom Tillis is doing as their senator. One in four (25 percent) is unsure, including 22 percent of Republicans.

Elected in 2014, Tillis is facing two challengers in the senate primary. He leads with the support of 54 percent of GOP primary voters, while Garland Tucker receives 11 percent and Sandy Smith 4 percent. Twenty-six percent are undecided and 5 percent say other.

Things are more uncertain on the other side, as the three declared Democrats are all under 20 percent: Erica Smith receives 18 percent, Cal Cunningham 13 percent, and Trevor Fuller 10 percent. Most Democratic primary voters are undecided (49 percent) or say they will support someone else (10 percent).

Is the U.S. electorate an equal opportunity employer? Two-thirds of North Carolina voters think the country is ready to elect a woman president. That drops to 54 percent for a Jewish president, 49 percent a Latino/Hispanic president, and 30 percent a gay/lesbian president.

By a 24-point margin, more Democrats than Republicans believe the nation is ready for a woman president. Democrats are also more likely to say Americans are ready to elect someone who is Jewish (by 7 points), Latino/Hispanic (by 11 points), or gay (by 17 points).

Conducted November 10-13, 2019 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,504 North Carolina voters who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones. Respondents were randomly selected from a statewide voter file, and 669 were screened to identify potential participants in the Democratic primary and 574 the GOP primary. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points for all registered voters, 3.5 points for Democratic primary voters, and 4 points for GOP primary voters."

Patrick, the former two-term governor of neighboring Massachusetts, said that he’s “a big, big fan of Joe Biden.”

But he noted that the former vice president’s “deep, deep, public empathy doesn’t always come through in this campaign.”

DEVAL PATRICK MAKES LATE ENTRY INTO 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

And he took another dig at Biden’s emphasis on ousting President Trump and returning to the normalcy of his eight years as President Barack Obama’s vice president.

""The instinct that his campaign seems to have to say, to project in effect ‘if we just get rid, if you will, of the incumbent, we can just go back to doing what we used to do,’ misses the moment,"" Patrick argued.

The late entry into the race by Patrick could present a threat to the former vice president. It appears Patrick will run a center-left campaign, fighting for the same voters that Biden and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg have been successfully courting. And he could give Biden a fight in the former vice president’s early voting state stronghold of South Carolina, where black voters make up a majority of the Democratic primary electorate.

Patrick could also pose problems for fellow Bay Stater Elizabeth Warren. The senator from Massachusetts is now a co-front-runner in the polls alongside Biden, with Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also part of the top tier of candidates in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire.

""I want to acknowledge my friendship and my enormous respect, in particular with Senator Warren,"" Patrick told Fox News. ""I talked to her last night and I think it was a kind of hard conversation for both of us frankly.”

Asked about the government-run programs that Warren and Sanders are proposing, such as ""Medicare-for-all,"" Patrick praised both of the populist Democratic standard-bearers but added: “I think that if we want solutions that last, they can’t be solutions that feel to the voting public as if they are just Democratic solutions.”

Despite his criticisms of Warren and Biden, Patrick insisted he didn’t want to play the role of a political pundit and emphasized: “Let me be clear about a ground rule for me going forward. I am not trying to climb up by trying to pull anyone else down.”

Patrick also told reporters that he wouldn’t object to an outside group – such as a super PAC that can accept unlimited contributions – assisting his campaign.

“It would be hard for me to see how we put all the resources together for an effective campaign without a PAC of some kind,” he said. “I wish it weren’t so. I wish campaigns weren’t as expensive and I wish that the influence of money that we’ve seen in Washington wasn’t as great as it is.”

Biden has been criticized by many of his rivals for not speaking out against a newly formed super PAC that’s hoping to raise millions of dollars on behalf of the former vice president’s White House bid.

Patrick acknowledged that joining the race late – Iowa kicks off the nominating calendar on Feb. 3, followed eight days later by New Hampshire – presents high hurdles.

“It’s a big and talented field,"" he said. ""It’s hard to break through not just because it’s this stage in the elections, in the campaigns, but it’s hard to break through without being a celebrity or sensational and I’m neither of those things.”

But he highlighted that “voters all across the country in some cases are just tuning in and in many cases haven’t made their decisions.”

And Patrick – a long-shot who went on to win the Massachusetts governorship in the 2006 election – emphasized that “I understand what we have to do but you know what, I’ve lived a political life and I would say as a black man, a whole life dealing with skepticism.”

Patrick served as U.S. Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division from 1994-1997 under President Bill Clinton. After serving his two terms as governor, Patrick took a job with Bain Capital, the Boston-based private investment firm that became a liability to Mitt Romney – Patrick’s predecessor as Massachusetts governor – during Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign. Patrick’s tenure at the firm will likely be in the spotlight in the 2020 race.

Asked about the liability, Patrick told reporters “I smile because when I was co-chair of the Obama-Biden campaign in 2012 and there was all the attacks on Bain Capital on account of Mitt Romney, I was asked about that and I didn’t buy it then and I don’t buy it now.

The former governor mulled launching a presidential campaign last year, assembling a team of advisers and enjoying the backing of some of former President Barack Obama’s top political aides. But late last year, Patrick announced he wouldn’t run, pointing to the “cruelty of our elections process.”

Patrick said “I was ready to go last year… we got really, really close.” But he noted that just two weeks before Thanksgiving, his wife Diane was diagnosed with uterine cancer “and it’s the sort of thing that brings you right back to earth and I felt that the right thing to do for her, for us, was to focus on that.”

He explained that his wife is now cancer free."

Deval Patrick into the race, further dividing Democrats in their battle to pick a nominee to challenge President Trump in 2020.

This is good news for Trump, especially if it causes the crowded field to devolve into a bitter negative campaign. The more time Democrats spend attacking each other, the less time they have to attack the president.

In addition, Trump would be able to use the attacks by Democrats on their eventual nominee in ads when he runs against that person next year.

DEVAL PATRICK JUMPS INTO DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

Patrick is a former assistant U.S. attorney general and was governor of Massachusetts from 2007 to 2015, becoming the first African-American to hold that position.

Former New York City Mayor and multibillionaire Michael Bloomberg hasn’t made an official declaration of his candidacy yet, but seems certain to do so in the near future. He’s already filed to run in at least two states and is reportedly hiring staff across the country.

And 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told the BBC that she’s “under enormous pressure” to run again in 2020, and has refused to rule it out. But it seems unlikely that the former first lady, senator and secretary state will make a third presidential run at this late date, although it’s understandable why she could find it tempting.

Not counting Bloomberg and Clinton, 17 Democrats remain in the race for their party’s presidential nomination, though most have virtually no chance of winning the contest. Eight other Democrats have dropped out of the nomination race even before the first votes are cast.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., are atop the polls in the presidential contest. Right now it looks like only a handful of other candidates have even a longshot chance of capturing the nomination.

Patrick joins the Democratic race with the rumored tacit blessing of former President Barack Obama, who may be frustrated by the failure of any other candidate – particularly Biden, his vice president – to both consolidate the field and demonstrate a clear ability to defeat President Trump.

But there is evidence that Democratic primary voters are actually happy with the current crop of candidates.

The most recent Fox News Poll showed 69 percent of Democrats are satisfied with the field as it now stands. That’s particularly true among the more liberal wing of the party – which is split between supporters of self-described democratic socialist Sanders and Warren. Among the liberals, 71 percent are satisfied with the field.

More moderate Democrats appear slightly less satisfied than liberals. The polls suggest they’d be fine with Biden, particularly given his apparent strength against Trump in the general election.

While it’s unlikely that either Patrick or Bloomberg will be the Democratic nominee facing Trump in November 2020, neither candidate can be written off.

However, there’s a nagging feeling about Biden. Yes, he was exceedingly effective in both the 2008 and 2012 vice presidential candidate debates. But that was a long time ago. He will turn 77 on Wednesday and is showing his age, stumbling a few times in past debates and appearances and sometimes looking like he is past his prime.

The age issue has also been raised with Sanders, who is 78 and is back on the campaign trail after recently suffering a heart attack. It would certainly be raised with Bloomberg, who is 77, and could be raised with Warren, who is 70. However, the 73-year-old Trump would have a hard time attacking any of these candidates as being too old to be president.

Despite Biden’s imperfect performance to date, none of the other center-left candidates – I call them the “junior Bidens” – has managed to achieve real prominence.

Buttigieg has done extremely well in appearances and seems to have a very effective organization in Iowa. But only 30 percent of likely Democratic primary voters say he can beat Trump – compared to 68 percent who say that about Biden, and almost 60 percent who say that about Sanders and Warren.

That leaves running room – or at least dreaming room – for Patrick and Bloomberg. Can you blame either one for looking in the mirror each morning and thinking he can beat Biden?

Patrick had a strong and moderate, record as governor of Massachusetts. Though he starts with no organization and little money, he is hoping for a solid showing in Iowa and to then eclipse Biden in New Hampshire, which borders Massachusetts.

If Patrick makes a credible showing in Iowa and New Hampshire, he’d be in a position to win the South Carolina primary, where about 60 percent of the Democratic electorate is black. However, right now Biden enjoys very strong support among black voters – outpacing African-American candidates who joined the race months ago – so it would be premature to assume Patrick would come out on top in South Carolina.

One potential weakness for Patrick is that he just left a partnership at Bain Capital, the private equity firm founded by Mitt Romney. Yes, Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, former GOP presidential nominee, and current senator from Utah.

Patrick will certainly get attacked for his work at Bain by Sanders and Warren, who have proposed a slew of new taxes on wealthy individuals and on businesses, along with new regulations on the private sector.

However, I have trouble seeing how a caricature of a “rich fat cat” will stick to Patrick, who is the son of a single mother living in the Chicago projects, and who won scholarships to a fancy prep school and Harvard.

Still, the polls in New Hampshire suggest Patrick is not well-known there, despite an eight-year track record as governor next door.

And unlike Bloomberg, Patrick will need to expend significant time and effort raising money.

The smart money says it’s too late for Patrick to become the Democratic presidential nominee.

My own sense is that if Patrick can raise the contributions and hit the poll numbers needed to get into one of the upcoming Democratic presidential candidate debates, his optimistic message might enable him to beat the odds. Primary politics is a strange beast – and, yes, lightning does sometimes strike.

Remember that when then-Sen. Barack Obama first announced his presidential candidacy, many “experts” said America was not ready to elect a black president. And when Trump first announced he was running for president many pundits wrote him off as a publicity-seeking reality-TV star with no chance of getting the Republican nomination.

Bloomberg, whose net worth is said to be north of $50 billion, has the advantage of being able to write a check to amply fund his campaign and mount a multistate effort. However, his intention to self-fund will keep him out of Democratic presidential debates unless the rules to qualify are changed. That would present him with a big disadvantage.

At the same time, Bloomberg’s opposition to many of the far-left proposals of Sanders and Warren may wind up helping those two candidates more than hurting them with the liberal Democratic electorate.

“With enemies like Mike, he’ll wind up deepening their support,” one wag joked, about Sanders and Warren, “and here we thought they’ve renounced super PACs.”

The recent Fox News poll suggested that only 6 percent of Democratic primary voters would definitely support Bloomberg, while 32 would “never vote for him.” That’s a big disadvantage to overcome.

Bloomberg’s strategy is based on not entering any contests until the Super Tuesday primaries March 3 – after Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina vote.

Sixteen states – including the two most populous, California and Texas – hold primaries on Super Tuesday. They will divide up roughly 36 percent of delegates to the Democratic National Convention. The four early states will have only about 4 percent of convention delegates.

Bloomberg’s hope is that no two candidates will emerge as strong contenders after the first four nominating contests. Given how quickly previous nomination contests have been defined by the initial results, I wouldn’t put too much stock in that hope. Few things are certain in politics, but Iowa will winnow the field, and New Hampshire will likely define it.

Of course, politics remains unpredictable, with new developments able to shake up races significantly.

While it’s unlikely that either Patrick or Bloomberg will be the Democratic nominee facing Trump in November 2020, neither candidate can be written off. This unpredictability is one of the things that makes politics so interesting.

WELCOME TO THE RACE DEVAL PATRICK

Fox News: “Former two-term Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick is jumping into the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Patrick declared his candidacy for the White House in a video on social media and in an email sent to supporters early Thursday. ‘I admire and respect the candidates in the Democratic field that bring a richness of ideas and experience and a depth of character that makes me proud to be a Democrat,’ Patrick said. ‘But if the character of the candidates is an issue in every election, this time is about the character of the country. So in the spirit of profound gratitude for all the country has given to me, with a determination to build a better, more sustainable, more inclusive American dream for the next generation, I am today announcing my candidacy for president of the United States.’ Patrick is expected to travel later on Thursday to neighboring New Hampshire to file for the state’s first-in-the-nation presidential primary. Friday is the last day for candidates to place their names on the primary ballot.”



Biden proposes $1.3 trillion infrastructure plan - Politico: “Joe Biden wants to spend $1.3 trillion on infrastructure as president, aiming to reduce carbon emissions, create jobs and shore up the ailing Highway Trust Fund with ‘new revenues’ in a plan released Thursday that's reminiscent of the Obama years. Biden’s 12-page plan promises to ‘ensure new revenues are secured to stabilize the Highway Trust Fund’ but doesn’t specify where those revenues would come from or how he would get political consensus for them. In many ways it's also a throwback to the administration of President Barack Obama, with planks related to ‘complete streets,’ repairing existing infrastructure before building new and calling for investments in transit and high-speed rail. The plan’s goal of working directly with cities, instead of always going through state departments of transportation as an intermediary, is another throwback.”



Pragmatic Klobuchar gaining ground - Time: “While Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have proffered revolutionary proposals—including free college tuition, nationwide student-debt cancellation and Medicare for All—[Amy] Klobuchar has staked out a platform defined by pragmatism. Her higher-education plan centers on free in-state community college and higher Pell Grant caps, and her health care proposal offers a public option through which people could purchase access to Medicare or Medicaid. …Klobuchar has seized the opportunity to brand herself as the moderate alternative—a take-your-vitamins realist in a field defined by idealism. There’s some evidence her strategy is working. In the six days after the October debate … Klobuchar’s campaign raked in $2.1 million… She has since become one of 10 candidates to qualify for the November debate in Atlanta, and one of six to qualify for the December one in Los Angeles. Her support in the Hawkeye State has swelled too.”



Post heart attack Sanders trying to rebound - NYT: “Before a campaign event last month, Bernie Sanders and his wife, Jane, went for an hourlong stroll around Green Castle Recreation Area, a lush park in central Iowa with evergreen trees and a small lake. … Ms. Sanders is ensuring that her husband is getting adequate rest, and he has been requesting fish for dinner instead of steak or ribs. … Some allies, aware that Mr. Sanders can appear rumpled, have even urged him to dress better — he has been wearing more stylish sweaters — and to rein in his previously unkempt hair. … His recuperative program has coincided with a vigorous push to reboot his campaign… He and his team recognize that his ability to beat his chief ideological rival, Elizabeth Warren, and the rest of the leading candidates depends in part on whether he can convince voters that his age, and his health, is not an issue.”



Warren attacks billionaires in new campaign ad - CNBC: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren is launching a new attack on the billionaires who have criticized her proposed taxes and policies with a new ad set to air on CNBC this week, according to a campaign aide. Titled ‘Elizabeth Warren Stands Up to Billionaires,’ the ad takes aim at longtime investor Leon Cooperman, former CEO of TD Ameritrade Joe Ricketts, former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel. The ad will premiere Thursday on CNBC’s ‘Squawk on the Street,’ which airs at 9 a.m. ET, and Jim Cramer’s ‘Mad Money,’ which airs at 6 p.m. ET, in all New York and Washington, D.C., markets, the aide added. The ad will be part of a digital buy, as well. … The ad opens with Warren telling a campaign rally: ‘It is time for a wealth tax.’ The ad then plays clips of the aforementioned billionaires.”



THE RULEBOOK: THE HOUSE REPRESENTS

“Under these reasonable limitations, the door of this part of the federal government is open to merit of every description, whether native or adoptive, whether young or old, and without regard to poverty or wealth, or to any particular profession of religious faith.” – Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, Federalist No. 52



TIME OUT: ‘CALL ME ISHMAEL.’

History: “Moby-Dick is now considered a great classic of American literature… Initially, though, the book about Captain Ahab and his quest to catch a giant white whale was a flop. Its author, Herman Melville was born in New York City in 1819. … Melville’s sixth book, Moby-Dick, was first published in October 1851 in London, in three volumes titled The Whale, and then in the U.S. a month later [on Nov. 14, 1851]. Melville had promised his publisher an adventure story similar to his popular earlier works, but instead, Moby-Dick was a tragic epic, influenced in part by Melville’s friend and Pittsfield, Massachusetts, neighbor, Nathaniel Hawthorne, whose novels include The Scarlet Letter. … Melville died in 1891, largely forgotten by the literary world. By the 1920s, scholars had rediscovered his work, particularly Moby-Dick, which would eventually become a staple of high school reading lists across the United States.”

FIRST DAY OF HEARINGS PUTS PRESSURE ON MODERATE DEMS

Fox News: “All eyes were on moderate House Democrats in swing districts Wednesday night, after the first day of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry against President Trump wrapped up with no major revelations -- but also highlighted weaknesses in Democrats' key witnesses, who relied primarily on second-hand information and never once interacted with the president. At one point in Wednesday's hearing, Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., even appeared to embrace hearsay testimony, claiming that ‘hearsay can be much better evidence than direct’ … It was unclear which of those limited exceptions would apply to Wednesday's testimony -- and whether Quigley's argument would persuade critical swing-vote Democrats. … Freshman Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich. -- who flipped a GOP district in 2018 that Trump won by 7 points in 2016 -- told Fox News that she was tentatively weighing all the evidence. ‘My constituents expect me to make an objective decision,’ Slotkin said as the hearings concluded…”



Pelosi says Trump committed bribery - Politico: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that President Donald Trump committed ‘bribery,’ an impeachable offense, by trying to force Ukraine into tarnishing a political rival to help him in the 2020 election. The speaker’s remark is one of her strongest statements yet on the scandal engulfing Trump that is threatening his presidency. Bribery is one of the specific crimes spelled out in the Constitution as an impeachable offense. ‘I am saying what the president has admitted to and said it’s perfect — it’s perfectly wrong. It’s bribery,’ Pelosi told reporters during her weekly press conference Thursday. … Still, Pelosi cautioned, she isn’t yet ready to say whether the House will vote to impeach Trump, an outcome many lawmakers think is all but certain to happen by the end of this year.”



Report: Republicans discuss prolonging Senate impeachment trial - WaPo: “Some Republican senators and their advisers are privately discussing whether to pressure GOP leaders to stage a lengthy impeachment trial beginning in January to scramble the Democratic presidential race — potentially keeping six contenders in Washington until the eve of the Iowa caucuses or longer. Those conversations about the timing and framework for a trial remain fluid and closely held, according to more than a dozen participants in the discussions. But the deliberations come as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) faces pressure from conservative activists to swat back at Democrats as public impeachment hearings began this week in the House. The discussions raise a potential hazard for the six Democratic senators running for president, who had previously planned on a final sprint out of Washington before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses and the Feb. 11 New Hampshire primary.”



Did anything new come from the hearings? - Fox News: “[Wednesday] offered one previously undisclosed allegation. Career diplomat William Taylor, the charge d’affaires in Kiev, offered testimony, for the first time that the president was overheard by a member of his staff on July 26 asking EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland about ‘the investigations,’ to which Sondland supposedly responded that ‘the Ukrainians were ready to move forward.’ Taylor said that following Sondland’s call with Trump, the member of his staff asked what Trump thought about Ukraine. ‘Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for,’ Taylor said, revealing new information from his prior testimony last month. ‘At the time I gave my deposition on October 22, I was not aware of this information. I am including it for completeness.’”



What’s next - AP: “Several more witnesses scheduled to testify in the House impeachment hearings over the next week are expected to say they too worried about President Donald Trump’s push for Ukraine to investigate Democrats as the U.S. withheld military aid from the country. … On Friday, lawmakers will hear from former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was ousted in May at Trump’s direction. … Eight more witnesses will testify next week, some in back-to-back hearings on the same day. Among them will be Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council … Gordon Sondland, Trump’s European Union ambassador … and Fiona Hill, a former Russia adviser to the White House who told lawmakers about national security adviser John Bolton’s concerns about Ukraine. … The public hearings are expected to last at least another week.”



White House brings in backup to unify strategy - WashEx: “Newly appointed White House aide Tony Sayegh will try to bring cohesion to a disorderly White House impeachment response… The Washington Examiner has learned that Sayegh, a former Treasury official, will work with the White House communications team, White House counsel Pat Cipollone and his staff, and other administration offices to develop and streamline a strategy to dispute allegations and make sure Republicans are on the same page. … Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi was brought in to partner with Sayegh and will be the media face of the anti-impeachment campaign, with plans to leverage her legal background to discredit allegations by House Democrats that the president abused his power in his dealings with Ukraine.”



The Judge’s Ruling: Impeachment and the Constitution - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano discusses the facts surrounding the impeachment hearings: “The House is operating under rules adopted in 2015, when Republicans ran the House. Schiff is no more secretive about or partisan against the president than my old boss, then-Judiciary chair Rep. Peter Rodino, was toward Nixon or then-Judiciary chair Rep. Henry Hyde was toward Clinton. Both acquired evidence from secret proceedings, and both decided to impeach before any public hearings were held. Impeachment is political, not juridical. Former President Gerald R. Ford was essentially right when he argued that under the Constitution impeachable offenses are whatever a majority of the House says they are -- for Nixon, covering up a break-in; for Clinton, lying about consensual sex; for Trump, solicitation, bribery and obstruction. Whose behavior was arguably the gravest?” More here.



JON HUNTSMAN ANNOUNCES THIRD RUN FOR UTAH GOVERNOR

The Salt Lake Tribune: “Former U.S. ambassador Jon Huntsman says he’s grown weary of the national political scene, with its ‘theatrics,’ time-wasting and dearth of meaningful action. Now, he’s asking Utah’s voters to return him to what he calls ‘the best job in the world’ — working as governor. ‘For a very long time, we’ve served our country in the top two diplomatic posts in the world. Now we feel it is time to give back to our home state again,’ Huntsman said on a campaign video posted Thursday morning. He’s vying for a third term as governor in the 2020 election, a little more than 10 years since he last held the post. He previously served as governor from 2005 to 2009. … News leaked Wednesday night that Huntsman would be kicking off his campaign Thursday, and he did with an early call-in to KSL radio and by launching his website and campaign materials.”



RNC jumps in to help Louisiana governor’s race - Politico: “The Republican National Committee is pouring another $1 million into the Louisiana governor’s race ahead of Saturday’s runoff — a move that comes amid mounting GOP concerns about losing a second major election in a conservative state in as many weeks. The last-minute spending doubles the committee’s investment in the race, where Republican Eddie Rispone is trying to unseat Democratic incumbent John Bel Edwards. President Donald Trump is set to headline a rally for Rispone in Louisiana on Thursday evening, barreling ahead despite worries within the GOP that Edwards is a slight favorite to win. Trump had bet that a GOP sweep in three gubernatorial races this fall would project political strength in the face of impeachment. But after Republican Gov. Matt Bevin’s apparent defeat in Kentucky last week, and with Rispone locked in a neck-and-neck race, the president is facing the possibility of losing two out of three.”

GOOD PIGGIES

NY Post: “These pigs have a nose for nose candy. Italy’s Il Tirreno reported that authorities believe wild boars in Tuscany have sniffed out some 20,000 euros (about $22,000) worth of cocaine buried in the woods near Montepulciano. Local police learned of the incident after tapping the phone lines of a suspected drug-trafficking group, who revealed the incident during one of their calls. The powder had been stored in jars and tucked into waterproof packages. Allegedly, a boar had stomped the earth where the jars had been buried, which caused the containers to burst, scattering the illicit stimulant across the forest floor. Local officials claim this particular gang is responsible for slinging some two kilograms of blow per month to club-goers around the cities of Arezzo and Siena between September 2018 and March 2019… The drug dealers — one Italian and three Albanians — have been arrested and face charges for drug trafficking.”

Castro and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas are two candidates who debated last month who will not appear on the debate stage for the next round next week. Castro failed to meet the threshold requirements set forth by Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, while O’Rourke dropped out of the race last month.

Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney and author Marianne Williamson also failed to qualify.

This month, candidates were required to have reached 3 percent support in at least four qualifying national polls since Sept. 13 or 5 percent in two early-nominating state polls since that date, while collecting contributions from at least 165,000 unique donors -- with at least 600 each in a minimum of 20 states.

CASTRO LAYS OFF STAFF IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SOUTH CAROLINA

Some candidates have criticized Perez for what they've viewed as overly stringent requirements. Some argue that the donor emphasis has forced them to spend disproportionately for online fundraising efforts that drain resources they could be using to reach voters in other ways.

Perez says hopefuls have had ample time to demonstrate their supporter, both in polls and through small-dollar contributors, and that any Democrat falling short this far into the campaign almost certainly isn’t positioned to win the nomination or defeat President Trump in November 2020.

Perez has announced even stiffer requirements for a Dec. 19 debate. The polling marks:4 percent in four national polls or 6 percent in two early state polls taken after Oct. 16. The donor threshold: 200,000 unique donors, with at least 800 from each of 20 states.

The top-tier candidates – former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg -- are not threatened by those goals. Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have met them as well.

But the higher targets put pressure on several other candidates to broaden their support or risk falling out of any reasonable contention with less than three months to go before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses.

Two new candidates also could be vying for December spots.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick launched his campaign Thursday and filed to appear on New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary ballot. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is considering a bid as well, already having filed paperwork for some Super Tuesday primaries.

Next Wednesday's debate in Atlanta will be broadcast on MSNBC, 9-11 p.m. EST.

TRUMP CASTS LOUISIANA VOTE AS IMPEACHMENT REFERENDUM

USA Today: “President Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail Thursday to stump in Louisiana for the second time in as many weeks, using a raucous rally to mock two U.S. diplomats who raised questions about his dealings with Ukraine at the center of an impeachment inquiry. … ‘The people of this country aren't buying it – you see it because we're going up and they're going down,’ Trump said. ‘Let's keep it going for a while.’ … Stung by Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin's loss last week to Democrat Andy Beshear, Trump is putting considerable emphasis on Louisiana. Republican businessman Eddie Rispone is challenging Democratic incumbent Gov. John Bel Edwards in a Nov. 16 runoff election. … ‘You gotta give me a big win please,’ Trump told the crowd. ‘Please.’”



Will black voters rally for Edwards? - FiveThirtyEight: “While election forecasters like Sabato’s Crystal Ball estimate that Edwards needs about 30 percent or so of the white vote to win reelection, that’s not the only thing that matters for Edwards’ candidacy. He also needs black voters to turn out. … And so far, black voter turnout is slightly down for Edwards. In the initial vote, 27.6 percent of all voters were black, according to data from the Louisiana secretary of state, compared to 28.1 percent in the first round of the 2015 gubernatorial election. [When] you consider that Democrats win more than 90 percent of African American voters in the state, slightly lower black turnout matters a lot in a race this close.”



Bevin cries uncle - Louisville [Ky.] Courier Journal: “An upbeat Andy Beshear claimed victory — again — in the Kentucky governor's race Thursday, shortly after incumbent Republican Gov. Matt Bevin said he would not contest the results of the close election. ‘The race is now officially over,’ Beshear, a Democrat and Kentucky's attorney general, said at a news conference where he appeared with Lt. Gov.-Elect Jacqueline Coleman, an educator. Beshear spoke at the Kentucky Education Association in Frankfort, apparently to underscore his support by teachers angry with Bevin over his public criticisms of them during a dispute over pension changes. Beshear has designated Kentucky teachers as grand marshals of his inaugural parade down Capitol Avenue. But Beshear stressed Thursday that the tone will change in his administration following his Dec. 10 inauguration.”



New map could cost Republicans two House seats in North Carolina - The [Raleigh] News & Observer: “Republicans in the North Carolina General Assembly are advancing a new map for the 2020 U.S. House races that could cost their party seats in Congress. The map passed the N.C. House Thursday afternoon and was sent to the Senate, which could pass the map into law or come up with a new proposal. ‘I do believe this is a fair and honest attempt to address the issues that have been brought up,’ said Republican Rep. David Lewis, one of the legislature’s top redistricting leaders. He was referring to a lawsuit that challenged the constitutionality of the current maps. As it stands now, the state has a 10-3 Republican advantage in the U.S. House of Representatives, even though Democratic and Republican candidates typically get around the same number of votes statewide.”



TRUMP OPERATIVE STONE CONVICTED OF LYING, OBSTRUCTION

Fox News: “Roger Stone was found guilty on all counts of obstruction, witness tampering and making false statements to Congress by a jury in Washington, D.C. federal court, after deliberations had been going on since Thursday morning. The former Trump associate and longtime political operative faced charges that stemmed from Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. Sentencing has been set for Thursday Feb. 6. Stone was accused of providing false statements to the House Intelligence Committee about communications having to do with WikiLeaks, obstructing a congressional investigation of Russian election interference by falsely denying that he had evidence to turn over, and witness tampering. The prosecution argued that Stone intentionally lied about his use of intermediaries to get information about WikiLeaks’ possession and release of hacked Democratic emails. They said he hid the truth to protect Trump’s campaign.”



Tensions boil over at impeachment hearing - Fox News: “Tensions between lawmakers boiled over Friday on the second day of the public impeachment hearings, when House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., repeatedly shut down GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., citing House procedure -- as an astonished Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., accused him of ‘gagging’ the lawmaker. … The explosive moment came during the questioning of Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine… Yovanovitch pointed her finger at Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani while detailing her sudden removal from her diplomatic post, as the president fired back in real-time and said every place she worked ‘turned bad.’ Trump’s comments ignited an outcry from Democrats: Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff read Trump's anti-Yovanovitch tweet during the hearing, and called it ‘witness intimidation.’ Yovanovitch told lawmakers, regarding the tweet: ‘It's very intimidating.’”



Legal woes mount for Giuliani - Bloomberg: “Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, is being investigated by federal prosecutors for possible campaign finance violations and a failure to register as a foreign agent as part of an active investigation into his financial dealings, according to three U.S. officials. The probe of Giuliani, which one official said could also include possible charges on violating laws against bribing foreign officials or conspiracy, presents a serious threat to Trump’s presidency from a man that former national security adviser John Bolton has called a ‘hand grenade.’ A second official said Giuliani’s activities raise counterintelligence concerns as well, although there probably wouldn’t be a criminal charge related to that. The officials, who asked for anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, provided the first indication of the potential charges under investigation.”



Career White House budget official to testify - WaPo: “A longtime career employee at the White House Office of Management and Budget is expected to break ranks and testify Saturday in the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, potentially filling in important details on the holdup of military aid to Ukraine. Mark Sandy would be the first OMB employee to testify in the inquiry, after OMB acting director Russell T. Vought and two other political appointees at the agency defied congressional subpoenas to appear. The White House has called the impeachment inquiry unconstitutional and ordered administration officials not to participate. Unlike these other OMB officials, Sandy is a career employee, not one appointed by the president. He has worked at the agency off and on for over a decade, under presidents of both parties, climbing the ranks to his current role as deputy associate director for national security programs.”

TIME OUT: AND NOW YOU KNOW THE REST OF THE STORY

Smithsonian: “Founded in 1912 in Cincinnati, [Kutol’s] primary product—a soft, pliable compound used for wiping soot from wallpaper—was no longer in demand and the firm’s future looked bleak. Fortunately, the sister-in-law of one of its principals had an idea: let kids play with it. Kutol Products had become the largest wallpaper cleaner manufacturer in the world in the early 20th century. Fortunes began to change in the 1950s, though. With the transition from heating with dirtier coal to cleaner oil, gas and electricity, sooty buildup on wallpaper was no longer an issue in many households. Joseph McVicker was trying to turn around the struggling company when his sister-in-law read an article about how wallpaper cleaner could be used for modeling projects. Sister-in-law Kay Zufall, a nursery school teacher, tested the nontoxic material with children, who loved molding it into all kinds of shapes. She told McVicker of her discovery and even suggested a new name: Play-Doh.”

BIDEN BREACHES WARREN’S NEVADA FIREBREAK

Fox News: “Democrats’ strong desire for a candidate who can defeat President Trump gives Joe Biden the edge in the nomination race, while Hispanic voters help both Biden and Bernie Sanders top Trump in hypothetical 2020 matchups. That’s according to a Fox News Poll of Nevada voters. In the nomination contest, Biden receives the backing of 24 percent of Democratic caucusgoers, followed by Sanders and Elizabeth Warren each at 18 percent. Next is Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent, Tom Steyer at 5 percent, Kamala Harris at 4 percent, Andrew Yang 3 percent, and Tulsi Gabbard and Amy Klobuchar at 2 percent apiece. Cory Booker and Julian Castro each get 1 percent. Biden (23 percent) and Warren (21 percent) receive nearly equal backing among white caucusgoers, followed by Sanders (13 percent) and Buttigieg (12 percent).”



Poll shows tight race in North Carolina for Trump - Fox News: “North Carolina voters give President Trump mixed reviews on his job performance and about half oppose his impeachment. That leads to tight races in 2020 ballot tests, according to a Fox News Poll of North Carolina voters. In hypothetical matchups, Joe Biden edges Trump by two points and Bernie Sanders is up by one. The president tops Elizabeth Warren by one point and Pete Buttigieg by four. Each race is within the poll’s margin of error. There is added uncertainty considering no candidate hits 50 percent and 11-18 percent are undecided. Trump topped Hillary Clinton by nearly 4 points in the Tar Heel State. Ninety-four percent of Republicans voted for him in 2016. Today, 91 percent of Republicans approve of the job he’s doing and 89 percent back him in the matchup against Biden.”



North Korean news agency calls Biden a ‘rabid dog’ - ABC News: “After a campaign ad for Former Vice President Joe Biden implied Kim Jong Un was a ‘tyrant,’ North Korean state media responded on Thursday by blasting the 2020 Democratic candidate. The commentary called Biden a ‘rabid dog’ and advocated that rabid dogs ‘can hurt lots of people’ and ‘must be beaten to death with a stick.’ … The ad for Biden said, in part: ‘We live in the most dangerous moment in a generation. Our world, set on edge by an erratic, unstable president. Dictators and tyrants are praised -- our allies, pushed aside.’ Kim's photo appears at the mention of the word ‘tyrants.’ The Biden campaign hit back, calling Kim a ‘repugnant dictator,’ arguing that sharp words from North Korea highlight the strength of their candidate.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Mr. Stirewalt: Why doesn't the President simply claim whistleblower status for himself? U.S. law prohibits adverse actions against anyone reporting suspicion of wrongdoing. I looked -- it doesn't say the report must be made to a US authority. … Clearly, the President disclosed information that he believed evidenced violation of ANY law (including the law of Ukraine), a gross waste of funds, and an abuse of authority. He should therefore be protected against any adverse action as a result. (I'm not a lawyer, but it seems like a gift-wrapped solution . . . am I missing something?)” – Michael Whalen, Weirton, W. Va.



[Ed. note: I’m not sure how facetious you’re being, Mr. Whalen, but this note will always make allowances for readers from West Virginia’s Northern Panhandle! I guess I’d have to ask in reply: Protection from what? If it’s protection from Congress that you seek, I’m afraid not. Congress’ power to impeach is absolute. The president does have many protections in dealing with Congress – shielding intimate advisers from testifying about private conversations, etc. – but when it comes to impeachment, Congress is at the apex of its powers. Go Red Riders!]

Three months had gone by since the animals, belonging to a free-range herd living on private land on Cedar Island, went missing during the storm. Category One Hurricane Dorian created a ‘mini-tsunami’ that swept cattle and some 30 wild horses from Cedar Island into the ocean when it struck on September 6.

""A lot of folks ... feel very good about what Trump has accomplished. The No. 1 thing that I've heard though, was, 'I wish he would just stop doing that thing on Twitter,""' Caldwell said on Fox Nation.

""Even conservatives,"" he continued, ""even though he has a 95 percent approval rating within the conservative party, conservatives are having issues with his tweets because they're distracting.""

Trump adopted the platform as a means of directly communicating with the American people. Not known to hold back, his Twitter account -- which currently holds 66.8 M followers -- has attracted worldwide attention since the 2016 campaign.

Now considered official presidential statements, Trump uses the platform to circumvent the mainstream media, connecting directly with citizens and leaders across the country.

While many are opposed to the president's use of Twitter, which often features name-calling and inflammatory statements, he remains among the platform's most popular users.

Last month, Democratic hopeful Kamala Harris put pressure on Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey to ""do something"" about Trump's account.

""Hey, @jack, Time to do something about this,"" Harris wrote.

She also urged Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to join her in demanding that Twitter suspend Trump’s account as ”a matter of safety and corporate accountability.""

“I would urge you to join me because here we have Donald Trump, who has 65 million Twitter followers and is using that platform as the president of the United States to openly intimidate witnesses, to threaten witnesses, to obstruct justice,” Harris said during a primary presidential debate.

TRUMP IN TWITTER BATTLE WITH SCARAMUCCI, SAYING HE'D DO ANYTHING TO STAY IN SPOTLIGHT

Founder of the FiveThirtyEight website, Nate Silver, fired back on Twitter, defending the president's use of the platform.

""Hey, @jack. As a journalist I think Trump's tweets are extremely newsworthy and I'm happy that you've given the President of the United States a platform to communicate in a direct and unfiltered way with the public,"" he tweeted.

Silver's response drew criticism from many, including other reporters who seemed to side with Harris on the issue, before Twitter eventually put the matter to rest.

“We focus on the language of reported Tweets and do not attempt to determine all potential interpretations of the content or its intent,” Twitter said, calling the actions of world leaders on Twitter “largely new ground and unprecedented.”

In January 2018, the company responded to calls to shut down Trump's account saying, “blocking a world leader from Twitter or removing their controversial Tweets, would hide important information people should be able to see and debate,” Twitter said.

“It would also not silence that leader, but it would certainly hamper necessary discussion around their words and actions.”

NATE SILVER DEFENDS TRUMP'S TWITTER ACCOUNT

Co-host of the Fox Nation show Tom Shillue disagreed with Caldwell's statement that conservatives largely oppose the president's Twitter usage, and even encouraged Trump to ""tone it up.""

""I disagree with that...I could have him tone it up a little bit because ... I've been hearing this since he started ... 'Oh, I like the president, he's got to calm down with the tweets ... He's not gonna,"" Shillue said. ""So I say, stop saying it, and ... embrace it.""

""It's hilarious,"" he continued. ""I think we have gotten used to it. The only people who haven't gotten used to it...aside from the Trump haters, it's these kinds of...old line conservatives who think there's a way to sell conservatism...that way stinks,"" Shillue said.

While Caldwell acknowledged a double standard from Democrats who use similar rhetoric without backlash, he did call for the president to tone it down.

""We are leaders in this movement,"" he said, ""and I think it's important to calm it down a little bit.""

""The rules of impeachment are very clear. We’ll have to have a trial,"" announced Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday, conceding that the Senate must hold a trial to determine whether or not to convict the president and remove him from office if the Democrat-led House votes to impeach.

What that means for Democratic senators who are also running for president is that they may be forced off the campaign trail to return to Washington D.C. in the critical runup to the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primaries in February 2020.

""That raises a question - who is a trial going to benefit?"" asked Wall Street Journal columnist Daniel Henninger on Fox Nation's ""Deep Dive"" on Thursday. ""Undoubtedly [Senate] Republicans are not going to convict the president and yet you're going to have at least six Senate Democratic senators who are running for their nomination, sitting in Washington all through January, enduring this trial.""

""In effect, this process of impeachment is suppressing the Democratic message, other than the fact that the message for three years is that they have been chasing the president of the United States.""

In fact, the conundrum for some Democrats is reportedly not lost on the candidates themselves.

The Washington Post reported that ""advisers to multiple candidates have been inquiring about the potential timing behind the scenes."" In addition, Sen. Bernie Sanders I-Vt., told the Post that a Senate trial would present a serious challenge. “We will do our best to get back to Iowa, to get to New Hampshire, to get to all the states that we have to. But there’s no question it will make our life a little bit more difficult,” he said.

""So who does [a Senate trial] benefit? Short answer, Pete Buttigieg,"" said Wall Street Journal editorial board member Kyle Peterson. ""He's going to be the only guy in Des Moines. He's going to be walking around, shaking hands, kissing babies and the other Democrats... they're gonna be stuck in Washington, not saying much.""

2020 Democratic national frontrunner Joe Biden will also be free to remain on the campaign trail if the Senate holds a trial. However, recent polling has shown him falling behind his competitors in the early Democratic primary states.

IS IT TOO LATE FOR MORE DEMOCRATS TO JUMP INTO THE 2020 RACE?

""I totally agree,"" said Judith Miller, Fox News contributor and Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter. ""It also benefits Mike Bloomberg and the governor of Massachusetts [Deval Patrick], who's now throwing his hat into the ring, maybe.""

Miller concluded by saying that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif., must have foreseen these circumstances.

""I think that was another reason that so troubled Pelosi [by the prospect of impeachment]. She understands the calendar better than anybody - along with votes. And she knew that this was exactly the prospect,"" Miller said. ""If I were Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders or any of the other Democratic senators who are going to be confined to Washington in this trial, I would be very worried indeed.""

“The average American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it. And I think it's important for us not to lose sight of that,” Obama said.

OBAMA SOUNDS OFF ON CANCEL CULTURE, 'WOKE' PURITY: 'THAT'S NOT ACTIVISM'

“There are a lot of persuadable voters and there are a lot of Democrats out there who just want to see things make sense. They just don't want to see crazy stuff,"" he said. ""They want to see things a little more fair, they want to see things a little more just. And how we approach that I think will be important.”

The two-term Democratic president made the remarks at a gathering of the Democracy Alliance, a group of wealthy Democratic donors. He was interviewed by Stacey Abrams, who lost Georgia’s gubernatorial race last year.

Obama has largely stayed on the sidelines on the 2020 Democratic primary, and has not yet backed a candidate -- even as former Vice President Joe Biden has invoked his name on numerous occasions. But Obama has made remarks indicating he is nervous about the drift to the extreme left on a number of issues by parts of the Democratic Party.

On Friday, he did not mention any candidates by name, but did cite immigration and health care reform as examples of where Democrats may be out of sync with the broader electorate.

Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who have both released plans on immigration and “Medicare-for-all” respectively in recent weeks. Warren’s government-led overhaul of the health care system would eventually abolish private insurance and cost $52 trillion, while Sanders’ immigration plan includes radical policies including welfare for illegal immigrants and a moratorium on all deportations.

SANDERS' IMMIGRATION PLAN: HALT DEPORTATIONS, ABOLISH ICE, WELCOME 50K 'CLIMATE MIGRANTS,' GIVE WELFARE TO ALL

“Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality and the fact that voters, including the Democratic voters and certainly persuadable independents or even moderate Republicans, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds,” Obama said.

The comment about Twitter feeds echoes remarks he made last month, when the former president took a swipe at “woke” virtue signalling and cancel culture, telling a Chicago audience to “get over” their obsessions with ideological purity tests.

“This idea of purity and you're never compromised and you're always politically woke, and all that stuff, you should get over that quickly,"" Obama said. “The world is messy. There are ambiguities. People who do really good stuff have flaws. People who you are fighting may love their kids, and share certain things with you.”

Deval Patrick into the race, further dividing Democrats in their battle to pick a nominee to challenge President Trump in 2020.

This is good news for Trump, especially if it causes the crowded field to devolve into a bitter negative campaign. The more time Democrats spend attacking each other, the less time they have to attack the president.

In addition, Trump would be able to use the attacks by Democrats on their eventual nominee in ads when he runs against that person next year.

DEVAL PATRICK JUMPS INTO DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

Patrick is a former assistant U.S. attorney general and was governor of Massachusetts from 2007 to 2015, becoming the first African-American to hold that position.

Former New York City Mayor and multibillionaire Michael Bloomberg hasn’t made an official declaration of his candidacy yet, but seems certain to do so in the near future. He’s already filed to run in at least two states and is reportedly hiring staff across the country.

And 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told the BBC that she’s “under enormous pressure” to run again in 2020, and has refused to rule it out. But it seems unlikely that the former first lady, senator and secretary state will make a third presidential run at this late date, although it’s understandable why she could find it tempting.

Not counting Bloomberg and Clinton, 17 Democrats remain in the race for their party’s presidential nomination, though most have virtually no chance of winning the contest. Eight other Democrats have dropped out of the nomination race even before the first votes are cast.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., are atop the polls in the presidential contest. Right now it looks like only a handful of other candidates have even a longshot chance of capturing the nomination.

Patrick joins the Democratic race with the rumored tacit blessing of former President Barack Obama, who may be frustrated by the failure of any other candidate – particularly Biden, his vice president – to both consolidate the field and demonstrate a clear ability to defeat President Trump.

But there is evidence that Democratic primary voters are actually happy with the current crop of candidates.

The most recent Fox News Poll showed 69 percent of Democrats are satisfied with the field as it now stands. That’s particularly true among the more liberal wing of the party – which is split between supporters of self-described democratic socialist Sanders and Warren. Among the liberals, 71 percent are satisfied with the field.

More moderate Democrats appear slightly less satisfied than liberals. The polls suggest they’d be fine with Biden, particularly given his apparent strength against Trump in the general election.

While it’s unlikely that either Patrick or Bloomberg will be the Democratic nominee facing Trump in November 2020, neither candidate can be written off.

However, there’s a nagging feeling about Biden. Yes, he was exceedingly effective in both the 2008 and 2012 vice presidential candidate debates. But that was a long time ago. He will turn 77 on Wednesday and is showing his age, stumbling a few times in past debates and appearances and sometimes looking like he is past his prime.

The age issue has also been raised with Sanders, who is 78 and is back on the campaign trail after recently suffering a heart attack. It would certainly be raised with Bloomberg, who is 77, and could be raised with Warren, who is 70. However, the 73-year-old Trump would have a hard time attacking any of these candidates as being too old to be president.

Despite Biden’s imperfect performance to date, none of the other center-left candidates – I call them the “junior Bidens” – has managed to achieve real prominence.

Buttigieg has done extremely well in appearances and seems to have a very effective organization in Iowa. But only 30 percent of likely Democratic primary voters say he can beat Trump – compared to 68 percent who say that about Biden, and almost 60 percent who say that about Sanders and Warren.

That leaves running room – or at least dreaming room – for Patrick and Bloomberg. Can you blame either one for looking in the mirror each morning and thinking he can beat Biden?

Patrick had a strong and moderate, record as governor of Massachusetts. Though he starts with no organization and little money, he is hoping for a solid showing in Iowa and to then eclipse Biden in New Hampshire, which borders Massachusetts.

If Patrick makes a credible showing in Iowa and New Hampshire, he’d be in a position to win the South Carolina primary, where about 60 percent of the Democratic electorate is black. However, right now Biden enjoys very strong support among black voters – outpacing African-American candidates who joined the race months ago – so it would be premature to assume Patrick would come out on top in South Carolina.

One potential weakness for Patrick is that he just left a partnership at Bain Capital, the private equity firm founded by Mitt Romney. Yes, Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, former GOP presidential nominee, and current senator from Utah.

Patrick will certainly get attacked for his work at Bain by Sanders and Warren, who have proposed a slew of new taxes on wealthy individuals and on businesses, along with new regulations on the private sector.

However, I have trouble seeing how a caricature of a “rich fat cat” will stick to Patrick, who is the son of a single mother living in the Chicago projects, and who won scholarships to a fancy prep school and Harvard.

Still, the polls in New Hampshire suggest Patrick is not well-known there, despite an eight-year track record as governor next door.

And unlike Bloomberg, Patrick will need to expend significant time and effort raising money.

The smart money says it’s too late for Patrick to become the Democratic presidential nominee.

My own sense is that if Patrick can raise the contributions and hit the poll numbers needed to get into one of the upcoming Democratic presidential candidate debates, his optimistic message might enable him to beat the odds. Primary politics is a strange beast – and, yes, lightning does sometimes strike.

Remember that when then-Sen. Barack Obama first announced his presidential candidacy, many “experts” said America was not ready to elect a black president. And when Trump first announced he was running for president many pundits wrote him off as a publicity-seeking reality-TV star with no chance of getting the Republican nomination.

Bloomberg, whose net worth is said to be north of $50 billion, has the advantage of being able to write a check to amply fund his campaign and mount a multistate effort. However, his intention to self-fund will keep him out of Democratic presidential debates unless the rules to qualify are changed. That would present him with a big disadvantage.

At the same time, Bloomberg’s opposition to many of the far-left proposals of Sanders and Warren may wind up helping those two candidates more than hurting them with the liberal Democratic electorate.

“With enemies like Mike, he’ll wind up deepening their support,” one wag joked, about Sanders and Warren, “and here we thought they’ve renounced super PACs.”

The recent Fox News poll suggested that only 6 percent of Democratic primary voters would definitely support Bloomberg, while 32 would “never vote for him.” That’s a big disadvantage to overcome.

Bloomberg’s strategy is based on not entering any contests until the Super Tuesday primaries March 3 – after Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina vote.

Sixteen states – including the two most populous, California and Texas – hold primaries on Super Tuesday. They will divide up roughly 36 percent of delegates to the Democratic National Convention. The four early states will have only about 4 percent of convention delegates.

Bloomberg’s hope is that no two candidates will emerge as strong contenders after the first four nominating contests. Given how quickly previous nomination contests have been defined by the initial results, I wouldn’t put too much stock in that hope. Few things are certain in politics, but Iowa will winnow the field, and New Hampshire will likely define it.

Of course, politics remains unpredictable, with new developments able to shake up races significantly.

While it’s unlikely that either Patrick or Bloomberg will be the Democratic nominee facing Trump in November 2020, neither candidate can be written off. This unpredictability is one of the things that makes politics so interesting.

Kamala Harris, whose campaign cut staff in a dramatic restructuring last month, is now polling at just 3 percent, tying her with Michael Bloomberg for fifth place among the Democratic Party’s presidential nominees -- according to a poll released Friday -- even though Bloomberg hasn't even formally announced his 2020 candidacy.

And now Harris may be facing another problem: A second report Friday described internal strife at Harris’ Baltimore campaign headquarters, with several aides calling for campaign manager Juan Rodriguez’s resignation following his late October decision to lay off field staffers in several states and dedicate Harris' already dwindling campaign war chest to a seven-figure TV ad campaign before the February Iowa caucus.

KAMALA HARRIS SAYS SHE'S 'ALL IN' ON IOWA -- DESPITE CAMPAIGN RESTRUCTURING, LAYOFFS

Harris and Bloomberg were deadlocked in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Nov. 12-14. Though not yet a declared candidate, Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and billionaire business and media mogul, launched a massive $100 million digital ad campaign Friday targeting President Trump.

In the poll, both Harris and Bloomberg fell behind Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who polled at 6 percent, and Sen Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who polled at 13 percent. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders led the Demicratic field tied at 19 percent support.

Rodriguez said in an Oct. 30 campaign memo obtained by Fox News that several dozen people would be laid off at the campaign's Baltimore headquarters -- as would volunteers in New Hampshire, Nevada, and California -- in an effort to go ""all-in"" in Iowa. He also said the campaign aimed to dedicate $1 million to a media campaign in the weeks before the Feb. 3 caucus, a figure now considered unlikely given Harris’ lackluster funding.

Three additional staff members were laid off and another quit in recent days at Harris’ campaign headquarters in Baltimore, unnamed aides told Politico on Friday. They said several aides have approached campaign chair Maya Harris, the candidate’s sister, to force Rodriguez to step down, claiming his failed leadership is responsible for the campaign’s recent troubles.

One official said Harris’ current campaign structure has “No discipline. No plan. No strategy.”

“It’s a campaign of id,” the official continued. “What feels right, what impulse you have right now, what emotion, what frustration.”

But others defended Rodriguez, saying he’s been loyal to Harris even before she first announced her candidacy in January. They pointed fingers at Maya Harris, who shared leadership responsibility with Rodriguez.

“From the outset of this race, he has had all the responsibility with none of the authority. He’s been managing this race with at least one, if not two, hands tied behind his back,” a senior campaign official told Politico of Rodriguez. “He would never undermine her. He’s just not that guy.”

The Politico report cited 12 individuals – who were either current or former campaign staffers or donors – who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Meanwhile, Harris has been crisscrossing the country to try to salvage support. Her campaign has struggled to regain traction after an initial stand-out moment in the race during the first Democratic debate in June when she challenged Biden, a frontrunner, over comments he made about segregationist U.S. senators and school busing. Harris struggled in the second debate after Biden and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, challenged her record as California's attorney general. She struggled to shine in subsequent debates.

TRUMP CASTS LOUISIANA VOTE AS IMPEACHMENT REFERENDUM

USA Today: “President Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail Thursday to stump in Louisiana for the second time in as many weeks, using a raucous rally to mock two U.S. diplomats who raised questions about his dealings with Ukraine at the center of an impeachment inquiry. … ‘The people of this country aren't buying it – you see it because we're going up and they're going down,’ Trump said. ‘Let's keep it going for a while.’ … Stung by Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin's loss last week to Democrat Andy Beshear, Trump is putting considerable emphasis on Louisiana. Republican businessman Eddie Rispone is challenging Democratic incumbent Gov. John Bel Edwards in a Nov. 16 runoff election. … ‘You gotta give me a big win please,’ Trump told the crowd. ‘Please.’”



Will black voters rally for Edwards? - FiveThirtyEight: “While election forecasters like Sabato’s Crystal Ball estimate that Edwards needs about 30 percent or so of the white vote to win reelection, that’s not the only thing that matters for Edwards’ candidacy. He also needs black voters to turn out. … And so far, black voter turnout is slightly down for Edwards. In the initial vote, 27.6 percent of all voters were black, according to data from the Louisiana secretary of state, compared to 28.1 percent in the first round of the 2015 gubernatorial election. [When] you consider that Democrats win more than 90 percent of African American voters in the state, slightly lower black turnout matters a lot in a race this close.”



Bevin cries uncle - Louisville [Ky.] Courier Journal: “An upbeat Andy Beshear claimed victory — again — in the Kentucky governor's race Thursday, shortly after incumbent Republican Gov. Matt Bevin said he would not contest the results of the close election. ‘The race is now officially over,’ Beshear, a Democrat and Kentucky's attorney general, said at a news conference where he appeared with Lt. Gov.-Elect Jacqueline Coleman, an educator. Beshear spoke at the Kentucky Education Association in Frankfort, apparently to underscore his support by teachers angry with Bevin over his public criticisms of them during a dispute over pension changes. Beshear has designated Kentucky teachers as grand marshals of his inaugural parade down Capitol Avenue. But Beshear stressed Thursday that the tone will change in his administration following his Dec. 10 inauguration.”



New map could cost Republicans two House seats in North Carolina - The [Raleigh] News & Observer: “Republicans in the North Carolina General Assembly are advancing a new map for the 2020 U.S. House races that could cost their party seats in Congress. The map passed the N.C. House Thursday afternoon and was sent to the Senate, which could pass the map into law or come up with a new proposal. ‘I do believe this is a fair and honest attempt to address the issues that have been brought up,’ said Republican Rep. David Lewis, one of the legislature’s top redistricting leaders. He was referring to a lawsuit that challenged the constitutionality of the current maps. As it stands now, the state has a 10-3 Republican advantage in the U.S. House of Representatives, even though Democratic and Republican candidates typically get around the same number of votes statewide.”



TRUMP OPERATIVE STONE CONVICTED OF LYING, OBSTRUCTION

Fox News: “Roger Stone was found guilty on all counts of obstruction, witness tampering and making false statements to Congress by a jury in Washington, D.C. federal court, after deliberations had been going on since Thursday morning. The former Trump associate and longtime political operative faced charges that stemmed from Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. Sentencing has been set for Thursday Feb. 6. Stone was accused of providing false statements to the House Intelligence Committee about communications having to do with WikiLeaks, obstructing a congressional investigation of Russian election interference by falsely denying that he had evidence to turn over, and witness tampering. The prosecution argued that Stone intentionally lied about his use of intermediaries to get information about WikiLeaks’ possession and release of hacked Democratic emails. They said he hid the truth to protect Trump’s campaign.”



Tensions boil over at impeachment hearing - Fox News: “Tensions between lawmakers boiled over Friday on the second day of the public impeachment hearings, when House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., repeatedly shut down GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., citing House procedure -- as an astonished Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., accused him of ‘gagging’ the lawmaker. … The explosive moment came during the questioning of Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine… Yovanovitch pointed her finger at Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani while detailing her sudden removal from her diplomatic post, as the president fired back in real-time and said every place she worked ‘turned bad.’ Trump’s comments ignited an outcry from Democrats: Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff read Trump's anti-Yovanovitch tweet during the hearing, and called it ‘witness intimidation.’ Yovanovitch told lawmakers, regarding the tweet: ‘It's very intimidating.’”



Legal woes mount for Giuliani - Bloomberg: “Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, is being investigated by federal prosecutors for possible campaign finance violations and a failure to register as a foreign agent as part of an active investigation into his financial dealings, according to three U.S. officials. The probe of Giuliani, which one official said could also include possible charges on violating laws against bribing foreign officials or conspiracy, presents a serious threat to Trump’s presidency from a man that former national security adviser John Bolton has called a ‘hand grenade.’ A second official said Giuliani’s activities raise counterintelligence concerns as well, although there probably wouldn’t be a criminal charge related to that. The officials, who asked for anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, provided the first indication of the potential charges under investigation.”



Career White House budget official to testify - WaPo: “A longtime career employee at the White House Office of Management and Budget is expected to break ranks and testify Saturday in the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, potentially filling in important details on the holdup of military aid to Ukraine. Mark Sandy would be the first OMB employee to testify in the inquiry, after OMB acting director Russell T. Vought and two other political appointees at the agency defied congressional subpoenas to appear. The White House has called the impeachment inquiry unconstitutional and ordered administration officials not to participate. Unlike these other OMB officials, Sandy is a career employee, not one appointed by the president. He has worked at the agency off and on for over a decade, under presidents of both parties, climbing the ranks to his current role as deputy associate director for national security programs.”

TIME OUT: AND NOW YOU KNOW THE REST OF THE STORY

Smithsonian: “Founded in 1912 in Cincinnati, [Kutol’s] primary product—a soft, pliable compound used for wiping soot from wallpaper—was no longer in demand and the firm’s future looked bleak. Fortunately, the sister-in-law of one of its principals had an idea: let kids play with it. Kutol Products had become the largest wallpaper cleaner manufacturer in the world in the early 20th century. Fortunes began to change in the 1950s, though. With the transition from heating with dirtier coal to cleaner oil, gas and electricity, sooty buildup on wallpaper was no longer an issue in many households. Joseph McVicker was trying to turn around the struggling company when his sister-in-law read an article about how wallpaper cleaner could be used for modeling projects. Sister-in-law Kay Zufall, a nursery school teacher, tested the nontoxic material with children, who loved molding it into all kinds of shapes. She told McVicker of her discovery and even suggested a new name: Play-Doh.”

BIDEN BREACHES WARREN’S NEVADA FIREBREAK

Fox News: “Democrats’ strong desire for a candidate who can defeat President Trump gives Joe Biden the edge in the nomination race, while Hispanic voters help both Biden and Bernie Sanders top Trump in hypothetical 2020 matchups. That’s according to a Fox News Poll of Nevada voters. In the nomination contest, Biden receives the backing of 24 percent of Democratic caucusgoers, followed by Sanders and Elizabeth Warren each at 18 percent. Next is Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent, Tom Steyer at 5 percent, Kamala Harris at 4 percent, Andrew Yang 3 percent, and Tulsi Gabbard and Amy Klobuchar at 2 percent apiece. Cory Booker and Julian Castro each get 1 percent. Biden (23 percent) and Warren (21 percent) receive nearly equal backing among white caucusgoers, followed by Sanders (13 percent) and Buttigieg (12 percent).”



Poll shows tight race in North Carolina for Trump - Fox News: “North Carolina voters give President Trump mixed reviews on his job performance and about half oppose his impeachment. That leads to tight races in 2020 ballot tests, according to a Fox News Poll of North Carolina voters. In hypothetical matchups, Joe Biden edges Trump by two points and Bernie Sanders is up by one. The president tops Elizabeth Warren by one point and Pete Buttigieg by four. Each race is within the poll’s margin of error. There is added uncertainty considering no candidate hits 50 percent and 11-18 percent are undecided. Trump topped Hillary Clinton by nearly 4 points in the Tar Heel State. Ninety-four percent of Republicans voted for him in 2016. Today, 91 percent of Republicans approve of the job he’s doing and 89 percent back him in the matchup against Biden.”



North Korean news agency calls Biden a ‘rabid dog’ - ABC News: “After a campaign ad for Former Vice President Joe Biden implied Kim Jong Un was a ‘tyrant,’ North Korean state media responded on Thursday by blasting the 2020 Democratic candidate. The commentary called Biden a ‘rabid dog’ and advocated that rabid dogs ‘can hurt lots of people’ and ‘must be beaten to death with a stick.’ … The ad for Biden said, in part: ‘We live in the most dangerous moment in a generation. Our world, set on edge by an erratic, unstable president. Dictators and tyrants are praised -- our allies, pushed aside.’ Kim's photo appears at the mention of the word ‘tyrants.’ The Biden campaign hit back, calling Kim a ‘repugnant dictator,’ arguing that sharp words from North Korea highlight the strength of their candidate.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Mr. Stirewalt: Why doesn't the President simply claim whistleblower status for himself? U.S. law prohibits adverse actions against anyone reporting suspicion of wrongdoing. I looked -- it doesn't say the report must be made to a US authority. … Clearly, the President disclosed information that he believed evidenced violation of ANY law (including the law of Ukraine), a gross waste of funds, and an abuse of authority. He should therefore be protected against any adverse action as a result. (I'm not a lawyer, but it seems like a gift-wrapped solution . . . am I missing something?)” – Michael Whalen, Weirton, W. Va.



[Ed. note: I’m not sure how facetious you’re being, Mr. Whalen, but this note will always make allowances for readers from West Virginia’s Northern Panhandle! I guess I’d have to ask in reply: Protection from what? If it’s protection from Congress that you seek, I’m afraid not. Congress’ power to impeach is absolute. The president does have many protections in dealing with Congress – shielding intimate advisers from testifying about private conversations, etc. – but when it comes to impeachment, Congress is at the apex of its powers. Go Red Riders!]

SEE, COWS

AFP: “Three cows swept into the ocean when Hurricane Dorian struck the US east coast in September were found living on a string of sandy islands miles away from their home… The bovine trio is believed to have swum four to five miles before placing hoof on land – in this case an island of sand dunes and scattered vegetation that is part of North Carolina's Outer Banks… The animals were recently discovered by park rangers at the Cape Lookout National Seashore... Three months had gone by since the animals, belonging to a free-range herd living on private land on Cedar Island, went missing during the storm. Category One Hurricane Dorian created a ‘mini-tsunami’ that swept cattle and some 30 wild horses from Cedar Island into the ocean when it struck on September 6. The cows were identified by their keeper, Woody Hancock. They will likely be sedated and sent home on a boat…”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“France does not expect to rival America but to tame it, restrain it, thwart it — and to accept the world's laurels for having led the way.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in Time magazine on March 17, 2003.

""A lot of folks ... feel very good about what Trump has accomplished. The No. 1 thing that I've heard though, was, 'I wish he would just stop doing that thing on Twitter,""' Caldwell said on Fox Nation.

""Even conservatives,"" he continued, ""even though he has a 95 percent approval rating within the conservative party, conservatives are having issues with his tweets because they're distracting.""

Trump adopted the platform as a means of directly communicating with the American people. Not known to hold back, his Twitter account -- which currently holds 66.8 M followers -- has attracted worldwide attention since the 2016 campaign.

Now considered official presidential statements, Trump uses the platform to circumvent the mainstream media, connecting directly with citizens and leaders across the country.

While many are opposed to the president's use of Twitter, which often features name-calling and inflammatory statements, he remains among the platform's most popular users.

Last month, Democratic hopeful Kamala Harris put pressure on Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey to ""do something"" about Trump's account.

""Hey, @jack, Time to do something about this,"" Harris wrote.

She also urged Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to join her in demanding that Twitter suspend Trump’s account as ”a matter of safety and corporate accountability.""

“I would urge you to join me because here we have Donald Trump, who has 65 million Twitter followers and is using that platform as the president of the United States to openly intimidate witnesses, to threaten witnesses, to obstruct justice,” Harris said during a primary presidential debate.

TRUMP IN TWITTER BATTLE WITH SCARAMUCCI, SAYING HE'D DO ANYTHING TO STAY IN SPOTLIGHT

Founder of the FiveThirtyEight website, Nate Silver, fired back on Twitter, defending the president's use of the platform.

""Hey, @jack. As a journalist I think Trump's tweets are extremely newsworthy and I'm happy that you've given the President of the United States a platform to communicate in a direct and unfiltered way with the public,"" he tweeted.

Silver's response drew criticism from many, including other reporters who seemed to side with Harris on the issue, before Twitter eventually put the matter to rest.

“We focus on the language of reported Tweets and do not attempt to determine all potential interpretations of the content or its intent,” Twitter said, calling the actions of world leaders on Twitter “largely new ground and unprecedented.”

In January 2018, the company responded to calls to shut down Trump's account saying, “blocking a world leader from Twitter or removing their controversial Tweets, would hide important information people should be able to see and debate,” Twitter said.

“It would also not silence that leader, but it would certainly hamper necessary discussion around their words and actions.”

NATE SILVER DEFENDS TRUMP'S TWITTER ACCOUNT

Co-host of the Fox Nation show Tom Shillue disagreed with Caldwell's statement that conservatives largely oppose the president's Twitter usage, and even encouraged Trump to ""tone it up.""

""I disagree with that...I could have him tone it up a little bit because ... I've been hearing this since he started ... 'Oh, I like the president, he's got to calm down with the tweets ... He's not gonna,"" Shillue said. ""So I say, stop saying it, and ... embrace it.""

""It's hilarious,"" he continued. ""I think we have gotten used to it. The only people who haven't gotten used to it...aside from the Trump haters, it's these kinds of...old line conservatives who think there's a way to sell conservatism...that way stinks,"" Shillue said.

While Caldwell acknowledged a double standard from Democrats who use similar rhetoric without backlash, he did call for the president to tone it down.

""We are leaders in this movement,"" he said, ""and I think it's important to calm it down a little bit.""

""The rules of impeachment are very clear. We’ll have to have a trial,"" announced Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday, conceding that the Senate must hold a trial to determine whether or not to convict the president and remove him from office if the Democrat-led House votes to impeach.

What that means for Democratic senators who are also running for president is that they may be forced off the campaign trail to return to Washington D.C. in the critical runup to the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primaries in February 2020.

""That raises a question - who is a trial going to benefit?"" asked Wall Street Journal columnist Daniel Henninger on Fox Nation's ""Deep Dive"" on Thursday. ""Undoubtedly [Senate] Republicans are not going to convict the president and yet you're going to have at least six Senate Democratic senators who are running for their nomination, sitting in Washington all through January, enduring this trial.""

""You've got the Iowa [caucuses] coming up the first week of August, followed by New Hampshire, followed by the Nevada caucuses, and then a caucus, a primary in South Carolina,"" he continued. ""In effect, this process of impeachment is suppressing the Democratic message, other than the fact that the message for three years is that they have been chasing the president of the United States.""

In fact, the conundrum for some Democrats is reportedly not lost on the candidates themselves.

The Washington Post reported that ""advisers to multiple candidates have been inquiring about the potential timing behind the scenes."" In addition, Sen. Bernie Sanders I-Vt., told the Post that a Senate trial would present a serious challenge. “We will do our best to get back to Iowa, to get to New Hampshire, to get to all the states that we have to. But there’s no question it will make our life a little bit more difficult,” he said.

""So who does [a Senate trial] benefit? Short answer, Pete Buttigieg,"" said Wall Street Journal editorial board member Kyle Peterson. ""He's going to be the only guy in Des Moines. He's going to be walking around, shaking hands, kissing babies and the other Democrats... they're gonna be stuck in Washington, not saying much.""

2020 Democratic national frontrunner Joe Biden will also be free to remain on the campaign trail if the Senate holds a trial. However, recent polling has shown him falling behind his competitors in the early Democratic primary states.

IS IT TOO LATE FOR MORE DEMOCRATS TO JUMP INTO THE 2020 RACE?

""I totally agree,"" said Judith Miller, Fox News contributor and Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter. ""It also benefits Mike Bloomberg and the governor of Massachusetts [Deval Patrick], who's now throwing his hat into the ring, maybe.""

Miller concluded by saying that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif., must have foreseen these circumstances.

""I think that was another reason that so troubled Pelosi [by the prospect of impeachment]. She understands the calendar better than anybody - along with votes. And she knew that this was exactly the prospect,"" Miller said. ""If I were Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders or any of the other Democratic senators who are going to be confined to Washington in this trial, I would be very worried indeed.""

Mayor Pete Buttigieg nine percentage points clear of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., indicating the one-time longshot is now a force to be reckoned with in the race for the Democratic nomination.

The CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll showed Buttigieg with 25 percent support, a 16 percent increase over his numbers in the September version of the poll. Behind Warren (16 percent) came former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who each garnered 15 percent support.

Warren's support has dropped six percentage points from the September CNN/DMR/Mediacom poll, while Biden's backing has slipped five percentage points. Sanders' support has risen four percentage points from two months ago.

FOX NEWS POLL: CLOSE RACES BETWEEN TRUMP AND DEMOCRATS IN NORTH CAROLINA

No one else in the poll cracked double-digit support. In fifth place, behind Sanders, is Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who earned six percent of the vote.

""This @DMRegister poll confirms what we’re seeing every day — MOMENTUM!"" Klobuchar tweeted Saturday night. ""

Sen. Corey Booker, D-N.J.; Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii; businessman Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang are all tied at three percent. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has not formally announced his candidacy, earned two percent.

Buttigieg has moved to the front of the pack in other recent polls of Iowa. A Monmouth University poll released Tuesday pegged Buttigieg at 22 percent, Biden at 19 percent, Warren at 18 percent and Sanders at 13 percent. Buttigieg's support jumped 14 percentage points compared to Monmouth’s last survey in August, while Biden’s dropped seven percentage points, Warren’s edged down two percentage points, and Sanders jumped five percentage points from the August survey.

A Quinnipiac survey released last week however had Buttigieg one point behind Warren, at 19 and 20 percentage points respectively.

BUTTIGIEG CLAIMS NARROW IOWA LEAD AMID PRIMARY SURGE: POLL

Buttigieg is a 37-year-old Navy war veteran and would be America’s first openly gay president if elected. Without any sort of Washington name-recognition, the mayor’s campaign seemed a longshot before he rose to middle-tier status in the spring.

Buttigieg for many seems to offer a more moderate approach than the radical policy proposals of Warren and Sanders, and unlike Biden, he does not have to fight many concerns about his age or past voting record. Among Iowa caucusgoers, 63 percent say Buttigieg's views are about right, while only seven percent say they are too liberal and 13 percent say they are too conservative.

According to the CNN/DMR poll, Buttigieg excels with caucusgoers with incomes over $100,000 (32 percent) and self-described moderates (also 32 percent) but underperforms with union households (17 percent) and those who call themselves very liberal (12 percent)."

“The average American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it. And I think it's important for us not to lose sight of that,” Obama said.

“There are a lot of persuadable voters and there are a lot of Democrats out there who just want to see things make sense. They just don't want to see crazy stuff,"" he said. ""They want to see things a little more fair, they want to see things a little more just. And how we approach that I think will be important.”

The two-term Democratic president made the remarks at a gathering of the Democracy Alliance, a group of wealthy Democratic donors. He was interviewed by Stacey Abrams, who lost Georgia’s gubernatorial race last year.

Obama has largely stayed on the sidelines on the 2020 Democratic primary, and has not yet backed a candidate -- even as former Vice President Joe Biden has invoked his name on numerous occasions. But Obama has made remarks indicating he is nervous about the drift to the extreme left on a number of issues by parts of the Democratic Party.

On Friday, he did not mention any candidates by name, but did cite immigration and health care reform as examples of where Democrats may be out of sync with the broader electorate.

Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who have both released plans on immigration and “Medicare-for-all” respectively in recent weeks. Warren’s government-led overhaul of the health care system would eventually abolish private insurance and cost $52 trillion, while Sanders’ immigration plan includes radical policies including welfare for illegal immigrants and a moratorium on all deportations.

“Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality and the fact that voters, including the Democratic voters and certainly persuadable independents or even moderate Republicans, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds,” Obama said.

The comment about Twitter feeds echoes remarks he made last month, when the former president took a swipe at “woke” virtue signalling and cancel culture, telling a Chicago audience to “get over” their obsessions with ideological purity tests.

“This idea of purity and you're never compromised and you're always politically woke, and all that stuff, you should get over that quickly,"" Obama said. “The world is messy. There are ambiguities.

And now Harris may be facing another problem: A second report Friday described internal strife at Harris’ Baltimore campaign headquarters, with several aides calling for campaign manager Juan Rodriguez’s resignation following his late October decision to lay off field staffers in several states and dedicate Harris' already dwindling campaign war chest to a seven-figure TV ad campaign before the February Iowa caucus.

KAMALA HARRIS SAYS SHE'S 'ALL IN' ON IOWA -- DESPITE CAMPAIGN RESTRUCTURING, LAYOFFS

Harris and Bloomberg were deadlocked in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Nov. 12-14. Though not yet a declared candidate, Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and billionaire business and media mogul, launched a massive $100 million digital ad campaign Friday targeting President Trump.

In the poll, both Harris and Bloomberg fell behind Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who polled at 6 percent, and Sen Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who polled at 13 percent. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders led the Demicratic field tied at 19 percent support.

Rodriguez said in an Oct. 30 campaign memo obtained by Fox News that several dozen people would be laid off at the campaign's Baltimore headquarters -- as would volunteers in New Hampshire, Nevada, and California -- in an effort to go ""all-in"" in Iowa. He also said the campaign aimed to dedicate $1 million to a media campaign in the weeks before the Feb. 3 caucus, a figure now considered unlikely given Harris’ lackluster funding.

Three additional staff members were laid off and another quit in recent days at Harris’ campaign headquarters in Baltimore, unnamed aides told Politico on Friday. They said several aides have approached campaign chair Maya Harris, the candidate’s sister, to force Rodriguez to step down, claiming his failed leadership is responsible for the campaign’s recent troubles.

One official said Harris’ current campaign structure has “No discipline. No plan. No strategy.”

“It’s a campaign of id,” the official continued. “What feels right, what impulse you have right now, what emotion, what frustration.”

But others defended Rodriguez, saying he’s been loyal to Harris even before she first announced her candidacy in January. They pointed fingers at Maya Harris, who shared leadership responsibility with Rodriguez.

“From the outset of this race, he has had all the responsibility with none of the authority. He’s been managing this race with at least one, if not two, hands tied behind his back,” a senior campaign official told Politico of Rodriguez. “He would never undermine her. He’s just not that guy.”

The Politico report cited 12 individuals – who were either current or former campaign staffers or donors – who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Meanwhile, Harris has been crisscrossing the country to try to salvage support. Her campaign has struggled to regain traction after an initial stand-out moment in the race during the first Democratic debate in June when she challenged Biden, a frontrunner, over comments he made about segregationist U.S. senators and school busing. Harris struggled in the second debate after Biden and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, challenged her record as California's attorney general. She struggled to shine in subsequent debates.

Biden – he has deep ties to South Carolina -- stands at 33 percent among likely Democratic primary voters in the Palmetto State, according to a Quinnipiac University survey released Monday. Warren, the Massachusetts senator, is a distant second – at 13 percent -- with Sanders at 11 percent and Buttigieg at 6 percent.

And Biden stands at 36 percent among likely South Carolina Democratic primary voters in a University of South Florida survey, with Sanders and Warren tied for second at just 10 percent.

“Unlike tight races in Iowa and New Hampshire, South Carolina has a clear front-runner in the Democratic primary,” Quinnipiac University polling analyst Mary Snow said. “Former Vice President Joe Biden has broad based appeal, with particularly strong leads among black and moderate/conservative voters.”

Hedge-fund manager turned billionaire environment and progressive grassroots advocate Tom Steyer stands at 5 percent in the poll, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 4 percent, Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 3 percent, and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey at 2 percent. Everyone else in the large field of Democratic White House hopefuls registers at 1 percent or less.

THE LATEST 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN POLLS FROM FOX NEWS

The poll indicates Biden’s the most favorably viewed of all the candidates, with a 71 percent-18 percent favorable-unfavorable rating. The former vice president’s plus-53 net favorability rating is 17 points higher than Sanders and 22 points higher than Warren.

The poll’s release comes days after former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick jumped into the race, and amid speculation that former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg is poised to launch a presidential bid.

Snow noted that Patrick “has his work cut out for him in introducing himself to voters. Nearly 8 in 10 likely voters say they haven't heard enough about Patrick to form an opinion of him.”

“More likely voters are familiar with Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor contemplating a run, as roughly 5 in 10 haven't heard enough -- but voters that have an opinion view him more unfavorably than favorably,"" she added.

And Snow pointed out that “where South Carolina is similar to other early states: choices are not set in stone. Roughly 4 in 10 of likely Democratic primary voters say their minds are made up.”

But fellow Democrats seem to be hinting his stand againt legalizing marijuana may be outdated too.

The latest pushback came Sunday night, when Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., tweeted that “Marijuana should be legalized, and drug consumption should be decriminalized. These are matters of public health.”

AOC's Twitter post -- which mirrored the pro-pot stands of Sen. Bernie Sanders, whom she supports for president, as well as Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker and others running for the party's 2020 nomination -- came a day after Biden told a town hall audience in Las Vegas that he still hasn’t seen enough evidence that marijuana is not a gateway drug, so he can't yet back legalizing weed.

""It's a debate, and I want a lot more [data] before I legalize it nationally,"" Biden said, according to Business Insider. ""I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it.""

""It's a debate, and I want a lot more [data] before I legalize it nationally. I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it."" — Joe Biden

Sanders said Oct. 24 he would legalize the drug by executive order within the first 100 days of his administration should he win the White House, Fox News reported.



SANDERS INTRODUCES PLAN TO LEGALIZE MARIJUANA NATIONWIDE DURING FIRST 100 DAYS IN OFFICE



Last year, Sanders' home state of Vermont legalized possession of one ounce of pot and letting each adult resident grow two plants for personal use. He has long been a supporter of decriminalizing marijuana nationwide and argued criminalization of the drug has ravaged communities of color and created an unequal incarceration rate.



""Too many lives were ruined due to the disastrous criminalization of marijuana,” Sanders wrote in a tweet announcing his plan.

Biden, however, spoke in favor of a more cautious approach. He said states should be able to legalize marijuana if they want but added he wouldn’t overturn federal law right away.



In addition, he supports medical marijuana and believes possession of the substance ""should not be a crime,"" the Business Insider report said.



Much of Biden’s 40-year Senate career took place during the federal government's War on Drugs, which included harsh criminal penalties for nonviolent drug users, Business Insider reported.



The former vice president also said in a June campaign speech that he supported expunging past convictions for possession.



BOOKER, OTHER 2020 DEM PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS, INTRODUCE FEDERAL MARIJUANA LEGALIZATION BILL



But contrary to Biden's Las Vegas comments, several national organizations say there is no solid evidence to support the claim that using marijuana leads to the use of harder drugs, the report said. A 1999 Institute of Medicine report said marijuana ""typically precedes rather than follows initiation of other illicit drug use,"" but it ""does not appear to be a gateway drug to the extent that it is the cause or even that it is the most significant predictor of serious drug abuse; that is, care must be taken not to attribute cause to association.""



The National Institute on Drug Abuse says that research shows ""the majority of people who use marijuana do not go on to use other, 'harder' substances,"" and drug use can be affected by numerous other biological and environmental factors, the report continued.



The majority of current candidates openly support nationwide legalization.



Ten states and the District of Columbia already have legalized recreational marijuana, with only nine states where the drug remains fully illegal. Most states either have decriminalized it or have allowed it to be sold for medical uses.

A recent Gallup poll found 66 percent of Americans support fully legalizing marijuana, almost double the number from 2005 when only 35 percent supported the move.



The sentiment across the country has been reflected among the 2020 Democrats with all supporting at least some form of legalization or decriminalization of the drug.



While Sanders became the first candidate to lay out an extensive plan for legalizing marijuana, fellow candidates Warren and Booker as well as Sen. Kamala Harris of California have supported the Marijuana Justice Act. Introduced by Booker, the legislation would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act and expunge existing cannabis-related criminal records."

IMPEACHMENT PROBE DRAWS IN TRUMP’S ANSWERS TO MUELLER

NYT: “Impeachment investigators are exploring whether President Trump lied in his written answers to Robert S. Mueller III during the Russia investigation, a lawyer for the House told a federal appeals court on Monday, raising the prospect of bringing an additional basis for a Senate trial over whether to remove Mr. Trump. … During the Mueller investigation, Mr. Trump refused to testify orally about what he knew and did during the 2016 campaign in relation to Russia’s election interference operation, or his later efforts to impede the special counsel’s inquiry. But he did provide lawyerly written answers to some questions, which were appended to the Mueller report. On Monday, Douglas Letter, the general counsel for the House, told a federal appeals court panel that impeachment investigators have an ‘immense’ need to see the grand jury evidence — redacted portions of the Mueller report, as well as the underlying testimony transcripts they came from — because Mr. Trump may have lied.”



Ukrainian president reportedly felt the pressure long before Trump’s squeeze - AP: “Despite his denials, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was feeling pressure from the Trump administration to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden before his July phone call with President Donald Trump that has led to impeachment hearings. In early May, staff at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, including then-Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, were briefed on a meeting Zelenskiy held in which he sought advice on how to navigate the difficult position he was in, according to two people with knowledge of the briefings. He was concerned that Trump and associates were pressing him to take action that could affect the 2020 U.S. presidential race, the people said. They spoke only on condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic and political sensitivity of the issue.”



Trump defenders’ new stance: The quid pro quo failed - NYT: “House Republicans, bracing for another week of impeachment hearings, asserted on Sunday that President Trump had done nothing wrong because his plans for Ukraine to investigate his political rivals never came to fruition… [L]awmakers are about to hear from crucial witnesses who had direct contact with the president, including Gordon D. Sondland, a donor to and an ally of Mr. Trump who served as his liaison to Ukrainian officials while the president withheld — but later released — $391 million in military aid to Ukraine. … On Sunday, Chris Wallace, the host of ‘Fox News Sunday,’ pressed Representative Steve Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, on that point, asking him whether Mr. Sondland might ‘blow a hole’ in Republicans’ defense. ‘The president’s defense is that those things didn’t happen,’ Mr. Scalise said, adding: ‘The real bottom line is he got the money. Ukraine got the money.’”



In a murky sea of disinformation and bias, voters tune out - NYT: “The Democrats in Congress took their case against President Trump to the public last week. But after hours of testimony, thousands of news reports and days of streaming headlines, one thing was clear: A lot of Americans weren’t listening. … In this volatile political moment, information, it would seem, has never been more crucial. The country is in the midst of impeachment proceedings against a president for the third time in modern history. A high-stakes election is less than a year away. But just when information is needed most, to many Americans it feels most elusive. The rise of social media; the proliferation of information online, including news designed to deceive; and a flood of partisan news are leading to a general exhaustion with news itself. Add to that a president with a documented record of regularly making false statements and the result is a strange new normal: Many people are numb and disoriented, struggling to discern what is real in a sea of slant, fake and fact.”



Trump reportedly vexed by Pompeo’s failure to rein in diplomats - NBC News: “The impeachment inquiry has created the first rift between President Donald Trump and the Cabinet member who has been his closest ally, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to four current and former senior administration officials. Trump has fumed for weeks that Pompeo is responsible for hiring State Department officials whose congressional testimony threatens to bring down his presidency, the officials said. The president confronted Pompeo about the officials – and what he believed was a lackluster effort by the secretary of state to block their testimony – during lunch at the White House on Oct. 29, those familiar with the matter said. Inside the White House, the view was that Trump ‘just felt like, ‘rein your people in,’’ a senior administration official said. Trump particularly blames Pompeo for tapping Ambassador Bill Taylor in June to be the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, the current and former senior administration officials said.”

TIME OUT: FITTED FOR A QUEEN

Atlantic: “Clothes, in [the Netflix series] The Crown, have always been part of the aesthetic pleasure the show provides viewers—a crucial element of the absurd spectacle that is royalist Britain… And yet, watching Season 3 [released Nov. 17], [The Atlantic’s Sophie Gilbert noticed] more than ever how the series uses clothing to explore and subvert ideas about power, and what it looks like when a woman wields it. … [Queen Elizabeth’s] gender, and her femininity, are intrinsic to the way she governs.… In reality, as in the show, the Queen’s deployment of pastel colors and pearls isn’t just a matter of personal taste. Since her coronation in 1953, when the Queen requested that her gown for the event be embroidered with symbols from countries in the British Commonwealth … every outfit she’s worn has been worn with intention. Clothing, for the Queen, is much more about diplomacy and visibility than style.”

BUTTI-BOOM, BUTTI-BING

Des Moines Register: “Pete Buttigieg has rocketed to the top of the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll in the latest reshuffling of the top tier of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. Since September, Buttigieg has risen 16 percentage points among Iowa’s likely Democratic caucusgoers, with 25% now saying he is their first choice for president. For the first time in the Register’s Iowa Poll, he bests rivals Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who are now clustered in competition for second place and about 10 percentage points behind the South Bend, Indiana, mayor. Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, led the September Iowa Poll, when 22% said she was their first choice. In this poll, her support slips to 16%. Former Vice President Biden, who led the Register’s first three Iowa Polls of the 2020 caucus cycle, has continued to slide, falling 5 percentage points to 15%. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, also garners 15% — a 4 percentage point rise.”



Biden strikes cautious tone on pot - WaPo: “On the question of marijuana, former vice president Joe Biden might seem out of step with the crowd. … But the 76-year-old Democrat is in tune with at least one demographic: his peers in the silent generation, who, at 35 percent, have what may be one of the lowest percentages of support for marijuana legalization, according to the Pew data released Nov. 14. This disparity on the topic came into full view at a town hall in Las Vegas over the weekend, when Biden drew some groans from the crowd by saying he wants to see more research on marijuana and suggesting that it may be a ‘gateway drug’ that can lead users to harsher substances.”



Harry Reid credits Biden’s Nevada success to minority appeal - AP: “Iowa and New Hampshire get to weigh in first on the Democratic presidential contest next year, but the states are not ethnically diverse enough to offer any insight into how a candidate will fare across the country, former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Sunday. … Reid said he thinks that former Vice President Joe Biden has appeared strong in Nevada because he ‘is one that appeals to diversity,’ but he added that most of the other Democrats running can also appeal to diverse groups.”



As Harris craters, blame game ramps up - Politico: “Kamala Harris’ campaign is careening toward a crackup. As the California senator crisscrosses the country trying to revive her sputtering presidential bid, aides at her fast-shrinking headquarters are deep into the finger-pointing stages. And much of the blame is being placed on campaign manager Juan Rodriguez. … The internal strife is the latest discouraging development for Harris’ once-encouraging candidacy. She has slid into low single digits and is now banking on a top-tier performance in Iowa to pull her back into contention. Inside the campaign, which had already experienced staff shakeups before the layoffs, rank and file aides are fed up with the weak leadership and uncertainty around internal communication, planning and executing on a clear vision. They say the constant shifting has eroded trust in the upper ranks.”



Pressure rises at home for speedy exit - Politico: “Harris’ loyal activist base, who call themselves the K-Hive, have lost none of the passion and intensity from those early days. … But in the halls and meeting rooms of the Long Beach Convention Center, many of the battle-scarred Democratic insiders — strategists, elected officials, campaign operatives — had a far more caustic view of her chances, suggesting that Harris’ team has already let slip away her shot at the White House. With California polls strongly suggesting she might not win, place — or even show — in her home state, many privately expressed the view that Harris should begin seriously considering leaving the race to avoid total embarrassment in the state’s early March primary. Her continued weakness in the presidential contest could even have a more damaging effect, several said — encouraging a primary challenger in 2022, when Harris is up for reelection.”



Warren’s Medicare hedge does little to quell doubts - WaPo: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has been mostly sure-footed in her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. One exception is health care. On Friday, she issued another proposal to go along with her support for Medicare-for-all, a step that appeared designed to put her into a safer place politically. Warren’s progression on health care through the course of the campaign has taken her from a position of flexibility to one of seeming inflexibility — at least until Friday. Over a period of months, she walked herself into a place that many Democrats feared could make her chances of winning a general election more, not less, difficult. Whether Friday’s turn alleviates those worries remains to be seen.”



Younger voters still dig Bernie - WBUR: “Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders remains the top choice for young likely voters, coming in at 28% in the [Harvard Institute of Politics poll of voters under age 30]. That's down 3 percentage points since the spring. The 78-year-old Sanders has long had strong support among the under-30 set. [Twenty-two percent of likely 18- to 29-year-old voters would choose Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic presidential primary. That’s up 18 points from her showing in March.] Another septuagenarian, former Vice President Joe Biden, comes in third in the Harvard survey, with the backing of 16% of likely voters. The youngest Democratic candidate, 37-year-old Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is fifth, at just 4%.”



Bloomberg continues apology tour - Fox News: “Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has yet to formally announce whether he will run for president in 2020, but during remarks where he looked to the future before a majority-black church in Brooklyn, he apologized for his controversial ‘stop and frisk’ policy that sowed distrust of police in black and Latino communities during his administration. That policy, which was later repealed, allowed police to stop individuals on the street and briefly question and frisk them if they had reasonable suspicion that the person may be committing, had committed or is about to commit a crime. During his Sunday speech, Bloomberg recognized that this led to ‘far too many innocent people’ being stopped, many of them black or Latino. ‘I got something important wrong. I got something important really wrong.’”



Lefties see conspiracy behind Patrick, Bloomberg runs - Politico: “Democratic donors say they want Michael Bloomberg and Deval Patrick to run for president because they’re petrified that a left-wing candidate can’t defeat President Donald Trump. But progressives see a more sinister effort afoot. Aides and allies to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, among other liberals, perceive the eleventh-hour campaign launched last week by Patrick — and the prospect of an impending Bloomberg 2020 bid — as an attempt to crush an ascendant left wing that would expand government more than any other Democratic president in decades. In their view, Patrick and Bloomberg are stalking horses for moderate Democrats, high-dollar contributors and bundlers desperate to halt the momentum of the economic populists at the top of the polls — and regain control of the party levers.”



Can anyone break the Coolidge curse? - NYT: “Voters have never elected a sitting mayor to the presidency. Americans have seldom embraced anyone who’s even touched the job. Calvin Coolidge was the last president, one of just three in 230 years, to have been a mayor at any point. He led Northampton, Mass. – a modest town, really – for two years. But as the Democratic Party becomes ever more aligned with urban areas, its presidential field is now studded with politicians whose boasts include running a city. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has now jumped to the lead in Iowa polling. Also in the race are two recent mayors, Julián Castro and Cory Booker, and another candidate who got his start as a mayor, Bernie Sanders. The current New York mayor, Bill de Blasio, and a former Denver mayor, John Hickenlooper, have already come and gone, while Michael Bloomberg, another New York mayor, is still calculating on the sidelines.”



TRUMP CRAPS OUT ON GUBERNATORIAL GAMBLES

Politico: “President Donald Trump campaigned hard in three conservative Southern states this fall, aiming for a string of gubernatorial wins that would demonstrate his political strength heading into impeachment and his own reelection effort. The plan backfired in dramatic fashion. The latest black eye came on Saturday, when Trump's favored candidate in Louisiana, multimillionaire businessman Eddie Rispone, went down to defeat. The president went all-in, visiting the state three times, most recently on Thursday. Earlier this month, Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin lost reelection after a similar presidential effort on his behalf. Of the candidates Trump backed, only Tate Reeves in Mississippi won. The losses raise questions about Trump’s standing as he heads into what will be a grueling 2020 campaign. By throwing himself into the three contests — each in states that Trump won by double-digits in 2016 — the president had hoped to gain a modicum of political momentum at a perilous moment of his presidency.”

DEEP YOGURT

USA Today: “[Patricia] Larkin, of Lacey, New Jersey, said in the Facebook group ‘Lacey Township Chatter’ that she was grocery shopping with her infant when a woman told a cashier that her baby was fake and an attempt to ‘smuggle yogurts out of the store.’ Larkin, despite being fatigued from staying up nights with her 2-month-old daughter, responded to the accusation with humor. She posted a picture of herself smiling while holding her sleeping baby in front of the store's sign. ‘Thank you for the laugh,’ she wrote in the Facebook group. ‘1) My baby is 100% real. 2) Yogurts are like $.25 at Aldi. 3) I'm lactose intolerant and don't consume any dairy at all.’ Larkin said a similarly amused cashier told her about the woman's accusation, by which time, her infant daughter was crying and fussing like only a real baby could.”

The decision by the California Democrat and House Intelligence Committee chairman to conduct the first series of interviews behind closed doors allowed Republicans to appropriately brand the enterprise as unfair and clandestine.

His next step, orchestrating a steady stream of leaks and disclosures timed and edited for maximum impact, all but guaranteed that last week’s subsequent live hearings would be anti-climactic.

Schiff stole his own thunder.

JASON CHAFFETZ: WHY SCHIFF'S WHISTLEBLOWER CLAIMS AT TRUMP IMPEACHMENT HEARING ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE

In addition, he has not been straightforward about his dealings with the whistleblower, who initially was pivotal to charges against the president but who is now deemed inconsequential by Schiff.

It is common knowledge that the initial complaint was launched by a Democrat with ties to President Trump’s adversaries. That revelation has sucked even more legitimacy from the investigation.

As a result of these several missteps, the public is wary of what has emerged as an obviously partisan attack on a duly elected president. Worse, they are also, already, bored and, we’re not even in the home stretch.

If Americans turn against the impeachment effort, they will punish Democrats for not attending to other, more important, priorities. Let’s face it, impeaching the president will not make our roads better or lower drug costs.

Adding to the public’s ennui is that the resolution of the impeachment is a foregone conclusion. It’s like Agatha Christie revealing whodunit in Chapter One; it steals the story’s punch.

We know Democrats will press forward with their tiresome questioning and posturing, hoping to convince the nation that the hearings are something bigger and nobler than a political stunt. They will vote to impeach; that has always been a foregone conclusion.

The carnival will then move to the Senate, which will ultimately hold a trial and find the president not guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors. Democrats know this; they know there is no real purpose to their impeachment thrust but to undermine Mr. Trump before the 2020 campaign.

It's a risky way to win an election. If Americans turn against the impeachment effort, they will punish Democrats for not attending to other, more important, priorities. Let’s face it, impeaching the president will not make our roads better or lower drug costs.

Also, a partisan investigation will energize Trump supporters and drive turnout among Republicans.

Even the Trump-hating New York Times struggled to find much meaning in the impeachment proceedings. In their coverage of the first day of hearings, reporter Peter Baker was reduced to glorifying star witness and diplomat William Taylor’s appearance: “the image, at least, of a wise, fatherly figure” with a “chiseled face and reassuring gray hair” whose “deep baritone voice [was] reminiscent of Walter Cronkite.” Channeling Gregory Peck apparently enhances Taylor’s credibility.

The liberal media did hyperventilate over Taylor’s “new” revelation that someone on his staff “asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine.” Sondland, according to the aide, according to Taylor, said the president “cares more about the investigations of Bidens.” In other words, third-hand hearsay.

Disappointing to Democrats, Taylor refused to climb aboard the impeachment train. Moreover, that Taylor had never once met with or talked to President Trump undermined the impact of his testimony, notwithstanding his admirable elocution.

To be sure, it is clear that Taylor disapproved of President Trump’s reportedly tying $391 million in aid to Kiev to an investigation into possible misdeeds by Joe Biden and his son Hunter. He said that holding up that assistance for political purposes is wrong. It is unclear what Taylor thought of President Obama’s steadfast refusal to authorize that much-needed help during his administration.

Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who was sent back to the United States because the White House heard she was openly critical of the president, was not even in the Ukraine when the events under review took place. The president is entitled to have representatives in foreign countries who are on his team. End of story.

Taylor, Yovanovitch and other witnesses, including the still missing-in-action whistleblower, have no first-hand evidence that Trump threatened to withhold aid in exchange for an investigation into the Bidens. That is still a critical missing link.

As the inquiry drags on, more Americans will tune out. The TV audience on the first day of the Schiff show was far less than the number who watched the confirmation hearings for now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh or even Michael Cohen’s testimony.

Schiff himself was tweeting his followers to watch in an embarrassing effort to gin up enthusiasm. The audience will shrink further.

Democratic candidates slugging it out in Iowa and New Hampshire are rarely asked about impeachment. Instead, voters ask about health care and other issues; campaigners are struggling to explain how they are rewarding voters for giving their party the majority in the House.

Some of those candidates will soon view the impeachment drive as an even bigger threat. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris, Michael Bennet and Cory Booker – all 2020 candidates – will have to participate in the eventual Senate trial. That means they will have to sit in the Senate day after day, while rivals like Joe Biden and Mayor Pete Buttigieg run circles around them on the campaign trail.

It is almost inconceivable that Democrats have allowed Adam Schiff to play ringmaster for this circus. As a major author of the Russia collusion narrative, Schiff was already reviled on the right.

As he leads his own party down the impeachment rabbit hole, Schiff may come under fire from Democrats as well, and especially from those senators trying to win the primaries.

And let’s not forget the damage Schiff has done to front-runner Joe Biden. After all, the one critical part of the Ukraine story that is regurgitated with each telling is that Biden’s son Hunter monetized his father’s unique status not only in Kiev but also in China. That has soiled the former vice president’s candidacy.

The hearings are not over but it is hard to see today how impeachment will prove a winner for Democrats. Nancy Pelosi should have stuck to her guns, and never let this process move forward, and especially with Adam Schiff at the helm.

WHAT WOULD BUTTIGIEG’S PATH LOOK LIKE?

FiveThirtyEight: “[If Pete Buttigieg] winds up pulling disproportionately from [Elizabeth Warren], it could make for a more complicated race. A world where Buttigieg wins both Iowa and New Hampshire is one where Warren will have finished second (or worse) in two early states that, on paper, look tailor-made for her. The underwhelming performances could drain her support among two key elements of her base — wonky-but-not-ideological college-educated whites, who could switch to Buttigieg, and devoted progressives, who could switch to [Bernie Sanders]. In fact, the Selzer poll already showed signs that Iowa liberals were leaving Warren for Sanders; if that happens nationwide, the Democratic primary could exit Super Tuesday as a three-way race between [Joe Biden] as the candidate of nonwhite voters, Buttigieg as the candidate of party elites and Sanders as the candidate of the left.”



Dems turn to big donors to blunt Trump’s early cash advantage - WaPo: “Democratic groups financed by wealthy donors have ratcheted up their spending in recent weeks as party operatives have become concerned that President Trump is gaining an insurmountable lead in the money race. By the time voters coalesce around a nominee, Democratic operatives worry, it will be too late to overcome Trump’s fundraising advantages in the general election. Already, pro-Trump committees have spent more than $500 million on his reelection — far more than previous incumbents at this point in the election. As a result, more than a dozen groups backed by high-dollar Democratic donors have pledged to spend at least $420 million through the primary season, focused largely on general-election swing states. Their efforts range from running anti-Trump digital ads to funding legal challenges to voter restriction that could hamper Democratic turnout.”



New debate threshold squeezes also-rans - Politico: “New thresholds announced by the Democratic National Committee for the sixth debate — which will be hosted by POLITICO and PBS on Dec. 19 in Los Angeles — represent only a modest step up from the criteria for the next debate in November. But they could still seriously endanger the participation of all but the top five candidates. To make the December debate, candidates must hit 4 percent support in at least four DNC-approved polls of primary voters nationally or in early voting states (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina) — or, instead, they can qualify by hitting 6 percent in two approved early state polls. Candidates must also bring in donations from 200,000 unique donors, with a minimum of 800 donors in 20 states, territories or Washington, D.C. … The new thresholds will put pressure on Democratic candidates outside a top five – Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris – who have routinely polled above 4 percent in approved surveys so far.”



Dems try to manipulate moderators - NBC News: “The Democratic National Committee and the news organization Politico are locked in an argument over the ideological credentials of a proposed moderator for next month's Democratic debate… Politico and PBS are scheduled to co-host the sixth Democratic primary debate on Dec. 19 in Los Angeles. At the behest of its publisher, Robert Allbritton, Politico is pushing for Tim Alberta, the chief political correspondent for Politico Magazine… The top PBS journalists under consideration are Judy Woodruff, Yamiche Alcindor and Amna Nawaz. Politico’s decision to push for Alberta has rankled officials at the DNC… The reason: Alberta previously wrote for National Review, a conservative magazine, and has spent the bulk of his recent career chronicling the Republican Party. Democratic Party officials say such a journalist is ill-suited to co-moderate a debate meant to better inform Democratic voters about their potential nominees.”



Sanders hits 4 million donations mark - Fox News: “…[When] it comes to donations to his campaign, the longtime progressive lawmaker and populist champion from Vermont is in a league of his own, far ahead of his 2020 rivals. Sanders’ campaign announced on Tuesday morning that it's now received more than 4 million individual contributions from people across the country, making the senator the fastest candidate in history to reach the fundraising mark. ‘Working-class Americans across the country are chipping in $3, $18, $27, or whatever they can to help elect Bernie Sanders because they know he is the only candidate who will fight for them and take on corporate greed and corruption,’ campaign manager Faiz Shakir touted. ‘This is what momentum looks like.’”



Columbia, S.C. mayor backs Bloomberg - AP: “Before he’s officially a presidential candidate, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is picking up a key endorsement in South Carolina. Steve Benjamin, the mayor of Columbia, told The Associated Press on Monday that he’s ready to back the billionaire if he decides to seek the Democratic presidential nomination. ‘He’s got what it takes and he’s got the resources to take it to Trump,’ Benjamin said in an interview. ‘I believe firmly that Mike Bloomberg can win. I think resources are going to matter.’ First elected in 2010, Benjamin is one of South Carolina’s highest-profile black politicians and was among the candidates to be Hillary Clinton’s running mate in 2016.”



Dems pleased with field, still open to changing horses - NPR: “On the 2020 presidential contest, 69% of Democrats say they're happy with the field. Less than a quarter say they're not. Three-quarters of Democrats also say they still haven't made up their minds on who to vote for, down only 7 points since July, the last time the question was asked in the survey. The survey also asked a battery of candidate qualities that would make a voter most ‘enthusiastic’ to vote for that person. Being a woman is the most desirable quality in a candidate among all registered voters. But there were big differences by party. Democrats would be most ‘enthusiastic’ about voting for a woman, someone who is gay or lesbian, or someone under 40. The top three qualities for Republicans, on the other hand: a business executive, a white man or a woman.”



THE RULEBOOK: HOUSE PARTY

“The number of which the House of Representatives is to consist, forms another and a very interesting point of view, under which this branch of the federal legislature may be contemplated. Scarce any article, indeed, in the whole Constitution seems to be rendered more worthy of attention, by the weight of character and the apparent force of argument with which it has been assailed.” – Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, Federalist No. 55



TIME OUT: SEVEN SCORE AND 16 YEARS AGO

On this day in 1863, President Abraham Lincoln delivered what is probably the finest piece of American political oratory. Speaking for less than three minutes on a sunny fall afternoon in southern Pennsylvania, Lincoln set out the duty of every generation of Americans: “To preserve and prefect the promise of our founding. Those buried at Gettysburg had died in service of that aim. Will we honor their sacrifice by living for it? “It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”

AS IMPEACHMENT GRINDS ON, VOTERS DIG IN

NPR: “The country is witnessing one of only a handful of times in its history that Congress has gone through with public hearings on whether to impeach a president. And yet, the overwhelming majority of Americans across parties say nothing they hear in the inquiry will change their minds on impeachment, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. Half of Americans said they approve of the impeachment inquiry — about the same as the poll found last month. Respondents are also split on whether they think Trump should be impeached and removed from office. But 65% of Americans say they can't imagine any information or circumstances during the impeachment inquiry where they might change their minds about their position on impeachment. And 30% say yes, it's possible. … ‘We're really not seeing either a backlash or a positive,’ Barbara Carvalho, director of the Marist Poll, said of the impeachment inquiry. ‘What we're seeing is people just locking in.’”



Army colonel testifies about Trump demand - Fox News: “One of the witnesses, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official, also caused a dustup by acknowledging communications with an unnamed intelligence official during an at-times tense exchange with Republicans. Vindman acknowledged speaking with two people outside the White House about the July 25 call, including State Department official George Kent and the unnamed intelligence community official… Vindman, who reported his concerns about Trump's call to the NSC lawyer, described Trump's request as a ‘demand’ and told lawmakers he believed if Ukraine pursued the investigations, it ‘would be interpreted as a partisan play.’ He also emphasized that he reported his concerns ‘out of a sense of duty.’ Vindman said that since the July 25 phone call, he believes he has been ‘excluded’ from meetings at the White House that would have been appropriate for his position.”



Impeachment scrambles Senate strategies - Politico: “The Senate is increasingly likely to hold Trump’s trial in January, according to senators and aides, a reflection of Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s uncertain timeline in the House and the dismal prospects for finishing an impeachment trial in December. And pushing the trial into 2020 will bring uncertain fallout for both parties, heightening the intrigue of what will already be historic proceedings on the second floor of the Capitol. … Meanwhile, Republican senators will be in the opening of their own primary season for their reelection campaigns, in which special attention will be placed on their fealty to Trump and any whiff of independence during the trial. … Much is uncertain and out of the Senate’s direct control. No one drew up an impeachment inquiry with plans for a Senate trial in January 2020, and there’s no blueprint from past trials to draw from considering none happened in the heat of a campaign.”



CONGRESS KICKS CAN ON SPENDING UNTIL DEC. 20

Politico: “House and Senate leaders secured a deal on Monday afternoon that would extend government funding for four more weeks and sidestep a debilitating government-wide shutdown. The continuing resolution unveiled by House Democrats would last until Dec. 20, leaving out any restrictions on border barrier spending, which President Donald Trump demanded in exchange for his signature. The current stopgap expires Thursday night. The bill would fund a 3.1 percent military pay raise, it would provide extra cash to help the Commerce Department gear up for the 2020 census and it would allow state highway programs to avoid a $7.6 billion cut this summer. It also includes a number of health extenders and renews three expiring surveillance provisions through March. House Democrats, however, did not secure funding for historically black colleges and universities, an item among their requested policy riders.”



Pelosi hopes Trumka can calm freshmen’s jitters - Politico: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her top deputies are working to ease long-simmering anxiety among battleground freshmen, which has intensified amid fears that impeachment could creep into 2020 and make many of them one-term members. Pelosi will bring in AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka on Tuesday to speak with freshman Democrats, many of whom have been privately demanding quicker action on President Donald Trump’s trade deal, according to multiple people familiar with the meeting. The private huddle with the labor leader — at a make-or-break moment for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement — is an attempt to calm concerns of swing-district Democrats who fear their agenda isn’t breaking through with the public and are increasingly frustrated by policy stalemates in Washington.”

AUDIBLE: AUDIBLE, INDEED

“TOTAL EXONERATION!” – Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif, tweeted after an interview Monday on MSNBC’s “Hardball,” in response to what sounded like him expelling a thunderous toot while on air. The official ‘Hardball’ Twitter account clarified the noise was from someone dragging a coffee mug across a table in the studio.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Your snippet from The Atlantic article on The Crown concerning the Queen’s clothing refers to its being, along with her gender, ‘intrinsic to the way she governs.’ No British monarch has governed in well over a hundred years. As the series demonstrates in occasionally painful detail, there are two parts of the British constitution — the efficient and the dignified, represented respectively by the government and the monarch. The monarch functions primarily as the Head of State, a ceremonial position representing the nation’s stability, while the Prime Minister is the Head of Government, subject to the whims of the democratic electorate. In the U.S. both functions are performed by the President, while in parliamentary democracies like India, Austria, Germany, and Israel the President is the ceremonial Head of State.” – Bob Foys, Chicago



[Ed. note: First, Mr. Foys, let’s be clear that this is all Brianna’s fault… I kid, I kid! First, you are quite right about the distribution of duties in a constitutional monarchy. But second, I think we might be a little forgiving when it comes to the political word choices of fashion writers. I’m sure I’d make a terrible hash of clothing terminology if I was delving into the subject to make a political point. I’m more than happy to give the piece’s author, Sophie Gilbert, plenty of leeway in her genuinely interesting, thoughtful piece.]

THREE WISE GUYS WANTED FOR QUESTIONING

KWCH/AP: “Goddard [Kan.] police say the owners of a camel, cow and donkey found wandering the streets of the Wichita suburb have been located. They say the animals, which looked reminiscent of a ‘nativity scene getaway,’ as some called it, belong to an employee of the nearby Tanganyika Wildlife Park. A neighborhood in Goddard had three unusual visitors strolling through its streets on Sunday afternoon. … ‘Well we were just coming back from picking up a friend and came into the trailer park and the first thing we see is hey there's a cow, wait a minute, that’s a donkey, and that’s a camel and we had all three,’ said Trudy Wilcox. It was quite the sight, a cow, a donkey, and a camel walking through the neighborhood. … With Christmas lights already up on some homes, the three friends brought even more holiday spirit to the neighborhood.”

NBCUniversal and parent company Comcast have been accused of multiple abuses of power amid ongoing scandals related to Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer. UltraViolet, a leading national women’s organization, organized an effort for key 2020 Democratic hopefuls to address the issues with DNC chairman Tom Perez through a harshly worded letter obtained by Fox News.

NBC NEWS REPORTEDLY RENEWS NOAH OPPENHEIM’S CONTRACT, DRAWING OUTRAGE: 'STATUS QUO HAS BEEN BLESSED'

“We, the undersigned candidates, are very concerned about the message it would send to sexual assault survivors if our next debate is sponsored by MSNBC without clear commitments from Comcast, the parent company of NBC and MSNBC, to conduct an independent investigation into the toxic culture that enabled abusers and silenced survivors,” the letter begins.

After the Weinstein and Lauer bombshells were reported in 2017, NBC refused to hire an outside investigator to determine who knew about Lauer’s alleged sexual misconduct and whether NBC executives looked the other way. NBC relied on in-house general counsel Kim Harris despite widespread calls for an outside law firm to conduct the review.

NBC KILLED MY SEX ASSAULT STORY AFTER FARROW'S WEINSTEIN PIECE, AUTHOR CLAIMS

NBC eventually declared that management was completely oblivious to Lauer’s behavior and Harris’ high-powered colleagues were cleared by the network – but UltraViolet has vowed not to give up until an independent investigation is launched.

“NBC’s internal investigation last year ultimately concluded that because there were no formal complaints, NBC News executives were not at fault. Yet, there is clearly something wrong with a work environment reluctant to hold management accountable,” the letter said. “That's what allowed the behavior of powerful abusers inside the company to go unchecked. The troubling reports about management’s role to cover up abuse demonstrate that Comcast should have and needs to do more to shift the work culture and pursue significant structural changes in order to prevent future harassment and abuse at NBC and MSNBC. Until that happens, employees are at risk.”

MADDOW CELEBRATES NYT REPORTERS WHO EXPOSED WEINSTEIN SCANDAL, IGNORES HOW NBC SPIKED SAME STORY

UltraViolet has called for NBCUniversal to fire NBC News president Noah Oppenheim, MSNBC president Phil Griffin and “every other person in leadership that enabled abusers and silenced survivors” at the Peacock Network. The group has also organized protests outside the network’s New York City headquarters.

“Current and former NBCUniversal employees have courageously put their livelihoods on the line to demand change and accountability. UltraViolet and our 1.2 million members have their backs, and we are proud to say that Senator Cory Booker, Senator Kamala Harris, Senator Bernie Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren have their backs too,” UltraViolet executive director Shaunna Thomas said.

Oppenheim, who is Lack’s top deputy, has been widely criticized for his role in the handling of the Weinstein and Lauer sexual harassment scandals. He is painted as a key figure in NBC’s decision not to run Ronan Farrow’s award-winning report that exposed Weinstein as a sexual predator throughout his book “Catch and Kill.”

Oppenheim famously told Farrow that his Weinstein reporting wasn’t fit to print, so Farrow took it to The New Yorker, where it won the Pulitzer Prize and helped launch the #MeToo movement. Farrow’s book details his version of why NBC refused to expose Weinstein – which includes allegations that the disgraced movie mogul leveraged the knowledge of Lauer’s own misconduct.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI PUBLICLY SUPPORTED NEWS VET BROKAW AMID MISCONDUCT CLAIMS, PRIVATELY APOLOGIZED

“Everyone on the side of survivors has a role to play in using their influence to push Comcast and NBC to do the right thing. The DNC has leverage as a critical media partner in the 2020 election and they owe it to survivors to use it,” Thomas added.

The letter said Democrats must offer an alternative to President Trump but “can not do that when we prop up and support companies that have systematically covered up numerous incidents of sexual violence with no accountability or changes of leadership.”

The letter, signed by Booker, Harris, Sanders and Warren, concludes by saying it is “critical that the Democratic National Committee make clear that they support survivors of sexual harassment and abuse by ensuring that Comcast and NBC News take steps to clean up the toxic culture that exists across their networks.”

NBCUniversal’s liberal cable news network, MSNBC, is scheduled to host a presidential debate in Atlanta on Wednesday."

But two new public opinion surveys in South Carolina – the first Southern state to vote in the race for the White House - shows the former vice president holding a large lead over his rivals for the Democratic nomination.

Biden – he has deep ties to South Carolina -- stands at 33 percent among likely Democratic primary voters in the Palmetto State, according to a Quinnipiac University survey released Monday. Warren, the Massachusetts senator, is a distant second – at 13 percent -- with Sanders at 11 percent and Buttigieg at 6 percent.

BUTTIGIEG WEBSITES ON 'BLACK AMERICA' PLANS USED SEVERAL STOCK PHOTOS

And Biden stands at 36 percent among likely South Carolina Democratic primary voters in a University of South Florida survey, with Sanders and Warren tied for second at just 10 percent.

“Unlike tight races in Iowa and New Hampshire, South Carolina has a clear front-runner in the Democratic primary,” Quinnipiac University polling analyst Mary Snow said. “Former Vice President Joe Biden has broad based appeal, with particularly strong leads among black and moderate/conservative voters.”

Hedge-fund manager turned billionaire environment and progressive grassroots advocate Tom Steyer stands at 5 percent in the poll, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 4 percent, Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 3 percent, and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey at 2 percent. Everyone else in the large field of Democratic White House hopefuls registers at 1 percent or less.

Among black voters – a majority of Democratic presidential primary voters in South Carolina – Biden stands at 44 percent. Sanders, the Vermont senator, is second at 10 percent, with everyone else registering in single digits.

THE LATEST 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN POLLS FROM FOX NEWS

The poll indicates Biden’s the most favorably viewed of all the candidates, with a 71 percent-18 percent favorable-unfavorable rating. The former vice president’s plus-53 net favorability rating is 17 points higher than Sanders and 22 points higher than Warren.

The poll’s release comes days after former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick jumped into the race, and amid speculation that former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg is poised to launch a presidential bid.

Snow noted that Patrick “has his work cut out for him in introducing himself to voters. Nearly 8 in 10 likely voters say they haven't heard enough about Patrick to form an opinion of him.”

“More likely voters are familiar with Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor contemplating a run, as roughly 5 in 10 haven't heard enough -- but voters that have an opinion view him more unfavorably than favorably,"" she added.

And Snow pointed out that “where South Carolina is similar to other early states: choices are not set in stone. Roughly 4 in 10 of likely Democratic primary voters say their minds are made up.”

BUTTIGIEG SURGES TO THE TOP IN A NEW IOWA POLL

The Quinnipiac poll was conducted Nov. 13 through Sunday, with 768 likely South Carolina Democratic primary voters questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s margin of error is plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.

The Public Opinion Research Lab at the University of North Florida poll was conducted Nov. 5-13, with 436 likely Palmetto State state Democratic primary voters questioned by live telephone operators. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 4.7 percentage points.

Steyer was in fourth place - at 8 percent - in the poll - with Harris at 4 percent. Buttigieg stood at 3 percent, and Booker at 2 percent, with everyone else at 1 percent or less.

According to a Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll released Tuesday, Buttigieg grabbed the support of 25 percent of likely Democratic presidential primary voters in New Hampshire. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of neighboring Massachusetts were tied for second – with each at 15 percent.

The survey indicated Sen. Bernie Sanders of neighboring Vermont – who crushed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire’s 2016 presidential primary – at 9 percent.

BUTTIGIEG WEBSITES ON 'BLACK AMERICA' PLANS USED STOCK PHOTOS OF MINORITIES

Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota registered at 6 percent in the poll, with billionaire environmental and progressive advocate and grassroots organizer Tom Steyer at 5 percent. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii each were at 3 percent and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang was at 2 percent. Everyone else tested in the survey stood at 1 percent or less.

The 37-year old Buttigieg – the youngest candidate in the large field of White House hopefuls – was once seen as the longest of long-shots for the nomination, but he surged in the spring to middle-tier status and he’s soared this autumn to reach the top-tier of contenders. He’s skyrocketed 15 percentage points since the previous Saint Anselm College poll, which was conducted in September.

Warren’s plunged 10 points since the previous poll, with Biden nose-diving 9 points.

“With less than three months before the primary, the race for New Hampshire’s Democratic delegates is still in a great deal of flux,” New Hampshire Institute of Politics Executive Director Neil Levesque highlighted.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

He’s not kidding. A Quinnipiac University Poll in New Hampshire conducted earlier this month indicated Biden at 20 percent, with Warren at 16 percent, Buttigieg at 15 percent and Sanders at 14 percent. And, a University of New Hampshire-CNN poll conducted late last month showed Sanders at 21 percent, Warren at 18 percent, Biden at 15 percent and Buttigieg at 10 percent.

Levesque emphasized that in the Saint Anselm poll, “Buttigieg’s bump is driven by the favorable impression he’s made on voters, with 76 percent having a favorable impression of him versus only 11 percent unfavorable.”

Buttigieg’s net favorability of 65 percent easily bested his top rivals for the nomination.

But, the reputation of New Hampshire voters as late deciders was reflected in the survey. Thirteen percent said they remained undecided and of those who were backing a candidate, only 36 percent said they were firm in their choices. If voters do change their minds, Warren may benefit. She topped the list for second choice, at 23 percent.

The poll’s release came with two and a half months until the Iowa caucuses kick off the presidential nominating calendar, followed eight days later by the New Hampshire primary.

A Des Moines Register-CNN-Mediacom poll released this past Saturday indicated Buttigieg at 25 percent among likely Iowa Democratic presidential caucus-goers, with Warren at 16 percent, and Biden and Sanders at 15 percent. A Monmouth University survey also conducted earlier this month showed Buttigieg with a single-digit advantage over his top rivals in the Hawkeye State.

The Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll was conducted November 13-18, with 255 likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s sampling of error was plus or minus 6.1 percentage points.

The poll's release came days after former Gov. Deval Patrick, D-Mass., jumped into the presidential nomination race. He stood at less than 1 percent support in the New Hampshire primary.

The poll also indicated over three-quarters of those questioned said they would discourage former New York City mayor and billionaire business and media mogul Mike Bloomberg from launching a bid.

Sanders is making his second straight White House run. His campaign highlighted that the candidate didn’t reach the 4 million individuals milestone in the 2016 cycle until after February’s New Hampshire primary, which is still more nearly three months away.

Sanders, though, didn’t announce his 2016 bid until late April 2015. This time around, Sanders launched his presidential campaign in February of 2019, two months ahead of his 2016 schedule.

Sanders – like his progressive rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts – is relying on small-dollar grassroots donations to fuel his campaign. He hauled in $25.3 million in the July-September third quarter of fundraising, more than any other Democratic White House hopeful. That haul was powered by some 1.4 million contributions.

Sanders’ donor announcement came on the eve of Wednesday’s fifth-round Democratic presidential nomination debate, which will be held in Atlanta."

But fellow Democrats seem to be hinting his stand againt legalizing marijuana may be outdated too.

The latest pushback came Sunday night, when Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., tweeted that “Marijuana should be legalized, and drug consumption should be decriminalized. These are matters of public health.”

AOC's Twitter post -- which mirrored the pro-pot stands of Sen. Bernie Sanders, whom she supports for president, as well as Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker and others running for the party's 2020 nomination -- came a day after Biden told a town hall audience in Las Vegas that he still hasn’t seen enough evidence that marijuana is not a gateway drug, so he can't yet back legalizing weed.

""It's a debate, and I want a lot more [data] before I legalize it nationally,"" Biden said, according to Business Insider. ""I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it.""

""It's a debate, and I want a lot more [data] before I legalize it nationally. I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it."" — Joe Biden

Sanders said Oct. 24 he would legalize the drug by executive order within the first 100 days of his administration should he win the White House, Fox News reported.



SANDERS INTRODUCES PLAN TO LEGALIZE MARIJUANA NATIONWIDE DURING FIRST 100 DAYS IN OFFICE



Last year, Sanders' home state of Vermont legalized possession of one ounce of pot and letting each adult resident grow two plants for personal use. He has long been a supporter of decriminalizing marijuana nationwide and argued criminalization of the drug has ravaged communities of color and created an unequal incarceration rate.



""Too many lives were ruined due to the disastrous criminalization of marijuana,” Sanders wrote in a tweet announcing his plan.

Biden, however, spoke in favor of a more cautious approach. He said states should be able to legalize marijuana if they want but added he wouldn’t overturn federal law right away.



In addition, he supports medical marijuana and believes possession of the substance ""should not be a crime,"" the Business Insider report said.



Much of Biden’s 40-year Senate career took place during the federal government's War on Drugs, which included harsh criminal penalties for nonviolent drug users, Business Insider reported.



The former vice president also said in a June campaign speech that he supported expunging past convictions for possession.

But contrary to Biden's Las Vegas comments, several national organizations say there is no solid evidence to support the claim that using marijuana leads to the use of harder drugs, the report said. A 1999 Institute of Medicine report said marijuana ""typically precedes rather than follows initiation of other illicit drug use,"" but it ""does not appear to be a gateway drug to the extent that it is the cause or even that it is the most significant predictor of serious drug abuse; that is, care must be taken not to attribute cause to association.""



The National Institute on Drug Abuse says that research shows ""the majority of people who use marijuana do not go on to use other, 'harder' substances,"" and drug use can be affected by numerous other biological and environmental factors, the report continued.



The majority of current candidates openly support nationwide legalization.



Ten states and the District of Columbia already have legalized recreational marijuana, with only nine states where the drug remains fully illegal. Most states either have decriminalized it or have allowed it to be sold for medical uses.

A recent Gallup poll found 66 percent of Americans support fully legalizing marijuana, almost double the number from 2005 when only 35 percent supported the move.



The sentiment across the country has been reflected among the 2020 Democrats with all supporting at least some form of legalization or decriminalization of the drug.



While Sanders became the first candidate to lay out an extensive plan for legalizing marijuana, fellow candidates Warren and Booker as well as Sen. Kamala Harris of California have supported the Marijuana Justice Act. Introduced by Booker, the legislation would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act and expunge existing cannabis-related criminal records."

IMPEACHMENT PROBE DRAWS IN TRUMP’S ANSWERS TO MUELLER

NYT: “Impeachment investigators are exploring whether President Trump lied in his written answers to Robert S. Mueller III during the Russia investigation, a lawyer for the House told a federal appeals court on Monday, raising the prospect of bringing an additional basis for a Senate trial over whether to remove Mr. Trump. … During the Mueller investigation, Mr. Trump refused to testify orally about what he knew and did during the 2016 campaign in relation to Russia’s election interference operation, or his later efforts to impede the special counsel’s inquiry. But he did provide lawyerly written answers to some questions, which were appended to the Mueller report. On Monday, Douglas Letter, the general counsel for the House, told a federal appeals court panel that impeachment investigators have an ‘immense’ need to see the grand jury evidence — redacted portions of the Mueller report, as well as the underlying testimony transcripts they came from — because Mr. Trump may have lied.”



Ukrainian president reportedly felt the pressure long before Trump’s squeeze - AP: “Despite his denials, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was feeling pressure from the Trump administration to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden before his July phone call with President Donald Trump that has led to impeachment hearings. In early May, staff at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, including then-Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, were briefed on a meeting Zelenskiy held in which he sought advice on how to navigate the difficult position he was in, according to two people with knowledge of the briefings. He was concerned that Trump and associates were pressing him to take action that could affect the 2020 U.S. presidential race, the people said. They spoke only on condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic and political sensitivity of the issue.”



Trump defenders’ new stance: The quid pro quo failed - NYT: “House Republicans, bracing for another week of impeachment hearings, asserted on Sunday that President Trump had done nothing wrong because his plans for Ukraine to investigate his political rivals never came to fruition… [L]awmakers are about to hear from crucial witnesses who had direct contact with the president, including Gordon D. Sondland, a donor to and an ally of Mr. Trump who served as his liaison to Ukrainian officials while the president withheld — but later released — $391 million in military aid to Ukraine. … On Sunday, Chris Wallace, the host of ‘Fox News Sunday,’ pressed Representative Steve Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, on that point, asking him whether Mr. Sondland might ‘blow a hole’ in Republicans’ defense. ‘The president’s defense is that those things didn’t happen,’ Mr. Scalise said, adding: ‘The real bottom line is he got the money. Ukraine got the money.’”



In a murky sea of disinformation and bias, voters tune out - NYT: “The Democrats in Congress took their case against President Trump to the public last week. But after hours of testimony, thousands of news reports and days of streaming headlines, one thing was clear: A lot of Americans weren’t listening. … In this volatile political moment, information, it would seem, has never been more crucial. The country is in the midst of impeachment proceedings against a president for the third time in modern history. A high-stakes election is less than a year away. But just when information is needed most, to many Americans it feels most elusive. The rise of social media; the proliferation of information online, including news designed to deceive; and a flood of partisan news are leading to a general exhaustion with news itself. Add to that a president with a documented record of regularly making false statements and the result is a strange new normal: Many people are numb and disoriented, struggling to discern what is real in a sea of slant, fake and fact.”



Trump reportedly vexed by Pompeo’s failure to rein in diplomats - NBC News: “The impeachment inquiry has created the first rift between President Donald Trump and the Cabinet member who has been his closest ally, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to four current and former senior administration officials. Trump has fumed for weeks that Pompeo is responsible for hiring State Department officials whose congressional testimony threatens to bring down his presidency, the officials said. The president confronted Pompeo about the officials – and what he believed was a lackluster effort by the secretary of state to block their testimony – during lunch at the White House on Oct. 29, those familiar with the matter said. Inside the White House, the view was that Trump ‘just felt like, ‘rein your people in,’’ a senior administration official said. Trump particularly blames Pompeo for tapping Ambassador Bill Taylor in June to be the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, the current and former senior administration officials said.”

TIME OUT: FITTED FOR A QUEEN

Atlantic: “Clothes, in [the Netflix series] The Crown, have always been part of the aesthetic pleasure the show provides viewers—a crucial element of the absurd spectacle that is royalist Britain… And yet, watching Season 3 [released Nov. 17], [The Atlantic’s Sophie Gilbert noticed] more than ever how the series uses clothing to explore and subvert ideas about power, and what it looks like when a woman wields it. … [Queen Elizabeth’s] gender, and her femininity, are intrinsic to the way she governs.… In reality, as in the show, the Queen’s deployment of pastel colors and pearls isn’t just a matter of personal taste. Since her coronation in 1953, when the Queen requested that her gown for the event be embroidered with symbols from countries in the British Commonwealth … every outfit she’s worn has been worn with intention. Clothing, for the Queen, is much more about diplomacy and visibility than style.”

BUTTI-BOOM, BUTTI-BING

Des Moines Register: “Pete Buttigieg has rocketed to the top of the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll in the latest reshuffling of the top tier of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. Since September, Buttigieg has risen 16 percentage points among Iowa’s likely Democratic caucusgoers, with 25% now saying he is their first choice for president. For the first time in the Register’s Iowa Poll, he bests rivals Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who are now clustered in competition for second place and about 10 percentage points behind the South Bend, Indiana, mayor. Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, led the September Iowa Poll, when 22% said she was their first choice. In this poll, her support slips to 16%. Former Vice President Biden, who led the Register’s first three Iowa Polls of the 2020 caucus cycle, has continued to slide, falling 5 percentage points to 15%. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, also garners 15% — a 4 percentage point rise.”



Biden strikes cautious tone on pot - WaPo: “On the question of marijuana, former vice president Joe Biden might seem out of step with the crowd. … But the 76-year-old Democrat is in tune with at least one demographic: his peers in the silent generation, who, at 35 percent, have what may be one of the lowest percentages of support for marijuana legalization, according to the Pew data released Nov. 14. This disparity on the topic came into full view at a town hall in Las Vegas over the weekend, when Biden drew some groans from the crowd by saying he wants to see more research on marijuana and suggesting that it may be a ‘gateway drug’ that can lead users to harsher substances.”



Harry Reid credits Biden’s Nevada success to minority appeal - AP: “Iowa and New Hampshire get to weigh in first on the Democratic presidential contest next year, but the states are not ethnically diverse enough to offer any insight into how a candidate will fare across the country, former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Sunday. … Reid said he thinks that former Vice President Joe Biden has appeared strong in Nevada because he ‘is one that appeals to diversity,’ but he added that most of the other Democrats running can also appeal to diverse groups.”



As Harris craters, blame game ramps up - Politico: “Kamala Harris’ campaign is careening toward a crackup. As the California senator crisscrosses the country trying to revive her sputtering presidential bid, aides at her fast-shrinking headquarters are deep into the finger-pointing stages. And much of the blame is being placed on campaign manager Juan Rodriguez. … The internal strife is the latest discouraging development for Harris’ once-encouraging candidacy. She has slid into low single digits and is now banking on a top-tier performance in Iowa to pull her back into contention. Inside the campaign, which had already experienced staff shakeups before the layoffs, rank and file aides are fed up with the weak leadership and uncertainty around internal communication, planning and executing on a clear vision. They say the constant shifting has eroded trust in the upper ranks.”



Pressure rises at home for speedy exit - Politico: “Harris’ loyal activist base, who call themselves the K-Hive, have lost none of the passion and intensity from those early days. … But in the halls and meeting rooms of the Long Beach Convention Center, many of the battle-scarred Democratic insiders — strategists, elected officials, campaign operatives — had a far more caustic view of her chances, suggesting that Harris’ team has already let slip away her shot at the White House. With California polls strongly suggesting she might not win, place — or even show — in her home state, many privately expressed the view that Harris should begin seriously considering leaving the race to avoid total embarrassment in the state’s early March primary. Her continued weakness in the presidential contest could even have a more damaging effect, several said — encouraging a primary challenger in 2022, when Harris is up for reelection.”



Warren’s Medicare hedge does little to quell doubts - WaPo: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has been mostly sure-footed in her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. One exception is health care. On Friday, she issued another proposal to go along with her support for Medicare-for-all, a step that appeared designed to put her into a safer place politically. Warren’s progression on health care through the course of the campaign has taken her from a position of flexibility to one of seeming inflexibility — at least until Friday. Over a period of months, she walked herself into a place that many Democrats feared could make her chances of winning a general election more, not less, difficult. Whether Friday’s turn alleviates those worries remains to be seen.”



Younger voters still dig Bernie - WBUR: “Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders remains the top choice for young likely voters, coming in at 28% in the [Harvard Institute of Politics poll of voters under age 30]. That's down 3 percentage points since the spring. The 78-year-old Sanders has long had strong support among the under-30 set. [Twenty-two percent of likely 18- to 29-year-old voters would choose Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic presidential primary. That’s up 18 points from her showing in March.] Another septuagenarian, former Vice President Joe Biden, comes in third in the Harvard survey, with the backing of 16% of likely voters. The youngest Democratic candidate, 37-year-old Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is fifth, at just 4%.”



Bloomberg continues apology tour - Fox News: “Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has yet to formally announce whether he will run for president in 2020, but during remarks where he looked to the future before a majority-black church in Brooklyn, he apologized for his controversial ‘stop and frisk’ policy that sowed distrust of police in black and Latino communities during his administration. That policy, which was later repealed, allowed police to stop individuals on the street and briefly question and frisk them if they had reasonable suspicion that the person may be committing, had committed or is about to commit a crime. During his Sunday speech, Bloomberg recognized that this led to ‘far too many innocent people’ being stopped, many of them black or Latino. ‘I got something important wrong. I got something important really wrong.’”



Lefties see conspiracy behind Patrick, Bloomberg runs - Politico: “Democratic donors say they want Michael Bloomberg and Deval Patrick to run for president because they’re petrified that a left-wing candidate can’t defeat President Donald Trump. But progressives see a more sinister effort afoot. Aides and allies to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, among other liberals, perceive the eleventh-hour campaign launched last week by Patrick — and the prospect of an impending Bloomberg 2020 bid — as an attempt to crush an ascendant left wing that would expand government more than any other Democratic president in decades. In their view, Patrick and Bloomberg are stalking horses for moderate Democrats, high-dollar contributors and bundlers desperate to halt the momentum of the economic populists at the top of the polls — and regain control of the party levers.”



Can anyone break the Coolidge curse? - NYT: “Voters have never elected a sitting mayor to the presidency. Americans have seldom embraced anyone who’s even touched the job. Calvin Coolidge was the last president, one of just three in 230 years, to have been a mayor at any point. He led Northampton, Mass. – a modest town, really – for two years. But as the Democratic Party becomes ever more aligned with urban areas, its presidential field is now studded with politicians whose boasts include running a city. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has now jumped to the lead in Iowa polling. Also in the race are two recent mayors, Julián Castro and Cory Booker, and another candidate who got his start as a mayor, Bernie Sanders. The current New York mayor, Bill de Blasio, and a former Denver mayor, John Hickenlooper, have already come and gone, while Michael Bloomberg, another New York mayor, is still calculating on the sidelines.”



TRUMP CRAPS OUT ON GUBERNATORIAL GAMBLES

Politico: “President Donald Trump campaigned hard in three conservative Southern states this fall, aiming for a string of gubernatorial wins that would demonstrate his political strength heading into impeachment and his own reelection effort. The plan backfired in dramatic fashion. The latest black eye came on Saturday, when Trump's favored candidate in Louisiana, multimillionaire businessman Eddie Rispone, went down to defeat. The president went all-in, visiting the state three times, most recently on Thursday. Earlier this month, Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin lost reelection after a similar presidential effort on his behalf. Of the candidates Trump backed, only Tate Reeves in Mississippi won. The losses raise questions about Trump’s standing as he heads into what will be a grueling 2020 campaign. By throwing himself into the three contests — each in states that Trump won by double-digits in 2016 — the president had hoped to gain a modicum of political momentum at a perilous moment of his presidency.”

DEEP YOGURT

USA Today: “[Patricia] Larkin, of Lacey, New Jersey, said in the Facebook group ‘Lacey Township Chatter’ that she was grocery shopping with her infant when a woman told a cashier that her baby was fake and an attempt to ‘smuggle yogurts out of the store.’ Larkin, despite being fatigued from staying up nights with her 2-month-old daughter, responded to the accusation with humor. She posted a picture of herself smiling while holding her sleeping baby in front of the store's sign. ‘Thank you for the laugh,’ she wrote in the Facebook group. ‘1) My baby is 100% real. 2) Yogurts are like $.25 at Aldi. 3) I'm lactose intolerant and don't consume any dairy at all.’ Larkin said a similarly amused cashier told her about the woman's accusation, by which time, her infant daughter was crying and fussing like only a real baby could.”

So why don't they ditch primaries, too?",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/democrats-electoral-college-primaries-david-avella,"While South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg is enjoying a surge in the polls in Iowa, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has consistently shown staying power nationally to remain the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. However, before she declares victory and announces its time to focus on the general election, here is an obvious question for her. If she is so convinced that a national popular vote is how we should elect the president of the United States in the general election, why don't Democrats hold a national primary to select their presidential nominee?

At the core of Warren’s plans for America is the end of the Electoral College. She wants to replace it with a national popular vote.

She is hardly alone among Democrats. Day after day, we are treated to Democrats decrying the Electoral College as being unfair, as being wrong, as being something that gives too much-undeserved power to voters in less populated states.

LIZ PEEK: SCHIFF STEERS TRUMP IMPEACHMENT DRIVE STRAIGHT TOWARD A DITCH — HERE'S WHAT'S NEXT

However, when one examines the arcane and near-mystical process the Democrats have chosen to determine their nominee for president of the United States, one would be hard-pressed to conclude anything other than that Democrats are unwilling to put their money where their mouths are.

It would seem to be a pretty simple matter to switch to a national primary where whoever receives the most votes is declared the winner. Why don’t Democrats do that?

One concern could be that with multiple candidates vying for the party’s nomination, one of them could prevail with less than a majority of the votes. That is surely so. Would not that same logic apply to anytime there was a strong third-party candidate?

We did not hear Democrats in 1992, 2000 or any other time arguing that only the votes of the two major-party candidates should count in the presidential tally to ensure the winner has earned a majority of the votes.

In 2016, when Hillary Clinton prevailed over Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., it is pretty clear the Democratic National Committee (DNC) put more than a thumb on the scale to all but assure that she prevailed.

If you go back to the last truly contested race for the Democratic Party nomination, in 2008, the process used might startle you. Suffice it to say, it was a little different than one man, one vote.

Florida and Michigan did not hold their primaries on the days the DNC deemed proper, so their votes were treated in a different fashion than those cast by voters in states bowing to the DNC. They did not even count the popular vote from Michigan (where President Obama did not have his name on the ballot). Eventually, the decision was made to split the delegate vote evenly in these two states, despite Clinton having defeated Obama soundly in Florida where both names were on the ballot.

It gets weirder. Democrats abroad, including those in American Samoa, Guam and the Virgin Islands had delegates who each received a half vote. Would it not just have been easier to have them cut the number of delegates in half?

At the end of the day, if you include the votes cast in Michigan, Hillary Clinton received 48.1 percent and Barack Obama 47.4 percent. Really close.

When delegates selected via primary and caucus were totaled up, neither candidate had enough to win at the convention.

So, just how did the Democrats resolve this tricky and difficult situation? Why, they turned to their consiglieres, otherwise known as super delegates. These are elected officials, party officials, etc.

In other words, an elitist class established to fix problems when the electorate gets out of hand. The super delegates overwhelmingly sided with Obama, and he became the nominee.

Fast forward to 2020. The Democrats are still holding a series of primaries, conventions, and caucuses. Fully 16 percent of the delegates will do nothing more than wake up in the morning and be designated as such. No longer are they called “super delegates.” These folks are now “automatic delegates,” as though they are granted divine intervention powers.

In other words, it’s more of the same old, same old. You do not even hear a murmur that this process should be replaced by a national primary.

The conclusion here is pretty simple. If the Democrats think a straight-up election with a winner-take-all outcome in the general election for president is right and good enough for the nation, they ought to at least demonstrate the pretense of the courage of their convictions and apply that standard to themselves.

Until that day comes to pass, Americans will have to accept that their posturing on the Electoral College is just that… posturing.

In addition, he has not been straightforward about his dealings with the whistleblower, who initially was pivotal to charges against the president but who is now deemed inconsequential by Schiff.

It is common knowledge that the initial complaint was launched by a Democrat with ties to President Trump’s adversaries. That revelation has sucked even more legitimacy from the investigation.

As a result of these several missteps, the public is wary of what has emerged as an obviously partisan attack on a duly elected president. Worse, they are also, already, bored and, we’re not even in the home stretch.

If Americans turn against the impeachment effort, they will punish Democrats for not attending to other, more important, priorities. Let’s face it, impeaching the president will not make our roads better or lower drug costs.

Adding to the public’s ennui is that the resolution of the impeachment is a foregone conclusion. It’s like Agatha Christie revealing whodunit in Chapter One; it steals the story’s punch.

We know Democrats will press forward with their tiresome questioning and posturing, hoping to convince the nation that the hearings are something bigger and nobler than a political stunt. They will vote to impeach; that has always been a foregone conclusion.

The carnival will then move to the Senate, which will ultimately hold a trial and find the president not guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors. Democrats know this; they know there is no real purpose to their impeachment thrust but to undermine Mr. Trump before the 2020 campaign.

It's a risky way to win an election. If Americans turn against the impeachment effort, they will punish Democrats for not attending to other, more important, priorities. Let’s face it, impeaching the president will not make our roads better or lower drug costs.

Also, a partisan investigation will energize Trump supporters and drive turnout among Republicans.

Even the Trump-hating New York Times struggled to find much meaning in the impeachment proceedings. In their coverage of the first day of hearings, reporter Peter Baker was reduced to glorifying star witness and diplomat William Taylor’s appearance: “the image, at least, of a wise, fatherly figure” with a “chiseled face and reassuring gray hair” whose “deep baritone voice [was] reminiscent of Walter Cronkite.” Channeling Gregory Peck apparently enhances Taylor’s credibility.

The liberal media did hyperventilate over Taylor’s “new” revelation that someone on his staff “asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine.” Sondland, according to the aide, according to Taylor, said the president “cares more about the investigations of Bidens.” In other words, third-hand hearsay.

Disappointing to Democrats, Taylor refused to climb aboard the impeachment train. Moreover, that Taylor had never once met with or talked to President Trump undermined the impact of his testimony, notwithstanding his admirable elocution.

To be sure, it is clear that Taylor disapproved of President Trump’s reportedly tying $391 million in aid to Kiev to an investigation into possible misdeeds by Joe Biden and his son Hunter. He said that holding up that assistance for political purposes is wrong. It is unclear what Taylor thought of President Obama’s steadfast refusal to authorize that much-needed help during his administration.

Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who was sent back to the United States because the White House heard she was openly critical of the president, was not even in the Ukraine when the events under review took place. The president is entitled to have representatives in foreign countries who are on his team. End of story.

Taylor, Yovanovitch and other witnesses, including the still missing-in-action whistleblower, have no first-hand evidence that Trump threatened to withhold aid in exchange for an investigation into the Bidens. That is still a critical missing link.

As the inquiry drags on, more Americans will tune out. The TV audience on the first day of the Schiff show was far less than the number who watched the confirmation hearings for now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh or even Michael Cohen’s testimony.

Schiff himself was tweeting his followers to watch in an embarrassing effort to gin up enthusiasm. The audience will shrink further.

Democratic candidates slugging it out in Iowa and New Hampshire are rarely asked about impeachment. Instead, voters ask about health care and other issues; campaigners are struggling to explain how they are rewarding voters for giving their party the majority in the House.

Some of those candidates will soon view the impeachment drive as an even bigger threat. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris, Michael Bennet and Cory Booker – all 2020 candidates – will have to participate in the eventual Senate trial. That means they will have to sit in the Senate day after day, while rivals like Joe Biden and Mayor Pete Buttigieg run circles around them on the campaign trail.

It is almost inconceivable that Democrats have allowed Adam Schiff to play ringmaster for this circus. As a major author of the Russia collusion narrative, Schiff was already reviled on the right.

As he leads his own party down the impeachment rabbit hole, Schiff may come under fire from Democrats as well, and especially from those senators trying to win the primaries.

And let’s not forget the damage Schiff has done to front-runner Joe Biden. After all, the one critical part of the Ukraine story that is regurgitated with each telling is that Biden’s son Hunter monetized his father’s unique status not only in Kiev but also in China. That has soiled the former vice president’s candidacy.

The hearings are not over but it is hard to see today how impeachment will prove a winner for Democrats. Nancy Pelosi should have stuck to her guns, and never let this process move forward, and especially with Adam Schiff at the helm.

On the roster: What would Buttigieg’s path look like? - As impeachment grinds on, voters dig in - Congress kicks can on spending until Dec. 20 - Audible: Audible, indeed - Three wise guys wanted for questioning



WHAT WOULD BUTTIGIEG’S PATH LOOK LIKE?

FiveThirtyEight: “[If Pete Buttigieg] winds up pulling disproportionately from [Elizabeth Warren], it could make for a more complicated race. A world where Buttigieg wins both Iowa and New Hampshire is one where Warren will have finished second (or worse) in two early states that, on paper, look tailor-made for her. The underwhelming performances could drain her support among two key elements of her base — wonky-but-not-ideological college-educated whites, who could switch to Buttigieg, and devoted progressives, who could switch to [Bernie Sanders]. In fact, the Selzer poll already showed signs that Iowa liberals were leaving Warren for Sanders; if that happens nationwide, the Democratic primary could exit Super Tuesday as a three-way race between [Joe Biden] as the candidate of nonwhite voters, Buttigieg as the candidate of party elites and Sanders as the candidate of the left.”



Dems turn to big donors to blunt Trump’s early cash advantage - WaPo: “Democratic groups financed by wealthy donors have ratcheted up their spending in recent weeks as party operatives have become concerned that President Trump is gaining an insurmountable lead in the money race. By the time voters coalesce around a nominee, Democratic operatives worry, it will be too late to overcome Trump’s fundraising advantages in the general election. Already, pro-Trump committees have spent more than $500 million on his reelection — far more than previous incumbents at this point in the election. As a result, more than a dozen groups backed by high-dollar Democratic donors have pledged to spend at least $420 million through the primary season, focused largely on general-election swing states. Their efforts range from running anti-Trump digital ads to funding legal challenges to voter restriction that could hamper Democratic turnout.”



New debate threshold squeezes also-rans - Politico: “New thresholds announced by the Democratic National Committee for the sixth debate — which will be hosted by POLITICO and PBS on Dec. 19 in Los Angeles — represent only a modest step up from the criteria for the next debate in November. But they could still seriously endanger the participation of all but the top five candidates. To make the December debate, candidates must hit 4 percent support in at least four DNC-approved polls of primary voters nationally or in early voting states (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina) — or, instead, they can qualify by hitting 6 percent in two approved early state polls. Candidates must also bring in donations from 200,000 unique donors, with a minimum of 800 donors in 20 states, territories or Washington, D.C. … The new thresholds will put pressure on Democratic candidates outside a top five – Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris – who have routinely polled above 4 percent in approved surveys so far.”



Dems try to manipulate moderators - NBC News: “The Democratic National Committee and the news organization Politico are locked in an argument over the ideological credentials of a proposed moderator for next month's Democratic debate… Politico and PBS are scheduled to co-host the sixth Democratic primary debate on Dec. 19 in Los Angeles. At the behest of its publisher, Robert Allbritton, Politico is pushing for Tim Alberta, the chief political correspondent for Politico Magazine… The top PBS journalists under consideration are Judy Woodruff, Yamiche Alcindor and Amna Nawaz. Politico’s decision to push for Alberta has rankled officials at the DNC… The reason: Alberta previously wrote for National Review, a conservative magazine, and has spent the bulk of his recent career chronicling the Republican Party. Democratic Party officials say such a journalist is ill-suited to co-moderate a debate meant to better inform Democratic voters about their potential nominees.”



Sanders hits 4 million donations mark - Fox News: “…[When] it comes to donations to his campaign, the longtime progressive lawmaker and populist champion from Vermont is in a league of his own, far ahead of his 2020 rivals. Sanders’ campaign announced on Tuesday morning that it's now received more than 4 million individual contributions from people across the country, making the senator the fastest candidate in history to reach the fundraising mark. ‘Working-class Americans across the country are chipping in $3, $18, $27, or whatever they can to help elect Bernie Sanders because they know he is the only candidate who will fight for them and take on corporate greed and corruption,’ campaign manager Faiz Shakir touted. ‘This is what momentum looks like.’”



Columbia, S.C. mayor backs Bloomberg - AP: “Before he’s officially a presidential candidate, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is picking up a key endorsement in South Carolina. Steve Benjamin, the mayor of Columbia, told The Associated Press on Monday that he’s ready to back the billionaire if he decides to seek the Democratic presidential nomination. ‘He’s got what it takes and he’s got the resources to take it to Trump,’ Benjamin said in an interview. ‘I believe firmly that Mike Bloomberg can win. I think resources are going to matter.’ First elected in 2010, Benjamin is one of South Carolina’s highest-profile black politicians and was among the candidates to be Hillary Clinton’s running mate in 2016.”



Dems pleased with field, still open to changing horses - NPR: “On the 2020 presidential contest, 69% of Democrats say they're happy with the field. Less than a quarter say they're not. Three-quarters of Democrats also say they still haven't made up their minds on who to vote for, down only 7 points since July, the last time the question was asked in the survey. The survey also asked a battery of candidate qualities that would make a voter most ‘enthusiastic’ to vote for that person. Being a woman is the most desirable quality in a candidate among all registered voters. But there were big differences by party. Democrats would be most ‘enthusiastic’ about voting for a woman, someone who is gay or lesbian, or someone under 40. The top three qualities for Republicans, on the other hand: a business executive, a white man or a woman.”



THE RULEBOOK: HOUSE PARTY

“The number of which the House of Representatives is to consist, forms another and a very interesting point of view, under which this branch of the federal legislature may be contemplated. Scarce any article, indeed, in the whole Constitution seems to be rendered more worthy of attention, by the weight of character and the apparent force of argument with which it has been assailed.” – Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, Federalist No. 55



TIME OUT: SEVEN SCORE AND 16 YEARS AGO

On this day in 1863, President Abraham Lincoln delivered what is probably the finest piece of American political oratory. Speaking for less than three minutes on a sunny fall afternoon in southern Pennsylvania, Lincoln set out the duty of every generation of Americans: “To preserve and prefect the promise of our founding. Those buried at Gettysburg had died in service of that aim. Will we honor their sacrifice by living for it? “It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”

AS IMPEACHMENT GRINDS ON, VOTERS DIG IN

NPR: “The country is witnessing one of only a handful of times in its history that Congress has gone through with public hearings on whether to impeach a president. And yet, the overwhelming majority of Americans across parties say nothing they hear in the inquiry will change their minds on impeachment, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. Half of Americans said they approve of the impeachment inquiry — about the same as the poll found last month. Respondents are also split on whether they think Trump should be impeached and removed from office. But 65% of Americans say they can't imagine any information or circumstances during the impeachment inquiry where they might change their minds about their position on impeachment. And 30% say yes, it's possible. … ‘We're really not seeing either a backlash or a positive,’ Barbara Carvalho, director of the Marist Poll, said of the impeachment inquiry. ‘What we're seeing is people just locking in.’”



Army colonel testifies about Trump demand - Fox News: “One of the witnesses, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official, also caused a dustup by acknowledging communications with an unnamed intelligence official during an at-times tense exchange with Republicans. Vindman acknowledged speaking with two people outside the White House about the July 25 call, including State Department official George Kent and the unnamed intelligence community official… Vindman, who reported his concerns about Trump's call to the NSC lawyer, described Trump's request as a ‘demand’ and told lawmakers he believed if Ukraine pursued the investigations, it ‘would be interpreted as a partisan play.’ He also emphasized that he reported his concerns ‘out of a sense of duty.’ Vindman said that since the July 25 phone call, he believes he has been ‘excluded’ from meetings at the White House that would have been appropriate for his position.”



Impeachment scrambles Senate strategies - Politico: “The Senate is increasingly likely to hold Trump’s trial in January, according to senators and aides, a reflection of Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s uncertain timeline in the House and the dismal prospects for finishing an impeachment trial in December. And pushing the trial into 2020 will bring uncertain fallout for both parties, heightening the intrigue of what will already be historic proceedings on the second floor of the Capitol. … Meanwhile, Republican senators will be in the opening of their own primary season for their reelection campaigns, in which special attention will be placed on their fealty to Trump and any whiff of independence during the trial. … Much is uncertain and out of the Senate’s direct control. No one drew up an impeachment inquiry with plans for a Senate trial in January 2020, and there’s no blueprint from past trials to draw from considering none happened in the heat of a campaign.”



CONGRESS KICKS CAN ON SPENDING UNTIL DEC. 20

Politico: “House and Senate leaders secured a deal on Monday afternoon that would extend government funding for four more weeks and sidestep a debilitating government-wide shutdown. The continuing resolution unveiled by House Democrats would last until Dec. 20, leaving out any restrictions on border barrier spending, which President Donald Trump demanded in exchange for his signature. The current stopgap expires Thursday night. The bill would fund a 3.1 percent military pay raise, it would provide extra cash to help the Commerce Department gear up for the 2020 census and it would allow state highway programs to avoid a $7.6 billion cut this summer. It also includes a number of health extenders and renews three expiring surveillance provisions through March. House Democrats, however, did not secure funding for historically black colleges and universities, an item among their requested policy riders.”



Pelosi hopes Trumka can calm freshmen’s jitters - Politico: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her top deputies are working to ease long-simmering anxiety among battleground freshmen, which has intensified amid fears that impeachment could creep into 2020 and make many of them one-term members. Pelosi will bring in AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka on Tuesday to speak with freshman Democrats, many of whom have been privately demanding quicker action on President Donald Trump’s trade deal, according to multiple people familiar with the meeting. The private huddle with the labor leader — at a make-or-break moment for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement — is an attempt to calm concerns of swing-district Democrats who fear their agenda isn’t breaking through with the public and are increasingly frustrated by policy stalemates in Washington.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Your snippet from The Atlantic article on The Crown concerning the Queen’s clothing refers to its being, along with her gender, ‘intrinsic to the way she governs.’ No British monarch has governed in well over a hundred years. As the series demonstrates in occasionally painful detail, there are two parts of the British constitution — the efficient and the dignified, represented respectively by the government and the monarch. The monarch functions primarily as the Head of State, a ceremonial position representing the nation’s stability, while the Prime Minister is the Head of Government, subject to the whims of the democratic electorate. In the U.S. both functions are performed by the President, while in parliamentary democracies like India, Austria, Germany, and Israel the President is the ceremonial Head of State.” – Bob Foys, Chicago



[Ed. note: First, Mr. Foys, let’s be clear that this is all Brianna’s fault… I kid, I kid! First, you are quite right about the distribution of duties in a constitutional monarchy. But second, I think we might be a little forgiving when it comes to the political word choices of fashion writers. I’m sure I’d make a terrible hash of clothing terminology if I was delving into the subject to make a political point. I’m more than happy to give the piece’s author, Sophie Gilbert, plenty of leeway in her genuinely interesting, thoughtful piece.]

THREE WISE GUYS WANTED FOR QUESTIONING

KWCH/AP: “Goddard [Kan.] police say the owners of a camel, cow and donkey found wandering the streets of the Wichita suburb have been located. They say the animals, which looked reminiscent of a ‘nativity scene getaway,’ as some called it, belong to an employee of the nearby Tanganyika Wildlife Park. A neighborhood in Goddard had three unusual visitors strolling through its streets on Sunday afternoon. … ‘Well we were just coming back from picking up a friend and came into the trailer park and the first thing we see is hey there's a cow, wait a minute, that’s a donkey, and that’s a camel and we had all three,’ said Trudy Wilcox. It was quite the sight, a cow, a donkey, and a camel walking through the neighborhood. … With Christmas lights already up on some homes, the three friends brought even more holiday spirit to the neighborhood.”

NBCUniversal and parent company Comcast have been accused of multiple abuses of power amid ongoing scandals related to Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer. UltraViolet, a leading national women’s organization, organized an effort for key 2020 Democratic hopefuls to address the issues with DNC chairman Tom Perez through a harshly worded letter obtained by Fox News.

NBC NEWS REPORTEDLY RENEWS NOAH OPPENHEIM’S CONTRACT, DRAWING OUTRAGE: 'STATUS QUO HAS BEEN BLESSED'

“We, the undersigned candidates, are very concerned about the message it would send to sexual assault survivors if our next debate is sponsored by MSNBC without clear commitments from Comcast, the parent company of NBC and MSNBC, to conduct an independent investigation into the toxic culture that enabled abusers and silenced survivors,” the letter begins.

After the Weinstein and Lauer bombshells were reported in 2017, NBC refused to hire an outside investigator to determine who knew about Lauer’s alleged sexual misconduct and whether NBC executives looked the other way. NBC relied on in-house general counsel Kim Harris despite widespread calls for an outside law firm to conduct the review.

NBC KILLED MY SEX ASSAULT STORY AFTER FARROW'S WEINSTEIN PIECE, AUTHOR CLAIMS

NBC eventually declared that management was completely oblivious to Lauer’s behavior and Harris’ high-powered colleagues were cleared by the network – but UltraViolet has vowed not to give up until an independent investigation is launched.

“NBC’s internal investigation last year ultimately concluded that because there were no formal complaints, NBC News executives were not at fault. Yet, there is clearly something wrong with a work environment reluctant to hold management accountable,” the letter said. “That's what allowed the behavior of powerful abusers inside the company to go unchecked. The troubling reports about management’s role to cover up abuse demonstrate that Comcast should have and needs to do more to shift the work culture and pursue significant structural changes in order to prevent future harassment and abuse at NBC and MSNBC. Until that happens, employees are at risk.”

MADDOW CELEBRATES NYT REPORTERS WHO EXPOSED WEINSTEIN SCANDAL, IGNORES HOW NBC SPIKED SAME STORY

UltraViolet has called for NBCUniversal to fire NBC News president Noah Oppenheim, MSNBC president Phil Griffin and “every other person in leadership that enabled abusers and silenced survivors” at the Peacock Network. The group has also organized protests outside the network’s New York City headquarters.

“Current and former NBCUniversal employees have courageously put their livelihoods on the line to demand change and accountability. UltraViolet and our 1.2 million members have their backs, and we are proud to say that Senator Cory Booker, Senator Kamala Harris, Senator Bernie Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren have their backs too,” UltraViolet executive director Shaunna Thomas said.

Oppenheim, who is Lack’s top deputy, has been widely criticized for his role in the handling of the Weinstein and Lauer sexual harassment scandals. He is painted as a key figure in NBC’s decision not to run Ronan Farrow’s award-winning report that exposed Weinstein as a sexual predator throughout his book “Catch and Kill.”

Oppenheim famously told Farrow that his Weinstein reporting wasn’t fit to print, so Farrow took it to The New Yorker, where it won the Pulitzer Prize and helped launch the #MeToo movement. Farrow’s book details his version of why NBC refused to expose Weinstein – which includes allegations that the disgraced movie mogul leveraged the knowledge of Lauer’s own misconduct.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI PUBLICLY SUPPORTED NEWS VET BROKAW AMID MISCONDUCT CLAIMS, PRIVATELY APOLOGIZED

“Everyone on the side of survivors has a role to play in using their influence to push Comcast and NBC to do the right thing. The DNC has leverage as a critical media partner in the 2020 election and they owe it to survivors to use it,” Thomas added.

The letter said Democrats must offer an alternative to President Trump but “can not do that when we prop up and support companies that have systematically covered up numerous incidents of sexual violence with no accountability or changes of leadership.”

The letter, signed by Booker, Harris, Sanders and Warren, concludes by saying it is “critical that the Democratic National Committee make clear that they support survivors of sexual harassment and abuse by ensuring that Comcast and NBC News take steps to clean up the toxic culture that exists across their networks.”

Elizabeth Warren's tax plan could create ""catastrophic economic consequences.""

“I don’t think that taxation approaching confiscatory is remotely feasible and, if it was tried, would have catastrophic economic consequences,” Summers, a former president of Harvard University, told CNBC.

Summers, who also was a former director of the National Economic Council under President Barack Obama, was the latest Democrat to express skepticism over proposals pushed by more progressive elements in the party.

“Essentially, what Sen. Warren’s plans would do, as I read them, is they go through every option that has been selected as the possible strategy for raising progressivity and tries to do them all of them at once,” Summers said. ""And when you try to do all of them at once, you're collecting essentially about as much taxes as the total after-tax AGI, adjusted gross income, of all the millionaires.""

OBAMA TAKES VEILED SHOT AT WARREN AND SANDERS, WARNS 2020 DEMS AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO 'TEAR DOWN THE SYSTEM'

Warren, D-Mass., previously proposed a two percent tax on wealth above $50 million as well as a three percent tax on wealth that surpassed $1 billion. That later changed to six percent after Warren faced questions over how she would pay for her ""Medicare-for-all"" plan -- a massive proposal that conservatives have warned would cost too much and burden the economy.

According to The Wall Street Journal, the rates could vary and make 100 percent tax rates ""typical"" for investment income.

IS ELIZABETH WARREN'S PROPOSED WEALTH TAX LEGAL OR EVEN PRACTICAL?: EXPERT PANEL DEBATES

Summers previously bashed the idea of a wealth tax, arguing in October that Congress and the Supreme Court would likely reject it.

“For progressives to invest their energy in a proposal that the Supreme Court has better than a 50 percent chance of declaring unconstitutional, that has very little chance of passing through the Congress, whose revenue potential is extraordinarily in doubt — for that to be the defining element in the progressive agenda in the United States, it seems to me to potentially sacrifice an immense opportunity,"" he said.

Warren, however, maintains that she can pay for her health plan without raising middle-class taxes. On her website, she claims that her all her tax changes would generate trillions of dollars in revenue over the next decade.

""We can raise another $3 trillion over ten years by asking the top 1 percent of households in America to pay a little more,"" she said. Overall, she projects the cost will total just under $52 trillion."

In a profile of Baquet, The Guardian reported that Baquet told staffers ""the outlet would lose its status if it openly sided with particular politicians."" The piece implied that Baquet had been pressured to approve coverage favorable to Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., but did not provide details.

""They probably want a more political New York Times than I’m willing to give them,"" Baquet said of those staffers. ""I hope they will learn over time that a New York Times that plays it straight has much more power and much more longevity.""

NEW YORK TIMES BANS REPORTERS FROM CNN'S DON LEMON, MSNBC'S MADDOW SHOWS FOR BEING 'TOO PARTISAN'

The Times editorial board endorsed Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination and for president in 2016. The paper has not endorsed a Republican for president since Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956.

In the same piece, Baquet blasted the president's attacks on his journalists as ""unpresidential"" and equivocated on whether Trump is a racist.

“I think Donald Trump says racially divisive things. I think that’s a little bit different. I’m not in his head enough to know whether he says them because he wants to stoke his base,"" he said.

Baquet's comments appeared to reflect his concern about a widespread perception that the Times is too biased. Vanity Fair previously reported that Baquet expressed concerns that reporters who appeared on certain cable news shows would be ""perceived as being aligned"" with the show's politics.

The interview also offered a glimpse into the Times' leadership as it faced growing criticism and boycotts from both sides of the ideological spectrum. Republicans often accuse the Times of left-wing bias with Trump repeatedly accusing the publication of spreading ""fake news.""

In August, Democrats called out the Times for employing a headline implying Trump opposed racism in a speech following the Aug. 3 mass shooting in El Paso, Texas. That shooting was prompted, in part, by anti-immigrant sentiment. Although Baquet later criticized the headline about Trump, he told the Guardian that he wasn't in a position to ""know whether he [makes comments] because he is a racist.""

According to a Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll released Tuesday, Buttigieg grabbed the support of 25 percent of likely Democratic presidential primary voters in New Hampshire. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of neighboring Massachusetts were tied for second – with each at 15 percent.

The survey indicated Sen. Bernie Sanders of neighboring Vermont – who crushed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire’s 2016 presidential primary – at 9 percent.

BUTTIGIEG WEBSITES ON 'BLACK AMERICA' PLANS USED STOCK PHOTOS OF MINORITIES

Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota registered at 6 percent in the poll, with billionaire environmental and progressive advocate and grassroots organizer Tom Steyer at 5 percent. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii each were at 3 percent and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang was at 2 percent. Everyone else tested in the survey stood at 1 percent or less.

The 37-year old Buttigieg – the youngest candidate in the large field of White House hopefuls – was once seen as the longest of long-shots for the nomination, but he surged in the spring to middle-tier status and he’s soared this autumn to reach the top-tier of contenders. He’s skyrocketed 15 percentage points since the previous Saint Anselm College poll, which was conducted in September.

Warren’s plunged 10 points since the previous poll, with Biden nose-diving 9 points.

“With less than three months before the primary, the race for New Hampshire’s Democratic delegates is still in a great deal of flux,” New Hampshire Institute of Politics Executive Director Neil Levesque highlighted.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

He’s not kidding. A Quinnipiac University Poll in New Hampshire conducted earlier this month indicated Biden at 20 percent, with Warren at 16 percent, Buttigieg at 15 percent and Sanders at 14 percent. And, a University of New Hampshire-CNN poll conducted late last month showed Sanders at 21 percent, Warren at 18 percent, Biden at 15 percent and Buttigieg at 10 percent.

Levesque emphasized that in the Saint Anselm poll, “Buttigieg’s bump is driven by the favorable impression he’s made on voters, with 76 percent having a favorable impression of him versus only 11 percent unfavorable.”

Buttigieg’s net favorability of 65 percent easily bested his top rivals for the nomination.

But, the reputation of New Hampshire voters as late deciders was reflected in the survey. Thirteen percent said they remained undecided and of those who were backing a candidate, only 36 percent said they were firm in their choices. If voters do change their minds, Warren may benefit. She topped the list for second choice, at 23 percent.

The poll’s release came with two and a half months until the Iowa caucuses kick off the presidential nominating calendar, followed eight days later by the New Hampshire primary.

A Des Moines Register-CNN-Mediacom poll released this past Saturday indicated Buttigieg at 25 percent among likely Iowa Democratic presidential caucus-goers, with Warren at 16 percent, and Biden and Sanders at 15 percent. A Monmouth University survey also conducted earlier this month showed Buttigieg with a single-digit advantage over his top rivals in the Hawkeye State.

The Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll was conducted November 13-18, with 255 likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire questioned by live telephone operators. The survey’s sampling of error was plus or minus 6.1 percentage points.

The poll's release came days after former Gov. Deval Patrick, D-Mass., jumped into the presidential nomination race. He stood at less than 1 percent support in the New Hampshire primary.

The poll also indicated over three-quarters of those questioned said they would discourage former New York City mayor and billionaire business and media mogul Mike Bloomberg from launching a bid. Ninety-one percent said they would discourage 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton from running again. But, more than four in ten said they would encourage former first lady Michelle Obama to run."

But when it comes to donations to his campaign, the longtime progressive lawmaker and populist champion from Vermont is in a league of his own, far ahead of his 2020 rivals. Sanders' campaign announced on Tuesday morning that it's now received more than 4 million individual contributions from people across the country, making the senator the fastest candidate in history to reach the fundraising mark.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

“Working-class Americans across the country are chipping in $3, $18, $27, or whatever they can to help elect Bernie Sanders because they know he is the only candidate who will fight for them and take on corporate greed and corruption,” campaign manager Faiz Shakir touted. “This is what momentum looks like.”

Sanders is making his second straight White House run. His campaign highlighted that the candidate didn’t reach the 4 million individuals milestone in the 2016 cycle until after February’s New Hampshire primary, which is still more nearly three months away.

Sanders, though, didn’t announce his 2016 bid until late April 2015. This time around, Sanders launched his presidential campaign in February of 2019, two months ahead of his 2016 schedule.

Sanders – like his progressive rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts – is relying on small-dollar grassroots donations to fuel his campaign. He hauled in $25.3 million in the July-September third quarter of fundraising, more than any other Democratic White House hopeful. That haul was powered by some 1.4 million contributions.

He says he's ready.

“We are making sure we are ready for anything that will come,” the South Bend, Ind., mayor said when asked on Monday how he was preparing for the fifth-round debate in Atlanta.

Once the longest of long-shot hopefuls, he's now firmly in the top tier of candidates, thanks to a recent surge in polling in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states that kick off the nominating calendar.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Mo Elleithee, the founding executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service and a Fox News contributor, expects Buttigieg “to be one of the big storylines” coming out of the debate.

“In every single debate so far, the person who came in as the front-runner or with momentum has faced serious incoming,” noted Elleithee, a senior spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign who later served as communications director for the Democratic National Committee.

“In each one of them, the person in the crosshairs stumbled,” he emphasized. “And so the question for Buttigieg is, now that he’s that guy, how does he handle the incoming?”

Veteran Democratic consultant and communications strategist Lynda Tran said Buttigieg “is on the rise, and that means he should anticipate the other candidates on stage this week to set their sights on his campaign.”

The 37-year-old candidate is the youngest in the large field of Democratic White House hopefuls – and Tran spotlighted the “generational contrast” between Buttigieg and the other top-tier contenders, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who are all in their 70’s.

“Look to the upcoming debate to see the top tier of candidates try to turn his youth and fresh take into a vulnerability,” said Tran, who ran communications for the Obama-era grassroots group Organizing for America and was a founding partner of the communications firm 270 Strategies.

BUTTIGIEG WEBSITES ON 'BLACK AMERICA' PLANS USED STOCK PHOTOS OF MINORITIES

The debate also comes as Buttigieg faces increased media attention for his lack of support in polling among black voters, who make up around 20 percent of the Democratic presidential primary electorate.

The debate’s being held in Georgia's largest city and capital – which is home to a large and vibrant African-American community. Elleithee said Buttigieg “has got to begin show soon that he can get some traction with black voters and this is a good opportunity for him to do that.”

“He would do himself a lot of good to come out tonight and find some way to connect with black voters in a real way,” he suggested.

Tran looked to the candidate’s numerous policy proposals, saying that Buttigieg’s “newly minted status at the top of the polls in Iowa also offers an opportunity for the mayor to discuss his expansive ideas about how to govern the nation.”

Buttigieg likely won’t be the only candidate with a mark on his or her back.

“I suspect that Warren’s going to be the other main target of attacks tonight,” Elleithee predicted. “Her Medicare-for-all plan has proven to be a major target. So she’s going to continue to be pushed on it. In the last debate, she was pushed on it. She stumbled. She then came out with details and now those details are going to be fair game.”

Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota were the two candidates who took on Warren over her government-run single-payer health care proposal at last month’s debate.

And Elleithee said “if there’s going to be any real fireworks tonight, I think the thing to look for will be Buttigieg versus Warren on this issue. They have both emerged as sort of the standard-bearers of the two sides of the Medicare-for-all debate, that has sort of become a proxy issue for this bigger discussion about the direction of the Democratic Party. “

But Tran said Warren should be able to take the heat.

“I expect Senator Warren will continue to take swings from others on stage around the costs of her health care proposal — but if the previous debate matchups are any indicator of how she will respond, I don’t see her being ruffled by the attention,” she predicated.

As he has at every debate to date, Biden will also be in the spotlight. Although he’ll likely not face the scrutiny he weathered in the first three debates – when he was the unrivaled front-runner – Elleithee stressed that “Biden’s going to need to have a good night. He’s still in good shape but he’s slipped a bit in the early states. He’s got to stop the slide.”

And Tran noted that “as before, voters will have their eyes on Vice President Joe Biden to see how he manages questions about his experience — the good and the bad — and his reaction to the impeachment hearings currently underway.”

Tran also highlighted that she’s going to “be on the lookout” on whether Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang have breakout moments.

“Both have delivered strong performances in the past rounds of debates, albeit without surging in the polls as a result. But they both bring unique perspectives to the stage and it’s not too late to shift the dynamics heading into Iowa,” she explained.

Elleithee’s got his eye on Sen. Kamala Harris of California, a one-time top tier contender who’s seen her White House bid plummet this autumn.

“She’s got to see if she can claw her way back in,” he said.

And he pointed to Klobuchar, “who keeps having steady debate performances that haven’t translated into significant support in the polls. She’s inched up a little bit. She had a very good debate performance last time. Can she replicate that and this time turn it into some sort of real bump in support.”

Reports have indicated the decision to replace “quid pro quo” with “bribery” when speaking of President Trump’s phone call to Ukraine’s president came from focus groups conducted in key battleground states. Among the questions asked of people was whether ""quid pro quo,"" ""extortion"" or ""bribery"" was the best description of the president’s alleged conduct. The groups found ""bribery"" to be the most descriptive and ""damning.""

Armed with their talking points, Democrats at the House Intelligence Committee hearing, across the country and on TV programs, began using the word ""bribery."" Listening to some of the montages compiled by conservative media is hilarious. It is straight out of “newspeak” in George Orwell’s novel, “1984,” which the author said was “designed to diminish the range of thought.”

MIKE HUCKABEE: DEMOCRATS' TRUMP IMPEACHMENT THEATRICS A SIGN OF THEIR GROWING DESPERATION — IT'S NOW A PARODY

This represents the death rattle of a party once known for promoting big ideas. Last week, the stock market achieved another record high, the Dow Jones Industrial Average topping 28,000, fattening the savings of current and future retirees.

If government is the solution, how much more money does it need to solve problems and why haven’t those problems been solved by now?

While not everyone is invested in the market, when companies make money, they tend to hire more people. It is why unemployment is at record, or near record, lows and the number of employed at record highs. Anyone wanting a job can find one, if they are willing to accept an entry-level position and work hard to move up. Many companies offer education benefits to their employees.

Democrats are desperate to get rid of the president (though the Senate will never convict him), because one more term of prosperity, especially for minorities, who have mostly been tied to their party, could mean a shift in loyalty. If that shift in African-American voters from Democrat to Republican is even as small as 10 percent, Democrats would be doomed in 2020 and possibly beyond.

Success is a better and more motivating theme than envy, greed and entitlement, as promoted by Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. The Wall Street Journal reported that under Warren’s ""Medicare-for-all"" scheme, some would be taxed above 100 percent and that her proposals are so grandiose her “wealth tax” would fall far short of paying for it all.

Given the poor stewardship of the federal government with the record amounts of tax dollars it already receives, why does anyone believe sending more money to Washington and placing additional tax penalties on successful people would suddenly mean politicians might become fiscally responsible?

If government is the solution, how much more money does it need to solve problems and why haven’t those problems been solved by now?

It’s all a sham and a scam. We hear the same rhetoric every four years, especially about the wealthy and successful needing to pay their “fair share.” Democrats never tell us what they mean by fair, but it appeals to the envy and class warfare their party promotes.

America is a land of opportunity, not guaranteed outcome. There are more opportunities than ever for a good education, good jobs and so many other things that make the country unique.

On the roster: Sondland bursts the ‘perfect’ bubble - Time Out: Nineteen Thanksgivings ‘over there’ - Buttigieg takes the lead in New Hampshire - Opossum like its hot



SONDLAND BURSTS THE ‘PERFECT’ BUBBLE

President Trump’s ambassador to the European Union didn’t tell us anything today that wasn’t obvious from the moment America first read the transcript of Trump’s phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart.



Gordon Sondland certainly added some context with his descriptions of the Keystone Cops routine by Rudy Giuliani. Sondland also made clear what some had once adamantly denied: That help for Ukraine was contingent on the president’s political demands.



But anybody who didn’t think those things were true after reading Trump’s transcript was either being facile or is a few chicken wings short of a dozen.



Democrats can be happy to have had such a senior official from the Trump administration – a political appointee of the president himself – make their case so clearly.



But there is reason for relief among Republicans, too.



The House GOP has been a messaging disaster throughout this process. It’s not entirely their fault given the contradictory, scattershot efforts from the White House, but it has not been pretty at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue.



Democrats with uncharacteristic discipline have homed in on the concept of the president abusing his broad foreign policy powers to try to harm his leading political rival.



Seemingly on a daily rotating basis, the president’s defenders in Congress have tried out myriad defenses. He didn’t do it! If he did do it, everyone else does it! The process is unfair! Trump was just worried about corruption!



The worst version of this stuff has been the tortured explanations about the “bigger” story in Ukraine. As Democrats tell their simpler story about presidential misconduct, some Republicans have been trying to tell a more convoluted one about the real nature of Ukrainian politics.



Sondland’s testimony today should put that all to rest, and that is good news for the GOP.



As we have long argued here, Republicans should be following the playbook laid out in 1998 by Bill Clinton and his team.



Much as with Clinton’s seamy conduct with a White House intern, Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of what Trump did to the Ukrainian president. Poll after poll shows that two-thirds or more of voters think the president acted wrongly.



But on the question of whether Trump should be impeached or removed from office, voters are much more evenly divided. That difference points the way to the useful strategy going forward and a way for the White House to meaningfully diminish support for impeachment.



There’s no sense in trying to convince persuadable voters that what Trump did was “perfect.” That’s a fool’s errand. But arguing that the offense doesn’t rise to the level of impeachment, especially less than a year away from an election, is a political winner.



Acknowledging Trump’s mistake, reminding voters that the system worked – the necessary aid to fight Russia’s military advances in Ukraine did flow to Kyiv – and pointing to next November seems like a much more fruitful place for the GOP to be.



If that approach is consistently applied it could make Democrats look like they are obsessed with obvious, old issues rather than dealing with the matters important to voters.



But that will require Republicans, including the president, to abandon their doctrine of denial and excuse. Sondland made doing so much easier today.

TIME OUT: NINETEEN THANKSGIVINGS ‘OVER THERE’

NYT: “This year marks the 19th Thanksgiving since the beginning of the wars, occupations, operations and deployments that together form what the Pentagon calls the global war on terrorism. Across all this time and terrain, a few million American service members, and those who labored beside them, have accumulated vast and varied observances of a quintessential American holiday spent at war. Earlier this year The Times asked service members, veterans and civilians who have celebrated Thanksgiving in a conflict zone to share their photographs and memories. … Like combat service itself, Thanksgivings for troops have been wildly uneven experiences. Depending on each place and time, dinners and celebrations veered between scarcity and excess, spectacle and sorrow, isolation and crowds. But common themes inform veteran memories, including the longing for home caused by separation from families and lifelong rituals, the bonds many veterans formed with fellow troops, and recollections of rich palettes of emotions associated with the particular circumstances troops lived in while deployed.”

BUTTIGIEG TAKES THE LEAD IN NEW HAMPSHIRE

WMUR9: “The Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll of 255 likely Democratic primary voters shows that [Pete] Buttigieg, supported by 25 percent, now holds a 10 percentage point lead over former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who are tied for second at 15 percent. Buttigieg is substantially ahead of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is in fourth place at 9 percent. Rounding out the top 10 were Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar at 6 percent; billionaire activist Tom Steyer of California at 5 percent; U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey at 3 percent each; entrepreneur Andrew Yang of New York at 2 percent and California Sen. Kamala Harris at 1 percent. Thirteen percent of those polled said they were undecided.”



Can he bring the momentum to the debate stage? - Politico: “Pete Buttigieg will take the stage at Wednesday’s debate as a serious threat to the top Democratic presidential candidates for the first time. … But that surge in the early states comes with the glare of additional scrutiny, including on his struggles appealing to African American voters in other states, and the growing likelihood of attacks from Democratic opponents eager to blunt Buttigieg’s rise and regain momentum of their own. … Though the campaign has heated up recently, many candidates are still reluctant to go on the attack and risk alienating a rival’s supporters. But Buttigieg’s strong polling out of Iowa has already come with fresh criticism over several campaign missteps related to one of the mayor’s biggest weaknesses: his lack of support among African American voters, which has contributed to his lower numbers in polls of Democrats in South Carolina and nationally.”



Michael Kruse: Are your neighbors ready for Mayor Pete? - Politico: “Up till now, Buttigieg’s youth and sexual orientation largely have been calling cards in the Democratic primary, distinguishing him in a field whose front-runners are in their 70s and whose back-of-the-packers are too numerous for most people to keep track of. … When it comes to the prospect of a gay president, the numbers right now are sobering for Buttigieg: Polling suggests that the country was more ready for a black president back in 2008 than it is for a gay president now. And last month, the current iteration of the question of readiness became front-page news when a leaked memo revealed focus groups commissioned by the Buttigieg campaign suggested his sexuality could be ‘a barrier’ for black voters in at least South Carolina, the crucial fourth nominating contest—and a bellwether for the party’s more socially conservative voters.”



Biden steps up efforts in Iowa - WaPo: “[Biden] has been in Iowa fewer times than any of the other top-tier candidates, and he is spending much less on advertising than several of his rivals. And now, even as he retains a national lead in polling, he is falling behind in a state that doomed his campaign the last time he sought the presidency. Biden’s campaign once shrugged off the potential impact of losing the caucus vote on Feb. 3, but concerns lately have grown about just how poorly he might do. Desperate to avoid a humiliating showing that might have broader repercussions, Biden is planning a renewed focus on Iowa, with an expectation that both he and his wife, Jill, soon will make the kind of extended trips to the state that other candidates have for months. They also have launched a new digital campaign and could have additional endorsements in the works.”



Foundering Harris calls talk of campaign crack-up ‘gossip’ - Nevada Independent: “California Sen. Kamala Harris is dismissing recent reports of unrest within her campaign and chatter among attendees of a Democratic convention in her home state about whether she should drop out of the presidential race as no more than ‘gossip.’ … With about two and a half months until the first presidential preferences are cast, Harris said that it is “still early” and that “to follow the punditry around what is going on with the campaign is to overlook what’s happening on the street…” But she remained vague when asked whether that enthusiasm had at all changed her campaign’s plans to shift staff from Nevada to Iowa. ‘I will keep you posted but I’m going to tell you something: Nevada is very, very important to me,’ Harris said.”



Adieu, Wayne Messam - Axios: “Miramar Mayor Wayne Messam (D-Fla.) announced on Wednesday that he is dropping out of the 2020 presidential race. The big picture: Messam got into the race after Southbend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg's announcement, however, the small-town Florida mayor failed to gain the momentum that Buttigieg's campaign achieved. Messam did not make it on to any debate stage and struggled to see significant gains in polling. Messam is Miramar's first black mayor, the owner of a construction company, a former college football player and the son of a Jamaican sugarcane worker.”

“The campaigns, of course, are always, shall I say, hot salsa, but the governing part doesn’t need to be that way.” – Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in a speech in his home commonwealth of Kentucky decrying the level of vitriol in government.



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“What do you make of the Chairman’s larger than anyone else’s chair? It looks like Queen Elizabeth’s throne to me. Is that standard for the Congress? To me, it makes him look diminutive.” – Tom Winter Lt. Col. USMC (Ret), Steele, Mo.



[Ed. note: It is standard practice for chairmen and chairwomen. And it always has seemed a little silly.]



“So, it would seem that the Democratic Party fear a journalist [Tim Alberta] that is not necessarily in the tank for the Democratic agenda. What a load of disservice to the voters! Our country is greatly endangered by partisan politics and journalism that does not stay clear of taking sides. Perhaps, I am not in the swing of things, but I would like to believe that the American voter could figure out what to do or think without a partisan scorecard. That is probably naive.” – Lisa Lentz, Hollister, Calif.



[Ed. note: Both sides suffer from this affliction. In 2016, Republicans were talking openly about only allowing avowed partisans or right-leaning opinion mongers to moderate debates. It was nearly as pitiful as the effort to assassinate the character of Alberta, one the most respected, finest political reporters working in Washington today because he started his career at a right-leaning publication. I dare anyone to find any partisan hackery in Alberta’s work, wherever he was doing it. But both Republicans and Democrats make a self-defeating mistake when they look for gentle coddling instead of incisive questioning. Are Democrats better off for letting opinion journalists play patty-cake with their candidates these many months? No chance. Insulating candidates from tough questioning has not only help keep the field at its bloated size but also allowed them to ignore the most important issues when it comes to winning in 2020. It’s farcical that Elizabeth Warren made it until October before anyone put the bite on her about her formless, pie-in-the-sky health insurance program. If you can’t handle Tim Alberta for five questions, you darned sure can’t handle the presidency.]



“Lincoln's quintessential address of 156 years ago seems much closer to today when referred to as seven score and 16 years. I agree with your often-stated position that the dearth of humanities in secondary education, especially civics and western civilization, is tearing away the very fabric of our republic - an educated citizenry. Unfortunately, I do not see the education elites embracing the classics and the much-maligned vocational education necessary to sustain our grand experiment.” – Dan Burch, Turlock, Calif.

OPOSSUM LIKE ITS HOT

AP: “A movement is growing in North Carolina to prevent the act of so-called ‘opossum dropping.’ The practice involves suspending an opossum in a transparent box on New Year’s Eve and slowly lowering it the ground as people count down to midnight. The Raleigh News & Observer reported Monday that a western North Carolina town had conducted opossum drops for 24 years. Brasstown in Clay County dropped its last opossum in 2018. But the organization Animal Help Now wants to prevent anyone from doing it elsewhere. That will require a change to state law that allows people to do anything they want to opossums for five days each year. The group started a petition and gathered almost 160,000 signatures before the petition closed. The group says it’s continuing its legislative efforts.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“It is pure fiction that this pro-American sentiment was either squandered after Sept. 11 or lost under the Bush Administration. It never existed.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in Time magazine on Nov. 9, 2003.

Here's what you need to know as you start your Wednesday...

Potentially problematic figure for Democrats set to testify as key Trump impeachment witnesses undercut claims of 'quid pro quo,' 'bribery' and 'cover-up'

Republicans sounded a celebratory note as House Democrats' impeachment inquiry wrapped up another day of public hearings Tuesday evening, saying the day's witnesses had served only to highlight fundamental problems in the case against President Trump.

“Did anyone ever ask you to bribe or extort anyone at any time during your time in the White House?"" House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., asked at one point in Tuesday's afternoon hearing.

Former National Security Council (NSC) aide Tim Morrison: ""No.""

Former U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker: “No.""

Later, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., covered similar ground in asking Morrison and Volker about Trump's fateful July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. When asked whether there were indications of quid pro quo, bribery or extortion, they each repeatedly answered, ""No.""

The answers underscored a problem facing House Democrats in the second week of public hearings in their impeachment inquiry. With more witnesses testifying, more soundbites have emerged that may help Republicans and the Trump campaign argue that the proceedings were politically motivated theater, long in the works and foreshadowed openly by Democrats for months, if not years. Click here for a complete summary of Tuesday's testimony.

A 'Gordon Problem' for Democrats: Democrats' troubles with their case against Trump may continue Wednesday with Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union and perhaps impeachment inquiry's most anticipated witness. Sondland repeatedly has frustrated Democrats' narrative by contradicting several other key witnesses in the probe. Sondland, critics argue, has a credibility problem.

In a closed-door hearing, Sondland revised his prior testimony to say that he told a top Ukrainian official that U.S. aid would likely not resume until the country issues a corruption statement. Democrats quickly hailed the revelation as proof that Trump tried to pressure Zelensky into investigating Joe Biden's family business dealings in the country in exchange for the release of about $400 million in military aid. However, in prior testimony, Sondland said he had texted Ambassador Bill Taylor, the U.S. chargé d'affaires in Ukraine, that in September saying there was no quid pro quo.

Democrats to hold fifth presidential primary debate

The Democratic Party will hold its fifth presidential primary debate in Atlanta on Wednesday night and it will likely be overshadowed by the Trump impeach inquiry hearing. The following 10 candidates qualified to be on stage for Wednesday's debate: Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren, Andrew Yang.

Wednesday's debate comes amid uncertainty over whether Democrats truly have a candidate who could defeat President Trump next November as former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has seriously flirted with the idea of entering the race and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick declared his candidacy last week. South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg may find himself under attack Wednesday night as he has surged in recent polls in Iowa, which holds the nation’s first caucuses in February.

Acquitted Navy SEAL faces review, potential loss of Trident pin, senior US defense official says

The top admiral in the Navy plans to announce a review in which peers will determine whether to remove SEAL Eddie Gallagher's Trident pin following his highly publicized war crimes case, a senior U.S. defense official told Fox News on Tuesday. The Trident is bestowed on SEALs to reinforce ""good order and discipline"" across the force, the source told Fox News.

Commander Nate Christensen, a spokesman for the Navy, told Fox News that the chief of naval operations, Adm. Mike Gilday, supported Rear Adm. Collin Green's decision to uphold a mitigated sentence against Gallagher, who was acquitted in July of killing an Islamic State fighter in Iraq. A San Diego jury sentenced Gallagher to a reduced rank and four months of confinement, which he has already served, for posing with the body of the dead ISIS fighter, which was considered the least egregious of the seven charges he was facing. President Trump signed an order last Friday reversing the sentence and ordering the promotion of Gallagher back to the rank he held before his trial.

Why don’t Democrats do that?,2019-11-19,Fox News,"David Avella: Democrats want to scrap the Electoral College. So why don't they ditch primaries, too?",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/democrats-electoral-college-primaries-david-avella,"While South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg is enjoying a surge in the polls in Iowa, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has consistently shown staying power nationally to remain the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. However, before she declares victory and announces its time to focus on the general election, here is an obvious question for her. If she is so convinced that a national popular vote is how we should elect the president of the United States in the general election, why don't Democrats hold a national primary to select their presidential nominee?

At the core of Warren’s plans for America is the end of the Electoral College. She wants to replace it with a national popular vote.

She is hardly alone among Democrats. Day after day, we are treated to Democrats decrying the Electoral College as being unfair, as being wrong, as being something that gives too much-undeserved power to voters in less populated states.

LIZ PEEK: SCHIFF STEERS TRUMP IMPEACHMENT DRIVE STRAIGHT TOWARD A DITCH — HERE'S WHAT'S NEXT

However, when one examines the arcane and near-mystical process the Democrats have chosen to determine their nominee for president of the United States, one would be hard-pressed to conclude anything other than that Democrats are unwilling to put their money where their mouths are.

It would seem to be a pretty simple matter to switch to a national primary where whoever receives the most votes is declared the winner. Why don’t Democrats do that?

One concern could be that with multiple candidates vying for the party’s nomination, one of them could prevail with less than a majority of the votes. That is surely so. Would not that same logic apply to anytime there was a strong third-party candidate?

We did not hear Democrats in 1992, 2000 or any other time arguing that only the votes of the two major-party candidates should count in the presidential tally to ensure the winner has earned a majority of the votes.

In 2016, when Hillary Clinton prevailed over Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., it is pretty clear the Democratic National Committee (DNC) put more than a thumb on the scale to all but assure that she prevailed.

If you go back to the last truly contested race for the Democratic Party nomination, in 2008, the process used might startle you. Suffice it to say, it was a little different than one man, one vote.

Florida and Michigan did not hold their primaries on the days the DNC deemed proper, so their votes were treated in a different fashion than those cast by voters in states bowing to the DNC. They did not even count the popular vote from Michigan (where President Obama did not have his name on the ballot). Eventually, the decision was made to split the delegate vote evenly in these two states, despite Clinton having defeated Obama soundly in Florida where both names were on the ballot.

It gets weirder. Democrats abroad, including those in American Samoa, Guam and the Virgin Islands had delegates who each received a half vote. Would it not just have been easier to have them cut the number of delegates in half?

At the end of the day, if you include the votes cast in Michigan, Hillary Clinton received 48.1 percent and Barack Obama 47.4 percent. Really close.

When delegates selected via primary and caucus were totaled up, neither candidate had enough to win at the convention.

So, just how did the Democrats resolve this tricky and difficult situation? Why, they turned to their consiglieres, otherwise known as super delegates. These are elected officials, party officials, etc.

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER

In other words, an elitist class established to fix problems when the electorate gets out of hand. The super delegates overwhelmingly sided with Obama, and he became the nominee.

Fast forward to 2020. The Democrats are still holding a series of primaries, conventions, and caucuses. Fully 16 percent of the delegates will do nothing more than wake up in the morning and be designated as such. No longer are they called “super delegates.” These folks are now “automatic delegates,” as though they are granted divine intervention powers.

In other words, it’s more of the same old, same old. You do not even hear a murmur that this process should be replaced by a national primary.

The conclusion here is pretty simple. If the Democrats think a straight-up election with a winner-take-all outcome in the general election for president is right and good enough for the nation, they ought to at least demonstrate the pretense of the courage of their convictions and apply that standard to themselves.

Until that day comes to pass, Americans will have to accept that their posturing on the Electoral College is just that… posturing.

* Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid spoke at an event in his home state of Nevada over the weekend and downplayed the importance of the first two 2020 nominating contests. “I don’t think it matters what happens in Iowa or New Hampshire because those states are not representative of the country anymore,” Reid said.

Elizabeth Warren's tax plan could create ""catastrophic economic consequences.""

“I don’t think that taxation approaching confiscatory is remotely feasible and, if it was tried, would have catastrophic economic consequences,” Summers, a former president of Harvard University, told CNBC.

Summers, who also was a former director of the National Economic Council under President Barack Obama, was the latest Democrat to express skepticism over proposals pushed by more progressive elements in the party.

“Essentially, what Sen. Warren’s plans would do, as I read them, is they go through every option that has been selected as the possible strategy for raising progressivity and tries to do them all of them at once,” Summers said. ""And when you try to do all of them at once, you're collecting essentially about as much taxes as the total after-tax AGI, adjusted gross income, of all the millionaires.""

Warren, D-Mass., previously proposed a two percent tax on wealth above $50 million as well as a three percent tax on wealth that surpassed $1 billion. That later changed to six percent after Warren faced questions over how she would pay for her ""Medicare-for-all"" plan -- a massive proposal that conservatives have warned would cost too much and burden the economy.

According to The Wall Street Journal, the rates could vary and make 100 percent tax rates ""typical"" for investment income.

IS ELIZABETH WARREN'S PROPOSED WEALTH TAX LEGAL OR EVEN PRACTICAL?: EXPERT PANEL DEBATES

Summers previously bashed the idea of a wealth tax, arguing in October that Congress and the Supreme Court would likely reject it.

“For progressives to invest their energy in a proposal that the Supreme Court has better than a 50 percent chance of declaring unconstitutional, that has very little chance of passing through the Congress, whose revenue potential is extraordinarily in doubt — for that to be the defining element in the progressive agenda in the United States, it seems to me to potentially sacrifice an immense opportunity,"" he said.

Warren, however, maintains that she can pay for her health plan without raising middle-class taxes. On her website, she claims that her all her tax changes would generate trillions of dollars in revenue over the next decade.

""We can raise another $3 trillion over ten years by asking the top 1 percent of households in America to pay a little more,"" she said. Overall, she projects the cost will total just under $52 trillion."

The Times editorial board endorsed Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination and for president in 2016. The paper has not endorsed a Republican for president since Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956.

In the same piece, Baquet blasted the president's attacks on his journalists as ""unpresidential"" and equivocated on whether Trump is a racist.

“I think Donald Trump says racially divisive things. I think that’s a little bit different. I’m not in his head enough to know whether he says them because he wants to stoke his base,"" he said.

Baquet's comments appeared to reflect his concern about a widespread perception that the Times is too biased. Vanity Fair previously reported that Baquet expressed concerns that reporters who appeared on certain cable news shows would be ""perceived as being aligned"" with the show's politics.

The interview also offered a glimpse into the Times' leadership as it faced growing criticism and boycotts from both sides of the ideological spectrum. Republicans often accuse the Times of left-wing bias with Trump repeatedly accusing the publication of spreading ""fake news.""

In August, Democrats called out the Times for employing a headline implying Trump opposed racism in a speech following the Aug. 3 mass shooting in El Paso, Texas. That shooting was prompted, in part, by anti-immigrant sentiment. Although Baquet later criticized the headline about Trump, he told the Guardian that he wasn't in a position to ""know whether he [makes comments] because he is a racist.""

Langone also said it's human nature for others to be jealous of people's success and claimed he's been mischaracterized by those who envy his wealth.

""Human nature is alive and well. And one of the seven deadly sins is envy,"" he said.

In Wednesday's Democratic presidential debate, Warren continued to tout her plans to increase taxes on the wealthiest Americans, arguing that she is not trying to punish the rich.

He was joined by several other candidates on stage in going after the health care overhaul, putting the party's far-left candidates on their heels over what Buttigieg called their ""divisive"" and unrealistic approach.

Reflecting the ever-shifting dynamic in the race, meanwhile, Joe Biden had a mixed performance -- projecting foreign policy strength and siding with Buttigieg against the liberal wing on health care, while also suffering some stumbles on the debate stage. Until recently the unrivaled front-runner in the race, Biden competed for attention Wednesday with three other top-tier candidates -- Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg -- but flubbed when he erroneously stated in front of Sen. Kamala Harris that he had the support of the ""only"" black woman elected to the Senate.

In an odd moment, he also said it's important to ""keep punching at"" the problem of domestic violence, noting that it's ""rarely"" needed for men to hit women in self-defense.

The debate was the candidates' first meeting since Warren said she would gradually guide the nation toward Medicare-for-all, supposedly paid for with a host of tax hikes on the rich and other measures. One by one, several of the candidates -- including Biden, Sen. Cory Booker and Sen. Amy Klobuchar -- raised objections to that plan.

""I’m not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car,"" Klobuchar said at one point.

Buttigieg called for health care reform ""without the divisive step of ordering people onto it,"" saying that ""commanding people to accept that option"" is not the right approach.

""We have a majority to do the right thing if we can galvanize, not polarize, that majority,"" the South Bend mayor said.

And, in a particularly spirited moment, New Jersey Sen. Booker directly took on Warren's proposed wealth tax, saying it would be ineffective as a means of funding her Medicare-for-all plan, along with her proposals to provide free college tuition and erasing student loan debt.

Democrats need to be focused on growing wealth, Booker said, not simply taxing it. Republicans have asserted that, even if all billionaires were somehow taxed out of existence without causing any capital markets distortion, the resulting revenues in the best case scenario would barely pay for three years of Medicare-for-all. (The world's 2,150 billionaires have an approximate combined net worth of $8.7 trillion, and the progressive Urban Institute has said that Medicare-for-all would cost on average $10.2 trillion for three years.)

WHAT HAPPENED IN TODAY'S BLOCKBUSTER IMPEACHMENT TESTIMONY?

Vermont Sen. Sanders, who is arguing for a more immediate shift to a single-payer system, separately sparred with Biden on the issue. Biden argued that Medicare-for-all could not pass Congress, in part because it would force people to lose their private insurance.

""I trust the American people to make a judgment about what is in their interest, and not demand of them what the insurance companies want,"" Biden said. He continued to push for modifications to Obama-era health care reforms instead.

On foreign policy, Biden sounded an authoritative note, declaring that he would restrict arms sales to Saudi Arabia following the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. “We have to speak loudly on violations of human rights,"" he said, unequivocally holding Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman responsible for Khashoggi's death.

Later, in a somewhat awkward moment, Biden prompted some laughter in the audience when he declared that ""we gotta keep punching at"" the problem of domestic violence, and that it is only acceptable to hit a woman in ""self-defense,"" which he said would ""rarely"" occur.

And, Biden asserted that he had the support of ""the only African-American woman who’s ever been elected to the United States Senate"" -- prompting Booker and Harris to dryly remark, ""That's not true.""

Harris noted, “The other one is here.” Biden later corrected himself to say he had the support of the first African-American woman elected to the Senate, referring to former Illinois Democratic Sen. Carol Moseley Braun.

In another notable one-on-one moment, Sanders, touting the benefits of socialism in a discussion with billionaire Tom Steyer, argued that America only has ""eight or nine"" years left to reverse catastrophic effects of climate change, including cities going ""underwater."" United Nations experts made similar claims all the way back in 1989.

As the heated discussion unfolded at the MSNBC debate in Atlanta, Hawaii Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard -- who was recently accused by Hillary Clinton of being a ""Russian asset"" -- offered a blunt assessment: ""Our Democratic Party, unfortunately, is not the party that is of, by and for the people,"" she said.

Gabbard also doubled down on earlier comments that Clinton represents the “personification of the rot in the Democratic Party.” She said the party is influenced by a “foreign policy establishment” that supports regime-change wars. She called it the “Bush, Clinton, Trump foreign policy doctrine.” (Harris then attacked Gabbard for appearing on Fox News.)

Separately, Gabbard unloaded on Buttigieg after he attacked her for a widely-panned meeting with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, who is accused of war crimes.

""You would lack the courage to meet with both adversaries and friends,"" Gabbard shot back, noting that former President John F. Kennedy met with his counterpart in the Soviet Union.

Klobuchar also pointedly criticized Buttigieg, arguing that he ""said the right words"" as a ""local official"" but lacks needed experience.

""I actually have the experience,"" Klobuchar remarked.

""Washington experience is not the only experience that matters,"" Buttigieg retorted. ""There's more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country?""

Meanwhile, Warren unloaded on U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland just hours after his explosive impeachment hearing testimony, saying at Wednesday night's primary debate that he bought his position ""by writing a check for $1 million"" to Trump's inaugural committee.

Warren vowed that if she were elected, ""We are not going to give the ambassador posts to the highest bidder"" -- signaling that the Massachusetts Democratic senator would use the proceedings to advance her outsider message.

However, The Washington Free Beacon noted that Warren repeatedly voted to confirm several of former President Barack Obama's donors to ambassadorships, even when they lacked relevant experience. And, Warren did not object to Sonland's confirmation at the time.

""Read the Mueller report, all 442 pages of it, that show how the president tried to obstruct justice,"" Warren said. ""We have to establish the principle that no one is above the law. We have a constitutional responsibility, and we need to meet it.""

Others on stage also slammed President Trump over the impeachment proceedings.

“We have a criminal living in the White House,” Harris, D-Calif., declared. Citing Sondland's claim that everyone was ""in the loop"" on Ukraine talks at the heart of the probe, she said ""that means it is a criminal enterprise engaged in by the president"" and other top officials.

Not everyone on stage committed to voting to convict the president if he were impeached, however. Klobuchar suggested she wanted Trump removed, but emphasized the importance of seeing all the evidence.

""I have made it very clear that this is impeachable conduct. ... I just believe our jurors is to look at each count and make a decision,"" Klobuchar said, before saying that Trump repeatedly ""puts his own private interests ... in front of our country's interest.""

The debate's initial attention on Trump and Medicare-for-all took some heat off Buttigieg, at least for the debate's beginning moments. His dramatic rise from little-known Indiana mayor to a leading Democratic presidential candidate faced its toughest test on Wednesday, with rivals eager to stall his momentum.

Harris and Buttigieg engaged in a tense but respectful conversation later on in the evening, as Harris discussed the importance of not taking ""women of color"" for granted.

""I do sometimes feel like a stranger in my own country,"" Buttigieg, who is openly gay, remarked.

The debate in Atlanta marked the first time Buttigieg faced other White House hopefuls as an undisputed member of the top tier.

BUTTIGIEG WEBSITES ON 'BLACK AMERICA' PLANS USED STOCK PHOTOS OF MINORITIES

The 37-year old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, gained significant ground in recent months in Iowa, which holds the nation’s first caucuses in February. He is bunched at the top of most polls in Iowa with candidates who have much longer political resumes.

Veteran Democratic consultant and communications strategist Lynda Tran said Buttigieg “is on the rise, and that means he should anticipate the other candidates on stage this week to set their sights on his campaign.”

Some surveys are beginning to show him taking a more convincing lead in the race, at least in early-voting states.

Buttigieg still faces plenty of hurdles to clinching the Democratic nomination, particularly winning over black and other minority voters. But his Iowa rise means he could come under fire from his rivals like never before.

Biden, Warren and Sanders have all faced similar scrutiny in previous debates, and those attacks did little to change the trajectory of the race.

The debate unfolded at a moment of uncertainty about the Democratic field, with some in the party, particularly donors, worried there’s no one positioned to defeat President Trump. Former President Barack Obama took the unusual step last week of warning the party against moving too far to the left.

Speaking to that anxiety, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick entered the Democratic race last week. Billionaire Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, is openly flirting with a bid.

Neither Patrick nor Bloomberg were onstage Wednesday.

With less than three months before voting, much of the nation’s political attention would typically be focused on the primary. Instead, the focus is on the impeachment inquiry against Trump.

Booker faces especially intense pressure. He’s yet to meet the Democratic National Committee’s polling requirements for the December debate, and his campaign acknowledges that he needs to capitalize on the national spotlight.

The New Jersey senator took an apparent shot at Buttigieg at one point, following the news that his campaign had used a stock photo of a woman in Kenya who apparently had nothing to do with the campaign.

“I want to turn back to the issue of black voters,"" Booker said. ""I have a lifetime of experience with black voters. I’ve been one since I was 18. Nobody on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African-American voters.""

In his rousing closing statement Wednesday night, Booker claimed to throw out his prepared remarks to discuss the ""debt"" that all Americans owed because of the country's racist history.

""It is time to fight, and fight together,"" Booker said, as the audience applauded.

Gabbard, for her closing remarks, urged Democrats to defeat the ""divisiveness of Donald Trump"" and ""make Dr. King's dream a reality.""

In his closing statement, Buttigieg offered an olive branch to ""progressives,"" as well as ""moderates"" and ""a lot of future former Republicans,"" emphasizing his efforts to win over moderates throughout the contentious evening.

""I want you to know that everybody is welcome in this movement that we're building,"" Buttigieg remarked.

The underwhelming televised event prompted Lahren to hold a vote, of sorts, among panelists on Fox Nation's ""Democratic Debate Reactions,"" asking them which they found ""more boring"" -- the debate or the House-led impeachment hearings.

""That's a tough one for the American people,"" replied Fox News contributor and Fox Nation host David Webb, saying the debate was, ""a repeat of the last debate and the prior debate and probably will be the next debate on December 19th.

""I think that they weren't really debating each other,"" he observed. ""They weren't countering each other, making their arguments, for their part, from their position.""

One of the biggest topics on the debate stage last night was health care, but even on that major issue Fox News contributor and retired U.S. Marine and Johnny ""Joey"" Jones argued that the candidates did not seem to be setting themselves apart.

""The only difference between a moderate Democrat and a progressive is, 'Is this Medicare-for-all with the mandate or Medicare-for-all without?' That's about the only difference at this point,"" he said.

Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have said that they would eliminate private health care insurance plans immediately to make way for a single-payer health care system. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and entrepreneur Andrew Yang have said that they would keep private insurance plans for now. The remaining candidates have advocated for keeping private insurance while expanding public health insurance options.

Erin Elmore, who is a republican strategist and attorney, observed that these positions may present a huge electoral challenge for Democrats.

""Let's say Elizabeth Warren does get this nomination, her Medicare-for-all is toxic in the general. Absolutely toxic. You can't campaign on that against President Trump. And that's the issue here. Can any of these people make it against President Trump? And they don't have that 'It' factor,"" she said.

Webb told the Fox Nation panel: ""Fact is when you take federal spending as a percentage of GDP to that level where you cross the 47 percent line and over the 50 plus percent line, as other socialist democracies, you are a socialist nation. And that's where their spending would take us.""

Jones observed: ""This is why impeachment is so important for them, because they're fighting over who's going to get the consolation prize.

""They're fighting over who's going to be there when the Democrats in Congress beat Trump up so much that they believe the voters won't show up for him,"" he concluded. ""That's the only way they can beat him... and when Trump gets another win and another win between now and November next year, the only hope they have is to impeach him on emotion.""

""Well actually that was the first question of the night,"" observed Lahren, who pointed out that MSNBC debate moderator Rachel Maddow asked former vice president Joe Biden to weigh in on the impeachment hearings, without pressing him on his relation to the scandal.

Webb expressed disbelief that the debate moderators failed to ask Biden a single question about his and his son, Hunter's, dealings in Ukraine.

""You also have to look at his potential problems with influence peddling,"" said Webb, ""We're talking about major issues where his son was involved while he was vice president. He was a member of the Senate, a member of that body. I'm not convicting him. I want the inquiry and the investigation to include him, which would, therefore, if he's innocent, exclude him.""

While many expected the debate to focus attacks on the front runners – including the newly minted member of the club, South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg – that didn’t happen.

However, Sen. Kamala Harris of California delivered a prosecutorial dissection of Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii that was the attack everyone will remember, after the latter criticized the Democratic Party and Harris brought the receipts that Gabbard was never really a member of it.

RISING BUTTIGIEG FENDS OFF ATTACKS, TAKES ON FAR-LEFT FLANK AT DEM DEBATE; BIDEN STUMBLES

Here are the night’s biggest winners and losers:

WINNERS

BIGGEST WINNER: Amy Klobuchar

Overall, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar was the winner of the contest than ran over two hours. She had her best performance by emphasizing her experience, productivity, electoral successes. She also emphasized the fact that women are judged by a different standard than men, citing her criticism of Buttigieg’s lack of experience while he was being hailed as a front-runner last week.

Klobuchar pulled it all together in Atlanta with a number of great points and lines -- many familiar -- but then she delivered the line of the night, ""If you think a woman can’t beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day."" Klobuchar isn’t a front runner and this debate won’t make her one. But, the senator will get another look from voters due to it and that puts her in a better position coming out of the debate than going into it.

SURPRISE WINNER: Joe Biden

Former Vice President Biden is a winner by default. Hiding in plain sight might be the best strategy for him. Biden didn’t have the mistake laden performance of past debates by receding for long stretches in the debate. Still holding on to a national lead, that strategy Wednesday night will help him hold on to it for a bit longer. Biden largely relied on his message that he can beat Trump, has the experience, and can bring people together. That might be enough, for now, to keep him in the post position but it’s not going to win the nomination without a better performance in future debates and on the campaign trail.

SURPRISE WINNER: Kamala Harris

Harris had her best performance in a long time. She went after Trump and Gabbard making the case against both in her best prosecutorial fashion. Harris may never match the electric moment she had when she went after Biden in an earlier debate, but she turned in her best performance since that one by mixing moxie and policy positions. That allows Harris to play for another day when she’s been skating at the edge of collapse. A lack of consistency has bedeviled her candidacy. But on Wednesday night she was the candidate everyone expected her to be in this campaign.

LOSERS

BIGGEST LOSER: Tulsi Gabbard

Running to be the Democratic nominee and criticizing the Democratic Party is not a winning strategy. Gabbard’s criticism of the Party may have been her way of setting up a run as an independent in the general election. Instead, Harris disqualified her for both contests by reciting her embrace of Trump and dictators since the 2016 election. Gabbard then turned her aim on Buttigieg at the end of the debate in yet another curious attack on other Democratic candidates that has been a hallmark of her candidacy.

LOSER: Pete Buttigieg

Buttigieg was the loser in Atlanta. He had the most to gain yet missed the opportunity to set himself apart from the front tier of candidates and generate even more of the momentum initiated by the latest polls. Buttigieg still struggles to address matters of race and that was no different on Wednesday night. The fact that Buttigieg couldn’t make the most of the debate on Wednesday night could foreshadow his ability to put the race away later in the campaign. It is his second turn in the spotlight and under the stage lights on Wednesday night he didn’t shine. Instead, Buttigieg turned in a serviceable appearance at best, missing an opportunity he’s unlikely to get again -- a hot hand going into a debate as a new front-runner.

LOSER: Elizabeth Warren

Debates have been Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s bread and butter. No one has more plans, policies, or points and makes them better than Warren…but not on Wednesday night. For some reason, Warren didn’t have it. She made better points with more detail than any of the other candidates but her delivery and presence were off. A performance like those from her other debates would have helped Warren stem a tough week or two of poll numbers in early primary states. Instead, she will have to hit the trail to do it until the next debate.

LOSER: Bernie Sanders

The independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders didn’t do anything to help himself on Wednesday night. Same lines, same attacks, same Bernie Sanders. His performance means that Sanders won’t turn his drop in the polls around with the Atlanta debate. He has plenty of money to stay in the race for months to come. But, that doesn’t mean he’s going to win a contest in the process and that’s why debates like the one on Wednesday night matter.

LOSER: Cory Booker

In every debate, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker has a moment…and that’s it. It’s just a moment. That’s not enough for him or his candidacy to make a move. Booker’s performance Wednesday night isn’t going to move the polls for him and it’s unlikely he is going do anything else at this point that will do it.

LOSERS: Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang

Neither entrepreneur Andrew Yang nor billionaire activist Tom Steyer were able to make a real mark in this debate to make a move in the polls with voters. Steyer resorted to reciting lines from his TV ads during much of the debate. Yang had a few good lines. But, at this point, that’s a costly missed opportunity for both candidates.

LOSER: Deval Patrick

The late entrant into the 2020 Democratic race, former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick not only didn’t make the debate stage he also canceled an event he organized at Morehouse College in Atlanta, the site of the debate, when only two people showed up."

He says he's ready.

“We are making sure we are ready for anything that will come,” the South Bend, Ind., mayor said when asked on Monday how he was preparing for the fifth-round debate in Atlanta.

Once the longest of long-shot hopefuls, he's now firmly in the top tier of candidates, thanks to a recent surge in polling in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states that kick off the nominating calendar.

THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

Mo Elleithee, the founding executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service and a Fox News contributor, expects Buttigieg “to be one of the big storylines” coming out of the debate.

“In every single debate so far, the person who came in as the front-runner or with momentum has faced serious incoming,” noted Elleithee, a senior spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign who later served as communications director for the Democratic National Committee.

“In each one of them, the person in the crosshairs stumbled,” he emphasized. “And so the question for Buttigieg is, now that he’s that guy, how does he handle the incoming?”

Veteran Democratic consultant and communications strategist Lynda Tran said Buttigieg “is on the rise, and that means he should anticipate the other candidates on stage this week to set their sights on his campaign.”

The 37-year-old candidate is the youngest in the large field of Democratic White House hopefuls – and Tran spotlighted the “generational contrast” between Buttigieg and the other top-tier contenders, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who are all in their 70’s.

“Look to the upcoming debate to see the top tier of candidates try to turn his youth and fresh take into a vulnerability,” said Tran, who ran communications for the Obama-era grassroots group Organizing for America and was a founding partner of the communications firm 270 Strategies.

BUTTIGIEG WEBSITES ON 'BLACK AMERICA' PLANS USED STOCK PHOTOS OF MINORITIES

The debate also comes as Buttigieg faces increased media attention for his lack of support in polling among black voters, who make up around 20 percent of the Democratic presidential primary electorate.

The debate’s being held in Georgia's largest city and capital – which is home to a large and vibrant African-American community. Elleithee said Buttigieg “has got to begin show soon that he can get some traction with black voters and this is a good opportunity for him to do that.”

“He would do himself a lot of good to come out tonight and find some way to connect with black voters in a real way,” he suggested.

Tran looked to the candidate’s numerous policy proposals, saying that Buttigieg’s “newly minted status at the top of the polls in Iowa also offers an opportunity for the mayor to discuss his expansive ideas about how to govern the nation.”

Buttigieg likely won’t be the only candidate with a mark on his or her back.

“I suspect that Warren’s going to be the other main target of attacks tonight,” Elleithee predicted. “Her Medicare-for-all plan has proven to be a major target. So she’s going to continue to be pushed on it. In the last debate, she was pushed on it. She stumbled. She then came out with details and now those details are going to be fair game.”

Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota were the two candidates who took on Warren over her government-run single-payer health care proposal at last month’s debate.

And Elleithee said “if there’s going to be any real fireworks tonight, I think the thing to look for will be Buttigieg versus Warren on this issue. They have both emerged as sort of the standard-bearers of the two sides of the Medicare-for-all debate, that has sort of become a proxy issue for this bigger discussion about the direction of the Democratic Party. “

But Tran said Warren should be able to take the heat.

“I expect Senator Warren will continue to take swings from others on stage around the costs of her health care proposal — but if the previous debate matchups are any indicator of how she will respond, I don’t see her being ruffled by the attention,” she predicated.

As he has at every debate to date, Biden will also be in the spotlight. Although he’ll likely not face the scrutiny he weathered in the first three debates – when he was the unrivaled front-runner – Elleithee stressed that “Biden’s going to need to have a good night. He’s still in good shape but he’s slipped a bit in the early states. He’s got to stop the slide.”

And Tran noted that “as before, voters will have their eyes on Vice President Joe Biden to see how he manages questions about his experience — the good and the bad — and his reaction to the impeachment hearings currently underway.”

Tran also highlighted that she’s going to “be on the lookout” on whether Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang have breakout moments.

“Both have delivered strong performances in the past rounds of debates, albeit without surging in the polls as a result. But they both bring unique perspectives to the stage and it’s not too late to shift the dynamics heading into Iowa,” she explained.

Elleithee’s got his eye on Sen. Kamala Harris of California, a one-time top tier contender who’s seen her White House bid plummet this autumn.

“She’s got to see if she can claw her way back in,” he said.

And he pointed to Klobuchar, “who keeps having steady debate performances that haven’t translated into significant support in the polls. She’s inched up a little bit. She had a very good debate performance last time. Can she replicate that and this time turn it into some sort of real bump in support.”

“This is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement,"" Obama said. He said Americans ""like seeing things improved. But the average American doesn't think that we have to completely tear down the system and remake it. And I think it's important for us not to lose sight of that.""

It seems clear that President Obama was directing his comments at the two farthest-left major Democratic presidential candidates – Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont – as well as the four freshmen congresswomen collectively known as “the Squad.”

OBAMA TAKES VEILED SHOT AT WARREN AND SANDERS, WARNS 2020 DEMS AMERICANS DON’T WANT TO ‘TEAR DOWN THE SYSTEM’

Obama is right. We had an American Revolution in 1776 that changed history for the better and gave birth to our great nation. But many Americans are alarmed by talk of a second revolution that will move America so far left that millions of people will feel left out.

Americans want sound solutions – not simply solutions that sound good – that will make major improvements to our country. But they want the equivalent of a home remodeling for our nation’s government – not a demolition that will blow up what works as well as what needs replacing.

You can be sure that President Trump will work to demonize whoever the Democrats nominate to run against him next year. Trump will call his opponent a wild-eyed socialist who will raise taxes sky-high on everyone, impose crazy new regulations, destroy our economy and take away our freedoms. Democrats need to nominate someone who can show such Trump claims are nonsense, and can appeal to centrist voters as well as those on the far left.

The polls back up Obama’s advice for Democrats to avoid extremism.

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg is surging in the polls in the nomination race because he is seen as progressive but not radical by many voters. The 37-year-old military veteran is seen as the future of the Democratic Party by many – and if he doesn’t get the nomination next year has plenty of time to compete in the years ahead.

Buttigieg has taken sizeable leads over the other top-tier candidates – former Vice President Joe Biden, Warren and Sanders – in some polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, where the first two nominating contests will be held in February. A lot can change between now the first votes, but Mayor Pete is clearly a strong contender.

Like Biden and many of the second-tier candidates, Buttigieg is taking the path recommended by Obama – seeking evolution rather than revolution.

While the revolutionary faction of the Democratic Party wants ""Medicare-for-all,"" Buttigieg favors Medicare “for all who want it.” Under this plan, people who want to keep their employer-provided health insurance can do so. But an affordable, comprehensive public alternative for health insurance would be available for all who want it.

When it comes to guns, Mayor Pete supports a voluntary gun buyback program that voters have voiced strong support for. He rejects mandatory confiscation of assault weapons, like the plan proposed by former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas. That idea was so unpopular it may have contributed to O’Rourke’s decision to end his presidential candidacy not long after he proposed it.

On the issue of immigration, Buttigieg again sides with the majority of voters. He wants citizenship for Dreamers – immigrants brought to the U.S. without legal authorization as children. About 77 percent of voters favor this sensible plan

At the same time, Buttigieg wants to enforce our immigration laws, but with less severe penalties and without separating immigrant children from their parents. And the mayor rejects calls from some Democrats to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.

Like Biden and some candidates in the back of the pack of Democratic contenders, Buttigieg wants to fix what’s broken in our country and unite us around our common goals and aspirations – the exact opposite of what President Trump has tried to do by fanning the flames of division and spewing hateful rhetoric in his speeches and tweets.

Not too long ago, “experts” thought a black presidential candidate couldn’t be elected until the far future. Barack Obama waged a brilliant presidential campaign and proved them wrong, and then won reelection against all odds. So he has the best credentials of anyone to know what Democrats need to do to send Trump into a well-deserved political retirement.

There are no silver medals for the second-place finishers in presidential elections. The losing candidate can write a book about what might have been, but can’t accomplish anything for the American people. All his or her brilliant plans will amount to nothing.

Democrats need to focus on the need to defeat President Trump as their top priority. To do this they have to nominate a pragmatic candidate who can appeal to moderate Democrats, independents, and even some Republicans turned off by Trump’s conduct in office.

Democratic candidates need to remember that Obama got to the White House by calling for change – not revolution.

“On the one hand, it featured a fantastic all-woman moderation team, and on the other, it was hosted by a media company with serious problems related to workplace sexual assault and harassment,” UltraViolet Action co-founder Shaunna Thomas said in a statement to Fox News.

NBC MUST CLEAN UP ‘TOXIC CULTURE,’ 2020 DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES DEMAND AHEAD OF MSNBC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

“This debate was also defined by what was not addressed: workplace sexual abuse, and the fact that MSNBC, and its parent company Comcast/NBC Universal, have a serious problem with silencing survivors, enabling abuse, and creating a culture of impunity where employees were simply unsafe,” Thomas added.

NBCUniversal did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

At one point, former Vice President Joe Biden missed an opportunity to bring attention to the issue during MSNBC’s debate.

“The #MeToo movement has forced a cultural reckoning around the issue of sexual violence and harassment against women in America. Are there specific actions that you would take, early in your administration, to address this problem?” NBC News' White House correspondent Kristen Welker asked Biden, setting up the 2020 presidential hopeful to call for changes at the Peacock Network.

The former vice president, who was not among the five candidates to sign a harshly worded letter demanding parent company Comcast to “prevent future harassment and abuse at NBC and MSNBC,” had a chance to call out the scandal-inundated Peacock Network but ultimately went a different direction.

MATT LAUER, NBC’S ‘TOXIC CULTURE’ LOOM OVER MSNBC’S DEMOCRATIC DEBATE

Biden instead gave a widely panned answer in which he said “the culture of how women are treated” needs to change before repeatedly saying we need to keep “punching” at domestic violence. He appeared to believe that the #MeToo movement is focused on domestic violence, as opposed to sexual assault and harassment.

“No man has a right to raise a hand to a woman, in anger, other than in self-defense… we have to just change the culture, period. And keep punching at it and punching at it and punching at it,” Biden said as he punched the air, drawing a snicker from the audience.

“No, I really mean it,” Biden said, apparently unaware of the irony that evoked the laughter.

NBC KILLED MY SEX ASSAULT STORY AFTER FARROW'S WEINSTEIN PIECE, AUTHOR CLAIMS

Earlier this week, Tom Steyer, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren signed a letter urging the Democratic National Committee to hold NBC accountable for its “toxic culture” after a series of sexual harassment scandals related to Weinstein and Lauer.

UltraViolet helped putting the letter together and said Biden was invited to partake but ultimately didn’t sign it.

NBC News chairman Andy Lack and his top deputy, Noah Oppenheim, refused to hire an outside investigator to determine who knew about Lauer’s alleged sexual misconduct. UltraViolet’s letter called on parent company Comcast to step in and “conduct an independent investigation into the toxic culture that enabled abusers and silenced survivors” at NBC.

MADDOW CELEBRATES NYT REPORTERS WHO EXPOSED WEINSTEIN SCANDAL, IGNORES HOW NBC SPIKED SAME STORY

But the message apparently fell on deaf ears and Lack dodged the subject when approached by Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple backstage during the debate.

Wemple, who attended the debate and bumped into Lack backstage, said he assumed the NBC News boss would “want to express his confidence in NBC News’s efforts to date” or even blow off some steam.

“Not so fast,” Wemple wrote, adding that Lack quickly shut down questions about conducting an investigation.

“I don’t have anything to say about it. . . . I don’t know much about it,” Lack told Wemple.

An NBC News insider with knowledge of the relationship between NBC’s high-level executives doesn’t think the network will take action anytime soon.

“Andy Lack is the Rasputin of network news. He has [NBC Universal CEO Steve] Burke and [Comcast CEO] Roberts so wrapped around his finger that God himself couldn’t force an independent investigation — which Andy knows would certainly result in his ouster,” the insider told Fox News."

“I’m wondering if you have a comment on this report, and court filing, out of Arkansas that your son Hunter just made you a grandfather again,” Fox News’ Peter Doocy asked.

“No, that’s a private matter and I have no comment,” Biden fired back before attacking the reporter.

“Only you would ask that,” Biden said. “You’re a good man. You’re a good man. Classy.”

CNN’S CHRIS CUOMO MOCKED AFTER ATTEMPT TO DISPROVE TRUMP’S PHONE THEORY WITH CALL TO MOM FAILS

DNA tests reportedly confirm ""with scientific certainty"" that Hunter Biden is the father, according to court documents filed in Arkansas on Wednesday.

In a motion to partially seal information about the baby from the public as part of an ongoing child support suit, an attorney for Lunden Alexis Roberts, the child's mom, asked that the name, sex and any other identifying information of the infant, referred to as Baby Doe in court documents, be withheld from public court records to protect the child from any attention associated with Joe Biden's prominency.

The attorney, Clinton Lancaster, informed the court in Independence County that because onetime Vice President Joe Biden ""is considered by some to be the person most likely to win his party’s nomination and challenge President Trump on the ballot in 2020,” the child and those close to him or her should be entitled to the same protections afforded to Biden's other kin.

""Baby Doe's paternity could put the child and those close to the child at risk of harm for the same reasons the Biden family is protected by the United States Secret Service,"" the document said.

MEDIA'S ‘CLUMSY HANDLING’ OF BOTCHED REPORT ATTRIBUTING OBAMA-ERA STATS TO TRUMP BLASTED BY CRITICS

""The goal is to make identifying information about the child more difficult to obtain,"" Lancaster told Fox News.

Roberts' paternity suit was first filed on May 28 when she alleged that she and Hunter Biden “were in a relationship” and that “Baby Doe” was born in August 2018 “as a result of that relationship,” according to reports by The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.

BIDEN CAMPAIGN ACCIDENTALLY SENDS FUNDRAISING EMAIL CELEBRATING DEBATE PERFORMANCE HOURS BEFORE EVENT BEGINS

In July, Biden denied having sexual relations with Roberts, according to an article by The New Yorker. He agreed to submit to a paternity test in October. Wednesday's court filings said Biden ""is not expected to challenge the results of the DNA test or the testing process.""

This isn’t the first time Biden found an issue with Doocy’s questions on the campaign trail.

Back in August, Doocy issued a live fact check when Biden claimed to reporters that he drew larger crowds than other Democratic candidates.

""What I'm trying to do is go around from town to town and I'm drawing as big of crowds, or bigger than anybody,"" Biden said. ""Have you seen anybody draw bigger crowds than me in this state?""

CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP

""Yes,"" Doocy responded before noting that he saw a bigger crowd for Sen. Elizabeth Warren when she visited Des Moines in January.

""The vice president didn't seem to like that because a few minutes later he singled me out,"" Doocy explained, saying Biden referred to himself as a “big boy” during an exchange.

In September, Biden stuck his finger in Doocy’s face and told him to “ask the right questions” when the reporter attempted to get a comment on Hunter Biden’s overseas business dealings.

Reports have indicated the decision to replace “quid pro quo” with “bribery” when speaking of President Trump’s phone call to Ukraine’s president came from focus groups conducted in key battleground states. Among the questions asked of people was whether ""quid pro quo,"" ""extortion"" or ""bribery"" was the best description of the president’s alleged conduct. The groups found ""bribery"" to be the most descriptive and ""damning.""

Armed with their talking points, Democrats at the House Intelligence Committee hearing, across the country and on TV programs, began using the word ""bribery."" Listening to some of the montages compiled by conservative media is hilarious. It is straight out of “newspeak” in George Orwell’s novel, “1984,” which the author said was “designed to diminish the range of thought.”

MIKE HUCKABEE: DEMOCRATS' TRUMP IMPEACHMENT THEATRICS A SIGN OF THEIR GROWING DESPERATION — IT'S NOW A PARODY

This represents the death rattle of a party once known for promoting big ideas. Last week, the stock market achieved another record high, the Dow Jones Industrial Average topping 28,000, fattening the savings of current and future retirees.

If government is the solution, how much more money does it need to solve problems and why haven’t those problems been solved by now?

While not everyone is invested in the market, when companies make money, they tend to hire more people. It is why unemployment is at record, or near record, lows and the number of employed at record highs. Anyone wanting a job can find one, if they are willing to accept an entry-level position and work hard to move up. Many companies offer education benefits to their employees.

Democrats are desperate to get rid of the president (though the Senate will never convict him), because one more term of prosperity, especially for minorities, who have mostly been tied to their party, could mean a shift in loyalty. If that shift in African-American voters from Democrat to Republican is even as small as 10 percent, Democrats would be doomed in 2020 and possibly beyond.

Success is a better and more motivating theme than envy, greed and entitlement, as promoted by Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. The Wall Street Journal reported that under Warren’s ""Medicare-for-all"" scheme, some would be taxed above 100 percent and that her proposals are so grandiose her “wealth tax” would fall far short of paying for it all.

Given the poor stewardship of the federal government with the record amounts of tax dollars it already receives, why does anyone believe sending more money to Washington and placing additional tax penalties on successful people would suddenly mean politicians might become fiscally responsible?

If government is the solution, how much more money does it need to solve problems and why haven’t those problems been solved by now?

It’s all a sham and a scam. We hear the same rhetoric every four years, especially about the wealthy and successful needing to pay their “fair share.” Democrats never tell us what they mean by fair, but it appeals to the envy and class warfare their party promotes.

America is a land of opportunity, not guaranteed outcome. There are more opportunities than ever for a good education, good jobs and so many other things that make the country unique.

On Wednesday evening, 10 Democratic candidates for president will stand on the stage for the fifth Democratic debate in Atlanta.

On Fox Nation's ""My Take,"" Varney said that the Democratic field is not generating any of the excitement that the 2016 Republican primary debates produced.

""Who could forget the Republican debates four years ago? Riveting for one reason -- candidate Donald J. Trump. Legendary insults and put-downs. Republicans and Democrats alike glued. The TV ratings actually went up because everyone wanted to know what he would say next. What zinger would be unleashed? Political debate became must-see viewing,"" he said.

""Fast forward to the Democrat debates this year,"" Varney continued. ""Oh, what a difference. Viewers are already turning off. Between the first debate in June and the one last month, the TV audience was actually cut in half. There's no Trump in these debates. There's no standout character, no sharp questioning either. It's boring.""

According to Nielsen Media Research, the fourth debate of the Democratic primary season drew 8.3 million viewers, making it the second-least watched debate of the cycle. The most-watched primary debate was in August 2015, when more than 24 million viewers watched a Republican primary debate in Cleveland on the Fox News Channel.

""Ten candidates on the stage tonight, six more who didn't qualify. Bloomberg - he's not going to be there, nor will [former Mass., governor] Deval Patrick -- not there. But it's a very crowded field. They really need to narrow it down. And they haven't found a way to do it yet. And they're miles apart on policy. They are split,"" observed Varney.

Varney argued that Donald Trump made the difference on the Republican side four years ago, but Democrats lack the star power.

""Donald Trump really did upend the Republican Party. His debate performance crushed the Republican establishment and his go for the throat policies brought a raft of new voters to his party.""

""Perhaps the Democrats believe a socialist like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders can similarly upend their party or that the moderates can somehow make a dramatic comeback. Dream on!"" he concluded. ""If you can't get people to watch, if you are already boring your supporters, you're in bad shape.""

On the roster: Sondland bursts the ‘perfect’ bubble - Time Out: Nineteen Thanksgivings ‘over there’ - Buttigieg takes the lead in New Hampshire - Opossum like its hot



SONDLAND BURSTS THE ‘PERFECT’ BUBBLE

President Trump’s ambassador to the European Union didn’t tell us anything today that wasn’t obvious from the moment America first read the transcript of Trump’s phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart.



Gordon Sondland certainly added some context with his descriptions of the Keystone Cops routine by Rudy Giuliani. Sondland also made clear what some had once adamantly denied: That help for Ukraine was contingent on the president’s political demands.



But anybody who didn’t think those things were true after reading Trump’s transcript was either being facile or is a few chicken wings short of a dozen.



Democrats can be happy to have had such a senior official from the Trump administration – a political appointee of the president himself – make their case so clearly.



But there is reason for relief among Republicans, too.



The House GOP has been a messaging disaster throughout this process. It’s not entirely their fault given the contradictory, scattershot efforts from the White House, but it has not been pretty at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue.



Democrats with uncharacteristic discipline have homed in on the concept of the president abusing his broad foreign policy powers to try to harm his leading political rival.



Seemingly on a daily rotating basis, the president’s defenders in Congress have tried out myriad defenses. He didn’t do it! If he did do it, everyone else does it! The process is unfair! Trump was just worried about corruption!



The worst version of this stuff has been the tortured explanations about the “bigger” story in Ukraine. As Democrats tell their simpler story about presidential misconduct, some Republicans have been trying to tell a more convoluted one about the real nature of Ukrainian politics.



Sondland’s testimony today should put that all to rest, and that is good news for the GOP.



As we have long argued here, Republicans should be following the playbook laid out in 1998 by Bill Clinton and his team.



Much as with Clinton’s seamy conduct with a White House intern, Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of what Trump did to the Ukrainian president. Poll after poll shows that two-thirds or more of voters think the president acted wrongly.



But on the question of whether Trump should be impeached or removed from office, voters are much more evenly divided. That difference points the way to the useful strategy going forward and a way for the White House to meaningfully diminish support for impeachment.



There’s no sense in trying to convince persuadable voters that what Trump did was “perfect.” That’s a fool’s errand. But arguing that the offense doesn’t rise to the level of impeachment, especially less than a year away from an election, is a political winner.



Acknowledging Trump’s mistake, reminding voters that the system worked – the necessary aid to fight Russia’s military advances in Ukraine did flow to Kyiv – and pointing to next November seems like a much more fruitful place for the GOP to be.



If that approach is consistently applied it could make Democrats look like they are obsessed with obvious, old issues rather than dealing with the matters important to voters.



But that will require Republicans, including the president, to abandon their doctrine of denial and excuse. Sondland made doing so much easier today.



THE RULEBOOK: BIG BOSS MAN

TIME OUT: NINETEEN THANKSGIVINGS ‘OVER THERE’

NYT: “This year marks the 19th Thanksgiving since the beginning of the wars, occupations, operations and deployments that together form what the Pentagon calls the global war on terrorism. Across all this time and terrain, a few million American service members, and those who labored beside them, have accumulated vast and varied observances of a quintessential American holiday spent at war. Earlier this year The Times asked service members, veterans and civilians who have celebrated Thanksgiving in a conflict zone to share their photographs and memories. … Like combat service itself, Thanksgivings for troops have been wildly uneven experiences. Depending on each place and time, dinners and celebrations veered between scarcity and excess, spectacle and sorrow, isolation and crowds. But common themes inform veteran memories, including the longing for home caused by separation from families and lifelong rituals, the bonds many veterans formed with fellow troops, and recollections of rich palettes of emotions associated with the particular circumstances troops lived in while deployed.”

BUTTIGIEG TAKES THE LEAD IN NEW HAMPSHIRE

WMUR9: “The Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll of 255 likely Democratic primary voters shows that [Pete] Buttigieg, supported by 25 percent, now holds a 10 percentage point lead over former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who are tied for second at 15 percent. Buttigieg is substantially ahead of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is in fourth place at 9 percent. Rounding out the top 10 were Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar at 6 percent; billionaire activist Tom Steyer of California at 5 percent; U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey at 3 percent each; entrepreneur Andrew Yang of New York at 2 percent and California Sen. Kamala Harris at 1 percent. Thirteen percent of those polled said they were undecided.”



Can he bring the momentum to the debate stage? - Politico: “Pete Buttigieg will take the stage at Wednesday’s debate as a serious threat to the top Democratic presidential candidates for the first time. … But that surge in the early states comes with the glare of additional scrutiny, including on his struggles appealing to African American voters in other states, and the growing likelihood of attacks from Democratic opponents eager to blunt Buttigieg’s rise and regain momentum of their own. … Though the campaign has heated up recently, many candidates are still reluctant to go on the attack and risk alienating a rival’s supporters. But Buttigieg’s strong polling out of Iowa has already come with fresh criticism over several campaign missteps related to one of the mayor’s biggest weaknesses: his lack of support among African American voters, which has contributed to his lower numbers in polls of Democrats in South Carolina and nationally.”



Michael Kruse: Are your neighbors ready for Mayor Pete? - Politico: “Up till now, Buttigieg’s youth and sexual orientation largely have been calling cards in the Democratic primary, distinguishing him in a field whose front-runners are in their 70s and whose back-of-the-packers are too numerous for most people to keep track of. … When it comes to the prospect of a gay president, the numbers right now are sobering for Buttigieg: Polling suggests that the country was more ready for a black president back in 2008 than it is for a gay president now. And last month, the current iteration of the question of readiness became front-page news when a leaked memo revealed focus groups commissioned by the Buttigieg campaign suggested his sexuality could be ‘a barrier’ for black voters in at least South Carolina, the crucial fourth nominating contest—and a bellwether for the party’s more socially conservative voters.”



Biden steps up efforts in Iowa - WaPo: “[Biden] has been in Iowa fewer times than any of the other top-tier candidates, and he is spending much less on advertising than several of his rivals. And now, even as he retains a national lead in polling, he is falling behind in a state that doomed his campaign the last time he sought the presidency. Biden’s campaign once shrugged off the potential impact of losing the caucus vote on Feb. 3, but concerns lately have grown about just how poorly he might do. Desperate to avoid a humiliating showing that might have broader repercussions, Biden is planning a renewed focus on Iowa, with an expectation that both he and his wife, Jill, soon will make the kind of extended trips to the state that other candidates have for months. They also have launched a new digital campaign and could have additional endorsements in the works.”



Foundering Harris calls talk of campaign crack-up ‘gossip’ - Nevada Independent: “California Sen. Kamala Harris is dismissing recent reports of unrest within her campaign and chatter among attendees of a Democratic convention in her home state about whether she should drop out of the presidential race as no more than ‘gossip.’ … With about two and a half months until the first presidential preferences are cast, Harris said that it is “still early” and that “to follow the punditry around what is going on with the campaign is to overlook what’s happening on the street…” But she remained vague when asked whether that enthusiasm had at all changed her campaign’s plans to shift staff from Nevada to Iowa. ‘I will keep you posted but I’m going to tell you something: Nevada is very, very important to me,’ Harris said.”



Adieu, Wayne Messam - Axios: “Miramar Mayor Wayne Messam (D-Fla.) announced on Wednesday that he is dropping out of the 2020 presidential race. The big picture: Messam got into the race after Southbend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg's announcement, however, the small-town Florida mayor failed to gain the momentum that Buttigieg's campaign achieved. Messam did not make it on to any debate stage and struggled to see significant gains in polling. Messam is Miramar's first black mayor, the owner of a construction company, a former college football player and the son of a Jamaican sugarcane worker.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“What do you make of the Chairman’s larger than anyone else’s chair? It looks like Queen Elizabeth’s throne to me. Is that standard for the Congress? To me, it makes him look diminutive.” – Tom Winter Lt. Col. USMC (Ret), Steele, Mo.



[Ed. note: It is standard practice for chairmen and chairwomen. And it always has seemed a little silly.]



“So, it would seem that the Democratic Party fear a journalist [Tim Alberta] that is not necessarily in the tank for the Democratic agenda. What a load of disservice to the voters! Our country is greatly endangered by partisan politics and journalism that does not stay clear of taking sides. Perhaps, I am not in the swing of things, but I would like to believe that the American voter could figure out what to do or think without a partisan scorecard. That is probably naive.” – Lisa Lentz, Hollister, Calif.



[Ed. note: Both sides suffer from this affliction. In 2016, Republicans were talking openly about only allowing avowed partisans or right-leaning opinion mongers to moderate debates. It was nearly as pitiful as the effort to assassinate the character of Alberta, one the most respected, finest political reporters working in Washington today because he started his career at a right-leaning publication. I dare anyone to find any partisan hackery in Alberta’s work, wherever he was doing it. But both Republicans and Democrats make a self-defeating mistake when they look for gentle coddling instead of incisive questioning. Are Democrats better off for letting opinion journalists play patty-cake with their candidates these many months? No chance. Insulating candidates from tough questioning has not only help keep the field at its bloated size but also allowed them to ignore the most important issues when it comes to winning in 2020. It’s farcical that Elizabeth Warren made it until October before anyone put the bite on her about her formless, pie-in-the-sky health insurance program.

I agree with your often-stated position that the dearth of humanities in secondary education, especially civics and western civilization, is tearing away the very fabric of our republic - an educated citizenry. Unfortunately, I do not see the education elites embracing the classics and the much-maligned vocational education necessary to sustain our grand experiment.” – Dan Burch, Turlock, Calif.

OPOSSUM LIKE ITS HOT

AP: “A movement is growing in North Carolina to prevent the act of so-called ‘opossum dropping.’ The practice involves suspending an opossum in a transparent box on New Year’s Eve and slowly lowering it the ground as people count down to midnight. The Raleigh News & Observer reported Monday that a western North Carolina town had conducted opossum drops for 24 years. Brasstown in Clay County dropped its last opossum in 2018. But the organization Animal Help Now wants to prevent anyone from doing it elsewhere. That will require a change to state law that allows people to do anything they want to opossums for five days each year. The group started a petition and gathered almost 160,000 signatures before the petition closed. The group says it’s continuing its legislative efforts.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“It is pure fiction that this pro-American sentiment was either squandered after Sept. 11 or lost under the Bush Administration. It never existed.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in Time magazine on Nov. 9, 2003.

Potentially problematic figure for Democrats set to testify as key Trump impeachment witnesses undercut claims of 'quid pro quo,' 'bribery' and 'cover-up'

Republicans sounded a celebratory note as House Democrats' impeachment inquiry wrapped up another day of public hearings Tuesday evening, saying the day's witnesses had served only to highlight fundamental problems in the case against President Trump.

“Did anyone ever ask you to bribe or extort anyone at any time during your time in the White House?"" House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., asked at one point in Tuesday's afternoon hearing.

Former National Security Council (NSC) aide Tim Morrison: ""No.""

Former U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker: “No.""

Later, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., covered similar ground in asking Morrison and Volker about Trump's fateful July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. When asked whether there were indications of quid pro quo, bribery or extortion, they each repeatedly answered, ""No.""

The answers underscored a problem facing House Democrats in the second week of public hearings in their impeachment inquiry. With more witnesses testifying, more soundbites have emerged that may help Republicans and the Trump campaign argue that the proceedings were politically motivated theater, long in the works and foreshadowed openly by Democrats for months, if not years. Click here for a complete summary of Tuesday's testimony.

A 'Gordon Problem' for Democrats: Democrats' troubles with their case against Trump may continue Wednesday with Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union and perhaps impeachment inquiry's most anticipated witness. Sondland repeatedly has frustrated Democrats' narrative by contradicting several other key witnesses in the probe. Sondland, critics argue, has a credibility problem.

In a closed-door hearing, Sondland revised his prior testimony to say that he told a top Ukrainian official that U.S. aid would likely not resume until the country issues a corruption statement. Democrats quickly hailed the revelation as proof that Trump tried to pressure Zelensky into investigating Joe Biden's family business dealings in the country in exchange for the release of about $400 million in military aid. However, in prior testimony, Sondland said he had texted Ambassador Bill Taylor, the U.S. chargé d'affaires in Ukraine, that in September saying there was no quid pro quo.

Democrats to hold fifth presidential primary debate

The Democratic Party will hold its fifth presidential primary debate in Atlanta on Wednesday night and it will likely be overshadowed by the Trump impeach inquiry hearing. The following 10 candidates qualified to be on stage for Wednesday's debate: Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren, Andrew Yang.

Wednesday's debate comes amid uncertainty over whether Democrats truly have a candidate who could defeat President Trump next November as former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has seriously flirted with the idea of entering the race and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick declared his candidacy last week. South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg may find himself under attack Wednesday night as he has surged in recent polls in Iowa, which holds the nation’s first caucuses in February.

Acquitted Navy SEAL faces review, potential loss of Trident pin, senior US defense official says

The top admiral in the Navy plans to announce a review in which peers will determine whether to remove SEAL Eddie Gallagher's Trident pin following his highly publicized war crimes case, a senior U.S. defense official told Fox News on Tuesday. The Trident is bestowed on SEALs to reinforce ""good order and discipline"" across the force, the source told Fox News.

Commander Nate Christensen, a spokesman for the Navy, told Fox News that the chief of naval operations, Adm. Mike Gilday, supported Rear Adm. Collin Green's decision to uphold a mitigated sentence against Gallagher, who was acquitted in July of killing an Islamic State fighter in Iraq. A San Diego jury sentenced Gallagher to a reduced rank and four months of confinement, which he has already served, for posing with the body of the dead ISIS fighter, which was considered the least egregious of the seven charges he was facing. President Trump signed an order last Friday reversing the sentence and ordering the promotion of Gallagher back to the rank he held before his trial.

Bribery. Contempt of Congress. Obstruction of justice.

Those are the four potential articles of impeachment that House Judiciary Committee Democrats could draw up against President Trump as soon as next month, Fox News is told, after all scheduled public hearings before the House Intelligence Committee wrapped up on a testy note Thursday.

At a meeting with top GOP senators and Trump administration officials at the White House on Thursday afternoon, Fox News is told there was a consensus that should Trump be impeached by the House, the GOP-controlled Senate should hold a full trial, rather than ignore the issue.

Reports have surfaced that Republicans were considering even holding a long trial to disrupt the 2020 presidential primaries. Several Democrats seeking to unseat Trump -- including Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders -- are senators who would need to divert at least some of their campaigning time toward a potential trial.

""I think most everybody agreed there's not 51 votes to dismiss it before the managers get to call their case,"" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News after huddling with other top Republican senators and White House officials. ""The idea you would dismiss the trial before they presented the cases is a non-starter. You're not going to get a motion to dismiss.""

It remained possible the House Intelligence Committee could schedule more hearings, although no additional hearings are expected during Thanksgiving week. Or, the committee could prepare a report on its findings for the House Judiciary Committee -- which would have the option of holding its own hearings or simply drafting articles of impeachment outright.

Under a resolution passed by House Democrats on the Rules Committee this past October, Trump and the White House potentially would have more rights to defend themselves in Judiciary Committee hearings. For example, attorneys for the president could participate in such hearings. But, in a bid for leverage, Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., would be allowed under the rules to deny ""specific requests"" by Trump representatives if the White House continued refusing to provide documents or witnesses sought by Democratic investigators.

A possible timetable for impeachment has been unclear. It’s generally thought the Judiciary Committee may hold a ""markup"" in which it writes articles of impeachment in mid-December. If that were to happen, it's possible the full House could vote on articles of impeachment sometime close to Christmas. That would be a similar timeframe to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton: The House impeached Clinton just before Christmas in 1998. The Senate trial then began in January 1999.

KEY WITNESSES UNDERCUT CLAIMS OF 'QUID PRO QUO' .... DIPLOMAT THEN CLAIMS 'QUID PRO QUO,' BUT ADMITS IT'S BASED ENTIRELY ON HIS PRESUMPTIONS

However, the House theoretically could pass articles of impeachment, but delay a vote to send them to the Senate for consideration -- perhaps to delay handing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., control over the proceedings.

Graham, coming out of the White House discussion, added that ""we didn't talk about"" how to mount a case to ""defend the president.""

Instead, Graham said, the discussion centered around ""how would the trial start -- you know, they'll make a request for witnesses, but that would have to be granted by the Senate, I guess that's the way we did it before.""

Graham continued, ""My preference was to try to follow the Clinton model as much as possible.""

Clinton was acquitted on both perjury and obstruction counts in February 1999, with each vote falling fall short of the two-thirds majority required for removal.

In the Senate, impeachment procedures would allow witnesses to be called by the president's defense lawyers, GOP senators and a team of House Democrats who essentially would serve as prosecutors. The big catch: Republicans would need enough votes from the 53 GOP senators to muster a majority and prevent Democrats from blocking them.

Assuming Republican senators would stay united -- not a guarantee -- Trump's defenders could try refocusing the inquiry by seeking testimony from people like Hunter Biden, the son of 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden.

During his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that led to a whistleblower complaint touching off the impeachment inquiry, Trump suggested Zelensky investigate Joe Biden's dealings in Ukraine, including the former vice president's successful push to have Ukraine's top prosecutor fired by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid while the prosecutor was investigating Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden served on the board.

Hunter Biden held that lucrative role despite limited expertise while his father oversaw Ukraine policy as vice president. If Senate Republicans could put forward evidence showing the president's concerns about the Bidens' potential corruption were legitimate, they could undercut Democrats' central argument for impeachment.

On Thursday, Graham strongly signaled that Hunter Biden would be a key GOP focus. He sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting documents ""related to contacts between Vice President Biden, Hunter Biden, other Obama administration officials and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.""

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent testified behind closed doors last month that he and other officials had qualms about Hunter Biden's lucrative role on the board of Burisma at the time.

STATE DEPT OFFICIAL SAYS BIDEN, BURISMA NOT MENTIONED REGARDING AID HOLDUP

""What Republicans want to do is broaden the story,"" said David Hoppe, who was chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., during Clinton's impeachment trial.

And, Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said Thursday he'd like Senate testimony from the still-anonymous whistleblower, whose House appearance Democrats have blocked. Cramer said he might also like to hear from both Bidens and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif.

The White House has signaled it will mount an aggressive defense. ""When this goes over to the Senate, you know, the people that actually started this thing, they are going to be put on the stand,"" Eric Trump, the president's son, told reporters Thursday. He said that would include ""heads of the Democratic Party.""

For his part, Trump has argued that U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland's testimony before the Intelligence Committee was a total exoneration.""I just noticed one thing and that would mean it’s all over,"" Trump said on the White House lawn before reading from handwritten notes taken during Sondland’s testimony. Sondland testified about a conversation with Trump during which he asked the president what he wanted from Ukraine.

""It was a very short, abrupt conversation,"" the ambassador said. ""He was not in a good mood, and he just said, 'I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing.' Something to that effect.""

* It looked to me like voters learned quite a bit during last night’s Democratic presidential primary debate.

* For the second time this week, a poll out of Iowa offers good news for Pete Buttigieg: a new Iowa State University poll found the former mayor leading the Democrats’ presidential field with 26%, followed by Elizabeth Warren at 19%. Bernie Sanders is a very close third with 18% followed by Joe Biden at 12%.

* In New York, a new Siena College poll found Biden leading Warren among Democratic voters, 24% to 14%, with the former vice president’s support fueled in large part by African-American support. Sanders is a close third with 13% in the poll.

* Google announced changes to its policy on microtargeted advertising yesterday. As the Wall Street Journal reported, “Under the new policy, political ads can only be targeted based on users’ age, gender, and location at the postal-code level. Political advertisers will also still be able to display ads based on the content of the page a user is viewing. Advertisers would no longer be able to target political ads based on users’ interests inferred from browsing or search history.”

* And Wayne Messam, the mayor of Miramar, Fla., ended a longshot presidential campaign yesterday. By my count, that still leaves 17 Democratic presidential candidates in the party’s 2020 field."

DEMS HUSTLE TO SEPARATE BLACK VOTERS FROM BIDEN

WaPo: “[Pete] Buttigieg and [Cory] Booker were just two of the Democratic candidates fanning out across Atlanta and the South on Thursday, following Wednesday’s contentious debate in that city, in an increasingly urgent effort to court black voters. The multiple events highlighted a puzzle central to the Democratic primary: Can anyone chip away at black voters’ support for former vice president Joe Biden — and if not, what does it mean for the Democrats’ ­chances? … Thursday also saw some Democrats turning on each other on racial issues, with increased pressure to make headway before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses. … [Kamala] Harris and Booker are both prominent African American political figures, but they also have struggled to attract significant support from black voters. In an apparent effort to change that, both Harris and Booker ramped up their rhetoric on racial issues Wednesday night. Biden, for his part, boasted that he has more support from black leaders than any other candidate — ‘because they know me, they know who I am.’”



Warren makes plea to black women - Politico: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren made a full-throated pitch to black women in a much-hyped speech [in Atlanta] on Thursday night as she tries to tear into former Vice President Joe Biden’s durability with black voters. ‘The fighters I want to talk about tonight are black women,’ Warren said at Clark Atlanta University, a historically black college. … Warren cast her own campaign as learning from workers battles led by black women, from washerwomen in 1881 to the formation of the National Domestic Workers of America in the 1960s and ‘70s. … Black women, the Democratic Party’s most loyal voting bloc, led every part of the program on Thursday with the exception of Warren herself.”



Biden heckled over Obama-era deportations - Fox News: “A seemingly frustrated Joe Biden advised a protester to ‘vote for Trump’ Thursday after being confronted about the Obama administration’s record on deportations. It happened at a South Carolina town hall event for the former vice president, before about 800 people at Lander University in Greenwood. Biden seemed to lose his cool when Carlos Rojas, an immigration activist with a group called Cosecha Movement, pointed out that more illegal immigrants were deported during Obama's first two years as president than during Trump’s. … ‘You should vote for Trump. You should vote for Trump,’ Biden retorted, turning away from the man. … At that point a group of protesters -- many holding signs reading ‘Not 1 More Deportation’ – began to chant that very phrase, demanding Biden pledge to stop deporting all illegal immigrants if he’s elected president. ‘No matter what happens, if someone commits perjury, they should be deported,’ Biden pressed.”



Buttigieg campaign staffers unionize - HuffPo: “Field organizers on the presidential campaign of Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., have joined a union, the campaign announced on Thursday. It said in a statement that the campaign had ‘voluntarily recognized’ that IBEW Local 2321 would serve as the sole union representing campaign staffers who have the title ‘organizer.’ Staffers were informed that the organizers were forming a union, and the campaign supported that move on Thursday afternoon. In a statement, Buttigieg campaign manager Mike Schmuhl said the campaign welcomed the workers’ decision.”



Continetti: Why candidates matter most - Free Beacon: “The coverage of recent Democratic victories in Kentucky and Louisiana has emphasized President Trump's failure to drag Republicans past the finish line. Analysts have focused on Democratic strength in the suburban regions of these states, as well as in the suburbs of Mississippi where the Republican won by a surprisingly slim 5 points. Both of these storylines are important. But so is this one: Candidate attributes and positions matter more than a state or nation's partisan tilt. President Trump and his 17 Democratic challengers might want to pay attention. … Likability and empathy matter more than wonkiness and purity. … How ironic if Democrats so concerned with electability in the primary find themselves backing a flawed and uninspiring candidate in the general. Because, you see, fate can work that way in the Twilight Zone.”



Bloomberg files federal papers to join race - WaPo: “Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg filed federal papers Thursday declaring himself a Democratic candidate for president, a potentially disruptive move that could upend the party’s nomination fight this spring. The filing, coming just eight months after Bloomberg ruled out a bid because he believed it would be too hard to win the Democratic nomination, reflects his view that the field of Democratic contenders was not well positioned to win next year and that a candidate with his experience, political moderation and deep pockets would have a better chance of defeating President Trump in a general election. Advisers said Thursday that the filing was a step toward running for president, following several state ballot registrations, but not an official announcement or public signal that he had made a final decision.”



Obama warns Dems about ‘purity tests’ in the primary - AP: “Former President Barack Obama warned Democrats on Thursday against adopting ‘purity tests’ in the presidential primary and said any adversity the candidates face in the contest will make whoever emerges an even stronger nominee. Obama spoke to about 100 donors during a question-and-answer session with Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez in Los Altos Hills, California. The event came a day after the fifth Democratic presidential primary in Atlanta and as the 17-person field continues to expand, with the expected entry of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in the coming days. … Obama urged Democrats to ‘chill out,’ saying, ‘The truth of the matter is that every candidate on that stage believes we should provide’ better health care and education and address climate change.”



John Hendrickson: What Joe Biden can’t bring himself to say - Atlantic: “Maybe you’ve heard Biden talk about his boyhood stutter. A non-stutterer might not notice when he appears to get caught on words as an adult, because he usually maneuvers out of those moments quickly and expertly. But on other occasions, like that night in Detroit, Biden’s lingering stutter is hard to miss. He stutters—­if slightly—on several sounds as we sit across from each other in his office. … Biden looks down. He pivots to the distant past, telling me that the letter s was hard when he was a kid. ‘But, you know, I haven’t stuttered in so long that it’s hhhhard for me to remember the specific—’ He pauses. ‘What I do remember is the feeling.’”



THE RULEBOOK: SHORT AND SWEET

“It may perhaps be asked, how the shortness of the duration in office can affect the independence of the Executive on the legislature… One answer to this inquiry may be drawn from the principle already remarked that is, from the slender interest a man is apt to take in a short-lived advantage, and the little inducement it affords him to expose himself, on account of it, to any considerable inconvenience or hazard.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 71



TIME OUT: NOT ALL BLARNEY

Smithsonian: “Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman provides a decades-spanning look at one man’s relationship to organized crime, organized labor, and the truth – however slippery that concept may be. That man, Frank Sheeran, played by Robert De Niro, was a union official and mob associate whose story intersects with labor organizer Jimmy Hoffa, the Mafia, and the Kennedys. The film, Scorsese’s first to stream exclusively on Netflix, is adapted from the 2004 Sheeran biography I Heard You Paint Houses by writer Charles Brandt, in which Sheeran claims that he killed Hoffa, amongst other figures. Hoffa’s sudden disappearance in 1975 still looms large as one of America’s longest-standing unsolved mysteries…. And while many Hoffa scholars think Sheeran’s claims are bogus, and that Scorsese … got the story wrong, the film’s portrait of how organized crime became interwoven with the labor movement and the highest levels of government in the 20th century carries many elements of truth.”

HEARINGS DONE, HOUSE PLOTS NEXT STEPS ON IMPEACHMENT

Politico: “The public phase of the House Intelligence Committee’s investigation of President Donald Trump’s Ukraine scandal appears to have wrapped. But even most House Democrats aren’t clear what happens next. The Judiciary Committee will draft and vote on articles of impeachment and send those to the full House for debate, that much is clear. But how the Judiciary panel completes the already unorthodox impeachment process is still up in the air. Though lawmakers and aides expect the 1998 proceedings against former President Bill Clinton to be the model for the Trump case, they’re quick to emphasize they haven't been told how the endgame will play out. In fact, Judiciary Committee members have received little guidance from party leaders on how the panel will conduct the proceedings or the timeframe for completing them, according to interviews with more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers and aides.”



White House, Senate GOP plan for brief trial starting in January - WaPo: “A group of Republican senators and senior White House officials met privately Thursday to map out a strategy for a potential impeachment trial of President Trump, including rapid proceedings in the Senate that could be limited to about two weeks, according to multiple officials familiar with the talks. The prospect of an abbreviated trial is viewed by several Senate Republicans as a favorable middle ground — substantial enough to give the proceedings credence without risking greater damage to Trump by dragging on too long. Under this scenario, described by officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to recount a private meeting, the Senate trial could begin as early as January if the Democratic-controlled House votes to impeach Trump next month as appears increasingly likely.”



Graham readies hearings to target Biden - WaPo: “Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday requesting documents related to former vice president Joe Biden and his communications with Ukrainian officials, a step seen as a GOP effort to counter the House impeachment investigation of President Trump. The inquiry by Graham (R-S.C.) is focused on any calls Biden may have had with Petro Poroshenko, then the Ukrainian president, regarding the firing of the country’s top prosecutor, as well as any that referenced an investigation of Burisma, the Ukrainian natural-gas company that employed Biden’s son Hunter Biden. Graham’s document request suggests he is seeking to legitimize Trump’s accusations that Biden, then vice president, put pressure on Ukraine to fire its lead prosecutor to protect his son, a claim without evidence that has been disputed by officials familiar with the investigation.”



Fear the mustache - Fox News: “Former National Security Adviser John Bolton, whose name has repeatedly surfaced in the impeachment hearings as a witness to key events, returned to Twitter on Friday following an unexplained hiatus since his resignation in September -- cryptically vowing to share the ‘backstory’ while saying his account had been ‘suppressed unfairly.’ ‘Glad to be back on Twitter after more than two months. For the backstory, stay tuned….’ Bolton tweeted early Friday. … Later, Bolton tweeted again, adding: ‘We have now liberated the Twitter account, previously suppressed unfairly in the aftermath of my resignation as National Security Advisor. More to come…’”



Report: FBI lawyer altered document related to Carter Page - NY Post: “A former FBI lawyer allegedly altered a document related to surveillance of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page during the 2016 election, a report said Thursday. The evidence of the altered document was turned over to federal prosecutor John Durham, who is investigating how intelligence was gathered by agencies including the CIA and FBI during the probe into the Trump campaign, CNN reported. It’s not clear what role the altered document played in the investigation into Page — or if a FISA warrant against him would have been okayed without the fudged document, according to the report.”



The Judge’s Ruling: Beware of dangers of an imperial presidency - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano discusses Attorney General William Barr’s role in the impeachment inquiry: “Throughout the House of Representatives' impeachment inquiry, President Trump has been pushing Attorney General William Barr to make a public statement on the president's behalf. …The attorney general, to his credit, has declined to comply with the president's wishes. But he did stir the pot earlier this week with a partisan speech on the nature of the modern American presidency. That speech -- by its assertion that liberals have neutered the presidency or shackled it in chains -- must have been written in an alternate reality. … However, there is something much larger here than Barr's attempts to placate his boss. Barr’s impolitic speech was also a full-throated defense of the imperial presidency, no matter which party occupies the White House.” More here.



TRUMP SAYS POMPEO MAY RUN FOR SENATE

The Kansas City Star: “President Donald Trump acknowledged on Friday that his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is mulling a run for Senate in Kansas next year. In a lengthy phone interview with Fox & Friends, Trump said Pompeo would ‘easily’ win the seat opened by retiring Republican Sen. Pat Roberts. ‘He loves the people of Kansas. If he thought that there was a chance of losing that seat, I think he would do that and he would win in a landslide because they love him in Kansas,’ Trump said. Pompeo’s office declined to comment on the president’s remarks, which come after months of speculation that he might give up his post as top diplomat to launch a Senate run. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, has repeatedly encouraged the former Wichita congressman to enter the race. Pompeo has downplayed his interest, but Trump’s comments ensure that the buzz will persist. Kansas has a filing deadline of June 1, later than many states.”

“Chris, as a reformed Catholic I hooted at this descriptor. Like a ‘near occasion of sin?’ My wife and I love your report and cocktail nightly sharing bits and pieces with each other. We read for balance and you never fail to produce.” – David and Paula Perino, Arivaca, Ariz.

“In re: Monday's podcast: you're totally correct about it being too early for Christmas music, and I share your love of good Advent hymns. You're probably already familiar; but if not, here's the one I have on constant repeat for the season: The John Rutter Christmas Album. Cheers and a happy Thanksgiving to you and yours.” – Deanna Ducher, Hillsdale, Mich.



[Ed. note: Funny you would say so Ms. Ducher! So wonderful are our readers and listeners that I can scarcely sometimes believe it. First, a little context for folks who may have missed the podcast: This is a challenging time of year musically for Christians. Thanksgiving is not quite here and Advent is still more than a week away. Meantime, every store, suggested playlist, Uber driver’s sound system and seemingly every show you watch is trying to cram full-blown Christmas cavalcade down your gullet. But this is a season of Thanksgiving and meditation on those great, good gifts which we have received. It is a time of quiet, thoughtful joy, not bells pealing and hosannas shouting. What to do? Well, what I did was talked to my friend Dana Perino about it and good folks like you overheard. But the gold star goes to Laura Whitney of Paradise, Utah. A self-described “choir nerd,” she offered us an entire playlist of just this kind of music. Most of it is sacred, but it could be enjoyed by anyone. Really beautiful stuff. It included some of my favorites of all time – “It Is Well With My Soul,” “How Can I Keep From Singing?,” Beethoven’s “Eroica,” “Abide With Me” and the magnificent “Come Thou Fount Every Blessing.” The ever-obliging Brianna was kind enough to put it all into a Spotify playlist for us all to enjoy. Because of some platform issues we weren’t able to exactly replicate Ms. Whitney’s original on Spotify, and at least in one case I made the editorial decision to pick Johnny Cash’s version of “I’m Bound For The Promised Land.” But hey, it’s Johnny Cash. We hope you find it as delightful as we do. It will be something wonderful to listen as you are giving thanks and preparing to make merry.]

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is a ""phony and a liar"" looking to paint wealthy people as the enemy, said billionaire and GOP donor Ken Langone on ""Fox & Friends"" Thursday, before calling on her to make her charitable donations public.

""They can call me whatever they want. I still go to work every day... What I am is a grateful American,"" he said. ""What happened to me in my life only happened because my grandparents came to America. She can call me whatever she wants. She's phony. She's a liar, we know that. We know she's a liar, a horrible liar.""

The Home Depot co-founder and philanthropist said Warren's candidacy is being propped up by the media and claimed her millionaire status makes her a hypocrite.

""She's been created by the media,"" he said. ""She's worth $18 million... I don’t want to see her tax returns, it'd make me sick because she does nothing to make it. All I'd like to see is how much money have she and her husband given to charity over the years, as a percentage of their income or as a percentage of their net worth.""

Langone also said it's human nature for others to be jealous of people's success and claimed he's been mischaracterized by those who envy his wealth.

""Human nature is alive and well. And one of the seven deadly sins is envy,"" he said. ""Part of what happens to somebody like me that becomes successful, very successful, my old man used to say to me, 'You want to be successful, but not too successful.' This is an 8th-grade education man, OK? He had wisdom beyond his words.

""That's part of the price,"" Langone added. ""That's OK. People want to think that I've made my money by ripping them off. -- people want to think that I've exploited people? I can’t stop that.""

In Wednesday's Democratic presidential debate, Warren continued to tout her plans to increase taxes on the wealthiest Americans, arguing that she is not trying to punish the rich.

""It's about saying you built something great in this country? Good for you, but you did it using workers all of us helped pay to educate, you did it getting your goods using roads and bridges all of us helped pay for,"" she said."

He was joined by several other candidates on stage in going after the health care overhaul, putting the party's far-left candidates on their heels over what Buttigieg called their ""divisive"" and unrealistic approach.

Reflecting the ever-shifting dynamic in the race, meanwhile, Joe Biden had a mixed performance -- projecting foreign policy strength and siding with Buttigieg against the liberal wing on health care, while also suffering some stumbles on the debate stage. Until recently the unrivaled front-runner in the race, Biden competed for attention Wednesday with three other top-tier candidates -- Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg -- but flubbed when he erroneously stated in front of Sen. Kamala Harris that he had the support of the ""only"" black woman elected to the Senate.

In an odd moment, he also said it's important to ""keep punching at"" the problem of domestic violence, noting that it's ""rarely"" needed for men to hit women in self-defense.

The debate was the candidates' first meeting since Warren said she would gradually guide the nation toward Medicare-for-all, supposedly paid for with a host of tax hikes on the rich and other measures. One by one, several of the candidates -- including Biden, Sen. Cory Booker and Sen. Amy Klobuchar -- raised objections to that plan.

""I’m not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car,"" Klobuchar said at one point.

Buttigieg called for health care reform ""without the divisive step of ordering people onto it,"" saying that ""commanding people to accept that option"" is not the right approach.

""We have a majority to do the right thing if we can galvanize, not polarize, that majority,"" the South Bend mayor said.

And, in a particularly spirited moment, New Jersey Sen. Booker directly took on Warren's proposed wealth tax, saying it would be ineffective as a means of funding her Medicare-for-all plan, along with her proposals to provide free college tuition and erasing student loan debt.

Democrats need to be focused on growing wealth, Booker said, not simply taxing it. Republicans have asserted that, even if all billionaires were somehow taxed out of existence without causing any capital markets distortion, the resulting revenues in the best case scenario would barely pay for three years of Medicare-for-all. (The world's 2,150 billionaires have an approximate combined net worth of $8.7 trillion, and the progressive Urban Institute has said that Medicare-for-all would cost on average $10.2 trillion for three years.)

WHAT HAPPENED IN TODAY'S BLOCKBUSTER IMPEACHMENT TESTIMONY?

Vermont Sen. Sanders, who is arguing for a more immediate shift to a single-payer system, separately sparred with Biden on the issue. Biden argued that Medicare-for-all could not pass Congress, in part because it would force people to lose their private insurance.

""I trust the American people to make a judgment about what is in their interest, and not demand of them what the insurance companies want,"" Biden said. He continued to push for modifications to Obama-era health care reforms instead.

On foreign policy, Biden sounded an authoritative note, declaring that he would restrict arms sales to Saudi Arabia following the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. “We have to speak loudly on violations of human rights,"" he said, unequivocally holding Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman responsible for Khashoggi's death.

Later, in a somewhat awkward moment, Biden prompted some laughter in the audience when he declared that ""we gotta keep punching at"" the problem of domestic violence, and that it is only acceptable to hit a woman in ""self-defense,"" which he said would ""rarely"" occur.

And, Biden asserted that he had the support of ""the only African-American woman who’s ever been elected to the United States Senate"" -- prompting Booker and Harris to dryly remark, ""That's not true.""

Harris noted, “The other one is here.” Biden later corrected himself to say he had the support of the first African-American woman elected to the Senate, referring to former Illinois Democratic Sen. Carol Moseley Braun.

In another notable one-on-one moment, Sanders, touting the benefits of socialism in a discussion with billionaire Tom Steyer, argued that America only has ""eight or nine"" years left to reverse catastrophic effects of climate change, including cities going ""underwater."" United Nations experts made similar claims all the way back in 1989.

As the heated discussion unfolded at the MSNBC debate in Atlanta, Hawaii Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard -- who was recently accused by Hillary Clinton of being a ""Russian asset"" -- offered a blunt assessment: ""Our Democratic Party, unfortunately, is not the party that is of, by and for the people,"" she said.

Gabbard also doubled down on earlier comments that Clinton represents the “personification of the rot in the Democratic Party.” She said the party is influenced by a “foreign policy establishment” that supports regime-change wars. She called it the “Bush, Clinton, Trump foreign policy doctrine.” (Harris then attacked Gabbard for appearing on Fox News.)

Separately, Gabbard unloaded on Buttigieg after he attacked her for a widely-panned meeting with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, who is accused of war crimes.

""You would lack the courage to meet with both adversaries and friends,"" Gabbard shot back, noting that former President John F. Kennedy met with his counterpart in the Soviet Union.

Klobuchar also pointedly criticized Buttigieg, arguing that he ""said the right words"" as a ""local official"" but lacks needed experience.

""I actually have the experience,"" Klobuchar remarked.

""Washington experience is not the only experience that matters,"" Buttigieg retorted. ""There's more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country?""

Meanwhile, Warren unloaded on U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland just hours after his explosive impeachment hearing testimony, saying at Wednesday night's primary debate that he bought his position ""by writing a check for $1 million"" to Trump's inaugural committee.

Warren vowed that if she were elected, ""We are not going to give the ambassador posts to the highest bidder"" -- signaling that the Massachusetts Democratic senator would use the proceedings to advance her outsider message.

However, The Washington Free Beacon noted that Warren repeatedly voted to confirm several of former President Barack Obama's donors to ambassadorships, even when they lacked relevant experience. And, Warren did not object to Sonland's confirmation at the time.

""Read the Mueller report, all 442 pages of it, that show how the president tried to obstruct justice,"" Warren said. ""We have to establish the principle that no one is above the law. We have a constitutional responsibility, and we need to meet it.""

Others on stage also slammed President Trump over the impeachment proceedings.

“We have a criminal living in the White House,” Harris, D-Calif., declared. Citing Sondland's claim that everyone was ""in the loop"" on Ukraine talks at the heart of the probe, she said ""that means it is a criminal enterprise engaged in by the president"" and other top officials.

Not everyone on stage committed to voting to convict the president if he were impeached, however. Klobuchar suggested she wanted Trump removed, but emphasized the importance of seeing all the evidence.

""I have made it very clear that this is impeachable conduct. ... I just believe our jurors is to look at each count and make a decision,"" Klobuchar said, before saying that Trump repeatedly ""puts his own private interests ... in front of our country's interest.""

The debate's initial attention on Trump and Medicare-for-all took some heat off Buttigieg, at least for the debate's beginning moments. His dramatic rise from little-known Indiana mayor to a leading Democratic presidential candidate faced its toughest test on Wednesday, with rivals eager to stall his momentum.

Harris and Buttigieg engaged in a tense but respectful conversation later on in the evening, as Harris discussed the importance of not taking ""women of color"" for granted.

""I do sometimes feel like a stranger in my own country,"" Buttigieg, who is openly gay, remarked.

The debate in Atlanta marked the first time Buttigieg faced other White House hopefuls as an undisputed member of the top tier.

BUTTIGIEG WEBSITES ON 'BLACK AMERICA' PLANS USED STOCK PHOTOS OF MINORITIES

The 37-year old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, gained significant ground in recent months in Iowa, which holds the nation’s first caucuses in February. He is bunched at the top of most polls in Iowa with candidates who have much longer political resumes.

Veteran Democratic consultant and communications strategist Lynda Tran said Buttigieg “is on the rise, and that means he should anticipate the other candidates on stage this week to set their sights on his campaign.”

Some surveys are beginning to show him taking a more convincing lead in the race, at least in early-voting states.

Buttigieg still faces plenty of hurdles to clinching the Democratic nomination, particularly winning over black and other minority voters. But his Iowa rise means he could come under fire from his rivals like never before.

Biden, Warren and Sanders have all faced similar scrutiny in previous debates, and those attacks did little to change the trajectory of the race.

The debate unfolded at a moment of uncertainty about the Democratic field, with some in the party, particularly donors, worried there’s no one positioned to defeat President Trump. Former President Barack Obama took the unusual step last week of warning the party against moving too far to the left.

Speaking to that anxiety, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick entered the Democratic race last week. Billionaire Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, is openly flirting with a bid.

Neither Patrick nor Bloomberg were onstage Wednesday.

With less than three months before voting, much of the nation’s political attention would typically be focused on the primary. Instead, the focus is on the impeachment inquiry against Trump.

Booker faces especially intense pressure. He’s yet to meet the Democratic National Committee’s polling requirements for the December debate, and his campaign acknowledges that he needs to capitalize on the national spotlight.

The New Jersey senator took an apparent shot at Buttigieg at one point, following the news that his campaign had used a stock photo of a woman in Kenya who apparently had nothing to do with the campaign.

“I want to turn back to the issue of black voters,"" Booker said. ""I have a lifetime of experience with black voters. I’ve been one since I was 18. Nobody on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African-American voters.""

In his rousing closing statement Wednesday night, Booker claimed to throw out his prepared remarks to discuss the ""debt"" that all Americans owed because of the country's racist history.

""It is time to fight, and fight together,"" Booker said, as the audience applauded.

Gabbard, for her closing remarks, urged Democrats to defeat the ""divisiveness of Donald Trump"" and ""make Dr. King's dream a reality.""

In his closing statement, Buttigieg offered an olive branch to ""progressives,"" as well as ""moderates"" and ""a lot of future former Republicans,"" emphasizing his efforts to win over moderates throughout the contentious evening.

""I want you to know that everybody is welcome in this movement that we're building,"" Buttigieg remarked.

After the candidates left the stage, progressive author and Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson -- who didn't qualify for Wednesday's debate -- tweeted simply, ""Miss me?

The underwhelming televised event prompted Lahren to hold a vote, of sorts, among panelists on Fox Nation's ""Democratic Debate Reactions,"" asking them which they found ""more boring"" -- the debate or the House-led impeachment hearings.

""That's a tough one for the American people,"" replied Fox News contributor and Fox Nation host David Webb, saying the debate was, ""a repeat of the last debate and the prior debate and probably will be the next debate on December 19th.

""I think that they weren't really debating each other,"" he observed. ""They weren't countering each other, making their arguments, for their part, from their position.""

One of the biggest topics on the debate stage last night was health care, but even on that major issue Fox News contributor and retired U.S. Marine and Johnny ""Joey"" Jones argued that the candidates did not seem to be setting themselves apart.

""The only difference between a moderate Democrat and a progressive is, 'Is this Medicare-for-all with the mandate or Medicare-for-all without?' That's about the only difference at this point,"" he said.

Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have said that they would eliminate private health care insurance plans immediately to make way for a single-payer health care system. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and entrepreneur Andrew Yang have said that they would keep private insurance plans for now. The remaining candidates have advocated for keeping private insurance while expanding public health insurance options.

Erin Elmore, who is a republican strategist and attorney, observed that these positions may present a huge electoral challenge for Democrats.

""Let's say Elizabeth Warren does get this nomination, her Medicare-for-all is toxic in the general. Absolutely toxic. You can't campaign on that against President Trump. And that's the issue here. Can any of these people make it against President Trump? And they don't have that 'It' factor,"" she said.

Webb told the Fox Nation panel: ""Fact is when you take federal spending as a percentage of GDP to that level where you cross the 47 percent line and over the 50 plus percent line, as other socialist democracies, you are a socialist nation. And that's where their spending would take us.""

Jones observed: ""This is why impeachment is so important for them, because they're fighting over who's going to get the consolation prize.

""They're fighting over who's going to be there when the Democrats in Congress beat Trump up so much that they believe the voters won't show up for him,"" he concluded. ""That's the only way they can beat him... and when Trump gets another win and another win between now and November next year, the only hope they have is to impeach him on emotion.""

""Well actually that was the first question of the night,"" observed Lahren, who pointed out that MSNBC debate moderator Rachel Maddow asked former vice president Joe Biden to weigh in on the impeachment hearings, without pressing him on his relation to the scandal.

Webb expressed disbelief that the debate moderators failed to ask Biden a single question about his and his son, Hunter's, dealings in Ukraine.

""You also have to look at his potential problems with influence peddling,"" said Webb, ""We're talking about major issues where his son was involved while he was vice president. He was a member of the Senate, a member of that body. I'm not convicting him. I want the inquiry and the investigation to include him, which would, therefore, if he's innocent, exclude him.""

While many expected the debate to focus attacks on the front runners – including the newly minted member of the club, South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg – that didn’t happen.

However, Sen. Kamala Harris of California delivered a prosecutorial dissection of Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii that was the attack everyone will remember, after the latter criticized the Democratic Party and Harris brought the receipts that Gabbard was never really a member of it.

RISING BUTTIGIEG FENDS OFF ATTACKS, TAKES ON FAR-LEFT FLANK AT DEM DEBATE; BIDEN STUMBLES

Here are the night’s biggest winners and losers:

WINNERS

BIGGEST WINNER: Amy Klobuchar

Overall, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar was the winner of the contest than ran over two hours. She had her best performance by emphasizing her experience, productivity, electoral successes. She also emphasized the fact that women are judged by a different standard than men, citing her criticism of Buttigieg’s lack of experience while he was being hailed as a front-runner last week.

Klobuchar pulled it all together in Atlanta with a number of great points and lines -- many familiar -- but then she delivered the line of the night, ""If you think a woman can’t beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day."" Klobuchar isn’t a front runner and this debate won’t make her one. But, the senator will get another look from voters due to it and that puts her in a better position coming out of the debate than going into it.

SURPRISE WINNER: Joe Biden

Former Vice President Biden is a winner by default. Hiding in plain sight might be the best strategy for him. Biden didn’t have the mistake laden performance of past debates by receding for long stretches in the debate. Still holding on to a national lead, that strategy Wednesday night will help him hold on to it for a bit longer. Biden largely relied on his message that he can beat Trump, has the experience, and can bring people together. That might be enough, for now, to keep him in the post position but it’s not going to win the nomination without a better performance in future debates and on the campaign trail.

SURPRISE WINNER: Kamala Harris

Harris had her best performance in a long time. She went after Trump and Gabbard making the case against both in her best prosecutorial fashion. Harris may never match the electric moment she had when she went after Biden in an earlier debate, but she turned in her best performance since that one by mixing moxie and policy positions. That allows Harris to play for another day when she’s been skating at the edge of collapse. A lack of consistency has bedeviled her candidacy. But on Wednesday night she was the candidate everyone expected her to be in this campaign.

LOSERS

BIGGEST LOSER: Tulsi Gabbard

Running to be the Democratic nominee and criticizing the Democratic Party is not a winning strategy. Gabbard’s criticism of the Party may have been her way of setting up a run as an independent in the general election. Instead, Harris disqualified her for both contests by reciting her embrace of Trump and dictators since the 2016 election. Gabbard then turned her aim on Buttigieg at the end of the debate in yet another curious attack on other Democratic candidates that has been a hallmark of her candidacy.

LOSER: Pete Buttigieg

Buttigieg was the loser in Atlanta. He had the most to gain yet missed the opportunity to set himself apart from the front tier of candidates and generate even more of the momentum initiated by the latest polls. Buttigieg still struggles to address matters of race and that was no different on Wednesday night. The fact that Buttigieg couldn’t make the most of the debate on Wednesday night could foreshadow his ability to put the race away later in the campaign. It is his second turn in the spotlight and under the stage lights on Wednesday night he didn’t shine. Instead, Buttigieg turned in a serviceable appearance at best, missing an opportunity he’s unlikely to get again -- a hot hand going into a debate as a new front-runner.

LOSER: Elizabeth Warren

Debates have been Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s bread and butter. No one has more plans, policies, or points and makes them better than Warren…but not on Wednesday night. For some reason, Warren didn’t have it. She made better points with more detail than any of the other candidates but her delivery and presence were off. A performance like those from her other debates would have helped Warren stem a tough week or two of poll numbers in early primary states. Instead, she will have to hit the trail to do it until the next debate.

LOSER: Bernie Sanders

The independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders didn’t do anything to help himself on Wednesday night. Same lines, same attacks, same Bernie Sanders. His performance means that Sanders won’t turn his drop in the polls around with the Atlanta debate. He has plenty of money to stay in the race for months to come. But, that doesn’t mean he’s going to win a contest in the process and that’s why debates like the one on Wednesday night matter.

LOSER: Cory Booker

In every debate, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker has a moment…and that’s it. It’s just a moment. That’s not enough for him or his candidacy to make a move. Booker’s performance Wednesday night isn’t going to move the polls for him and it’s unlikely he is going do anything else at this point that will do it.

LOSERS: Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang

Neither entrepreneur Andrew Yang nor billionaire activist Tom Steyer were able to make a real mark in this debate to make a move in the polls with voters. Steyer resorted to reciting lines from his TV ads during much of the debate. Yang had a few good lines. But, at this point, that’s a costly missed opportunity for both candidates.

LOSER: Deval Patrick

“You know, I look at broadband the way I think people decades ago -- the 20s, 30s -- looked at electricity,"" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders told a crowd in Des Moines this month. ""Broadband is a basic necessity of life today."" He added, ""If you don't have quality broadband, no one is going to come into that town.""

INDEPENDENTS SOURING ON IMPEACHMENT AS INQUIRY HEATS UP, POLLS INDICATE

Some candidates are promising that, if elected, they would expand it rapidly over the next four years.

""I pledge to you, as your president I will make sure that we connect all the households with raw broadband by 2022,” Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said during a recent meet and greet in Wisconsin.

The state of Georgia is notorious for its slow connectivity in rural areas and local elected officials are making it a key issue and highlighting their constituents’ concerns.

“What we’ve heard a lot of families have to drive into town....and they have to go and sit in a Chick-fil-A or a Starbucks cafe somewhere where they can get public Wi-Fi,"" said Steve Gooch, a Republican state senator in Georgia.

He added: ""The kids have to come into town to get access to internet.""

Among the candidates, former Vice President Joe Biden is calling for $20 billion in broadband spending, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling for $85 billion and Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg is calling for $80 billion. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) already spends $4.5 billion a year on broadband.

Buttigieg has called for a public option for broadband, Warren wants to give local municipalities more control over their own broadband networks and Biden wants to extend service to tribal areas and offer subsidies to rural Americans to get better internet.

But the intractable issue has long been an unwillingness for large tech conglomerates to do the heavy lifting themselves.

“You run into this problem with private organizations where it is difficult for them from a financial perspective to justify the costs in those areas,” said tech expert Russell Holly.

Increasing access to rural broadband could be part of the Democratic strategy to woo those who might have voted for President Trump in 2016. But for those who study voting behavior, they are skeptical. The tangible advantages of infrastructure reform are not immediate.

“It’s going to be several years before we start to see this impact, whereas what are the issues that are going to strike the pocketbook within the next twelve months, I think that’s going to strike a nerve with voters,” said Emory Business School professor David Schweidel.

But without high-speed internet, the knowledge available to rural voters is limited once in the run-up to an election. Voters may not see hardly any of the digital ads candidates spend millions of dollars on. Logistically, getting the word out about polling location changes could hinder turnout.

“Just being able to share that information in a way that affects a large group of people is easier in a larger city where there’s faster internet access,” said Holly.

The digital divide does happen to be narrowing, according to the FCC.

The percentage of the population with access to broadband has increased from 83.6 percent in 2013 to 93.5 percent in 2017.

Whether voters enter the ballot box with the issue on their mind remains to be seen.

“I haven’t heard of a life or death situation yet, but I think there are situations where...people can’t get access to a telephone or a call into a 911 center...but it’s more of a nuisance,” said Gooch."

Why MSNBC’s Democratic debate made no news,https://www.foxnews.com/media/forgotten-why-msnbcs-democratic-debate-made-no-news,"After a nearly 11-hour hearing on impeaching President Trump, MSNBC and the Washington Post hosted a Democratic debate where the leadoff topic was…impeaching President Trump.

Rachel Maddow, the network’s top liberal voice and lead moderator, kicked off the Atlanta debate Wednesday by noting that Elizabeth Warren is ready to convict the president: “Will you try to convince your Republican colleagues in the Senate to vote the same way? And if so, how?”

Then she asked Amy Klobuchar about having said she’d wait for the evidence: “After the bombshell testimony of Ambassador Sondland today, has that view changed for you?”

SONDLAND DECLARES QUID PRO QUO, PUNDITS CALL TESTIMONY DAMAGING TO TRUMP

Next, Maddow asked Bernie Sanders: “How central should the president's conduct uncovered by this impeachment inquiry be to any Democratic nominee's campaign for president? How central would it be to yours?” And she put the same question to Pete Buttigieg.

And that’s pretty much how the evening went. No wonder the New York Times called it “the debate that wasn’t.”

There were few sparks. Most of the questions were polite, a chance for the 10 contenders to deliver their stump speeches. They said they were for daycare and voting rights and against climate change.

Maybe that’s why it was the lowest-rated debate of the season, seen by 6.5 million viewers—down from 8.5 million for the CNN debate last month.

The two reporters on the panel, MSNBC’s Kristen Welker and the Post’s Ashley Parker, asked some more aggressive questions. But the candidates, with little prodding, also showed little desire to mix it up. What passed for drama was Cory Booker professing shock that Joe Biden wouldn’t support legalizing marijuana. And all the pundit predictions about how Buttigieg would get beat up now that he’s the front-runner in Iowa proved to be wrong.

Andrea Mitchell did note that Mayor Pete won an election in South Bend with 11,000 votes, asking: “Why should Democrats take the risk of betting on you?”

“Because I have the right experience to take on Donald Trump,” he said. That was as rough as it got.

It was all very high road. Warren wasn’t really pressed on her latest explanation for her $20-trillion Medicare for All plan. No one really “won.”

Afterward, things seemed rather clubby. Chris Matthews told Booker during an interview that he did “great” and was inspiring.

And Maddow told Brian Williams: “I felt sitting here like, you know, these 10 candidates are getting a chance to put their best foot forward and make their best cases.” Is that a network’s goal in hosting a presidential debate?

But even if the debate had produced conflict or fireworks, it would have been largely forgotten 10 hours later, when the impeachment hearings resumed. The anchor of MSNBC’s coverage Thursday: Anti-Trump host Nicolle Wallace, who has led or co-anchored every day of the hearings. Matthews anchored one day last week.

Wallace called Fiona Hill’s appearance “some of the most searing testimony” and said it “packed a wallop.” A day earlier, she declared: “I think Gordon Sondland’s testimony changed everything.”

If MSNBC has had a token conservative guest during these hearings, I’ve missed it. And as I keep pointing out, the impeachment coverage on CNN and Fox has consistently been anchored by journalists.

But the Democratic debate was always destined to be overshadowed. Impeachment is consuming all the media oxygen. The debate was barely mentioned all day Wednesday on MSNBC itself until a half hour before it began. And it’s already becoming a footnote.

Obama White House aide David Axelrod tweeted during the Atlanta event, “It may just be me, but maybe the impeachment hearings have left me sapped for this debate. Kind of low energy.”

It wasn’t just you, David."

“This is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement,"" Obama said. He said Americans ""like seeing things improved. But the average American doesn't think that we have to completely tear down the system and remake it. And I think it's important for us not to lose sight of that.""

It seems clear that President Obama was directing his comments at the two farthest-left major Democratic presidential candidates – Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont – as well as the four freshmen congresswomen collectively known as “the Squad.”

OBAMA TAKES VEILED SHOT AT WARREN AND SANDERS, WARNS 2020 DEMS AMERICANS DON’T WANT TO ‘TEAR DOWN THE SYSTEM’

Obama is right. We had an American Revolution in 1776 that changed history for the better and gave birth to our great nation. But many Americans are alarmed by talk of a second revolution that will move America so far left that millions of people will feel left out.

Americans want sound solutions – not simply solutions that sound good – that will make major improvements to our country. But they want the equivalent of a home remodeling for our nation’s government – not a demolition that will blow up what works as well as what needs replacing.

You can be sure that President Trump will work to demonize whoever the Democrats nominate to run against him next year. Trump will call his opponent a wild-eyed socialist who will raise taxes sky-high on everyone, impose crazy new regulations, destroy our economy and take away our freedoms. Democrats need to nominate someone who can show such Trump claims are nonsense, and can appeal to centrist voters as well as those on the far left.

The polls back up Obama’s advice for Democrats to avoid extremism.

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg is surging in the polls in the nomination race because he is seen as progressive but not radical by many voters. The 37-year-old military veteran is seen as the future of the Democratic Party by many – and if he doesn’t get the nomination next year has plenty of time to compete in the years ahead.

Buttigieg has taken sizeable leads over the other top-tier candidates – former Vice President Joe Biden, Warren and Sanders – in some polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, where the first two nominating contests will be held in February. A lot can change between now the first votes, but Mayor Pete is clearly a strong contender.

Like Biden and many of the second-tier candidates, Buttigieg is taking the path recommended by Obama – seeking evolution rather than revolution.

While the revolutionary faction of the Democratic Party wants ""Medicare-for-all,"" Buttigieg favors Medicare “for all who want it.” Under this plan, people who want to keep their employer-provided health insurance can do so. But an affordable, comprehensive public alternative for health insurance would be available for all who want it.

When it comes to guns, Mayor Pete supports a voluntary gun buyback program that voters have voiced strong support for. He rejects mandatory confiscation of assault weapons, like the plan proposed by former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas. That idea was so unpopular it may have contributed to O’Rourke’s decision to end his presidential candidacy not long after he proposed it.

On the issue of immigration, Buttigieg again sides with the majority of voters. He wants citizenship for Dreamers – immigrants brought to the U.S. without legal authorization as children. About 77 percent of voters favor this sensible plan

At the same time, Buttigieg wants to enforce our immigration laws, but with less severe penalties and without separating immigrant children from their parents. And the mayor rejects calls from some Democrats to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. He understands our immigration problems are being caused by the wrong policies, not by the people who enforce those policies.

Like Biden and some candidates in the back of the pack of Democratic contenders, Buttigieg wants to fix what’s broken in our country and unite us around our common goals and aspirations – the exact opposite of what President Trump has tried to do by fanning the flames of division and spewing hateful rhetoric in his speeches and tweets.

Not too long ago, “experts” thought a black presidential candidate couldn’t be elected until the far future. Barack Obama waged a brilliant presidential campaign and proved them wrong, and then won reelection against all odds. So he has the best credentials of anyone to know what Democrats need to do to send Trump into a well-deserved political retirement.

There are no silver medals for the second-place finishers in presidential elections. The losing candidate can write a book about what might have been, but can’t accomplish anything for the American people. All his or her brilliant plans will amount to nothing.

Democrats need to focus on the need to defeat President Trump as their top priority. To do this they have to nominate a pragmatic candidate who can appeal to moderate Democrats, independents, and even some Republicans turned off by Trump’s conduct in office.

Democratic candidates need to remember that Obama got to the White House by calling for change – not revolution.

“On the one hand, it featured a fantastic all-woman moderation team, and on the other, it was hosted by a media company with serious problems related to workplace sexual assault and harassment,” UltraViolet Action co-founder Shaunna Thomas said in a statement to Fox News.

NBC MUST CLEAN UP ‘TOXIC CULTURE,’ 2020 DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES DEMAND AHEAD OF MSNBC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

“This debate was also defined by what was not addressed: workplace sexual abuse, and the fact that MSNBC, and its parent company Comcast/NBC Universal, have a serious problem with silencing survivors, enabling abuse, and creating a culture of impunity where employees were simply unsafe,” Thomas added.

NBCUniversal did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

At one point, former Vice President Joe Biden missed an opportunity to bring attention to the issue during MSNBC’s debate.

“The #MeToo movement has forced a cultural reckoning around the issue of sexual violence and harassment against women in America. Are there specific actions that you would take, early in your administration, to address this problem?” NBC News' White House correspondent Kristen Welker asked Biden, setting up the 2020 presidential hopeful to call for changes at the Peacock Network.

The former vice president, who was not among the five candidates to sign a harshly worded letter demanding parent company Comcast to “prevent future harassment and abuse at NBC and MSNBC,” had a chance to call out the scandal-inundated Peacock Network but ultimately went a different direction.

MATT LAUER, NBC’S ‘TOXIC CULTURE’ LOOM OVER MSNBC’S DEMOCRATIC DEBATE

Biden instead gave a widely panned answer in which he said “the culture of how women are treated” needs to change before repeatedly saying we need to keep “punching” at domestic violence. He appeared to believe that the #MeToo movement is focused on domestic violence, as opposed to sexual assault and harassment.

“No man has a right to raise a hand to a woman, in anger, other than in self-defense… we have to just change the culture, period. And keep punching at it and punching at it and punching at it,” Biden said as he punched the air, drawing a snicker from the audience.

“No, I really mean it,” Biden said, apparently unaware of the irony that evoked the laughter.

NBC KILLED MY SEX ASSAULT STORY AFTER FARROW'S WEINSTEIN PIECE, AUTHOR CLAIMS

Earlier this week, Tom Steyer, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren signed a letter urging the Democratic National Committee to hold NBC accountable for its “toxic culture” after a series of sexual harassment scandals related to Weinstein and Lauer.

UltraViolet helped putting the letter together and said Biden was invited to partake but ultimately didn’t sign it.

NBC News chairman Andy Lack and his top deputy, Noah Oppenheim, refused to hire an outside investigator to determine who knew about Lauer’s alleged sexual misconduct. UltraViolet’s letter called on parent company Comcast to step in and “conduct an independent investigation into the toxic culture that enabled abusers and silenced survivors” at NBC.

MADDOW CELEBRATES NYT REPORTERS WHO EXPOSED WEINSTEIN SCANDAL, IGNORES HOW NBC SPIKED SAME STORY

But the message apparently fell on deaf ears and Lack dodged the subject when approached by Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple backstage during the debate.

Wemple, who attended the debate and bumped into Lack backstage, said he assumed the NBC News boss would “want to express his confidence in NBC News’s efforts to date” or even blow off some steam.

“Not so fast,” Wemple wrote, adding that Lack quickly shut down questions about conducting an investigation.

“I don’t have anything to say about it. . . . I don’t know much about it,” Lack told Wemple.

An NBC News insider with knowledge of the relationship between NBC’s high-level executives doesn’t think the network will take action anytime soon.

“Andy Lack is the Rasputin of network news. He has [NBC Universal CEO Steve] Burke and [Comcast CEO] Roberts so wrapped around his finger that God himself couldn’t force an independent investigation — which Andy knows would certainly result in his ouster,” the insider told Fox News."

“I’m wondering if you have a comment on this report, and court filing, out of Arkansas that your son Hunter just made you a grandfather again,” Fox News’ Peter Doocy asked.

“No, that’s a private matter and I have no comment,” Biden fired back before attacking the reporter.

“Only you would ask that,” Biden said. “You’re a good man. You’re a good man. Classy.”

CNN’S CHRIS CUOMO MOCKED AFTER ATTEMPT TO DISPROVE TRUMP’S PHONE THEORY WITH CALL TO MOM FAILS

DNA tests reportedly confirm ""with scientific certainty"" that Hunter Biden is the father, according to court documents filed in Arkansas on Wednesday.

In a motion to partially seal information about the baby from the public as part of an ongoing child support suit, an attorney for Lunden Alexis Roberts, the child's mom, asked that the name, sex and any other identifying information of the infant, referred to as Baby Doe in court documents, be withheld from public court records to protect the child from any attention associated with Joe Biden's prominency.

The attorney, Clinton Lancaster, informed the court in Independence County that because onetime Vice President Joe Biden ""is considered by some to be the person most likely to win his party’s nomination and challenge President Trump on the ballot in 2020,” the child and those close to him or her should be entitled to the same protections afforded to Biden's other kin.

""Baby Doe's paternity could put the child and those close to the child at risk of harm for the same reasons the Biden family is protected by the United States Secret Service,"" the document said.

MEDIA'S ‘CLUMSY HANDLING’ OF BOTCHED REPORT ATTRIBUTING OBAMA-ERA STATS TO TRUMP BLASTED BY CRITICS

""The goal is to make identifying information about the child more difficult to obtain,"" Lancaster told Fox News.

Roberts' paternity suit was first filed on May 28 when she alleged that she and Hunter Biden “were in a relationship” and that “Baby Doe” was born in August 2018 “as a result of that relationship,” according to reports by The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.

BIDEN CAMPAIGN ACCIDENTALLY SENDS FUNDRAISING EMAIL CELEBRATING DEBATE PERFORMANCE HOURS BEFORE EVENT BEGINS

In July, Biden denied having sexual relations with Roberts, according to an article by The New Yorker. He agreed to submit to a paternity test in October. Wednesday's court filings said Biden ""is not expected to challenge the results of the DNA test or the testing process.""

This isn’t the first time Biden found an issue with Doocy’s questions on the campaign trail.

Back in August, Doocy issued a live fact check when Biden claimed to reporters that he drew larger crowds than other Democratic candidates.

""What I'm trying to do is go around from town to town and I'm drawing as big of crowds, or bigger than anybody,"" Biden said. ""Have you seen anybody draw bigger crowds than me in this state?""

""Yes,"" Doocy responded before noting that he saw a bigger crowd for Sen. Elizabeth Warren when she visited Des Moines in January.

""The vice president didn't seem to like that because a few minutes later he singled me out,"" Doocy explained, saying Biden referred to himself as a “big boy” during an exchange.

In September, Biden stuck his finger in Doocy’s face and told him to “ask the right questions” when the reporter attempted to get a comment on Hunter Biden’s overseas business dealings.

On Wednesday evening, 10 Democratic candidates for president will stand on the stage for the fifth Democratic debate in Atlanta.

On Fox Nation's ""My Take,"" Varney said that the Democratic field is not generating any of the excitement that the 2016 Republican primary debates produced.

""Who could forget the Republican debates four years ago? Riveting for one reason -- candidate Donald J. Trump. Legendary insults and put-downs. Republicans and Democrats alike glued. The TV ratings actually went up because everyone wanted to know what he would say next. What zinger would be unleashed? Political debate became must-see viewing,"" he said.

""Fast forward to the Democrat debates this year,"" Varney continued. ""Oh, what a difference. Viewers are already turning off. Between the first debate in June and the one last month, the TV audience was actually cut in half. There's no Trump in these debates. There's no standout character, no sharp questioning either. It's boring.""

According to Nielsen Media Research, the fourth debate of the Democratic primary season drew 8.3 million viewers, making it the second-least watched debate of the cycle. The most-watched primary debate was in August 2015, when more than 24 million viewers watched a Republican primary debate in Cleveland on the Fox News Channel.

""Ten candidates on the stage tonight, six more who didn't qualify. Bloomberg - he's not going to be there, nor will [former Mass., governor] Deval Patrick -- not there. But it's a very crowded field. They really need to narrow it down. And they haven't found a way to do it yet. And they're miles apart on policy. They are split,"" observed Varney.

Varney argued that Donald Trump made the difference on the Republican side four years ago, but Democrats lack the star power.

""Donald Trump really did upend the Republican Party. His debate performance crushed the Republican establishment and his go for the throat policies brought a raft of new voters to his party.""

""Perhaps the Democrats believe a socialist like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders can similarly upend their party or that the moderates can somehow make a dramatic comeback. Dream on!"" he concluded. ""If you can't get people to watch, if you are already boring your supporters, you're in bad shape.""

Members of the #YangGang were seen chanting ""M-S-N-B-C, hands off our democracy!"" at the Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta, the site of the Democrats' fifth debate.

Yang received the least amount of speaking time of the 10 participants on the debate stage with 6:48, roughly half of the time Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., received. Yang also did not receive a question from the moderators until 32 minutes into the debate.

The hashtags #YangMediaBlackout and #MSNBCFearsYang made waves on social media.

YANG CAMPAIGN RIPS MSNBC'S APOLOGY AFTER NETWORK SNUBBED HIM FROM POLLING GRAPHIC 'FOR THE 15TH TIME'

MSNBC did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

Yang knocked MSNBC during an interview Thursday.

""America saw it. I went 32 minutes without a question and I was raising my hand trying to get a word in edgewise during that time,” Yang said.

Yang's White House bid has exceeded many expectations on the campaign trail. In a recent Iowa poll from CNN and the Des Moines Register, the entrepreneur reached 3 percent support, tying him with Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Cory Booker, D-N.J., along with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, and billionaire donor Tom Steyer.

However, in an on-air graphic of that poll, Yang was missing from the roster -- even though it included former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who polled at 2 percent, and Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., at 1 percent.

""Why does @MSNBC keep leaving out @AndrewYang on their graphics (actually at 3% here)?"" political commentator Ian Bremmer asked Sunday. ""This has happened on a number of occasions, I haven’t seen with any other candidate. It’s not just a slip-up. Unacceptable.""

MSNBC offered an apology to Yang later Sunday, claiming it ""inadvertently"" left him off the graphic and shared a graphic that included him as well as the several candidates who had polled at zero percent.

The Yang campaign didn't seem to welcome the apology.

""Thank you @MSNBC, for making this apology for the 15th time. The #YangGang is very excited for #16,"" Yang campaign manager Zach Graumann reacted.

Writer and vocal Yang supporter Scott Santens previously documented every instance in which MSNBC or CNN left the tech businessman off a graphic.

Between MSNBC, NBC News and NBC digital platforms, Santens' thread included 15 other instances depicting Yang's absence dating back to June. CNN had at least five instances as well."

The field of 2020 candidates is one of the largest in history. Pretty much everybody seems to be running, from the former vice president of the United States to some guy who is literally the mayor of South Bend, which, in case you're wondering, is the fourth biggest city in the state of Indiana. It's smaller than Evansville, but it's slightly larger than Carmel. That guy's running for president.

There are an awful lot of people in this race. And yet the ideological range they're allowed is strikingly narrow. -- Everyone's required to have pretty much exactly the same views on everything. Anyone who dissents, even a little bit, is immediately denounced as immoral or racist or an agent of Russia.

BIDEN HECKLED OVER OBAMA-ERA DEPORTATIONS, TELLS PROTESTER 'YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR TRUMP'

In other words, the Democratic primary race is very much like everything else the left touches. It's strident; it's intolerant. It's almost unbelievably dumb.

Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii is one of the very few willing to challenge the status quo. She's no conservative, of course; she's liberal. But she regularly criticizes her party for becoming reflexively pro-war and pro-corporate monopoly. She did it again Wednesday night during the Democratic primary debate.



Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii: Our Democratic Party, unfortunately, is not the party that is of, by and for the people. It is a party that has been and continues to be influenced by the foreign policy establishment in Washington, represented by Hillary Clinton and others' foreign policy, by the military-industrial complex and other greedy corporate interests.

Oh. Spoken like an old fashioned liberal. There is one left, but things have changed in the rest of the party. Talk like this is a threat to the private equity community, which is now the core of the Democratic Party. So, their chief toady, Kamala Harris, immediately leaped forth to shut it down.

Kamala Harris: I think that it's unfortunate that we have someone on the stage who is attempting to be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States, who during the Obama administration spent four years full-time on Fox News criticizing President Obama --

Gabbard: That is ridiculous, Senator -- that's ridiculous...

Harris: -- Who has spent full time criticizing people on this stage as affiliated with the Democratic Party.

You often hear Democrats claim Donald Trump divides America. Okay, well, they want to unite it.

Well, one way to unite the country would be making an effort to speak to everyone who lives in the country. But that's literally not allowed. The left believes it's wrong to talk to people you disagree with, which is why they boycott this channel and this show.

We have more clips from Wednesday night's debate, but we can tell you now the most important things were never mentioned. One word, for example, nobody mentioned Wednesday night was suicide. And yet suicide has risen by more than a third since 1999.

Life expectancy wasn't mentioned either. It's been dropping for the last three years.

Illegal drugs are only mentioned when they told us the war on drugs is racist, and marijuana needs to be legalized. The rest of it ignored.

Prescription drug companies were attacked, but only for charging too much for their products, not for getting Americans hooked on opioids. The drugs that have fueled the deadliest wave of overdose deaths in the history of this country -- 70,000 people last year -- not mentioned.

The left believes it's wrong to talk to people you disagree with, which is why they boycott this channel and this show.

Democrats did talk about opportunity and inequality, but mostly in racial terms.

Everything for them is in racial terms, of course. Some groups are well off because of their skin color, they told us, while others are not; they're oppressed. America is a racist country they argued again and again and again.

But the truth, if you live here, is that opportunity in America is vanishing for almost everyone -- of all colors. In 1970, for example, 92 percent of 30-year-olds made more money than their parents had at that age. In 2014, only half did. Those are actual numbers that tell you a lot. They're not race-based numbers. They're numbers that tell you that the American dream is in peril. Add to that far higher debt levels and most young people, in the end, are economically worse off than their parents were at the exact same age.

So, opportunity is in decline, and that's a huge problem. There are a lot of reasons for that. One is this: big business has supported open borders with the rest of the world in order to keep wages down.

We don't even know how many illegal immigrants live in this country. We can't even guess to within the nearest million. The best guess, as of right now, is about 22 million people. Tens of thousands more arrive every month.

Democrats don't want to talk about this. On Wednesday night, they never mentioned fixing it. In fact, they pledged to tear down border walls we already have. Can you imagine?

Instead of helping young Americans to have the families they say they want -- and young people say they want to have families but can't afford it -- no Democrat addressed that. Instead, Elizabeth Warren talked about expanding abortion as an ""economic right.""

And that really does sort of sum up perfectly the 2020 Democratic Party. You're poorer and sadder than your parents were but at least the abortion is free.

Hope you're psyched about that.

According to reporting from ""Catch and Kill"" author Ronan Farrow, Lack and NBC News president Noah Oppenheim were directly implicated in the stonewalling of Farrow's harrowing report on Weinstein's sexual predation and discovered that the disgraced film mogul was trying to leverage Lauer's own scandal over the network.

Amid the fallout of Farrow's reporting, there had been growing calls for NBC News to conduct an outside investigation into the allegations surrounding Lauer, the former ""Today"" host. Earlier this week, presidential candidates Tom Steyer and Sens. Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren signed a letter urging the Democratic National Committee to hold NBC accountable for its ""toxic culture,"" ahead of Wednesday night's MSNBC debate.

Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple recalled his encounter with the NBC executive backstage at the MSNBC-hosted debate Wednesday night and saw his opportunity to ""pounce.""

""Given all that activity, surely Lack would want to express his confidence in NBC News's efforts to date, to repudiate Farrow’s reporting and/or to let off some righteous steam? Not so fast,"" Wemple wrote.

Wemple wrote that Lack ""dodged"" his questions about the growing calls for an outside investigation.

""I don't have anything to say about it. ... I don't know much about it,"" Lack said. ""Good to see you.""

After another attempt to get a response, Lack told Wemple, ""I don't really have anything to say about it. I'm here, got a great debate going, so I'll let you go.""

NBCUniversal did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Former Vice President Joe Biden had a chance to call out the scandal-inundated Peacock Network when asked about how he would carry on the #MeToo movement as president at the MSNBC debate, but he ultimately went a different direction.

Biden instead gave a widely panned answer in which he said ""the culture of how women are treated"" needed to change before saying, ""We have to... keep punching"" at domestic violence.

""No, I really mean it,"" Biden said, apparently unaware of what evoked the laughter.

An NBC News insider with knowledge of the relationship between NBC's high-level executives didn't think the network would take action anytime soon.

Bribery. Contempt of Congress. Obstruction of justice.

Those are the four potential articles of impeachment that House Judiciary Committee Democrats could draw up against President Trump as soon as next month, Fox News is told, after all scheduled public hearings before the House Intelligence Committee wrapped up on a testy note Thursday.

At a meeting with top GOP senators and Trump administration officials at the White House on Thursday afternoon, Fox News is told there was a consensus that should Trump be impeached by the House, the GOP-controlled Senate should hold a full trial, rather than ignore the issue.

Reports have surfaced that Republicans were considering even holding a long trial to disrupt the 2020 presidential primaries. Several Democrats seeking to unseat Trump -- including Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders -- are senators who would need to divert at least some of their campaigning time toward a potential trial.

""I think most everybody agreed there's not 51 votes to dismiss it before the managers get to call their case,"" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News after huddling with other top Republican senators and White House officials. ""The idea you would dismiss the trial before they presented the cases is a non-starter. You're not going to get a motion to dismiss.""

It remained possible the House Intelligence Committee could schedule more hearings, although no additional hearings are expected during Thanksgiving week. Or, the committee could prepare a report on its findings for the House Judiciary Committee -- which would have the option of holding its own hearings or simply drafting articles of impeachment outright.

Under a resolution passed by House Democrats on the Rules Committee this past October, Trump and the White House potentially would have more rights to defend themselves in Judiciary Committee hearings. For example, attorneys for the president could participate in such hearings. But, in a bid for leverage, Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., would be allowed under the rules to deny ""specific requests"" by Trump representatives if the White House continued refusing to provide documents or witnesses sought by Democratic investigators.

A possible timetable for impeachment has been unclear. It’s generally thought the Judiciary Committee may hold a ""markup"" in which it writes articles of impeachment in mid-December. If that were to happen, it's possible the full House could vote on articles of impeachment sometime close to Christmas. That would be a similar timeframe to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton: The House impeached Clinton just before Christmas in 1998. The Senate trial then began in January 1999.

KEY WITNESSES UNDERCUT CLAIMS OF 'QUID PRO QUO' .... DIPLOMAT THEN CLAIMS 'QUID PRO QUO,' BUT ADMITS IT'S BASED ENTIRELY ON HIS PRESUMPTIONS

However, the House theoretically could pass articles of impeachment, but delay a vote to send them to the Senate for consideration -- perhaps to delay handing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., control over the proceedings.

Graham, coming out of the White House discussion, added that ""we didn't talk about"" how to mount a case to ""defend the president.""

Instead, Graham said, the discussion centered around ""how would the trial start -- you know, they'll make a request for witnesses, but that would have to be granted by the Senate, I guess that's the way we did it before.""

Graham continued, ""My preference was to try to follow the Clinton model as much as possible.""

Clinton was acquitted on both perjury and obstruction counts in February 1999, with each vote falling fall short of the two-thirds majority required for removal.

In the Senate, impeachment procedures would allow witnesses to be called by the president's defense lawyers, GOP senators and a team of House Democrats who essentially would serve as prosecutors. The big catch: Republicans would need enough votes from the 53 GOP senators to muster a majority and prevent Democrats from blocking them.

Assuming Republican senators would stay united -- not a guarantee -- Trump's defenders could try refocusing the inquiry by seeking testimony from people like Hunter Biden, the son of 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden.

During his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that led to a whistleblower complaint touching off the impeachment inquiry, Trump suggested Zelensky investigate Joe Biden's dealings in Ukraine, including the former vice president's successful push to have Ukraine's top prosecutor fired by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid while the prosecutor was investigating Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden served on the board.

Hunter Biden held that lucrative role despite limited expertise while his father oversaw Ukraine policy as vice president. If Senate Republicans could put forward evidence showing the president's concerns about the Bidens' potential corruption were legitimate, they could undercut Democrats' central argument for impeachment.

On Thursday, Graham strongly signaled that Hunter Biden would be a key GOP focus. He sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting documents ""related to contacts between Vice President Biden, Hunter Biden, other Obama administration officials and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.""

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent testified behind closed doors last month that he and other officials had qualms about Hunter Biden's lucrative role on the board of Burisma at the time.

STATE DEPT OFFICIAL SAYS BIDEN, BURISMA NOT MENTIONED REGARDING AID HOLDUP

""What Republicans want to do is broaden the story,"" said David Hoppe, who was chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., during Clinton's impeachment trial.

And, Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said Thursday he'd like Senate testimony from the still-anonymous whistleblower, whose House appearance Democrats have blocked. Cramer said he might also like to hear from both Bidens and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif.

The White House has signaled it will mount an aggressive defense. ""When this goes over to the Senate, you know, the people that actually started this thing, they are going to be put on the stand,"" Eric Trump, the president's son, told reporters Thursday. He said that would include ""heads of the Democratic Party.""

For his part, Trump has argued that U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland's testimony before the Intelligence Committee was a total exoneration.""I just noticed one thing and that would mean it’s all over,"" Trump said on the White House lawn before reading from handwritten notes taken during Sondland’s testimony. Sondland testified about a conversation with Trump during which he asked the president what he wanted from Ukraine.

""It was a very short, abrupt conversation,"" the ambassador said. ""He was not in a good mood, and he just said, 'I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing.' Something to that effect.""

DEMS HUSTLE TO SEPARATE BLACK VOTERS FROM BIDEN

WaPo: “[Pete] Buttigieg and [Cory] Booker were just two of the Democratic candidates fanning out across Atlanta and the South on Thursday, following Wednesday’s contentious debate in that city, in an increasingly urgent effort to court black voters. The multiple events highlighted a puzzle central to the Democratic primary: Can anyone chip away at black voters’ support for former vice president Joe Biden — and if not, what does it mean for the Democrats’ ­chances? … Thursday also saw some Democrats turning on each other on racial issues, with increased pressure to make headway before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses. … [Kamala] Harris and Booker are both prominent African American political figures, but they also have struggled to attract significant support from black voters. In an apparent effort to change that, both Harris and Booker ramped up their rhetoric on racial issues Wednesday night. Biden, for his part, boasted that he has more support from black leaders than any other candidate — ‘because they know me, they know who I am.’”



Warren makes plea to black women - Politico: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren made a full-throated pitch to black women in a much-hyped speech [in Atlanta] on Thursday night as she tries to tear into former Vice President Joe Biden’s durability with black voters. ‘The fighters I want to talk about tonight are black women,’ Warren said at Clark Atlanta University, a historically black college. … Warren cast her own campaign as learning from workers battles led by black women, from washerwomen in 1881 to the formation of the National Domestic Workers of America in the 1960s and ‘70s. … Black women, the Democratic Party’s most loyal voting bloc, led every part of the program on Thursday with the exception of Warren herself.”



Biden heckled over Obama-era deportations - Fox News: “A seemingly frustrated Joe Biden advised a protester to ‘vote for Trump’ Thursday after being confronted about the Obama administration’s record on deportations. It happened at a South Carolina town hall event for the former vice president, before about 800 people at Lander University in Greenwood. Biden seemed to lose his cool when Carlos Rojas, an immigration activist with a group called Cosecha Movement, pointed out that more illegal immigrants were deported during Obama's first two years as president than during Trump’s. … ‘You should vote for Trump. You should vote for Trump,’ Biden retorted, turning away from the man. … At that point a group of protesters -- many holding signs reading ‘Not 1 More Deportation’ – began to chant that very phrase, demanding Biden pledge to stop deporting all illegal immigrants if he’s elected president. ‘No matter what happens, if someone commits perjury, they should be deported,’ Biden pressed.”



Buttigieg campaign staffers unionize - HuffPo: “Field organizers on the presidential campaign of Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., have joined a union, the campaign announced on Thursday. It said in a statement that the campaign had ‘voluntarily recognized’ that IBEW Local 2321 would serve as the sole union representing campaign staffers who have the title ‘organizer.’ Staffers were informed that the organizers were forming a union, and the campaign supported that move on Thursday afternoon. In a statement, Buttigieg campaign manager Mike Schmuhl said the campaign welcomed the workers’ decision.”



Continetti: Why candidates matter most - Free Beacon: “The coverage of recent Democratic victories in Kentucky and Louisiana has emphasized President Trump's failure to drag Republicans past the finish line. Analysts have focused on Democratic strength in the suburban regions of these states, as well as in the suburbs of Mississippi where the Republican won by a surprisingly slim 5 points. Both of these storylines are important. But so is this one: Candidate attributes and positions matter more than a state or nation's partisan tilt. President Trump and his 17 Democratic challengers might want to pay attention. … Likability and empathy matter more than wonkiness and purity. … How ironic if Democrats so concerned with electability in the primary find themselves backing a flawed and uninspiring candidate in the general. Because, you see, fate can work that way in the Twilight Zone.”



Bloomberg files federal papers to join race - WaPo: “Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg filed federal papers Thursday declaring himself a Democratic candidate for president, a potentially disruptive move that could upend the party’s nomination fight this spring. The filing, coming just eight months after Bloomberg ruled out a bid because he believed it would be too hard to win the Democratic nomination, reflects his view that the field of Democratic contenders was not well positioned to win next year and that a candidate with his experience, political moderation and deep pockets would have a better chance of defeating President Trump in a general election. Advisers said Thursday that the filing was a step toward running for president, following several state ballot registrations, but not an official announcement or public signal that he had made a final decision.”



Obama warns Dems about ‘purity tests’ in the primary - AP: “Former President Barack Obama warned Democrats on Thursday against adopting ‘purity tests’ in the presidential primary and said any adversity the candidates face in the contest will make whoever emerges an even stronger nominee. Obama spoke to about 100 donors during a question-and-answer session with Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez in Los Altos Hills, California. The event came a day after the fifth Democratic presidential primary in Atlanta and as the 17-person field continues to expand, with the expected entry of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in the coming days. … Obama urged Democrats to ‘chill out,’ saying, ‘The truth of the matter is that every candidate on that stage believes we should provide’ better health care and education and address climate change.”



John Hendrickson: What Joe Biden can’t bring himself to say - Atlantic: “Maybe you’ve heard Biden talk about his boyhood stutter. A non-stutterer might not notice when he appears to get caught on words as an adult, because he usually maneuvers out of those moments quickly and expertly. But on other occasions, like that night in Detroit, Biden’s lingering stutter is hard to miss. He stutters—­if slightly—on several sounds as we sit across from each other in his office. … Biden looks down. He pivots to the distant past, telling me that the letter s was hard when he was a kid. ‘But, you know, I haven’t stuttered in so long that it’s hhhhard for me to remember the specific—’ He pauses. ‘What I do remember is the feeling.’”



THE RULEBOOK: SHORT AND SWEET

“It may perhaps be asked, how the shortness of the duration in office can affect the independence of the Executive on the legislature… One answer to this inquiry may be drawn from the principle already remarked that is, from the slender interest a man is apt to take in a short-lived advantage, and the little inducement it affords him to expose himself, on account of it, to any considerable inconvenience or hazard.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 71



TIME OUT: NOT ALL BLARNEY

Smithsonian: “Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman provides a decades-spanning look at one man’s relationship to organized crime, organized labor, and the truth – however slippery that concept may be. That man, Frank Sheeran, played by Robert De Niro, was a union official and mob associate whose story intersects with labor organizer Jimmy Hoffa, the Mafia, and the Kennedys. The film, Scorsese’s first to stream exclusively on Netflix, is adapted from the 2004 Sheeran biography I Heard You Paint Houses by writer Charles Brandt, in which Sheeran claims that he killed Hoffa, amongst other figures. Hoffa’s sudden disappearance in 1975 still looms large as one of America’s longest-standing unsolved mysteries…. And while many Hoffa scholars think Sheeran’s claims are bogus, and that Scorsese … got the story wrong, the film’s portrait of how organized crime became interwoven with the labor movement and the highest levels of government in the 20th century carries many elements of truth.”

HEARINGS DONE, HOUSE PLOTS NEXT STEPS ON IMPEACHMENT

Politico: “The public phase of the House Intelligence Committee’s investigation of President Donald Trump’s Ukraine scandal appears to have wrapped. But even most House Democrats aren’t clear what happens next. The Judiciary Committee will draft and vote on articles of impeachment and send those to the full House for debate, that much is clear. But how the Judiciary panel completes the already unorthodox impeachment process is still up in the air. Though lawmakers and aides expect the 1998 proceedings against former President Bill Clinton to be the model for the Trump case, they’re quick to emphasize they haven't been told how the endgame will play out. In fact, Judiciary Committee members have received little guidance from party leaders on how the panel will conduct the proceedings or the timeframe for completing them, according to interviews with more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers and aides.”



White House, Senate GOP plan for brief trial starting in January - WaPo: “A group of Republican senators and senior White House officials met privately Thursday to map out a strategy for a potential impeachment trial of President Trump, including rapid proceedings in the Senate that could be limited to about two weeks, according to multiple officials familiar with the talks. The prospect of an abbreviated trial is viewed by several Senate Republicans as a favorable middle ground — substantial enough to give the proceedings credence without risking greater damage to Trump by dragging on too long. Under this scenario, described by officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to recount a private meeting, the Senate trial could begin as early as January if the Democratic-controlled House votes to impeach Trump next month as appears increasingly likely.”



Graham readies hearings to target Biden - WaPo: “Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday requesting documents related to former vice president Joe Biden and his communications with Ukrainian officials, a step seen as a GOP effort to counter the House impeachment investigation of President Trump. The inquiry by Graham (R-S.C.) is focused on any calls Biden may have had with Petro Poroshenko, then the Ukrainian president, regarding the firing of the country’s top prosecutor, as well as any that referenced an investigation of Burisma, the Ukrainian natural-gas company that employed Biden’s son Hunter Biden. Graham’s document request suggests he is seeking to legitimize Trump’s accusations that Biden, then vice president, put pressure on Ukraine to fire its lead prosecutor to protect his son, a claim without evidence that has been disputed by officials familiar with the investigation.”



Fear the mustache - Fox News: “Former National Security Adviser John Bolton, whose name has repeatedly surfaced in the impeachment hearings as a witness to key events, returned to Twitter on Friday following an unexplained hiatus since his resignation in September -- cryptically vowing to share the ‘backstory’ while saying his account had been ‘suppressed unfairly.’ ‘Glad to be back on Twitter after more than two months. For the backstory, stay tuned….’ Bolton tweeted early Friday. … Later, Bolton tweeted again, adding: ‘We have now liberated the Twitter account, previously suppressed unfairly in the aftermath of my resignation as National Security Advisor. More to come…’”



Report: FBI lawyer altered document related to Carter Page - NY Post: “A former FBI lawyer allegedly altered a document related to surveillance of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page during the 2016 election, a report said Thursday. The evidence of the altered document was turned over to federal prosecutor John Durham, who is investigating how intelligence was gathered by agencies including the CIA and FBI during the probe into the Trump campaign, CNN reported. It’s not clear what role the altered document played in the investigation into Page — or if a FISA warrant against him would have been okayed without the fudged document, according to the report.”



The Judge’s Ruling: Beware of dangers of an imperial presidency - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano discusses Attorney General William Barr’s role in the impeachment inquiry: “Throughout the House of Representatives' impeachment inquiry, President Trump has been pushing Attorney General William Barr to make a public statement on the president's behalf. …The attorney general, to his credit, has declined to comply with the president's wishes. But he did stir the pot earlier this week with a partisan speech on the nature of the modern American presidency. That speech -- by its assertion that liberals have neutered the presidency or shackled it in chains -- must have been written in an alternate reality. … However, there is something much larger here than Barr's attempts to placate his boss. Barr’s impolitic speech was also a full-throated defense of the imperial presidency, no matter which party occupies the White House.” More here.



TRUMP SAYS POMPEO MAY RUN FOR SENATE

The Kansas City Star: “President Donald Trump acknowledged on Friday that his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is mulling a run for Senate in Kansas next year. In a lengthy phone interview with Fox & Friends, Trump said Pompeo would ‘easily’ win the seat opened by retiring Republican Sen. Pat Roberts. ‘He loves the people of Kansas. If he thought that there was a chance of losing that seat, I think he would do that and he would win in a landslide because they love him in Kansas,’ Trump said. Pompeo’s office declined to comment on the president’s remarks, which come after months of speculation that he might give up his post as top diplomat to launch a Senate run. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, has repeatedly encouraged the former Wichita congressman to enter the race. Pompeo has downplayed his interest, but Trump’s comments ensure that the buzz will persist. Kansas has a filing deadline of June 1, later than many states.”

“Chris, as a reformed Catholic I hooted at this descriptor. Like a ‘near occasion of sin?’ My wife and I love your report and cocktail nightly sharing bits and pieces with each other. We read for balance and you never fail to produce.” – David and Paula Perino, Arivaca, Ariz.

“In re: Monday's podcast: you're totally correct about it being too early for Christmas music, and I share your love of good Advent hymns. You're probably already familiar; but if not, here's the one I have on constant repeat for the season: The John Rutter Christmas Album. Cheers and a happy Thanksgiving to you and yours.” – Deanna Ducher, Hillsdale, Mich.



[Ed. note: Funny you would say so Ms. Ducher! So wonderful are our readers and listeners that I can scarcely sometimes believe it. First, a little context for folks who may have missed the podcast: This is a challenging time of year musically for Christians. Thanksgiving is not quite here and Advent is still more than a week away. Meantime, every store, suggested playlist, Uber driver’s sound system and seemingly every show you watch is trying to cram full-blown Christmas cavalcade down your gullet. But this is a season of Thanksgiving and meditation on those great, good gifts which we have received. It is a time of quiet, thoughtful joy, not bells pealing and hosannas shouting. What to do? Well, what I did was talked to my friend Dana Perino about it and good folks like you overheard. But the gold star goes to Laura Whitney of Paradise, Utah. A self-described “choir nerd,” she offered us an entire playlist of just this kind of music. Most of it is sacred, but it could be enjoyed by anyone. Really beautiful stuff. It included some of my favorites of all time – “It Is Well With My Soul,” “How Can I Keep From Singing?,” Beethoven’s “Eroica,” “Abide With Me” and the magnificent “Come Thou Fount Every Blessing.” The ever-obliging Brianna was kind enough to put it all into a Spotify playlist for us all to enjoy. Because of some platform issues we weren’t able to exactly replicate Ms. Whitney’s original on Spotify, and at least in one case I made the editorial decision to pick Johnny Cash’s version of “I’m Bound For The Promised Land.” But hey, it’s Johnny Cash. We hope you find it as delightful as we do. It will be something wonderful to listen as you are giving thanks and preparing to make merry.]

“You know, I look at broadband the way I think people decades ago -- the 20s, 30s -- looked at electricity,"" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders told a crowd in Des Moines this month. ""Broadband is a basic necessity of life today."" He added, ""If you don't have quality broadband, no one is going to come into that town.""

INDEPENDENTS SOURING ON IMPEACHMENT AS INQUIRY HEATS UP, POLLS INDICATE

Some candidates are promising that, if elected, they would expand it rapidly over the next four years.

""I pledge to you, as your president I will make sure that we connect all the households with raw broadband by 2022,” Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said during a recent meet and greet in Wisconsin.

The state of Georgia is notorious for its slow connectivity in rural areas and local elected officials are making it a key issue and highlighting their constituents’ concerns.

“What we’ve heard a lot of families have to drive into town....and they have to go and sit in a Chick-fil-A or a Starbucks cafe somewhere where they can get public Wi-Fi,"" said Steve Gooch, a Republican state senator in Georgia.

He added: ""The kids have to come into town to get access to internet.""

Among the candidates, former Vice President Joe Biden is calling for $20 billion in broadband spending, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling for $85 billion and Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg is calling for $80 billion. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) already spends $4.5 billion a year on broadband.

Buttigieg has called for a public option for broadband, Warren wants to give local municipalities more control over their own broadband networks and Biden wants to extend service to tribal areas and offer subsidies to rural Americans to get better internet.

But the intractable issue has long been an unwillingness for large tech conglomerates to do the heavy lifting themselves.

“You run into this problem with private organizations where it is difficult for them from a financial perspective to justify the costs in those areas,” said tech expert Russell Holly.

Increasing access to rural broadband could be part of the Democratic strategy to woo those who might have voted for President Trump in 2016. But for those who study voting behavior, they are skeptical. The tangible advantages of infrastructure reform are not immediate.

“It’s going to be several years before we start to see this impact, whereas what are the issues that are going to strike the pocketbook within the next twelve months, I think that’s going to strike a nerve with voters,” said Emory Business School professor David Schweidel.

But without high-speed internet, the knowledge available to rural voters is limited once in the run-up to an election. Voters may not see hardly any of the digital ads candidates spend millions of dollars on. Logistically, getting the word out about polling location changes could hinder turnout.

“Just being able to share that information in a way that affects a large group of people is easier in a larger city where there’s faster internet access,” said Holly.

The digital divide does happen to be narrowing, according to the FCC.

The percentage of the population with access to broadband has increased from 83.6 percent in 2013 to 93.5 percent in 2017.

Whether voters enter the ballot box with the issue on their mind remains to be seen.

“I haven’t heard of a life or death situation yet, but I think there are situations where...people can’t get access to a telephone or a call into a 911 center...but it’s more of a nuisance,” said Gooch."

Why MSNBC’s Democratic debate made no news,https://www.foxnews.com/media/forgotten-why-msnbcs-democratic-debate-made-no-news,"After a nearly 11-hour hearing on impeaching President Trump, MSNBC and the Washington Post hosted a Democratic debate where the leadoff topic was…impeaching President Trump.

Rachel Maddow, the network’s top liberal voice and lead moderator, kicked off the Atlanta debate Wednesday by noting that Elizabeth Warren is ready to convict the president: “Will you try to convince your Republican colleagues in the Senate to vote the same way? And if so, how?”

Then she asked Amy Klobuchar about having said she’d wait for the evidence: “After the bombshell testimony of Ambassador Sondland today, has that view changed for you?”

SONDLAND DECLARES QUID PRO QUO, PUNDITS CALL TESTIMONY DAMAGING TO TRUMP

Next, Maddow asked Bernie Sanders: “How central should the president's conduct uncovered by this impeachment inquiry be to any Democratic nominee's campaign for president? How central would it be to yours?” And she put the same question to Pete Buttigieg.

And that’s pretty much how the evening went. No wonder the New York Times called it “the debate that wasn’t.”

There were few sparks. Most of the questions were polite, a chance for the 10 contenders to deliver their stump speeches. They said they were for daycare and voting rights and against climate change.

Maybe that’s why it was the lowest-rated debate of the season, seen by 6.5 million viewers—down from 8.5 million for the CNN debate last month.

The two reporters on the panel, MSNBC’s Kristen Welker and the Post’s Ashley Parker, asked some more aggressive questions. But the candidates, with little prodding, also showed little desire to mix it up. What passed for drama was Cory Booker professing shock that Joe Biden wouldn’t support legalizing marijuana. And all the pundit predictions about how Buttigieg would get beat up now that he’s the front-runner in Iowa proved to be wrong.

Andrea Mitchell did note that Mayor Pete won an election in South Bend with 11,000 votes, asking: “Why should Democrats take the risk of betting on you?”

“Because I have the right experience to take on Donald Trump,” he said. That was as rough as it got.

It was all very high road. Warren wasn’t really pressed on her latest explanation for her $20-trillion Medicare for All plan. No one really “won.”

Afterward, things seemed rather clubby. Chris Matthews told Booker during an interview that he did “great” and was inspiring.

And Maddow told Brian Williams: “I felt sitting here like, you know, these 10 candidates are getting a chance to put their best foot forward and make their best cases.” Is that a network’s goal in hosting a presidential debate?

But even if the debate had produced conflict or fireworks, it would have been largely forgotten 10 hours later, when the impeachment hearings resumed. The anchor of MSNBC’s coverage Thursday: Anti-Trump host Nicolle Wallace, who has led or co-anchored every day of the hearings. Matthews anchored one day last week.

Wallace called Fiona Hill’s appearance “some of the most searing testimony” and said it “packed a wallop.” A day earlier, she declared: “I think Gordon Sondland’s testimony changed everything.”

If MSNBC has had a token conservative guest during these hearings, I’ve missed it. And as I keep pointing out, the impeachment coverage on CNN and Fox has consistently been anchored by journalists.

But the Democratic debate was always destined to be overshadowed. Impeachment is consuming all the media oxygen. The debate was barely mentioned all day Wednesday on MSNBC itself until a half hour before it began. And it’s already becoming a footnote.

Obama White House aide David Axelrod tweeted during the Atlanta event, “It may just be me, but maybe the impeachment hearings have left me sapped for this debate. Kind of low energy.”

It wasn’t just you, David."

Her comments came just after a Democratic primary debate in which Booker, D-N.J., took on top-tier candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and former Vice President Joe Biden. Booker also touted his understanding of black voters, saying “I have a lifetime of experience with black voters. I’ve been one since I was 18.""

According to RealClearPolitics' polling average, Booker has 1.3 percent of support for the Democratic nomination. He typically polls among the top 10 candidates but lags behind several other Democrats.

Members of the #YangGang were seen chanting ""M-S-N-B-C, hands off our democracy!"" at the Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta, the site of the Democrats' fifth debate.

Yang received the least amount of speaking time of the 10 participants on the debate stage with 6:48, roughly half of the time Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., received. Yang also did not receive a question from the moderators until 32 minutes into the debate.

The hashtags #YangMediaBlackout and #MSNBCFearsYang made waves on social media.

YANG CAMPAIGN RIPS MSNBC'S APOLOGY AFTER NETWORK SNUBBED HIM FROM POLLING GRAPHIC 'FOR THE 15TH TIME'

MSNBC did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

Yang knocked MSNBC during an interview Thursday.

""America saw it. I went 32 minutes without a question and I was raising my hand trying to get a word in edgewise during that time,” Yang said.

Yang's White House bid has exceeded many expectations on the campaign trail. In a recent Iowa poll from CNN and the Des Moines Register, the entrepreneur reached 3 percent support, tying him with Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Cory Booker, D-N.J., along with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, and billionaire donor Tom Steyer.

However, in an on-air graphic of that poll, Yang was missing from the roster -- even though it included former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who polled at 2 percent, and Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., at 1 percent.

""Why does @MSNBC keep leaving out @AndrewYang on their graphics (actually at 3% here)?"" political commentator Ian Bremmer asked Sunday. ""This has happened on a number of occasions, I haven’t seen with any other candidate. It’s not just a slip-up. Unacceptable.""

MSNBC offered an apology to Yang later Sunday, claiming it ""inadvertently"" left him off the graphic and shared a graphic that included him as well as the several candidates who had polled at zero percent.

The Yang campaign didn't seem to welcome the apology.

""Thank you @MSNBC, for making this apology for the 15th time. The #YangGang is very excited for #16,"" Yang campaign manager Zach Graumann reacted.

Writer and vocal Yang supporter Scott Santens previously documented every instance in which MSNBC or CNN left the tech businessman off a graphic.

The field of 2020 candidates is one of the largest in history. Pretty much everybody seems to be running, from the former vice president of the United States to some guy who is literally the mayor of South Bend, which, in case you're wondering, is the fourth biggest city in the state of Indiana. It's smaller than Evansville, but it's slightly larger than Carmel. That guy's running for president.

There are an awful lot of people in this race. And yet the ideological range they're allowed is strikingly narrow. -- Everyone's required to have pretty much exactly the same views on everything.

BIDEN HECKLED OVER OBAMA-ERA DEPORTATIONS, TELLS PROTESTER 'YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR TRUMP'

In other words, the Democratic primary race is very much like everything else the left touches. It's strident; it's intolerant. It's almost unbelievably dumb.

Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii is one of the very few willing to challenge the status quo. She's no conservative, of course; she's liberal. But she regularly criticizes her party for becoming reflexively pro-war and pro-corporate monopoly. She did it again Wednesday night during the Democratic primary debate.



Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii: Our Democratic Party, unfortunately, is not the party that is of, by and for the people. It is a party that has been and continues to be influenced by the foreign policy establishment in Washington, represented by Hillary Clinton and others' foreign policy, by the military-industrial complex and other greedy corporate interests.

Oh. Spoken like an old fashioned liberal. There is one left, but things have changed in the rest of the party. Talk like this is a threat to the private equity community, which is now the core of the Democratic Party. So, their chief toady, Kamala Harris, immediately leaped forth to shut it down.

Gabbard: That is ridiculous, Senator -- that's ridiculous...

Harris: -- Who has spent full time criticizing people on this stage as affiliated with the Democratic Party.

You often hear Democrats claim Donald Trump divides America. Okay, well, they want to unite it.

Well, one way to unite the country would be making an effort to speak to everyone who lives in the country. But that's literally not allowed. The left believes it's wrong to talk to people you disagree with, which is why they boycott this channel and this show.

We have more clips from Wednesday night's debate, but we can tell you now the most important things were never mentioned. One word, for example, nobody mentioned Wednesday night was suicide. And yet suicide has risen by more than a third since 1999.

Life expectancy wasn't mentioned either. It's been dropping for the last three years.

Illegal drugs are only mentioned when they told us the war on drugs is racist, and marijuana needs to be legalized. The rest of it ignored.

Prescription drug companies were attacked, but only for charging too much for their products, not for getting Americans hooked on opioids. The drugs that have fueled the deadliest wave of overdose deaths in the history of this country -- 70,000 people last year -- not mentioned.

The left believes it's wrong to talk to people you disagree with, which is why they boycott this channel and this show.

Democrats did talk about opportunity and inequality, but mostly in racial terms.

Everything for them is in racial terms, of course. Some groups are well off because of their skin color, they told us, while others are not; they're oppressed. America is a racist country they argued again and again and again.

But the truth, if you live here, is that opportunity in America is vanishing for almost everyone -- of all colors. In 1970, for example, 92 percent of 30-year-olds made more money than their parents had at that age. In 2014, only half did. Those are actual numbers that tell you a lot. They're not race-based numbers. They're numbers that tell you that the American dream is in peril. Add to that far higher debt levels and most young people, in the end, are economically worse off than their parents were at the exact same age.

So, opportunity is in decline, and that's a huge problem. There are a lot of reasons for that. One is this: big business has supported open borders with the rest of the world in order to keep wages down.

We don't even know how many illegal immigrants live in this country. We can't even guess to within the nearest million. The best guess, as of right now, is about 22 million people. Tens of thousands more arrive every month.

Democrats don't want to talk about this. On Wednesday night, they never mentioned fixing it. In fact, they pledged to tear down border walls we already have. Can you imagine?

Instead of helping young Americans to have the families they say they want -- and young people say they want to have families but can't afford it -- no Democrat addressed that. Instead, Elizabeth Warren talked about expanding abortion as an ""economic right.""

And that really does sort of sum up perfectly the 2020 Democratic Party. You're poorer and sadder than your parents were but at least the abortion is free.

Hope you're psyched about that.

According to reporting from ""Catch and Kill"" author Ronan Farrow, Lack and NBC News president Noah Oppenheim were directly implicated in the stonewalling of Farrow's harrowing report on Weinstein's sexual predation and discovered that the disgraced film mogul was trying to leverage Lauer's own scandal over the network.

Amid the fallout of Farrow's reporting, there had been growing calls for NBC News to conduct an outside investigation into the allegations surrounding Lauer, the former ""Today"" host. Earlier this week, presidential candidates Tom Steyer and Sens. Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren signed a letter urging the Democratic National Committee to hold NBC accountable for its ""toxic culture,"" ahead of Wednesday night's MSNBC debate.

""Given all that activity, surely Lack would want to express his confidence in NBC News's efforts to date, to repudiate Farrow’s reporting and/or to let off some righteous steam? Not so fast,"" Wemple wrote.

Wemple wrote that Lack ""dodged"" his questions about the growing calls for an outside investigation.

NBCUniversal did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Former Vice President Joe Biden had a chance to call out the scandal-inundated Peacock Network when asked about how he would carry on the #MeToo movement as president at the MSNBC debate, but he ultimately went a different direction.

Biden instead gave a widely panned answer in which he said ""the culture of how women are treated"" needed to change before saying, ""We have to... keep punching"" at domestic violence.

""No, I really mean it,"" Biden said, apparently unaware of what evoked the laughter.

An NBC News insider with knowledge of the relationship between NBC's high-level executives didn't think the network would take action anytime soon.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts – a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination – stubbornly continues to masquerade as a capitalist.

In fact, Warren’s extensive record of supporting radical policies shows beyond all doubt that she is a far-left, off-her-rocker, dyed-in-the-wool socialist.

Warren can call herself anything she wants, of course, but that doesn’t make her claim true. She is no more a capitalist than she is a Native American – another false claim she made about herself for years.

KIMBERLEY STRASSEL: ELIZABETH WARREN ADMITS TO A COLOSSAL CAMPAIGN ERROR. THIS IS WHAT SHE DID NEXT

Why is Warren hiding her socialism? Because she’s not stupid. She knows that being honest and admitting she is a socialist will scare off millions of voters – making it difficult to win the Democratic presidential nomination and likely impossible to defeat President Trump a year from now in the general election.

According to a new Heartland Institute-Rasmussen Reports survey of 1,000 likely voters, only 26 percent of Americans say they would “vote for a presidential candidate who identifies himself or herself as a socialist.” And only 12 percent said they think socialism is a “better … economic system” than a free-market system. The survey was conducted Nov. 13 and 14.

Even more devastating for socialist presidential candidates like Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the survey found that half of independents and nearly one in three Democrats (31 percent) said they would not vote for a socialist presidential candidate.

Perhaps most interesting, 19 percent of those with a “very favorable” view of Warren and 20 percent of those with a “very favorable” view of Sanders – who proudly calls himself a democratic socialist – said they would not vote for a socialist in 2020.

While I disagree with Sanders on just about all issues of public policy, I give him credit for admitting he’s a socialist. However, his honesty about this one issue will likely doom his presidential candidacy.

In Warren’s America, taxpayers would pay for convicted murderers and rapists to go to college (for example) and they’d be required to pay for the food, health care and education of a potentially endless stream of illegal immigrants, including people who have never worked for a single day in the United States and have contributed absolutely no tax revenue into the system.

When Sanders likely withdraws from the nominating race, most of his supporters will probably throw their backing to Warren, because the two candidates hold similar positions on most issues. That may be enough to make Warren the Democratic presidential nominee next year – a prospect that must delight Trump.

You can count on the president to label whoever the Democrats nominate to run against him as a wild-eyed socialist with crazy and dangerous ideas. In Warren’s case – just as in the case of Sanders – this description is absolutely accurate.

Warren supports nearly every high-profile, far-left policy embraced by Sanders and other socialist radicals like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. These policies include a nationwide single-payer health care scheme (throwing more than 150 million Americans off their private health insurance plans), “free” college, cancellation of college debt, and the extraordinarily expensive Green New Deal that would wreck our economy send energy prices soaring.

Warren has also endorsed Ocasio-Cortez’s “Just Society” plan. Among other completely insane parts of the Just Society is a provision that would prevent government agencies from barring convicted criminals and illegal immigrants from accessing federal welfare, health, disability, education, and other government social and welfare benefits.

In Warren and AOC’s America, taxpayers would pay for convicted murderers and rapists to go to college (for example) and they’d be required to pay for the food, health care and education of a potentially endless stream of illegal immigrants, including people who have never worked for a single day in the United States and have contributed absolutely no tax revenue into the system.

All these pie-in-the-sky schemes would cost trillions of dollars to actually implement. Even if a President Warren were to confiscate everything the richest Americans owned and left them penniless and homeless, she would still have to raise taxes on the rest of us to fund her massively expensive government expansion.

Unfortunately for Comrades Bernie and Elizabeth, the Heartland-Rasmussen survey shows that despite the mountains of positive media coverage socialism and socialist candidates have received in the past year, Americans still aren’t buying the idea that centrally planned, collective economic systems work better than free markets. And there are good reasons for that, too.

Socialist and communist parties killed, exiled or imprisoned more than 167 million people in the 20th century. The recent chaos in countries like Venezuela – where there are shortages of all sorts of consumer goods and some people have resorted to eating zoo animals to survive – has served as a reminder that whenever socialism is attempted, it inevitably results in bloodshed and economic collapse.

Meanwhile, market-based capitalist reforms in India have liberated hundreds of millions of people from extreme poverty in just the past few decades alone.

And although America’s market economy is far from perfect – due in large part to arrangements made by corrupt governments and massive corporations – it has still created a higher quality of life than anything human beings have ever experienced.

The poorest among us today live better, longer, healthier lives than billions of people around the world – including hundreds of millions living in current or former socialist nations.

Most Americans know socialism doesn’t work.

But many don’t understand that what Elizabeth Warren and others are selling is – despite many the promises to the contrary – the same destructive, dangerous, disastrous ideas socialists have been peddling for more than 100 years.

If Americans figure that out, it would spell disaster for Warren, Sanders and their Democratic congressional comrades trying to keep control of the House and seize power in the Senate.

As a result, many of the Democrats competing for their party’s presidential nomination are scrambling to soften their support for this radical restructuring of our health care system or highlighting their opposition to it.

But here’s the truth you won’t hear from the Democratic would-be presidents: Those who say they oppose a government takeover of our health insurance system are simply trying to soothe nervous moderates.

JUSTIN HASKINS: ELIZABETH WARREN IS A SOCIALIST – IF SHE'S THE DEM NOMINEE, THIS HAPPENS IN 2020

In fact, every single Democratic presidential candidate supports a brand of health care reform that will lead to ""Medicare-for-all."" Each just has a different timeline, with a different path on how to get to the same result.

Think of the candidates like a large number of hikers making their way through a dense forest on different trails to reach a waterfall. Some will travel quickly, others more slowly as they encounter different obstacles, but eventually all will get to the same waterfall.

""Medicare-for-all"" is a radical plan to eliminate the private insurance industry and enroll every one of us in a taxpayer-funded government-run health plan – whether we like it or not. Like our income tax system, participation will be mandatory.

At this point 53 percent of Americans support “Medicare-for-all,” according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll. That's down from a high of 59 percent in March 2018.

In contrast, 65 percent of Americans favor the creation of a new, government-sponsored health plan that would compete against private insurers. This so-called ""public option"" would allow everyone to access affordable health insurance coverage without eliminating private insurance, its supporters say.

The Democratic presidential candidates have been following public opinion. Just look at Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. At the first candidate debate, she proudly proclaimed she was ""with Bernie on Medicare-for-all."" On Nov. 1, she unveiled her wildly unrealistic plan to pay for it.

But at last week's debate in Atlanta, Warren didn't join Sanders in his full-throated defense of ""Medicare-for-all."" Instead, she explained how she would gradually transition to a single-payer system during her first term.

Medicare underpaid hospitals by a staggering $54 billion in 2017. If everyone in our country were enrolled in government health insurance that $54 billion figure would grow enormously. Some hospitals would likely be forced to close.

Under Warren's plan, 135 million people would be automatically enrolled in a new Medicare-like plan right off the bat, at no cost to them.

This would include ""everybody under the age of 18, everybody who has a family of four income less than $50,000,"" she said. Every other American would have the option to buy into the plan at a ""modest"" cost.

Warren promises to get ""Medicare-for-all"" legislation passed ""no later than"" her third year in office. Of course, there’s no way to know if the House and Senate would approve her grand plan, no matter how hard she tries to win its passage.

What Warren is proposing is a public option for the first three years of her term – and ""Medicare-for-all"" thereafter. That timeline may be unrealistic – but it may not matter. The public option would invariably result in a government takeover of health insurance.

Proponents of the public option envision reimbursing doctors and hospitals at artificially low rates dictated by the government – typically Medicare's rates, which are about 40 percent below what private insurance pays.

Today hospitals receive just 87 cents for every dollar in costs they incur caring for beneficiaries. Those pennies on the dollar add up. Medicare underpaid hospitals by a staggering $54 billion in 2017.

If everyone in our country were enrolled in government health insurance that $54 billion figure would grow enormously. Some hospitals would likely be forced to close.

Government doesn't need to worry about covering its costs. So it can set premiums for the public option below its claims costs. It can make up the difference by dipping into the federal Treasury – or raising taxes on hard-working Americans.

The public option's low-cost structure would allow it to underprice private insurers. People would understandably drop their private coverage and sign up for the cheaper public plan.

As private insurance companies lost customers to government health insurance they would be forced to raise the price of the policies they sell – driving even more people to the public option.

You get it. Eventually, everyone would move from the private insurance companies to government health insurance. The private companies would shut down and all their employees and contractors would lose their jobs.

So when candidates claim their public option plans are alternatives to ""Medicare-for-all,"" they're not being honest. In time, the public option would turn into “Medicare-for-all.”

Former Vice President Joe Biden is wrong to claim that his public option would ""allow people to choose"" the coverage that best suits them.

At least South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has admitted that his public option plan would ""create a natural glide-path"" to ""Medicare-for-all."" Give him points for honesty.

So far the Democratic presidential hopefuls have managed to paper over the differences between their health care plans. But the more candidates talk, the more Americans realize that ""Medicare-for-all"" and the ""public option"" are just two different blueprints for total government control.

Once private insurance companies were eliminated there would be nothing to stop the federal government from raising premiums and taxes and cutting insurance benefits. And we, the American people, would have nowhere else to turn to get needed health insurance.

The one-minute ad, which was posted on social media and features images of Bloomberg campaigning alongside those during his younger years, shots of New York City and unflattering images of President Trump, is “the launch ad,” according to one of his top advisers.

Along with the video, Bloomberg posted a written statement on his campaign website in which he laid out why he was the best candidate to defeat President Trump next November.

“I’m running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America,” Bloomberg wrote.

BLOOMBERG LAUNCHING 'MASSIVE' COAST TO COAST TV AD BUY

“We cannot afford four more years of President Trump’s reckless and unethical actions,” he continued. “He represents an existential threat to our country and our values. If he wins another term in office, we may never recover from the damage.”

There has been speculation for months that Bloomberg, who donated millions of his own dollars to Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterm elections, would enter the 2020 fray, but rumors hit a frenzied point earlier this month when he completed the paperwork to be on the Democratic primary ballot in Alabama.

Bloomberg had announced earlier this year that he would not seek the party's nomination. But, in a statement obtained by Fox News in early November, his political adviser Howard Wolfson said Bloomberg was worried that the current crop of Democrats seeking the White House was ""not well-positioned"" to defeat President Trump.

""In 2018 [Bloomberg] spent more than $100 million to help elect Democrats to ensure that Congress began to hold the President accountable,"" Wolfson said. ""And this year he helped Democrats win control of both houses of the Virginia legislature.""

He added: ""We now need to finish the job and ensure that Trump is defeated -- but Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to do that.""

Bloomberg's expected move has come amid increasing concern about the leftward drift of the major Democratic candidates, the departure of candidates who failed to gain traction – and talk of other potential late entries.

BLOOMBERG WON'T CAMPAIGN IN EARLY VOTING STATES IF HE RUNS

Bloomberg’s entrance comes just 10 weeks before primary voting begins, an unorthodox move that reflects anxiety within the Democratic Party about the strength of its current candidates.

As a centrist with deep ties to Wall Street, Bloomberg is expected to struggle among the party’s energized progressive base. He became a Democrat only last year. Yet his tremendous resources and moderate profile could be appealing in a primary contest that has become, above all, a quest to find the person best-positioned to deny Trump a second term next November.

Forbes ranked Bloomberg as the 11th-richest person in the world last year with a net worth of roughly $50 billion. Trump, by contrast, was ranked 259th with a net worth of just over $3 billion.

Already, Bloomberg has vowed to spend at least $150 million of his fortune on various pieces of a 2020 campaign, including more than $100 million for internet ads attacking Trump, between $15 million and $20 million on a voter registration drive largely targeting minority voters, and more than $30 million on an initial round of television ads.

Even before the announcement was final, Democratic rivals like Bernie Sanders pounced on Bloomberg’s plans to rely on his personal fortune.

“I’m disgusted by the idea that Michael Bloomberg or any billionaire thinks they can circumvent the political process and spend tens of millions of dollars to buy elections,” Sanders tweeted on Friday.

Elizabeth Warren, another leading progressive candidate, also slammed Bloomberg on Saturday for trying to buy the presidency.

""I understand that rich people are going to have more shoes than the rest of us, they're going to have more cars than the rest of us, they're going to have more houses,” she said after a campaign stop in Manchester, New Hampshire. “But they don't get a bigger share of democracy, especially in a Democratic primary. We need to be doing the face-to-face work that lifts every voice.""

And often, she's got a new federal agency for that, too.

A Fox News analysis of the Democratic presidential candidate's myriad and much-touted plans reveals that Warren's ambitious agenda of policy prescriptions would not only prompt sweeping change in everything from health care to clean energy, but would come with the creation of at least 20 offices, bureaus, agencies, divisions or councils.

ELIZABETH WARREN RALLY WITH AYANNA PRESSLEY BROUGHT TO BRIEF HALT BY PRO SCHOOL-CHOICE PROTESTERS

Some of these are entirely new; some would replace existing agencies, only on a bigger scale; and some would represent a relaunch of old agencies disbanded years ago. Taken together, what is proposed is a significant expansion in the size of the federal bureaucracy.

If elected president, Warren vows she'll oversee the establishment of new offices that would be responsible for educating members of Congress on technology, investigating ethics violations, ensuring the U.S. is trading with green countries and much, much more.

For instance, a new Secure Democracy Administration would have the power to take over the administration of federal elections from state governments that run afoul of certain standards. A White House Budgetary Office of Tribal Affairs would ""track and advance"" Native American-related spending.

From Warren's perspective, it's just more evidence of the detail-rich policy pitch that has defined her candidacy. But Republicans see more evidence of an over-reliance on big government -- and a political liability.

""No surprise that Elizabeth Warren wants to expand unnecessary government bureaucracy on top of her radical socialist proposals,"" Sarah Matthews, the deputy press secretary for President Trump's re-election campaign, told Fox News. ""Despite what Elizabeth Warren may think, more big government isn’t the solution. President Trump believes our government should be smaller, smarter, and more efficient which is why he has delivered on his campaign promise to shrink the federal bureaucracy and get the government off the backs of the American people.""

Most of the new offices are explicitly outlined in Warren's campaign literature. But the total could be higher. At least one office -- the Office of United States Corporations -- is prescribed in a Warren bill linked to one of her campaign proposals, though the office is not mentioned on the campaign site.

The entity, under Warren's legislation, would issue charters to large American companies permitting them to operate. Hinting at this, Warren's ""Accountable Capitalism"" plan calls for issuing charters to American companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.

Warren's fondness for government agencies is hardly a secret. Her affiliation with one is part of her personal narrative. She mentions repeatedly on her site that she was one of then-President Obama's top advisers while his administration was creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

""Even though she wasn’t even in Congress at the time, she fought for the agency, built public support for it, and Barack Obama signed it into law in 2010,"" Warren's campaign website states. ""She then helped build the agency up from scratch. Now that agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has returned $12 billion directly to consumers scammed by financial institutions.""

ELIZABETH WARREN VOWS TO USE TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO TEAR DOWN BORDER WALL

The Warren campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this report.

Below is the full list of entities Warren says she would create:

CONSERVATIVE GROUP'S STUDY: 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' WOULD WORSEN FINANCIALSITUATIOMN FOR MAJORITY OF US HOUSEHOLDS

But Warren's plans don't just create offices. She further advocates for a litany of commissions, programs and positions that also would expand the scope of other parts of the federal bureaucracy.

She proposes a commission on disability rights that would ensure federal disaster spending is ADA compliant, a ""diplomatic equivalent of the ROTC program"" and a Special Envoy for the Human Rights of LGBTI Persons, to name a few.

All these government entities would need to be funded, which would mean additional spending on top of other costly benefit programs ranging from ""Medicare-for-all"" to student debt cancellation.

KEY DEM INDICATES WARREN'S WEALTH TAX HAS LITTLE CHANCE OF PASSING THE HOUSE

Warren has called for ""big structural change,"" as a cornerstone of her campaign as she competes with Bernie Sanders -- a self-identified Democratic socialist -- for more progressive and liberal voters in the Democratic primary. Some Democrats, however, have worried that her expansive vision will turn away moderates and independents.

Fellow 2020 hopeful Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., hit Warren on one of her more controversial policies -- a 2 percent wealth tax on individuals worth more than $50 million -- during the Democratic presidential debate in Atlanta last week.

""The tax the way we're putting it forward right now, the wealth tax, I'm sorry it's cumbersome, it's been tried by other nations, it's hard to evaluate. We can get the same amount of revenue through just taxation,"" Booker said in a heated exchange with Warren. ""But again, we as Democrats, have got to start talking not just about how you tax from a stage, but how we grow wealth in this country amongst those disadvantaged communities that are not seeing it.""

Warren's website says she would use the wealth tax to help fund many of her proposals. However, conservatives decry Warren's embrace of more government agencies and programs as a move in the wrong direction.

""It would take an army of bureaucrats and vastly more spending to realize Senator Warren’s command and control aspirations,"" said Romina Boccia, director of the conservative Heritage Foundation's Grover M.Hermann Center for the Federal Budget.

She also warned that the ""swamp"" President Trump vowed to drain still bubbles with bureaucracy: ""President Trump’s administration continues to have success in draining the swamp through deregulation. And yet, we’ve also seen vast, irresponsible spending increases that feed the swamp. Returning power to the people must include starving the bureaucratic beast, which means holding the line on spending."""

Warren can call herself anything she wants, of course, but that doesn’t make her claim true. She is no more a capitalist than she is a Native American – another false claim she made about herself for years.

KIMBERLEY STRASSEL: ELIZABETH WARREN ADMITS TO A COLOSSAL CAMPAIGN ERROR. THIS IS WHAT SHE DID NEXT

Why is Warren hiding her socialism? Because she’s not stupid. She knows that being honest and admitting she is a socialist will scare off millions of voters – making it difficult to win the Democratic presidential nomination and likely impossible to defeat President Trump a year from now in the general election.

According to a new Heartland Institute-Rasmussen Reports survey of 1,000 likely voters, only 26 percent of Americans say they would “vote for a presidential candidate who identifies himself or herself as a socialist.” And only 12 percent said they think socialism is a “better … economic system” than a free-market system. The survey was conducted Nov. 13 and 14.

Even more devastating for socialist presidential candidates like Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the survey found that half of independents and nearly one in three Democrats (31 percent) said they would not vote for a socialist presidential candidate.

Perhaps most interesting, 19 percent of those with a “very favorable” view of Warren and 20 percent of those with a “very favorable” view of Sanders – who proudly calls himself a democratic socialist – said they would not vote for a socialist in 2020.

While I disagree with Sanders on just about all issues of public policy, I give him credit for admitting he’s a socialist. However, his honesty about this one issue will likely doom his presidential candidacy.

In Warren’s America, taxpayers would pay for convicted murderers and rapists to go to college (for example) and they’d be required to pay for the food, health care and education of a potentially endless stream of illegal immigrants, including people who have never worked for a single day in the United States and have contributed absolutely no tax revenue into the system.

When Sanders likely withdraws from the nominating race, most of his supporters will probably throw their backing to Warren, because the two candidates hold similar positions on most issues. That may be enough to make Warren the Democratic presidential nominee next year – a prospect that must delight Trump.

You can count on the president to label whoever the Democrats nominate to run against him as a wild-eyed socialist with crazy and dangerous ideas. In Warren’s case – just as in the case of Sanders – this description is absolutely accurate.

Warren supports nearly every high-profile, far-left policy embraced by Sanders and other socialist radicals like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. These policies include a nationwide single-payer health care scheme (throwing more than 150 million Americans off their private health insurance plans), “free” college, cancellation of college debt, and the extraordinarily expensive Green New Deal that would wreck our economy send energy prices soaring.

Warren has also endorsed Ocasio-Cortez’s “Just Society” plan. Among other completely insane parts of the Just Society is a provision that would prevent government agencies from barring convicted criminals and illegal immigrants from accessing federal welfare, health, disability, education, and other government social and welfare benefits.

In Warren and AOC’s America, taxpayers would pay for convicted murderers and rapists to go to college (for example) and they’d be required to pay for the food, health care and education of a potentially endless stream of illegal immigrants, including people who have never worked for a single day in the United States and have contributed absolutely no tax revenue into the system.

All these pie-in-the-sky schemes would cost trillions of dollars to actually implement. Even if a President Warren were to confiscate everything the richest Americans owned and left them penniless and homeless, she would still have to raise taxes on the rest of us to fund her massively expensive government expansion.

Unfortunately for Comrades Bernie and Elizabeth, the Heartland-Rasmussen survey shows that despite the mountains of positive media coverage socialism and socialist candidates have received in the past year, Americans still aren’t buying the idea that centrally planned, collective economic systems work better than free markets. And there are good reasons for that, too.

Socialist and communist parties killed, exiled or imprisoned more than 167 million people in the 20th century. The recent chaos in countries like Venezuela – where there are shortages of all sorts of consumer goods and some people have resorted to eating zoo animals to survive – has served as a reminder that whenever socialism is attempted, it inevitably results in bloodshed and economic collapse.

Meanwhile, market-based capitalist reforms in India have liberated hundreds of millions of people from extreme poverty in just the past few decades alone.

And although America’s market economy is far from perfect – due in large part to arrangements made by corrupt governments and massive corporations – it has still created a higher quality of life than anything human beings have ever experienced.

The poorest among us today live better, longer, healthier lives than billions of people around the world – including hundreds of millions living in current or former socialist nations.

Most Americans know socialism doesn’t work.

But many don’t understand that what Elizabeth Warren and others are selling is – despite many the promises to the contrary – the same destructive, dangerous, disastrous ideas socialists have been peddling for more than 100 years.

If Americans figure that out, it would spell disaster for Warren, Sanders and their Democratic congressional comrades trying to keep control of the House and seize power in the Senate.

BLOOMY THROWS WARREN A LIFELINE

After a brutal six-week stretch, there’s finally some good news for the flagging fortunes of Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign.



In early October, the political press prematurely ordained the Massachusetts Democrat as her party’s front-runner. But Warren had landed splay-footed. She was nowhere near ready to deal with the scrutiny after months of fawning coverage and deference from her rivals. It’s been brutal.



The proximate cause of Warren’s woes was said to have been her triple-dip goofs on health insurance: No plan, a politically preposterous plan and then a rapid walk-back under pressure.



Adding to her woes have been problems with her biographical claims, including a dispute over whether she really was fired for being pregnant as a young woman and now over her denial that her children attended private school.



That all left Warren stuck between emboldened rivals to her right, particularly front-runner former Vice President Joe Biden and a surging South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and her longtime frenemy to her left, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.



Underpinning all of Warren’s problems is an understanding among many Democrats that she represents a special risk to her party as a potential nominee. Her out-of-the-mainstream ideology combined with a demeanor so dour that she makes Hillary Clinton seem cheerful is a potent combination for Republican message makers.



As House Democrats prepare for a brutal fight to retain the moderate, suburban swing districts that delivered them the lower chamber in 2018 and as party strategists survey the swing-state map, they have to see Warren as a worst-case scenario right now.



That understanding helps explain how Biden keeps his national lead and how Buttigieg has overtaken Warren in her previous strongholds of Iowa and New Hampshire.



But the same pundit-politico Democratic intelligentsia that has of late suddenly realized Warren’s massive defects still maintains its dislike of Biden. Biden, 77, is said to be too old, too gaffe prone and too much of an insider to be a good nominee. In the crucial “Morning Joe” and snarky Twitter primary, Biden is still mostly a punchline. As his puny fundraising shows, Democratic elites are still down on Sheriff Joe. And an establishmentarian front-runner without the backing of said establishment is as out of place as Corn Pop on a Wilmington city pool high dive.



Riding into the fray amid a cannonade of cash is former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who, with $30 million Friday, has already set a new record for single-day campaign spending.



But other than the owners of local television stations and the realtors selling vacation homes to his consultants, who stands to benefit from Bloomberg’s big buy in?



Why Warren, of course.



This isn’t complicated, folks. Just as Biden has benefited from the competition between Warren and Sanders — two hard-left, New England senators in their seventies — Warren will be aided by the rivalry between two moderate, Mid-Atlantic 77-year-olds.



It’s still unknowable what Bloomberg’s money can buy him. His forerunner, billionaire investor Tom Steyer, has been a fizzle in a tartan tie. But Bloomberg is a more formidable candidate, and not just for his service as mayor of America’s largest city.



As a media mogul and survivor of the same tabloid press that produced Donald Trump, Bloomberg has more moxie. Plus, he has more than one necktie.



How big will Bloomberg open? Will he draw from Biden more than Buttigieg? Will he be able to elbow onto the December debate stage? Can he connect with the black voters who have succored Biden?



That all remains to be seen. But we know for sure that Bloomberg is a godsend for Warren.



Aside from dividing the support for her rivals, Bloomberg, erstwhile Republican and Wall Street enthusiast, makes the perfect foil. She’s been talking for a year about not letting billionaires buy the election and Bloomberg rides into the arena blasting millions into the stands like free t-shirts out of a slingshot.



Democrats may ultimately choose to ignore Bloomberg’s bid, but for as long as he is a fascination, he’s helping Warren.



THE RULEBOOK: EVERYONE GETS TWO

“The equality of representation in the Senate is another point, which, being evidently the result of compromise between the opposite pretensions of the large and the small States, does not call for much discussion.” – Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, Federalist No. 62



TIME OUT: SAME WITH AXE BODY SPRAY

NYT: “When a bird preens its feathers, it uses a little of nature’s own pomade: an oil made by glands just above the tail. This oil helps clean and protect the bird’s plumage, but also contains a delicate bouquet of scents. To other birds — potential mates or would-be rivals — these smells carry many messages, not unlike the birdsongs and fancy feathers that are more obvious to human observers. These scents may signal that a bird would be dangerous to encounter or might be ready to mate, or any number of other cues. However, new research … suggests that these odoriferous messages may not be entirely of the bird’s own making. In a study published last month in the Journal of Experimental Biology, biologists reported that microbes living peacefully on the birds’ oil glands may play an important role in making the scent molecules involved. That implies that the birds’ microbiomes may influence both the smell and the behavior it provokes in other birds.”

I’LL TELL YOU WHAT: ARE YOU GONNA EAT THAT?

In Friday’s edition of I’ll Tell You What, Dana Perino and Chris Stirewalt discuss the week that was on Capitol Hill, a snoozer of a debate in Atlanta and a road trip comedy with President Trump and Senator Romney. And there's trivia. LISTEN AND SUBSCRIBE HERE



BLOOMBERG NEWS WILL AVOID REPORTS ON OWNER DURING CAMPAIGN

WaPo: “Bloomberg News will stop writing unsigned editorials and its reporters will avoid investigating the personal life and finances of its owner, Mike Bloomberg, as the news organization seeks to avoid conflicts of interest in covering Bloomberg’s newly announced candidacy for president. In an extraordinary memo to his newsroom on Sunday, Bloomberg News Editor in Chief John Micklethwait outlined steps designed to steer his reporters through a potential journalistic minefield: how to cover the campaign of the man who owns the news organization that is covering him. … Bloomberg operates one of the world’s largest media organizations, with about 2,700 journalists in TV, radio, magazine and digital operations. … Most notably, [Micklethwait] said his newsroom would continue ‘our tradition’ of not investigating Bloomberg, his family and his wealth, ‘and we will extend the same policy to his rivals in the Democratic primaries.’”



Biden can’t remember veep prospects’ names - NY Post: “Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has at least four women in mind as potential running mates — but had a hard time remembering their names when an Iowa voter asked him Friday who he would choose. … Biden then ran through a list of four prominent Democrats — without using any of their names. ‘The former assistant attorney general who got fired who was just in Delaware,’ he began, an apparent reference to Sally Yates… ‘The leader of the, uh, the woman who should’ve been the governor of Georgia, the African American woman,’ he continued — meaning Stacey Abrams… ‘The two senators from the state of New Hampshire,’ he concluded. That would be Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan. Abrams … is widely seen as a top veep prospect in 2020. Yates, Shaheen, and Hassan have not been cited as potential running mates before now.”



Buttigieg proposes long-term care benefits for older Americans - Fox News: “Presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg on Monday rolled out a plan to ‘promote dignity and security in retirement’ through additional regular payments to older Americans, along with imposing a payroll tax on the wealthiest Americans to ‘protect Social Security forever.’ The South Bend, Ind., mayor said his father had been admitted to a hospital last winter for an undisclosed illness, and died this past January. He said a social worker told him the best option for long-term care would be to deplete their assets in order to qualify for Medicaid. … On Monday, his campaign announced plans to establish Long-Term Care America, a program providing people 65 and older with a benefit of $90 per day. ‘Over 11 million will receive benefits from the program throughout their lifetime,’ according to the proposal.”



Black voters: Representation doesn’t mean change - NYT: “Moderate black voters, particularly older ones whose support has helped former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. maintain his lead atop most primary polls, pointed to the election of President Trump, and said nominating the candidate they saw as most capable of ending his administration was a moral priority above all others. And some black voters on the left — particularly younger ones — are disappointed by some aspects of former President Barack Obama’s legacy and have embraced the idea that supporting a candidate who is willing to upend unjust systems is more important than choosing one from their own community. … The sentiment among members of the black electorate has squeezed some candidates from both sides, and is especially meaningful for Mr. [Cory] Booker and Ms. [Kamala] Harris, two black candidates looking to replicate Mr. Obama’s electoral playbook.”



Booker wins praise but no support - WaPo: “As he struggles with low-single-digit polling and the prospect of missing the cut for next month’s debate, Booker has become a symbol for the harsh reality of this year’s nominating process. It is just not enough to win plaudits for performance, as he has after multiple events, or to execute a clear campaign strategy. In the shadow of Trump’s potential reelection, Democratic voters have become focused on winning and are unforgiving with their doubts. Booker has sought to answer that concern by preaching the power of empathy. He appeals to white Iowa and New Hampshire voters by talking about the problems of inner cities and poverty. He has confronted Trump by explaining his compassion for his supporters. And unlike other campaigns that have pivoted on message and policy, he has made clear he will not change his strategy to win.”



MULVANEY SOUGHT TO JUSTIFY WITHHOLDING UKRAINE AID

NYT: “Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, asked officials in the budget office after President Trump’s July 25 call with the Ukrainian president whether there was a legal justification for withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, according to two people briefed on an internal White House review. The discussions, which took place via email in August, came after the hold on the $391 million had already been put in place. Mr. Mulvaney also asked the officials at the Office of Management and Budget how long the aid could be withheld, three people familiar with the review said. The emails, which were first reported by The Washington Post on Sunday, were surfaced during a review by the White House Counsel’s Office that is examining the events surrounding the Ukraine call. They raise the question of whether Mr. Mulvaney was seeking after the fact to justify the hold, which is central to Democrats’ impeachment investigation into whether Mr. Trump abused his office for political gain, or whether his request was routine.”



House Intel has video, audio recordings from Giuliani associate - ABC News: “The House Intelligence Committee is in possession of audio and video recordings and photographs provided to the committee by Lev Parnas, an associate of President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who reportedly played a key role in assisting him in his efforts to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and Ukraine, multiple sources familiar with the matter tell ABC News. The material submitted to the committee includes audio, video and photos that include Giuliani and Trump. It was unclear what the content depicts and the committees only began accessing the material last week. ‘We have subpoenaed Mr. Parnas and Mr. [Igor] Fruman for their records. We would like them to fully comply with those subpoenas,’ House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff told CNN Sunday, with a committee spokesperson adding they would not elaborate beyond the chairman's comments.”



Schiff says Dems plan to keep moving forward - WaPo: “House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said Sunday that his panel will press ahead with its impeachment report even though key witnesses have not testified, in the latest signal that Democrats are moving swiftly in their probe of President Trump’s alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine. In an interview on CNN’s ‘State of the Union,’ Schiff said the evidence against Trump is ‘already overwhelming,’ although he stopped short of saying whether he would support impeachment himself. ‘Yes, we’d love to have these witnesses come in,’ Schiff said. ‘But we’re not willing to simply allow them to wait us out — to stall this proceeding — when the facts are already overwhelming.’”



Vulnerable Dems worry about constituent reactions at home - Politico: “Vulnerable Democrats are watching in horror as GOP impeachment attacks deluge their districts back home. And they want a much stronger counteroffensive from their own party and its allies. Some of those Democrats raised their concerns with party leaders this week as they prepared to leave for Thanksgiving recess, fearing that voters will be bombarded by anti-impeachment ads as families gather around the TV for parades and football, according to multiple lawmakers and aides. GOP-aligned outside groups have spent roughly $8 million on TV spots this cycle in battleground districts… The vast majority of those ads specifically hammer Democrats over impeachment. Meanwhile, swing-district Democrats are receiving little reinforcement from their own party or even other liberal coalitions.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“If you jump back and forth between Fox News, Politico, and CNN you would think the impeachment hearings occurred on alternate universes. Witness X is the best thing since sliced bread, say the Dems and their Media allies. Witness X is a bomb thrower and anti-American, say the Republicans. I tend to believe that nobody has a constitutional right to a federal job. If they the Deep Statists can’t follow the President’s lead, they should follow the lead or resign. How do you know which side to believe (other than reading only Half Time Report 24/7)??” – Ron Smith, Larned, Kan.



[Ed. note: Did you ever hear the one about the blind men trying to describe an elephant? One said it was a snake, one said it was a rope, one said it was the trunk of a tree. It all depended on where they stood. I will say that Fox News’ coverage — helmed by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum — has done a very fine job of showing you the whole elephant. But I take your point about the overall coverage. I encourage people to do a few things when it comes to navigating the political press. First, mostly try to ignore rank partisans. They’re usually boring anyway. Second, seek out good, in-depth reporting first. I start my day with the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times and go from there. Third, remember that nobody has a monopoly on the truth. American citizenship demands discernment and attentiveness.]

TACOS. IS THERE ANYTHING THEY CAN’T DO?

KOLD: “An Arizona man claimed a taco helped save his life after a near-miss with a stray bullet. KOLD reported that a Tucson, Arizona named Ryan Bishop man said he feels lucky to be alive after a bullet came close to causing him serious injuries and possibly death while he was driving. Bishop told KOLD that, just before 12:30 p.m. on Sunday, he was driving down Houghton Road when the driver's window of his vehicle shattered. … Bishop said he got a safe distance away and pulled over to call police. That's when he said he saw a bullet. … Bishop said he normally drives with his windows down and his arm on the window ledge, exactly where the bullet hit the vehicle. ‘I'm pretty sure [eating a] taco saved my life or at least stopped my arm from getting blown apart,’ he said. ‘I had the window closed because I didn’t want pieces of the taco flying around.’”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“This episode and others have brought me to the highly self-serving conclusion that nothing parents do alters a child’s character anyway, so there is no need to fret that some misdirected pedagogy or slip of the tongue will forever ruin him.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on Feb. 23, 1990.

BLOOMBERG UNION FIRES BACK ON BAN TO AVOID INVESTIGATING 2020 DEMS: 'SILENCING JOURNALISTS'

A video released on Sunday by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg marked the official start of the politician/media mogul's 2020 presidential run, Fox News reported.

“I’m running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America,” Bloomberg wrote.

There has been speculation for months that Bloomberg, who donated millions of his own dollars to Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterm elections, would enter the 2020 fray, but then he completed the paperwork to be on the Democratic primary ballot in Alabama.

Varney said he finds it ironic that Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, both of whom have ""built their campaigns around getting rid of billionaires,"" are now running against ""Bloomberg's mountain of money.""

""Money really talks in politics,"" Varney added.

Warren and Sanders shouldn't be the only ones opposed to a Bloomberg run, however, the Fox Nation host observed -- warning Joe Biden of his new competition.

""Joe Biden can't be happy. Joe occupies the center. But his campaign is lackluster and he's not raising much money. Overnight, Bloomberg has taken over the middle ground.,"" Varney explained.

Varney credited Bloomberg for his deliberately late strategy, but his run ""throws the party into even more chaos,"" he said.

BLOOMBERG CAMPAIGN MANAGER ON 2020: TRUMP IS WINNING

""His strategy is unusual, but very smart. He'll enter the race deliberately late. He'll let his competitors tear each other apart and spend their money and then jump into Super Tuesday in March. California and 14 other states hold primary votes that day. Bloomberg's billions will have an enormous impact,"" Varney said.

""And consider this,"" he added, ""there may be an impeachment trial in the Senate right around that time, March of next year. Senators Warren Sanders, Klobuchar, Booker, Harris. They're not going to be on the campaign trail -- they'll have to be in D.C. passing judgment on the president.""

Bloomberg's run further divides the Democratic Party, Varney explained, and he believes it ""opens the door to a Trump win in 2020.""

BLOOMBERG LAUNCHING 'MASSIVE' COAST TO COAST TV AD BUY

""It's hard to believe that Democrats welcome this,"" Varney said.""I can't see the supporters of Warren and Sanders suddenly jumping ship for the $50 billion man. I can't see rural moderates getting behind a candidate who has no time for guns. And I can't see Southerners or Midwesterners supporting a climate warrior.""

""Bloomberg not only splits the party, he throws it into even more chaos. And that means no matter who leads the Democrats next year, the party remains at war with itself.""

As a result, many of the Democrats competing for their party’s presidential nomination are scrambling to soften their support for this radical restructuring of our health care system or highlighting their opposition to it.

But here’s the truth you won’t hear from the Democratic would-be presidents: Those who say they oppose a government takeover of our health insurance system are simply trying to soothe nervous moderates.

JUSTIN HASKINS: ELIZABETH WARREN IS A SOCIALIST – IF SHE'S THE DEM NOMINEE, THIS HAPPENS IN 2020

In fact, every single Democratic presidential candidate supports a brand of health care reform that will lead to ""Medicare-for-all."" Each just has a different timeline, with a different path on how to get to the same result.

Think of the candidates like a large number of hikers making their way through a dense forest on different trails to reach a waterfall. Some will travel quickly, others more slowly as they encounter different obstacles, but eventually all will get to the same waterfall.

""Medicare-for-all"" is a radical plan to eliminate the private insurance industry and enroll every one of us in a taxpayer-funded government-run health plan – whether we like it or not. Like our income tax system, participation will be mandatory.

At this point 53 percent of Americans support “Medicare-for-all,” according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll. That's down from a high of 59 percent in March 2018.

In contrast, 65 percent of Americans favor the creation of a new, government-sponsored health plan that would compete against private insurers. This so-called ""public option"" would allow everyone to access affordable health insurance coverage without eliminating private insurance, its supporters say.

The Democratic presidential candidates have been following public opinion. Just look at Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. At the first candidate debate, she proudly proclaimed she was ""with Bernie on Medicare-for-all."" On Nov. 1, she unveiled her wildly unrealistic plan to pay for it.

But at last week's debate in Atlanta, Warren didn't join Sanders in his full-throated defense of ""Medicare-for-all."" Instead, she explained how she would gradually transition to a single-payer system during her first term.

Medicare underpaid hospitals by a staggering $54 billion in 2017. If everyone in our country were enrolled in government health insurance that $54 billion figure would grow enormously. Some hospitals would likely be forced to close.

Under Warren's plan, 135 million people would be automatically enrolled in a new Medicare-like plan right off the bat, at no cost to them.

This would include ""everybody under the age of 18, everybody who has a family of four income less than $50,000,"" she said. Every other American would have the option to buy into the plan at a ""modest"" cost.

Warren promises to get ""Medicare-for-all"" legislation passed ""no later than"" her third year in office. Of course, there’s no way to know if the House and Senate would approve her grand plan, no matter how hard she tries to win its passage.

What Warren is proposing is a public option for the first three years of her term – and ""Medicare-for-all"" thereafter. That timeline may be unrealistic – but it may not matter. The public option would invariably result in a government takeover of health insurance.

Proponents of the public option envision reimbursing doctors and hospitals at artificially low rates dictated by the government – typically Medicare's rates, which are about 40 percent below what private insurance pays.

Today hospitals receive just 87 cents for every dollar in costs they incur caring for beneficiaries. Those pennies on the dollar add up. Medicare underpaid hospitals by a staggering $54 billion in 2017.

If everyone in our country were enrolled in government health insurance that $54 billion figure would grow enormously. Some hospitals would likely be forced to close.

Government doesn't need to worry about covering its costs. So it can set premiums for the public option below its claims costs. It can make up the difference by dipping into the federal Treasury – or raising taxes on hard-working Americans.

The public option's low-cost structure would allow it to underprice private insurers. People would understandably drop their private coverage and sign up for the cheaper public plan.

As private insurance companies lost customers to government health insurance they would be forced to raise the price of the policies they sell – driving even more people to the public option.

You get it. Eventually, everyone would move from the private insurance companies to government health insurance. The private companies would shut down and all their employees and contractors would lose their jobs.

So when candidates claim their public option plans are alternatives to ""Medicare-for-all,"" they're not being honest. In time, the public option would turn into “Medicare-for-all.”

Former Vice President Joe Biden is wrong to claim that his public option would ""allow people to choose"" the coverage that best suits them.

At least South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has admitted that his public option plan would ""create a natural glide-path"" to ""Medicare-for-all."" Give him points for honesty.

So far the Democratic presidential hopefuls have managed to paper over the differences between their health care plans. But the more candidates talk, the more Americans realize that ""Medicare-for-all"" and the ""public option"" are just two different blueprints for total government control.

But during a Monday speech in the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House, the former two-term Massachusetts governor delivered a pointed warning to fellow members of his party.

“I don’t think you have to hate Republicans to be a good Democrat. I don’t think you have to hate conservatives to be a good progressive or to hate business to be a good social justice warrior,” he said.

PATRICK MAKES A VERY LATE ENTRY INTO WHITE HOUSE RACE

The comment by Patrick at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics's ""Politics and Eggs"" – a must-stop for White House hopefuls – appeared to be an indirect shot at the progressive standard-bearers in the 2020 Democratic nomination race, populist Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

Patrick, who announced his candidacy just a week-and-a-half ago, also highlighted that “we need leadership that understands that unity makes us not only stronger but successful.”

Patrick served as U.S. assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division from 1994-1997 under then-President Bill Clinton. He was elected governor of Massachusetts in 2006 and reelected in 2010, the first black governor in the commonwealth's history.

After leaving office in 2015, Patrick took a job with Bain Capital, the Boston-based private investment firm that became a liability to Mitt Romney – Patrick’s predecessor as Massachusetts governor – during Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign.

While considered a moderate, the 63-year-old Patrick insisted that he’s “not talking about a moderate agenda. That’s the last thing we need.""

Instead, he said he’s “talking about being woke while leaving room for the still-waking. What it takes to govern and what it takes to actually make change that lasts.”

And he said the reason he’s running is his “experience, both in range and depth. I have two terms of accomplishments and reforms as governor, a record of successful leadership in business.”

Launching a campaign with just over two months to go until the start of the nominating calendar, Patrick faces extremely high hurdles, which he acknowledges. But an optimistic Patrick, on his late entry into the race, told reporters “the path we knew was there is wider than I fully appreciated.""

“It’s a wide-open race,” he spotlighted.

And pointing to his rivals for the nomination, he stressed that “the fact that folks have been in for a long time and campaigning for a long time and raising money for a long time has not closed, has not resolved it. It’s a little bit of what I think about the importance of money or lack of money. We want it. We’re raising it so that we’re competitive and we’re confident that we will.”

Patrick’s stop in New Hampshire – his second since announcing his candidacy – came one day after former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg officially launched a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. The multimillionaire business and medial mogul on Monday launched a massive $32 million ad buy, airing biographical TV commercials in media markets from coast to coast.

Asked by Fox News how he can compete against that kind of money, Patrick responded: “I’ve been up against odds like that in the past. We’re going to do the work. I happen to believe that the work is much more about connecting with people personally and where they are in every sense of the term and that’s what we’re going to do.”

Bloomberg is skipping the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, which hold the first four nominating contests in February. Instead, he’s concentrating his firepower on the delegate-rich states that vote on Super Tuesday on March 3 and in the states later in the nominating calendar.

Patrick emphasized his commitment to campaigning in the early voting states, saying, “as a practical matter, we’re going to try to spend a lot of time here in New Hampshire and in South Carolina, but we will be active in Iowa and Nevada as well.”

And he touted that “we’re going to make our presence felt and build this organization.”

Patrick is the second Massachusetts resident in the race, following Warren.

Asked by Fox News about his phone conversation with Warren earlier this month, before he launched his bid, Patrick said “it was uncomfortable. We’re friends and I think in an ideal world, we would be working as collaborators rather than competitors. But I think you can compete with your friends and keep it friendly.”"

The 77-year-old billionaire added that he “looked in the mirror and said, ‘I just cannot let this happen.’""

Calling himself a problem-solver who can rebuild America and beat the “existential threat"" posed by the president, Bloomberg was chatting with people at a diner in Norfolk, Va. The state is part of his strategy of focusing on states with primaries on Super Tuesday.

Bloomberg's remarks echoed those of his campaign manager, Kevin Sheeky, earlier in the day. ""Right now, Donald Trump is winning,"" Sheekey said. ""It’s very tough for people who don’t live in New York or California to understand that, but that is what’s happening.""

Polls have shown that independents are souring on the idea of impeaching and removing Trump from office, including in critical battleground states like Wisconsin, even after House Democrats aggressively presented their case over the past two weeks.

The centrist Bloomberg is joining an already-crowded group of Democrats, who wasted no time in unloading on the former Big Apple mayor. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, for example, said voters don't want ""another wealthy person"" in the White House. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders slammed Bloomberg's $30 million advertising buy, saying he was “disgusted by the idea that Michael Bloomberg or any other billionaire thinks they can circumvent the political process and spend tens of millions of dollars to buy our elections.""

Sanders, for his part, has already committed to spending $30 million on his own advertising, although the money was raised from supporters.

As for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, on Monday she spoke at a community meeting in Ankeny, Iowa: ""Michael Bloomberg is making a bet about democracy in 2020. He doesn't need people, he only needs bags and bags of money. I think Michael Bloomberg is wrong and that's what we need to prove in this election.""

Bloomberg said his campaign would focus on issues including gun control, the environment and education. But already, his campaign has been shrouded in ethics concerns and dogged by his past policies. For example, the news service that bears Bloomberg's name said Sunday it will not “investigate” him or any of his Democratic rivals, and Bloomberg Opinion will no longer run unsigned editorials.

Bloomberg News' announcement led the organization’s former Washington bureau chief to blast the decision as “staggering” and “not journalism.”

And last month, during remarks where he looked to the future before a majority-black church in Brooklyn, Bloomberg suddenly apologized for his unprecedented “stop and frisk” policy that sowed distrust of police in black and Latino communities during his administration.

That policy, which was later repealed, allowed police to stop individuals on the street and briefly question and frisk them if they had reasonable suspicion that the person may be committing, had committed or is about to commit a crime. During his speech, Bloomberg recognized that the policy, which has been credited for cutting down on violent crime, led to “far too many innocent people” being stopped, many of them black or Latino.

“Over time I’ve come to understand something that I’ve long struggled to admit to myself,” Bloomberg told congregants at the Christian Cultural Center in the East New York neighborhood of Brooklyn. “I got something important wrong. I got something important really wrong. ... The erosion of that trust bothered me. And I want to earn it back.""

But, the city's top police union hit back within hours, while commentators noted that Bloomberg had defended ""stop and frisk"" even after a judge ruled it was unconstitutional as enforced in 2013. (""This is a dangerous decision made by a judge who I think does not understand how policing works and what is compliant with the U.S. Constitution as determined by the Supreme Court,” Bloomberg told the media at the time. “I worry for my kids, and I worry for your kids. I worry for you and I worry for me. Crime can come back any time the criminals think they can get away with things. We just cannot let that happen.”)

“Mayor Bloomberg could have saved himself this apology if he had just listened to the police officers on the street,"" Police Benevolent Association President Patrick J. Lynch said.

""We said in the early 2000s that the quota-driven emphasis on street stops was polluting the relationship between cops and our communities,"" Lynch continued. ""His administration’s misguided policy inspired an anti-police movement that has made cops the target of hatred and violence, and stripped away many of the tools we had used to keep New Yorkers safe. The apology is too little, too late.""

The one-minute ad, which was posted on social media and features images of Bloomberg campaigning alongside those during his younger years, shots of New York City and unflattering images of President Trump, is “the launch ad,” according to one of his top advisers.

Along with the video, Bloomberg posted a written statement on his campaign website in which he laid out why he was the best candidate to defeat President Trump next November.

“I’m running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America,” Bloomberg wrote.

BLOOMBERG LAUNCHING 'MASSIVE' COAST TO COAST TV AD BUY

“We cannot afford four more years of President Trump’s reckless and unethical actions,” he continued. “He represents an existential threat to our country and our values. If he wins another term in office, we may never recover from the damage.”

There has been speculation for months that Bloomberg, who donated millions of his own dollars to Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterm elections, would enter the 2020 fray, but rumors hit a frenzied point earlier this month when he completed the paperwork to be on the Democratic primary ballot in Alabama.

Bloomberg had announced earlier this year that he would not seek the party's nomination. But, in a statement obtained by Fox News in early November, his political adviser Howard Wolfson said Bloomberg was worried that the current crop of Democrats seeking the White House was ""not well-positioned"" to defeat President Trump.

""In 2018 [Bloomberg] spent more than $100 million to help elect Democrats to ensure that Congress began to hold the President accountable,"" Wolfson said. ""And this year he helped Democrats win control of both houses of the Virginia legislature.""

He added: ""We now need to finish the job and ensure that Trump is defeated -- but Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to do that.""

Bloomberg's expected move has come amid increasing concern about the leftward drift of the major Democratic candidates, the departure of candidates who failed to gain traction – and talk of other potential late entries.

BLOOMBERG WON'T CAMPAIGN IN EARLY VOTING STATES IF HE RUNS

Bloomberg’s entrance comes just 10 weeks before primary voting begins, an unorthodox move that reflects anxiety within the Democratic Party about the strength of its current candidates.

As a centrist with deep ties to Wall Street, Bloomberg is expected to struggle among the party’s energized progressive base. He became a Democrat only last year. Yet his tremendous resources and moderate profile could be appealing in a primary contest that has become, above all, a quest to find the person best-positioned to deny Trump a second term next November.

Forbes ranked Bloomberg as the 11th-richest person in the world last year with a net worth of roughly $50 billion. Trump, by contrast, was ranked 259th with a net worth of just over $3 billion.

Already, Bloomberg has vowed to spend at least $150 million of his fortune on various pieces of a 2020 campaign, including more than $100 million for internet ads attacking Trump, between $15 million and $20 million on a voter registration drive largely targeting minority voters, and more than $30 million on an initial round of television ads.

Even before the announcement was final, Democratic rivals like Bernie Sanders pounced on Bloomberg’s plans to rely on his personal fortune.

“I’m disgusted by the idea that Michael Bloomberg or any billionaire thinks they can circumvent the political process and spend tens of millions of dollars to buy elections,” Sanders tweeted on Friday.

Elizabeth Warren, another leading progressive candidate, also slammed Bloomberg on Saturday for trying to buy the presidency.

""I understand that rich people are going to have more shoes than the rest of us, they're going to have more cars than the rest of us, they're going to have more houses,” she said after a campaign stop in Manchester, New Hampshire. “But they don't get a bigger share of democracy, especially in a Democratic primary. We need to be doing the face-to-face work that lifts every voice.""

Calling the evidence against the president ""overwhelming, unchallenged and damning,"" Schiff nevertheless asserted that investigative work would continue, and left open the possibility that Democrats would hold additional hearings. But all scheduled public hearings before Schiff's panel wrapped up on a testy note last week, and no new proceedings are planned.

""As required under House Resolution 660, the Committees are now preparing a report summarizing the evidence we have found this far, which will be transmitted to the Judiciary Committee soon after Congress returns from the Thanksgiving recess,"" Schiff wrote in a letter to congressional colleagues.

He noted that the report ""will catalog the instances of non-compliance with lawful subpoenas as part of our report to the Judiciary Committee, which will allow that committee to consider whether an article of impeachment based on obstruction of Congress is warranted along with an article or articles based on this underlying conduct or other presidential misconduct. Such obstruction was the basis of the third article of impeachment against President Richard Nixon.""

In a worrying omen for moderate Democrats in swing districts that could have factored into Schiff's decision, polls have shown that independents are souring on the impeachment process. Fifty percent of independents questioned in an NPR/PBS/Marist poll conducted Nov. 11-15 did not support impeaching and removing Trump from office, with just 42 percent backing such a move. That’s a slight dip in support compared with the previous NPR/PBS/Marist poll – conducted the first week in October – when support stood at 45 percent.

TRUMP CALLS FOR SENATE TRIAL, SEEKS WHISTLEBLOWER AND SCHIFF AS IMPEACHMENT WITNESSES

Once it receives Schiff's report, the House Judiciary Committee has the option of drafting articles of impeachment outright or holding further hearings. Under a resolution passed by House Democrats on the Rules Committee this past October, Trump and the White House potentially would have more rights to defend themselves in any potential Judiciary Committee hearings. For example, attorneys for the president could participate in such proceedings.

But, in a bid for leverage, Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., would be allowed under the rules to deny ""specific requests"" by Trump representatives if the White House continued refusing to provide documents or witnesses sought by Democratic investigators.

A possible timetable for impeachment has been unclear. It’s generally thought the Judiciary Committee may hold a ""markup"" in which it writes articles of impeachment in mid-December. If that were to happen, it's possible the full House could vote on articles of impeachment sometime close to Christmas. That would be a similar timeframe to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton: The House impeached Clinton just before Christmas in 1998. The Senate trial then began in January 1999.

Fox News reported last week that Democrats were considering four articles of impeachment against the president: Abuse of power, bribery, contempt of Congress, and obstruction of justice.

At a meeting with top GOP senators and Trump administration officials at the White House last Thursday, Fox News is told there was a consensus that should Trump be impeached by the House, the GOP-controlled Senate should hold a full trial, rather than ignore the issue.

""Frankly, I want a trial,"" Trump declared Friday on “Fox & Friends.”

""Frankly, I want a trial."" — President Trump

Trump has argued that U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland's testimony before the Intelligence Committee was a total exoneration. ""I just noticed one thing and that would mean it’s all over,"" Trump said on the White House lawn before reading from handwritten notes taken during Sondland’s testimony. Sondland testified about a conversation with Trump during which he asked the president what he wanted from Ukraine.

""It was a very short, abrupt conversation,"" the ambassador said. ""He was not in a good mood, and he just said, 'I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing.' Something to that effect.""

KEY WITNESSES UNDERCUT CLAIMS OF 'QUID PRO QUO' .... DIPLOMAT THEN CLAIMS 'QUID PRO QUO,' BUT ADMITS IT'S BASED ENTIRELY ON HIS PRESUMPTIONS

Reports have surfaced that Republicans were considering even holding a long trial to disrupt the 2020 presidential primaries. Several Democrats seeking to unseat Trump -- including Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders -- are senators who would need to divert at least some of their campaigning time toward a potential trial.

Should the House approve impeachment articles and trigger a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate, Trump’s allies are already indicating they will look more closely at allegations involving Democrats -- including Trump's allegations of corruption against Joe and Hunter Biden involving their Ukraine dealings.

Additionally, Republicans would likely focus on Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election, and defend the president's push for investigations in that area before releasing any foreign aid. Numerous media outlets, and a Ukrainian court, have confirmed that Ukrainian actors meddled in the election, despite claims by Democrats and many media personalities that the allegations amount to a ""conspiracy theory.""

However, the House theoretically could pass articles of impeachment, but delay a vote to send them to the Senate for consideration -- perhaps to delay handing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., control over the proceedings.

""I think most everybody agreed there's not 51 votes to dismiss it before the managers get to call their case,"" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News after huddling with other top Republican senators and White House officials. ""The idea you would dismiss the trial before they presented the cases is a non-starter. You're not going to get a motion to dismiss.""

But, Graham indicated that any Senate trial wouldn't be pleasant for at least one Democratic presidential frontrunner. On Thursday, Graham penned a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting the release of any documents related to contacts between Biden former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, and to a meeting between son Hunter Biden’s business partner and former Secretary of State John Kerry.

The letter pertained to Biden's successful push to have Ukraine's top prosecutor fired by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid when he was vice president and in charge of Ukraine policy. The prosecutor was probing Burisma holdings, where Hunter Biden held a highly lucrative role on the board despite having little relevant experience.

Already, some witnesses in the impeachment probe have raised concerns about the Biden's dealings in Ukraine.

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, for example, testified behind closed doors last month that he had qualms about the younger Biden's role on the board of Burisma. And former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch said she was ""aware"" of a potential issue, because Obama administration officials prepped her for questions about Hunter Biden during her confirmation process.

""I was aware of it because as I told you before in the deposition, there had been a -- in terms of the preparation for my Senate confirmation hearings for Ukraine, there was a question about that and a select answer, so I was aware of it,"" Yovanovitch said.

She added that she was told that if the matter came up, she should refer questions to other departments.

And often, she's got a new federal agency for that, too.

A Fox News analysis of the Democratic presidential candidate's myriad and much-touted plans reveals that Warren's ambitious agenda of policy prescriptions would not only prompt sweeping change in everything from health care to clean energy, but would come with the creation of at least 20 offices, bureaus, agencies, divisions or councils.

ELIZABETH WARREN RALLY WITH AYANNA PRESSLEY BROUGHT TO BRIEF HALT BY PRO SCHOOL-CHOICE PROTESTERS

Some of these are entirely new; some would replace existing agencies, only on a bigger scale; and some would represent a relaunch of old agencies disbanded years ago. Taken together, what is proposed is a significant expansion in the size of the federal bureaucracy.

If elected president, Warren vows she'll oversee the establishment of new offices that would be responsible for educating members of Congress on technology, investigating ethics violations, ensuring the U.S. is trading with green countries and much, much more.

For instance, a new Secure Democracy Administration would have the power to take over the administration of federal elections from state governments that run afoul of certain standards. A White House Budgetary Office of Tribal Affairs would ""track and advance"" Native American-related spending.

From Warren's perspective, it's just more evidence of the detail-rich policy pitch that has defined her candidacy. But Republicans see more evidence of an over-reliance on big government -- and a political liability.

""No surprise that Elizabeth Warren wants to expand unnecessary government bureaucracy on top of her radical socialist proposals,"" Sarah Matthews, the deputy press secretary for President Trump's re-election campaign, told Fox News. ""Despite what Elizabeth Warren may think, more big government isn’t the solution. President Trump believes our government should be smaller, smarter, and more efficient which is why he has delivered on his campaign promise to shrink the federal bureaucracy and get the government off the backs of the American people.""

Most of the new offices are explicitly outlined in Warren's campaign literature. But the total could be higher. At least one office -- the Office of United States Corporations -- is prescribed in a Warren bill linked to one of her campaign proposals, though the office is not mentioned on the campaign site.

The entity, under Warren's legislation, would issue charters to large American companies permitting them to operate. Hinting at this, Warren's ""Accountable Capitalism"" plan calls for issuing charters to American companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.

Warren's fondness for government agencies is hardly a secret. Her affiliation with one is part of her personal narrative. She mentions repeatedly on her site that she was one of then-President Obama's top advisers while his administration was creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

""Even though she wasn’t even in Congress at the time, she fought for the agency, built public support for it, and Barack Obama signed it into law in 2010,"" Warren's campaign website states. ""She then helped build the agency up from scratch. Now that agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has returned $12 billion directly to consumers scammed by financial institutions.""

ELIZABETH WARREN VOWS TO USE TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO TEAR DOWN BORDER WALL

The Warren campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this report.

Below is the full list of entities Warren says she would create:

CONSERVATIVE GROUP'S STUDY: 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' WOULD WORSEN FINANCIALSITUATIOMN FOR MAJORITY OF US HOUSEHOLDS

But Warren's plans don't just create offices. She further advocates for a litany of commissions, programs and positions that also would expand the scope of other parts of the federal bureaucracy.

She proposes a commission on disability rights that would ensure federal disaster spending is ADA compliant, a ""diplomatic equivalent of the ROTC program"" and a Special Envoy for the Human Rights of LGBTI Persons, to name a few.

All these government entities would need to be funded, which would mean additional spending on top of other costly benefit programs ranging from ""Medicare-for-all"" to student debt cancellation.

KEY DEM INDICATES WARREN'S WEALTH TAX HAS LITTLE CHANCE OF PASSING THE HOUSE

Warren has called for ""big structural change,"" as a cornerstone of her campaign as she competes with Bernie Sanders -- a self-identified Democratic socialist -- for more progressive and liberal voters in the Democratic primary. Some Democrats, however, have worried that her expansive vision will turn away moderates and independents.

Fellow 2020 hopeful Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., hit Warren on one of her more controversial policies -- a 2 percent wealth tax on individuals worth more than $50 million -- during the Democratic presidential debate in Atlanta last week.

""The tax the way we're putting it forward right now, the wealth tax, I'm sorry it's cumbersome, it's been tried by other nations, it's hard to evaluate. We can get the same amount of revenue through just taxation,"" Booker said in a heated exchange with Warren.

Warren's website says she would use the wealth tax to help fund many of her proposals. However, conservatives decry Warren's embrace of more government agencies and programs as a move in the wrong direction.

""It would take an army of bureaucrats and vastly more spending to realize Senator Warren’s command and control aspirations,"" said Romina Boccia, director of the conservative Heritage Foundation's Grover M.Hermann Center for the Federal Budget.

She also warned that the ""swamp"" President Trump vowed to drain still bubbles with bureaucracy: ""President Trump’s administration continues to have success in draining the swamp through deregulation. And yet, we’ve also seen vast, irresponsible spending increases that feed the swamp. Returning power to the people must include starving the bureaucratic beast, which means holding the line on spending."""

BLOOMY THROWS WARREN A LIFELINE

After a brutal six-week stretch, there’s finally some good news for the flagging fortunes of Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign.



In early October, the political press prematurely ordained the Massachusetts Democrat as her party’s front-runner. But Warren had landed splay-footed. She was nowhere near ready to deal with the scrutiny after months of fawning coverage and deference from her rivals. It’s been brutal.



The proximate cause of Warren’s woes was said to have been her triple-dip goofs on health insurance: No plan, a politically preposterous plan and then a rapid walk-back under pressure.



Adding to her woes have been problems with her biographical claims, including a dispute over whether she really was fired for being pregnant as a young woman and now over her denial that her children attended private school.



That all left Warren stuck between emboldened rivals to her right, particularly front-runner former Vice President Joe Biden and a surging South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and her longtime frenemy to her left, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.



Underpinning all of Warren’s problems is an understanding among many Democrats that she represents a special risk to her party as a potential nominee. Her out-of-the-mainstream ideology combined with a demeanor so dour that she makes Hillary Clinton seem cheerful is a potent combination for Republican message makers.



As House Democrats prepare for a brutal fight to retain the moderate, suburban swing districts that delivered them the lower chamber in 2018 and as party strategists survey the swing-state map, they have to see Warren as a worst-case scenario right now.



That understanding helps explain how Biden keeps his national lead and how Buttigieg has overtaken Warren in her previous strongholds of Iowa and New Hampshire.



But the same pundit-politico Democratic intelligentsia that has of late suddenly realized Warren’s massive defects still maintains its dislike of Biden. Biden, 77, is said to be too old, too gaffe prone and too much of an insider to be a good nominee. In the crucial “Morning Joe” and snarky Twitter primary, Biden is still mostly a punchline. As his puny fundraising shows, Democratic elites are still down on Sheriff Joe. And an establishmentarian front-runner without the backing of said establishment is as out of place as Corn Pop on a Wilmington city pool high dive.



Riding into the fray amid a cannonade of cash is former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who, with $30 million Friday, has already set a new record for single-day campaign spending.



But other than the owners of local television stations and the realtors selling vacation homes to his consultants, who stands to benefit from Bloomberg’s big buy in?



Why Warren, of course.



This isn’t complicated, folks. Just as Biden has benefited from the competition between Warren and Sanders — two hard-left, New England senators in their seventies — Warren will be aided by the rivalry between two moderate, Mid-Atlantic 77-year-olds.



It’s still unknowable what Bloomberg’s money can buy him. His forerunner, billionaire investor Tom Steyer, has been a fizzle in a tartan tie. But Bloomberg is a more formidable candidate, and not just for his service as mayor of America’s largest city.



As a media mogul and survivor of the same tabloid press that produced Donald Trump, Bloomberg has more moxie. Plus, he has more than one necktie.



How big will Bloomberg open? Will he draw from Biden more than Buttigieg? Will he be able to elbow onto the December debate stage? Can he connect with the black voters who have succored Biden?



That all remains to be seen. But we know for sure that Bloomberg is a godsend for Warren.



Aside from dividing the support for her rivals, Bloomberg, erstwhile Republican and Wall Street enthusiast, makes the perfect foil. She’s been talking for a year about not letting billionaires buy the election and Bloomberg rides into the arena blasting millions into the stands like free t-shirts out of a slingshot.



Democrats may ultimately choose to ignore Bloomberg’s bid, but for as long as he is a fascination, he’s helping Warren.



THE RULEBOOK: EVERYONE GETS TWO

“The equality of representation in the Senate is another point, which, being evidently the result of compromise between the opposite pretensions of the large and the small States, does not call for much discussion.” – Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, Federalist No. 62



TIME OUT: SAME WITH AXE BODY SPRAY

NYT: “When a bird preens its feathers, it uses a little of nature’s own pomade: an oil made by glands just above the tail. This oil helps clean and protect the bird’s plumage, but also contains a delicate bouquet of scents. To other birds — potential mates or would-be rivals — these smells carry many messages, not unlike the birdsongs and fancy feathers that are more obvious to human observers. These scents may signal that a bird would be dangerous to encounter or might be ready to mate, or any number of other cues. However, new research … suggests that these odoriferous messages may not be entirely of the bird’s own making. In a study published last month in the Journal of Experimental Biology, biologists reported that microbes living peacefully on the birds’ oil glands may play an important role in making the scent molecules involved. That implies that the birds’ microbiomes may influence both the smell and the behavior it provokes in other birds.”

I’LL TELL YOU WHAT: ARE YOU GONNA EAT THAT?

In Friday’s edition of I’ll Tell You What, Dana Perino and Chris Stirewalt discuss the week that was on Capitol Hill, a snoozer of a debate in Atlanta and a road trip comedy with President Trump and Senator Romney. And there's trivia. LISTEN AND SUBSCRIBE HERE



BLOOMBERG NEWS WILL AVOID REPORTS ON OWNER DURING CAMPAIGN

WaPo: “Bloomberg News will stop writing unsigned editorials and its reporters will avoid investigating the personal life and finances of its owner, Mike Bloomberg, as the news organization seeks to avoid conflicts of interest in covering Bloomberg’s newly announced candidacy for president. In an extraordinary memo to his newsroom on Sunday, Bloomberg News Editor in Chief John Micklethwait outlined steps designed to steer his reporters through a potential journalistic minefield: how to cover the campaign of the man who owns the news organization that is covering him. … Bloomberg operates one of the world’s largest media organizations, with about 2,700 journalists in TV, radio, magazine and digital operations. … Most notably, [Micklethwait] said his newsroom would continue ‘our tradition’ of not investigating Bloomberg, his family and his wealth, ‘and we will extend the same policy to his rivals in the Democratic primaries.’”



Biden can’t remember veep prospects’ names - NY Post: “Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has at least four women in mind as potential running mates — but had a hard time remembering their names when an Iowa voter asked him Friday who he would choose. … Biden then ran through a list of four prominent Democrats — without using any of their names. ‘The former assistant attorney general who got fired who was just in Delaware,’ he began, an apparent reference to Sally Yates… ‘The leader of the, uh, the woman who should’ve been the governor of Georgia, the African American woman,’ he continued — meaning Stacey Abrams… ‘The two senators from the state of New Hampshire,’ he concluded. That would be Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan. Abrams … is widely seen as a top veep prospect in 2020. Yates, Shaheen, and Hassan have not been cited as potential running mates before now.”



Buttigieg proposes long-term care benefits for older Americans - Fox News: “Presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg on Monday rolled out a plan to ‘promote dignity and security in retirement’ through additional regular payments to older Americans, along with imposing a payroll tax on the wealthiest Americans to ‘protect Social Security forever.’ The South Bend, Ind., mayor said his father had been admitted to a hospital last winter for an undisclosed illness, and died this past January. He said a social worker told him the best option for long-term care would be to deplete their assets in order to qualify for Medicaid. … On Monday, his campaign announced plans to establish Long-Term Care America, a program providing people 65 and older with a benefit of $90 per day. ‘Over 11 million will receive benefits from the program throughout their lifetime,’ according to the proposal.”



Black voters: Representation doesn’t mean change - NYT: “Moderate black voters, particularly older ones whose support has helped former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. maintain his lead atop most primary polls, pointed to the election of President Trump, and said nominating the candidate they saw as most capable of ending his administration was a moral priority above all others. And some black voters on the left — particularly younger ones — are disappointed by some aspects of former President Barack Obama’s legacy and have embraced the idea that supporting a candidate who is willing to upend unjust systems is more important than choosing one from their own community. … The sentiment among members of the black electorate has squeezed some candidates from both sides, and is especially meaningful for Mr. [Cory] Booker and Ms. [Kamala] Harris, two black candidates looking to replicate Mr. Obama’s electoral playbook.”



Booker wins praise but no support - WaPo: “As he struggles with low-single-digit polling and the prospect of missing the cut for next month’s debate, Booker has become a symbol for the harsh reality of this year’s nominating process. It is just not enough to win plaudits for performance, as he has after multiple events, or to execute a clear campaign strategy. In the shadow of Trump’s potential reelection, Democratic voters have become focused on winning and are unforgiving with their doubts. Booker has sought to answer that concern by preaching the power of empathy. He appeals to white Iowa and New Hampshire voters by talking about the problems of inner cities and poverty. He has confronted Trump by explaining his compassion for his supporters. And unlike other campaigns that have pivoted on message and policy, he has made clear he will not change his strategy to win.”



MULVANEY SOUGHT TO JUSTIFY WITHHOLDING UKRAINE AID

NYT: “Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, asked officials in the budget office after President Trump’s July 25 call with the Ukrainian president whether there was a legal justification for withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, according to two people briefed on an internal White House review. The discussions, which took place via email in August, came after the hold on the $391 million had already been put in place. Mr. Mulvaney also asked the officials at the Office of Management and Budget how long the aid could be withheld, three people familiar with the review said. The emails, which were first reported by The Washington Post on Sunday, were surfaced during a review by the White House Counsel’s Office that is examining the events surrounding the Ukraine call. They raise the question of whether Mr. Mulvaney was seeking after the fact to justify the hold, which is central to Democrats’ impeachment investigation into whether Mr. Trump abused his office for political gain, or whether his request was routine.”



House Intel has video, audio recordings from Giuliani associate - ABC News: “The House Intelligence Committee is in possession of audio and video recordings and photographs provided to the committee by Lev Parnas, an associate of President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who reportedly played a key role in assisting him in his efforts to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and Ukraine, multiple sources familiar with the matter tell ABC News. The material submitted to the committee includes audio, video and photos that include Giuliani and Trump. It was unclear what the content depicts and the committees only began accessing the material last week. ‘We have subpoenaed Mr. Parnas and Mr. [Igor] Fruman for their records. We would like them to fully comply with those subpoenas,’ House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff told CNN Sunday, with a committee spokesperson adding they would not elaborate beyond the chairman's comments.”



Schiff says Dems plan to keep moving forward - WaPo: “House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said Sunday that his panel will press ahead with its impeachment report even though key witnesses have not testified, in the latest signal that Democrats are moving swiftly in their probe of President Trump’s alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine. In an interview on CNN’s ‘State of the Union,’ Schiff said the evidence against Trump is ‘already overwhelming,’ although he stopped short of saying whether he would support impeachment himself. ‘Yes, we’d love to have these witnesses come in,’ Schiff said. ‘But we’re not willing to simply allow them to wait us out — to stall this proceeding — when the facts are already overwhelming.’”



Vulnerable Dems worry about constituent reactions at home - Politico: “Vulnerable Democrats are watching in horror as GOP impeachment attacks deluge their districts back home. And they want a much stronger counteroffensive from their own party and its allies. Some of those Democrats raised their concerns with party leaders this week as they prepared to leave for Thanksgiving recess, fearing that voters will be bombarded by anti-impeachment ads as families gather around the TV for parades and football, according to multiple lawmakers and aides. GOP-aligned outside groups have spent roughly $8 million on TV spots this cycle in battleground districts… The vast majority of those ads specifically hammer Democrats over impeachment. Meanwhile, swing-district Democrats are receiving little reinforcement from their own party or even other liberal coalitions.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS

“If you jump back and forth between Fox News, Politico, and CNN you would think the impeachment hearings occurred on alternate universes. Witness X is the best thing since sliced bread, say the Dems and their Media allies. Witness X is a bomb thrower and anti-American, say the Republicans. I tend to believe that nobody has a constitutional right to a federal job. If they the Deep Statists can’t follow the President’s lead, they should follow the lead or resign. How do you know which side to believe (other than reading only Half Time Report 24/7)??” – Ron Smith, Larned, Kan.



[Ed. note: Did you ever hear the one about the blind men trying to describe an elephant? One said it was a snake, one said it was a rope, one said it was the trunk of a tree. It all depended on where they stood. I will say that Fox News’ coverage — helmed by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum — has done a very fine job of showing you the whole elephant. But I take your point about the overall coverage. I encourage people to do a few things when it comes to navigating the political press. First, mostly try to ignore rank partisans. They’re usually boring anyway. Second, seek out good, in-depth reporting first. I start my day with the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times and go from there. Third, remember that nobody has a monopoly on the truth. American citizenship demands discernment and attentiveness.]

TACOS. IS THERE ANYTHING THEY CAN’T DO?

KOLD: “An Arizona man claimed a taco helped save his life after a near-miss with a stray bullet. KOLD reported that a Tucson, Arizona named Ryan Bishop man said he feels lucky to be alive after a bullet came close to causing him serious injuries and possibly death while he was driving. Bishop told KOLD that, just before 12:30 p.m. on Sunday, he was driving down Houghton Road when the driver's window of his vehicle shattered. … Bishop said he got a safe distance away and pulled over to call police. That's when he said he saw a bullet. … Bishop said he normally drives with his windows down and his arm on the window ledge, exactly where the bullet hit the vehicle. ‘I'm pretty sure [eating a] taco saved my life or at least stopped my arm from getting blown apart,’ he said. ‘I had the window closed because I didn’t want pieces of the taco flying around.’”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“This episode and others have brought me to the highly self-serving conclusion that nothing parents do alters a child’s character anyway, so there is no need to fret that some misdirected pedagogy or slip of the tongue will forever ruin him.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on Feb. 23, 1990.

On the roster: Bernie, Warren, Buttigieg, Biden knotted in N.H. - Detroit Democrat does impeachment flip-flop-flip - Audible: How it’s done - The car that caught the dog



BERNIE, WARREN, BUTTIGIEG, BIDEN KNOTTED IN N.H.

Boston Globe: “A new Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll of likely New Hampshire Democratic primary voters shows a tight, four-way contest, with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on top but statistically tied with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and former vice president Joe Biden. It has been decades since this many candidates have jostled for the lead so soon before a New Hampshire presidential primary. On Monday, longtime New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner officially scheduled the vote for Feb. 11. The survey found Sanders, who won the New Hampshire primary in 2016, leading the field with 16 percent, including those who lean toward the candidate. Warren had 14 percent, Buttigieg had 13 percent, and Biden had 12 percent. All other candidates, including former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, who jumped in the race this month, were in single digits. The poll suggested little about this race is set in stone.”



Senior Biden staffer, Latina adviser quits campaign - Politico: “A senior Joe Biden campaign staffer in charge of outreach to Latino, African-American and women’s groups has quit her post, telling two allies she was frustrated over her lack of input and with the presidential candidate’s immigration rhetoric. Vanessa Cárdenas, the most senior Latina Biden staffer, had been serving as national coalitions director since the campaign formally announced its existence April 25. She resigned last week and has since changed her bio on Twitter to say she was ‘formerly with @joebiden.’ Cárdenas did not return a call or text message, but two friends familiar with her thinking told POLITICO that she felt the campaign wasn’t heeding her advice on immigration as she tried to reach out to Latino groups that have had longstanding concerns with the former vice president’s rhetoric and record stemming from the Obama administration.”



Bloomy’s low-key, high-dollar launch - NYT: “Michael R. Bloomberg started his campaign at a hushed diner in downtown Norfolk, Va. … before strolling to a nearby hotel ballroom and making an efficient statement before a bank of television cameras. Accompanied by a small platoon of aides, including two of his former deputy mayors from New York City and a security team that flitted around a downtown waterfront nearly barren of pedestrians, Mr. Bloomberg described himself as a political pragmatist skilled at wielding his wealth to win elections. … If Mr. Bloomberg’s first in-person appearance as a presidential candidate lacked something in organic political energy, he has already jolted the race through the sheer scale of his political spending, stunning the Democratic political establishment and stirring an outcry from the party’s populist wing.”



Deval Patrick has a long way to go - Politico: “To call Deval Patrick’s campaign a shoestring operation would be insulting to shoestrings. Attend a Patrick event and there’s not a bumper sticker or pin to be found, let alone organizers with clipboards collecting names of would-be voters. His ground game looks to be nonexistent: The entire campaign appears to consist of a handful of volunteers and one publicly announced staffer, campaign manager Abe Rakov. In comparison, other campaigns have several hundred paid staffers and dozens of offices combined — and that’s just in New Hampshire. Patrick has spent the first dozen days of his campaign trying to persuade senior Democratic leaders in the early voting states to take him seriously. They want to give the former Massachusetts governor with an inspirational life story and friendship with Barack Obama the benefit of the doubt. But Patrick has a way to go before they fully buy in.”



Ryan Lizza: Waiting for Obama - Politico: “The post-presidency of Obama is unlike any other. Many presidents have had to navigate the tricky politics of leaving office when a president from the other party takes over. And plenty of presidents have had to grapple with the delicate situation of their vice president seeking a promotion. But Obama has to grapple with both situations simultaneously, and under unprecedented conditions: Obama is under near daily personal assault from the president, who has tweeted about him relentlessly in the past three years, often accusing him and his top officials of an array of crimes, a situation that no ex-president has faced or even imagined.”



THE RULEBOOK: IT’S IN THE DETAILS

“THE erection of a new government, whatever care or wisdom may distinguish the work, cannot fail to originate questions of intricacy and nicety; and these may, in a particular manner, be expected to flow from the establishment of a constitution founded upon the total or partial incorporation of a number of distinct sovereignties.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 82



TIME OUT: PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE AFTER THE TONE

Smithsonian: “In the spring of 1900, twenty-four years after Alexander Graham Bell introduced the telephone, a Danish inventor named Valdemar Poulsen unveiled the ‘telegraphone’ at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. It was an engineering marvel—Poulsen recorded sound on a wire using nothing but a magnet, similar to the principle that underlies computer hard drives—and it was a minor social miracle, an antidote to Bell’s constantly ringing telephone. The telegraphone was the world’s first answering machine. … Not everyone was overjoyed. AT&T, which held a monopoly on the U.S. phone system and forbid the use of third-party technology, suppressed the innovation for more than half a century, according to research by Mark Clark, a historian of technology. … A big concern was that the device would be used not just to answer calls but to record conversations. The American Telegraphone Company, which had attempted unsuccessfully to market the machine, claimed that AT&T feared the device’s ability to record calls.”

DETROIT DEMOCRAT DOES IMPEACHMENT FLIP-FLOP-FLIP

Detroit Metro Times: “Rep. Brenda Lawrence [D-Mich.] is walking back statements she made about impeaching President Trump in an interview with Charlie LeDuff. In a written statement to Metro Times, Lawrence said she still supports impeaching Trump but censure may be a more viable option because of Republicans’ opposition to impeachment. ‘I was an early supporter for impeachment in 2017,’ Lawrence says. ‘The House Intelligence Committee followed a very thorough process in holding hearings these past two weeks. The information they revealed confirmed that this President has abused the power of his office, therefore I continue to support impeachment. However, I am very concerned about Senate Republicans and the fact that they would find this behavior by the President acceptable.’”

AUDIBLE: HOW IT’S DONE

“Chris Wallace is a damn good reporter. He asked me a very direct question. He asked me about hacking the DNC computer. I heard him say I thought he'd said meddling in the election. Chris was right. I was wrong. So let me be clear. Russia hacked the DNC computer. I have no evidence whatsoever that Ukraine did it.” – Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., on “America’s Newsroom” taking a do-over for statements he made on “Fox News Sunday.”



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Upon hearing yet another of Joe Biden’s continuing verbal gaffes, I’m reminded that when Gov. Rick Perry had ONE instance of ‘brain fade’ during a presidential debate, it did great damage to his campaign and his viability as a candidate. But when we hear Biden’s frequent brain fades, during debates and everywhere else, Democrats and the MSM shrug and say, ‘Oh that’s just good ol’ Uncle Joe.’ Doesn’t seem like a level playing field to me – what was levied against the goose ought to be levied against the gander. Short-term memory loss is often a fact of life as we age – OK, fine! But should someone who continuously exhibits those symptoms be in the most powerful position on the planet? Should that person be the commander-in-chief?” – Dave Wittnebert, Seneca, S.C.



[Ed. note: I thiiiiink you may be shading the past in a favorable light for the former secretary of energy. Perry burst into the 2012 primary race as a frontrunner. When he declared in August of 2011 he was already running even with Mitt Romney. By mid-September, Perry was way out in front with a double-digit lead on his fellow former governor. But then the cracks started to show. Aside from some spectacularly bad political moves – dissing Iowa, feuding with the Bush family, etc. – Perry was a simply awful debater. One performance in September in which Perry tried to attack Romney for inconstancy turned into such a debacle that commentators openly wondered about his health. In October, Perry seemed to rally for a bit, but his steep descent had already begun. By the time of the “brain fade” you reference in November, Perry was tied for fifth and headed for the exits. When he couldn’t remember the third federal agency he had called to shutter – ironically, the one he would eventually lead – it was bad enough. But that he stood there vapor locking so long and then eventually said, Heaven help us, “Oops,” it wasn’t instant disqualification. It was the coda to a long symphony of Perry’s ill-conceived, poorly executed presidential campaign. (He would later reveal that the after effects of intense back surgery the summer before his entry had been worse than he had admitted.) Biden takes a lot of abuse for his rambling, discursive answers and the anxiety-inducing inability to land answers. But that’s been his thing for 40 years. Biden was a notorious blarney and bluster merchant when he first ran in 1988. So I don’t know how much of it is media bias or, as Perry did in his subsequent 2012 candidacy and federal service, what another former Texas governor might call “the soft bigotry of low expectations.”]



“I am puzzled by the whole quid pro quo/bribery charge against Trump for calling for an investigation of Biden. If the investigation showed that there was no wrongdoing, wouldn’t that benefit Biden and be detrimental to Trump? So, those who believe the President urging Zelensky to investigate Biden was bribery (i.e., a benefit to Trump for a granted favor) must assume the investigation would find that Biden is guilty of wrongdoing.” – Pat Conroy, West Lake Hills, Texas



[Ed. note: Why would you ever, ever, ever want a sitting president to directly involve himself in a criminal or corruption matter involving his leading political rival? Instead, one would want the sitting president to keep himself as far removed from the process on that matter more than any except for those that might involve himself or those close to him. Members of the House may get the chance to decide whether what Trump did merits removal and they can debate the names they want to use for specific conduct. But that isn’t about whether Biden did or didn’t do the things Trump claims. The conduct at issue in Congress is about Trump involving himself personally and through his personal attorney in the process. Maybe think of it this way: police or judicial misconduct isn’t dependent on whether the suspect is guilty or not. The two issues are separable.]

THE CAR THAT CAUGHT THE DOG

WPTV: “What dog doesn’t love a car ride? Better yet- a ride behind the wheel? Some Port St. Lucie neighbors watched a dog get the ride of a lifetime. It was stuck inside a car spinning in reverse for nearly an hour. Neighbors say the dog did not seem to mind at all. ‘I figured ‘how the heck did they manage to do that?’’ said neighbor Anna Sabol. Sabol said she looked out her window Thursday morning and a police car grabbed her attention. … She realized they were all responding to a grey sedan spinning in reverse in a cul-de-sac. The one occupant inside was a Black Labrador. … Police say the dog’s owner had briefly stepped out of the car when the dog somehow knocked the car into reverse. Police say they were able to stop the joyride by punching the passcode into the driver’s side door. But, not before the dog took out a mailbox, a trash can, and moved some bricks in front of a home. … Police say the dog was not hurt. No neighbors were hurt. … Instead, they say the dog seemed pretty happy about his first, and likely last, solo drive.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“The sun rises regularly, too, but so often that we can't help being dulled to the wonder of its rhythm. And what rhythms, beyond that of the familiar year, really touch us?” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on Dec. 13, 1985.

"" I don't know whether a 77-year-old anti-gun New Yorker can win the Democratic nomination or the presidential election, but he has taken a buzz saw to the party and split it down the middle.""

BLOOMBERG UNION FIRES BACK ON BAN TO AVOID INVESTIGATING 2020 DEMS: 'SILENCING JOURNALISTS'

A video released on Sunday by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg marked the official start of the politician/media mogul's 2020 presidential run, Fox News reported.

“I’m running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America,” Bloomberg wrote.

There has been speculation for months that Bloomberg, who donated millions of his own dollars to Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterm elections, would enter the 2020 fray, but then he completed the paperwork to be on the Democratic primary ballot in Alabama.

Varney said he finds it ironic that Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, both of whom have ""built their campaigns around getting rid of billionaires,"" are now running against ""Bloomberg's mountain of money.""

""Money really talks in politics,"" Varney added.

Warren and Sanders shouldn't be the only ones opposed to a Bloomberg run, however, the Fox Nation host observed -- warning Joe Biden of his new competition.

""Joe Biden can't be happy. Joe occupies the center. But his campaign is lackluster and he's not raising much money. Overnight, Bloomberg has taken over the middle ground.,"" Varney explained.

Varney credited Bloomberg for his deliberately late strategy, but his run ""throws the party into even more chaos,"" he said.

BLOOMBERG CAMPAIGN MANAGER ON 2020: TRUMP IS WINNING

""His strategy is unusual, but very smart. He'll enter the race deliberately late. He'll let his competitors tear each other apart and spend their money and then jump into Super Tuesday in March. California and 14 other states hold primary votes that day. Bloomberg's billions will have an enormous impact,"" Varney said.

""And consider this,"" he added, ""there may be an impeachment trial in the Senate right around that time, March of next year. Senators Warren Sanders, Klobuchar, Booker, Harris. They're not going to be on the campaign trail -- they'll have to be in D.C. passing judgment on the president.""

Bloomberg's run further divides the Democratic Party, Varney explained, and he believes it ""opens the door to a Trump win in 2020.""

BLOOMBERG LAUNCHING 'MASSIVE' COAST TO COAST TV AD BUY

""It's hard to believe that Democrats welcome this,"" Varney said.""I can't see the supporters of Warren and Sanders suddenly jumping ship for the $50 billion man. I can't see rural moderates getting behind a candidate who has no time for guns. And I can't see Southerners or Midwesterners supporting a climate warrior.""

""Bloomberg not only splits the party, he throws it into even more chaos. And that means no matter who leads the Democrats next year, the party remains at war with itself.""

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., from winning the Democratic presidential nomination, according to a new report that sheds light on Obama's personal views of the jam-packed primary field with no clear front-runner.

Obama has largely stayed on the sidelines to date, refraining from any endorsements though he has issued general warnings to the party to avoid calls for radical upheaval in their policy pitches. These warnings were seen as a swipe at candidates like Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sanders.

But a new Politico Magazine report gives a clearer picture of what Obama is worried about -- claiming he has said in private he'd speak out against Sanders if it looked like he could actually win.

OBAMA TAKES VEILED SHOT AT WARREN AND SANDERS, WARNS 2020 DEMS AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO 'TEAR DOWN THE SYSTEM'

""Back when Sanders seemed like more of a threat than he does now, Obama said privately that if Bernie were running away with the nomination, Obama would speak up to stop him,"" the report says. An Obama spokesperson, however, reportedly noted that the former president has stated that he would get behind the Democratic nominee regardless of who it is.

One adviser said that while they personally had no knowledge of this, the threat of a Sanders nomination would likely be cause for action.

""I can't really confirm that,"" the adviser said, regarding the possibility of Obama trying to stop Sanders. ""He hasn't said that directly to me. The only reason I'm hesitating at all is because, yeah, if Bernie were running away with it, I think maybe we would all have to say something. But I don't think that's likely. It's not happening.""

This aversion to Sanders would be in line with Obama's recent comments. At an Obama Foundation Summit event in October, Obama took aim at political ""wokeness"" and cancel culture.

""This idea of purity and you're never compromised and you're always politically woke, and all that stuff, you should get over that quickly,"" Obama said.

Weeks later, at a gathering of the Democracy Alliance, Obama warned 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls that most voters do not want to “tear down the system.”

Obama dismissed far-left positions as not being popular among average Americans, even if they make waves on social media.

“Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality and the fact that voters, including the Democratic voters and certainly persuadable independents or even moderate Republicans, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds,” Obama said.

The same Politico report, meanwhile, addressed Obama's relationship with Biden, whom he has not yet endorsed, despite Biden serving as vice president in his administration -- and routinely touting their relationship on the stump.

The Politico piece said Obama recalled to one candidate who came to him for advice how he himself had a bond with the voters that has since faded. He reportedly added, “And you know who really doesn’t have it? Joe Biden.”

Biden says he never sought Obama's endorsement.

But during a Monday speech in the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House, the former two-term Massachusetts governor delivered a pointed warning to fellow members of his party.

“I don’t think you have to hate Republicans to be a good Democrat. I don’t think you have to hate conservatives to be a good progressive or to hate business to be a good social justice warrior,” he said.

PATRICK MAKES A VERY LATE ENTRY INTO WHITE HOUSE RACE

The comment by Patrick at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics's ""Politics and Eggs"" – a must-stop for White House hopefuls – appeared to be an indirect shot at the progressive standard-bearers in the 2020 Democratic nomination race, populist Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

Patrick, who announced his candidacy just a week-and-a-half ago, also highlighted that “we need leadership that understands that unity makes us not only stronger but successful.”

Patrick served as U.S. assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division from 1994-1997 under then-President Bill Clinton. He was elected governor of Massachusetts in 2006 and reelected in 2010, the first black governor in the commonwealth's history.

After leaving office in 2015, Patrick took a job with Bain Capital, the Boston-based private investment firm that became a liability to Mitt Romney – Patrick’s predecessor as Massachusetts governor – during Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign.

While considered a moderate, the 63-year-old Patrick insisted that he’s “not talking about a moderate agenda. That’s the last thing we need.""

Instead, he said he’s “talking about being woke while leaving room for the still-waking. What it takes to govern and what it takes to actually make change that lasts.”

And he said the reason he’s running is his “experience, both in range and depth. I have two terms of accomplishments and reforms as governor, a record of successful leadership in business.”

Launching a campaign with just over two months to go until the start of the nominating calendar, Patrick faces extremely high hurdles, which he acknowledges. But an optimistic Patrick, on his late entry into the race, told reporters “the path we knew was there is wider than I fully appreciated.""

“It’s a wide-open race,” he spotlighted.

And pointing to his rivals for the nomination, he stressed that “the fact that folks have been in for a long time and campaigning for a long time and raising money for a long time has not closed, has not resolved it. It’s a little bit of what I think about the importance of money or lack of money. We want it. We’re raising it so that we’re competitive and we’re confident that we will.”

Patrick’s stop in New Hampshire – his second since announcing his candidacy – came one day after former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg officially launched a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. The multimillionaire business and medial mogul on Monday launched a massive $32 million ad buy, airing biographical TV commercials in media markets from coast to coast.

Asked by Fox News how he can compete against that kind of money, Patrick responded: “I’ve been up against odds like that in the past. We’re going to do the work. I happen to believe that the work is much more about connecting with people personally and where they are in every sense of the term and that’s what we’re going to do.”

Bloomberg is skipping the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, which hold the first four nominating contests in February. Instead, he’s concentrating his firepower on the delegate-rich states that vote on Super Tuesday on March 3 and in the states later in the nominating calendar.

Patrick emphasized his commitment to campaigning in the early voting states, saying, “as a practical matter, we’re going to try to spend a lot of time here in New Hampshire and in South Carolina, but we will be active in Iowa and Nevada as well.”

And he touted that “we’re going to make our presence felt and build this organization.”

Patrick is the second Massachusetts resident in the race, following Warren.

Asked by Fox News about his phone conversation with Warren earlier this month, before he launched his bid, Patrick said “it was uncomfortable. We’re friends and I think in an ideal world, we would be working as collaborators rather than competitors. But I think you can compete with your friends and keep it friendly.”"

The 77-year-old billionaire added that he “looked in the mirror and said, ‘I just cannot let this happen.’""

Calling himself a problem-solver who can rebuild America and beat the “existential threat"" posed by the president, Bloomberg was chatting with people at a diner in Norfolk, Va. The state is part of his strategy of focusing on states with primaries on Super Tuesday.

Bloomberg's remarks echoed those of his campaign manager, Kevin Sheeky, earlier in the day. ""Right now, Donald Trump is winning,"" Sheekey said. ""It’s very tough for people who don’t live in New York or California to understand that, but that is what’s happening.""

Polls have shown that independents are souring on the idea of impeaching and removing Trump from office, including in critical battleground states like Wisconsin, even after House Democrats aggressively presented their case over the past two weeks.

The centrist Bloomberg is joining an already-crowded group of Democrats, who wasted no time in unloading on the former Big Apple mayor. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, for example, said voters don't want ""another wealthy person"" in the White House. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders slammed Bloomberg's $30 million advertising buy, saying he was “disgusted by the idea that Michael Bloomberg or any other billionaire thinks they can circumvent the political process and spend tens of millions of dollars to buy our elections.""

Sanders, for his part, has already committed to spending $30 million on his own advertising, although the money was raised from supporters.

As for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, on Monday she spoke at a community meeting in Ankeny, Iowa: ""Michael Bloomberg is making a bet about democracy in 2020. He doesn't need people, he only needs bags and bags of money. I think Michael Bloomberg is wrong and that's what we need to prove in this election.""

Bloomberg said his campaign would focus on issues including gun control, the environment and education. But already, his campaign has been shrouded in ethics concerns and dogged by his past policies. For example, the news service that bears Bloomberg's name said Sunday it will not “investigate” him or any of his Democratic rivals, and Bloomberg Opinion will no longer run unsigned editorials.

Bloomberg News' announcement led the organization’s former Washington bureau chief to blast the decision as “staggering” and “not journalism.”

And last month, during remarks where he looked to the future before a majority-black church in Brooklyn, Bloomberg suddenly apologized for his unprecedented “stop and frisk” policy that sowed distrust of police in black and Latino communities during his administration.

That policy, which was later repealed, allowed police to stop individuals on the street and briefly question and frisk them if they had reasonable suspicion that the person may be committing, had committed or is about to commit a crime. During his speech, Bloomberg recognized that the policy, which has been credited for cutting down on violent crime, led to “far too many innocent people” being stopped, many of them black or Latino.

“Over time I’ve come to understand something that I’ve long struggled to admit to myself,” Bloomberg told congregants at the Christian Cultural Center in the East New York neighborhood of Brooklyn. “I got something important wrong. I got something important really wrong. ... The erosion of that trust bothered me. And I want to earn it back.""

But, the city's top police union hit back within hours, while commentators noted that Bloomberg had defended ""stop and frisk"" even after a judge ruled it was unconstitutional as enforced in 2013. (""This is a dangerous decision made by a judge who I think does not understand how policing works and what is compliant with the U.S. Constitution as determined by the Supreme Court,” Bloomberg told the media at the time. “I worry for my kids, and I worry for your kids. I worry for you and I worry for me. Crime can come back any time the criminals think they can get away with things. We just cannot let that happen.”)

“Mayor Bloomberg could have saved himself this apology if he had just listened to the police officers on the street,"" Police Benevolent Association President Patrick J. Lynch said.

CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP

""We said in the early 2000s that the quota-driven emphasis on street stops was polluting the relationship between cops and our communities,"" Lynch continued. ""His administration’s misguided policy inspired an anti-police movement that has made cops the target of hatred and violence, and stripped away many of the tools we had used to keep New Yorkers safe. The apology is too little, too late.""

Calling the evidence against the president ""overwhelming, unchallenged and damning,"" Schiff nevertheless asserted that investigative work would continue, and left open the possibility that Democrats would hold additional hearings. But all scheduled public hearings before Schiff's panel wrapped up on a testy note last week, and no new proceedings are planned.

""As required under House Resolution 660, the Committees are now preparing a report summarizing the evidence we have found this far, which will be transmitted to the Judiciary Committee soon after Congress returns from the Thanksgiving recess,"" Schiff wrote in a letter to congressional colleagues.

He noted that the report ""will catalog the instances of non-compliance with lawful subpoenas as part of our report to the Judiciary Committee, which will allow that committee to consider whether an article of impeachment based on obstruction of Congress is warranted along with an article or articles based on this underlying conduct or other presidential misconduct. Such obstruction was the basis of the third article of impeachment against President Richard Nixon.""

In a worrying omen for moderate Democrats in swing districts that could have factored into Schiff's decision, polls have shown that independents are souring on the impeachment process. Fifty percent of independents questioned in an NPR/PBS/Marist poll conducted Nov. 11-15 did not support impeaching and removing Trump from office, with just 42 percent backing such a move. That’s a slight dip in support compared with the previous NPR/PBS/Marist poll – conducted the first week in October – when support stood at 45 percent.

TRUMP CALLS FOR SENATE TRIAL, SEEKS WHISTLEBLOWER AND SCHIFF AS IMPEACHMENT WITNESSES

Once it receives Schiff's report, the House Judiciary Committee has the option of drafting articles of impeachment outright or holding further hearings. Under a resolution passed by House Democrats on the Rules Committee this past October, Trump and the White House potentially would have more rights to defend themselves in any potential Judiciary Committee hearings. For example, attorneys for the president could participate in such proceedings.

But, in a bid for leverage, Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., would be allowed under the rules to deny ""specific requests"" by Trump representatives if the White House continued refusing to provide documents or witnesses sought by Democratic investigators.

A possible timetable for impeachment has been unclear. It’s generally thought the Judiciary Committee may hold a ""markup"" in which it writes articles of impeachment in mid-December. If that were to happen, it's possible the full House could vote on articles of impeachment sometime close to Christmas. That would be a similar timeframe to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton: The House impeached Clinton just before Christmas in 1998. The Senate trial then began in January 1999.

Fox News reported last week that Democrats were considering four articles of impeachment against the president: Abuse of power, bribery, contempt of Congress, and obstruction of justice.

At a meeting with top GOP senators and Trump administration officials at the White House last Thursday, Fox News is told there was a consensus that should Trump be impeached by the House, the GOP-controlled Senate should hold a full trial, rather than ignore the issue.

""Frankly, I want a trial,"" Trump declared Friday on “Fox & Friends.”

""Frankly, I want a trial."" — President Trump

Trump has argued that U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland's testimony before the Intelligence Committee was a total exoneration. ""I just noticed one thing and that would mean it’s all over,"" Trump said on the White House lawn before reading from handwritten notes taken during Sondland’s testimony. Sondland testified about a conversation with Trump during which he asked the president what he wanted from Ukraine.

""It was a very short, abrupt conversation,"" the ambassador said. ""He was not in a good mood, and he just said, 'I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing.' Something to that effect.""

KEY WITNESSES UNDERCUT CLAIMS OF 'QUID PRO QUO' .... DIPLOMAT THEN CLAIMS 'QUID PRO QUO,' BUT ADMITS IT'S BASED ENTIRELY ON HIS PRESUMPTIONS

Reports have surfaced that Republicans were considering even holding a long trial to disrupt the 2020 presidential primaries. Several Democrats seeking to unseat Trump -- including Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders -- are senators who would need to divert at least some of their campaigning time toward a potential trial.

Should the House approve impeachment articles and trigger a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate, Trump’s allies are already indicating they will look more closely at allegations involving Democrats -- including Trump's allegations of corruption against Joe and Hunter Biden involving their Ukraine dealings.

Additionally, Republicans would likely focus on Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election, and defend the president's push for investigations in that area before releasing any foreign aid. Numerous media outlets, and a Ukrainian court, have confirmed that Ukrainian actors meddled in the election, despite claims by Democrats and many media personalities that the allegations amount to a ""conspiracy theory.""

However, the House theoretically could pass articles of impeachment, but delay a vote to send them to the Senate for consideration -- perhaps to delay handing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., control over the proceedings.

""I think most everybody agreed there's not 51 votes to dismiss it before the managers get to call their case,"" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News after huddling with other top Republican senators and White House officials. ""The idea you would dismiss the trial before they presented the cases is a non-starter. You're not going to get a motion to dismiss.""

But, Graham indicated that any Senate trial wouldn't be pleasant for at least one Democratic presidential frontrunner. On Thursday, Graham penned a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting the release of any documents related to contacts between Biden former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, and to a meeting between son Hunter Biden’s business partner and former Secretary of State John Kerry.

The letter pertained to Biden's successful push to have Ukraine's top prosecutor fired by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid when he was vice president and in charge of Ukraine policy. The prosecutor was probing Burisma holdings, where Hunter Biden held a highly lucrative role on the board despite having little relevant experience.

Already, some witnesses in the impeachment probe have raised concerns about the Biden's dealings in Ukraine.

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, for example, testified behind closed doors last month that he had qualms about the younger Biden's role on the board of Burisma. And former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch said she was ""aware"" of a potential issue, because Obama administration officials prepped her for questions about Hunter Biden during her confirmation process.

""I was aware of it because as I told you before in the deposition, there had been a -- in terms of the preparation for my Senate confirmation hearings for Ukraine, there was a question about that and a select answer, so I was aware of it,"" Yovanovitch said.

She added that she was told that if the matter came up, she should refer questions to other departments.

BERNIE, WARREN, BUTTIGIEG, BIDEN KNOTTED IN N.H.

Boston Globe: “A new Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll of likely New Hampshire Democratic primary voters shows a tight, four-way contest, with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on top but statistically tied with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and former vice president Joe Biden. It has been decades since this many candidates have jostled for the lead so soon before a New Hampshire presidential primary. On Monday, longtime New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner officially scheduled the vote for Feb. 11. The survey found Sanders, who won the New Hampshire primary in 2016, leading the field with 16 percent, including those who lean toward the candidate. Warren had 14 percent, Buttigieg had 13 percent, and Biden had 12 percent. All other candidates, including former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, who jumped in the race this month, were in single digits. The poll suggested little about this race is set in stone.”



Senior Biden staffer, Latina adviser quits campaign - Politico: “A senior Joe Biden campaign staffer in charge of outreach to Latino, African-American and women’s groups has quit her post, telling two allies she was frustrated over her lack of input and with the presidential candidate’s immigration rhetoric. Vanessa Cárdenas, the most senior Latina Biden staffer, had been serving as national coalitions director since the campaign formally announced its existence April 25. She resigned last week and has since changed her bio on Twitter to say she was ‘formerly with @joebiden.’ Cárdenas did not return a call or text message, but two friends familiar with her thinking told POLITICO that she felt the campaign wasn’t heeding her advice on immigration as she tried to reach out to Latino groups that have had longstanding concerns with the former vice president’s rhetoric and record stemming from the Obama administration.”

Accompanied by a small platoon of aides, including two of his former deputy mayors from New York City and a security team that flitted around a downtown waterfront nearly barren of pedestrians, Mr. Bloomberg described himself as a political pragmatist skilled at wielding his wealth to win elections. … If Mr. Bloomberg’s first in-person appearance as a presidential candidate lacked something in organic political energy, he has already jolted the race through the sheer scale of his political spending, stunning the Democratic political establishment and stirring an outcry from the party’s populist wing.”



Deval Patrick has a long way to go - Politico: “To call Deval Patrick’s campaign a shoestring operation would be insulting to shoestrings. Attend a Patrick event and there’s not a bumper sticker or pin to be found, let alone organizers with clipboards collecting names of would-be voters. His ground game looks to be nonexistent: The entire campaign appears to consist of a handful of volunteers and one publicly announced staffer, campaign manager Abe Rakov. In comparison, other campaigns have several hundred paid staffers and dozens of offices combined — and that’s just in New Hampshire. Patrick has spent the first dozen days of his campaign trying to persuade senior Democratic leaders in the early voting states to take him seriously. They want to give the former Massachusetts governor with an inspirational life story and friendship with Barack Obama the benefit of the doubt. But Patrick has a way to go before they fully buy in.”



Ryan Lizza: Waiting for Obama - Politico: “The post-presidency of Obama is unlike any other. Many presidents have had to navigate the tricky politics of leaving office when a president from the other party takes over. And plenty of presidents have had to grapple with the delicate situation of their vice president seeking a promotion. But Obama has to grapple with both situations simultaneously, and under unprecedented conditions: Obama is under near daily personal assault from the president, who has tweeted about him relentlessly in the past three years, often accusing him and his top officials of an array of crimes, a situation that no ex-president has faced or even imagined.”



THE RULEBOOK: IT’S IN THE DETAILS

“THE erection of a new government, whatever care or wisdom may distinguish the work, cannot fail to originate questions of intricacy and nicety; and these may, in a particular manner, be expected to flow from the establishment of a constitution founded upon the total or partial incorporation of a number of distinct sovereignties.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 82



TIME OUT: PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE AFTER THE TONE

Smithsonian: “In the spring of 1900, twenty-four years after Alexander Graham Bell introduced the telephone, a Danish inventor named Valdemar Poulsen unveiled the ‘telegraphone’ at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. It was an engineering marvel—Poulsen recorded sound on a wire using nothing but a magnet, similar to the principle that underlies computer hard drives—and it was a minor social miracle, an antidote to Bell’s constantly ringing telephone. The telegraphone was the world’s first answering machine. … Not everyone was overjoyed. AT&T, which held a monopoly on the U.S. phone system and forbid the use of third-party technology, suppressed the innovation for more than half a century, according to research by Mark Clark, a historian of technology. … A big concern was that the device would be used not just to answer calls but to record conversations. The American Telegraphone Company, which had attempted unsuccessfully to market the machine, claimed that AT&T feared the device’s ability to record calls.”

DETROIT DEMOCRAT DOES IMPEACHMENT FLIP-FLOP-FLIP

Detroit Metro Times: “Rep. Brenda Lawrence [D-Mich.] is walking back statements she made about impeaching President Trump in an interview with Charlie LeDuff. In a written statement to Metro Times, Lawrence said she still supports impeaching Trump but censure may be a more viable option because of Republicans’ opposition to impeachment. ‘I was an early supporter for impeachment in 2017,’ Lawrence says. ‘The House Intelligence Committee followed a very thorough process in holding hearings these past two weeks. The information they revealed confirmed that this President has abused the power of his office, therefore I continue to support impeachment. However, I am very concerned about Senate Republicans and the fact that they would find this behavior by the President acceptable.’”

I was wrong. So let me be clear. Russia hacked the DNC computer. I have no evidence whatsoever that Ukraine did it.” – Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., on “America’s Newsroom” taking a do-over for statements he made on “Fox News Sunday.”



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“Upon hearing yet another of Joe Biden’s continuing verbal gaffes, I’m reminded that when Gov. Rick Perry had ONE instance of ‘brain fade’ during a presidential debate, it did great damage to his campaign and his viability as a candidate. But when we hear Biden’s frequent brain fades, during debates and everywhere else, Democrats and the MSM shrug and say, ‘Oh that’s just good ol’ Uncle Joe.’ Doesn’t seem like a level playing field to me – what was levied against the goose ought to be levied against the gander. Short-term memory loss is often a fact of life as we age – OK, fine! But should someone who continuously exhibits those symptoms be in the most powerful position on the planet? Should that person be the commander-in-chief?” – Dave Wittnebert, Seneca, S.C.



[Ed. note: I thiiiiink you may be shading the past in a favorable light for the former secretary of energy. Perry burst into the 2012 primary race as a frontrunner. When he declared in August of 2011 he was already running even with Mitt Romney. By mid-September, Perry was way out in front with a double-digit lead on his fellow former governor. But then the cracks started to show. Aside from some spectacularly bad political moves – dissing Iowa, feuding with the Bush family, etc. – Perry was a simply awful debater. One performance in September in which Perry tried to attack Romney for inconstancy turned into such a debacle that commentators openly wondered about his health. In October, Perry seemed to rally for a bit, but his steep descent had already begun. By the time of the “brain fade” you reference in November, Perry was tied for fifth and headed for the exits. When he couldn’t remember the third federal agency he had called to shutter – ironically, the one he would eventually lead – it was bad enough. But that he stood there vapor locking so long and then eventually said, Heaven help us, “Oops,” it wasn’t instant disqualification. It was the coda to a long symphony of Perry’s ill-conceived, poorly executed presidential campaign. (He would later reveal that the after effects of intense back surgery the summer before his entry had been worse than he had admitted.) Biden takes a lot of abuse for his rambling, discursive answers and the anxiety-inducing inability to land answers. But that’s been his thing for 40 years. Biden was a notorious blarney and bluster merchant when he first ran in 1988. So I don’t know how much of it is media bias or, as Perry did in his subsequent 2012 candidacy and federal service, what another former Texas governor might call “the soft bigotry of low expectations.”]



“I am puzzled by the whole quid pro quo/bribery charge against Trump for calling for an investigation of Biden. If the investigation showed that there was no wrongdoing, wouldn’t that benefit Biden and be detrimental to Trump? So, those who believe the President urging Zelensky to investigate Biden was bribery (i.e., a benefit to Trump for a granted favor) must assume the investigation would find that Biden is guilty of wrongdoing.” – Pat Conroy, West Lake Hills, Texas



[Ed. note: Why would you ever, ever, ever want a sitting president to directly involve himself in a criminal or corruption matter involving his leading political rival? Instead, one would want the sitting president to keep himself as far removed from the process on that matter more than any except for those that might involve himself or those close to him. Members of the House may get the chance to decide whether what Trump did merits removal and they can debate the names they want to use for specific conduct. But that isn’t about whether Biden did or didn’t do the things Trump claims. The conduct at issue in Congress is about Trump involving himself personally and through his personal attorney in the process. Maybe think of it this way: police or judicial misconduct isn’t dependent on whether the suspect is guilty or not. The two issues are separable.]

THE CAR THAT CAUGHT THE DOG

WPTV: “What dog doesn’t love a car ride? Better yet- a ride behind the wheel? Some Port St. Lucie neighbors watched a dog get the ride of a lifetime. It was stuck inside a car spinning in reverse for nearly an hour. Neighbors say the dog did not seem to mind at all. ‘I figured ‘how the heck did they manage to do that?’’ said neighbor Anna Sabol. Sabol said she looked out her window Thursday morning and a police car grabbed her attention. … She realized they were all responding to a grey sedan spinning in reverse in a cul-de-sac. The one occupant inside was a Black Labrador. … Police say the dog’s owner had briefly stepped out of the car when the dog somehow knocked the car into reverse. Police say they were able to stop the joyride by punching the passcode into the driver’s side door. But, not before the dog took out a mailbox, a trash can, and moved some bricks in front of a home. … Police say the dog was not hurt. No neighbors were hurt. … Instead, they say the dog seemed pretty happy about his first, and likely last, solo drive.”



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“The sun rises regularly, too, but so often that we can't help being dulled to the wonder of its rhythm. And what rhythms, beyond that of the familiar year, really touch us?” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on Dec. 13, 1985.

OBAMA TAKES VEILED SHOT AT WARREN AND SANDERS, WARNS 2020 DEMS AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO 'TEAR DOWN THE SYSTEM'

Perino was responding to a report from Politico saying Obama recalled to one candidate who came to him for advice how he himself had a bond with the voters that has since faded. He reportedly added: “And you know who really doesn’t have it? Joe Biden.”

Earlier this month, a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll showed former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg leading the field in Iowa with 25 percent support, a 16 percent increase over his numbers in the September version of the poll. Behind Elizabeth Warren (16 percent) came former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who each garnered 15 percent support.

The former White House press secretary said it's ""pretty clear that Biden doesn't have what it takes in Iowa,"" adding that the Democratic Party is divided into factions.

""They can't pull the coalition together from older people to younger people to African-Americans and Hispanics, white liberals, academics, climate change people,"" Perino said. ""They have all these different factions. And that's because they have created them""

""And there's no one right now who can pull them all together,"" Perino added, saying Obama is the only person that can try. ""The only person who thinks that they could do that is a person who won nationally twice, Barack Obama.""

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., from winning the Democratic presidential nomination, according to a new report that sheds light on Obama's personal views of the jam-packed primary field with no clear front-runner.

Obama has largely stayed on the sidelines to date, refraining from any endorsements though he has issued general warnings to the party to avoid calls for radical upheaval in their policy pitches. These warnings were seen as a swipe at candidates like Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sanders.

But a new Politico Magazine report gives a clearer picture of what Obama is worried about -- claiming he has said in private he'd speak out against Sanders if it looked like he could actually win.

OBAMA TAKES VEILED SHOT AT WARREN AND SANDERS, WARNS 2020 DEMS AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO 'TEAR DOWN THE SYSTEM'

""Back when Sanders seemed like more of a threat than he does now, Obama said privately that if Bernie were running away with the nomination, Obama would speak up to stop him,"" the report says. An Obama spokesperson, however, reportedly noted that the former president has stated that he would get behind the Democratic nominee regardless of who it is.

One adviser said that while they personally had no knowledge of this, the threat of a Sanders nomination would likely be cause for action.

""I can't really confirm that,"" the adviser said, regarding the possibility of Obama trying to stop Sanders. ""He hasn't said that directly to me. The only reason I'm hesitating at all is because, yeah, if Bernie were running away with it, I think maybe we would all have to say something. But I don't think that's likely. It's not happening.""

This aversion to Sanders would be in line with Obama's recent comments. At an Obama Foundation Summit event in October, Obama took aim at political ""wokeness"" and cancel culture.

""This idea of purity and you're never compromised and you're always politically woke, and all that stuff, you should get over that quickly,"" Obama said.

Weeks later, at a gathering of the Democracy Alliance, Obama warned 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls that most voters do not want to “tear down the system.”

Obama dismissed far-left positions as not being popular among average Americans, even if they make waves on social media.

“Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality and the fact that voters, including the Democratic voters and certainly persuadable independents or even moderate Republicans, are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds,” Obama said.

The same Politico report, meanwhile, addressed Obama's relationship with Biden, whom he has not yet endorsed, despite Biden serving as vice president in his administration -- and routinely touting their relationship on the stump.

The Politico piece said Obama recalled to one candidate who came to him for advice how he himself had a bond with the voters that has since faded. He reportedly added, “And you know who really doesn’t have it? Joe Biden.”

Biden says he never sought Obama's endorsement.

168,Ronn Blitzer,"Joe Biden, from the very outset of his 2020 bid, has sought to leverage his history with old running mate President Barack Obama to propel him to the Democratic presidential nomination -- the problem is, this does not appear to be a plan shared by the former … [+3488 chars]","Joe Biden, from the very outset of his 2020 bid, has sought to leverage his history with old running mate Barack Obama to propel him to the Democratic presidential nomination -- the problem is, this does not appear to be a plan shared by the former president …",2019-11-27,Fox News,Obama’s Biden dig latest sign ex-president’s inner circle has doubts about his veep,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/obamas-biden-dig-veep,"Joe Biden, from the very outset of his 2020 bid, has sought to leverage his history with old running mate President Barack Obama to propel him to the Democratic presidential nomination -- the problem is, this does not appear to be a plan shared by the former president or his closest advisers.

First, there was the persistent criticism of Biden's campaign from Obama's inner circle. Then, there were the lingering questions over why ""44"" has not simply endorsed his former vice president. Now come reports that Obama has made discouraging -- even derisive -- comments about his candidacy.

BIDEN CLINGS TO OBAMA LEGACY AS CANDIDACY STUMBLES -- THOUGH EX-PRESIDENT, AIDES KEEP DISTANCE

""[Y]ou know who really doesn’t have it? Joe Biden,"" Obama said about a connection with voters, according to a recent Politico Magazine report. That remark reportedly was made to one of Biden's Democratic primary opponents.

An August New York Times report also cited a source who claimed that before Biden officially entered the 2020 race, Obama told him, “You don’t have to do this, Joe, you really don’t.”

That article came after Obama's former top strategist David Axelrod had harsh words for the former vice president. Axelrod warned that Biden “has sort of played into the caricature” of being mentally weak that President Trump has played on in the past. This, after Axelrod had questioned Biden's ""steadiness"" regarding an abortion policy flip-flop.

Axelrod also has described Biden as “confused” and suggested he looked like “part of the past rather than the future,” after a heated exchange during a June debate between Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.

The dismissive commentary from one of the chief architects of Obama's history-making 2008 presidential run is not helpful for a candidate who has latched his campaign to the Obama legacy -- routinely defending ObamaCare in the face of primary rivals vowing to pursue ""Medicare-for-all,"" and reminding voters of their bond. (In the category of kidding/not kidding, Biden once posted matching friendship bracelets on Twitter wishing the former commander-in-chief a happy Best Friends Day. Obama responded with a classy, ""Back atcha Joe,"" along with a GIF of him calling Biden the ""best VP America has ever had."")

Obama may think Biden was a great VP -- but that doesn't mean he sees him as president.

Karl Rove, former deputy chief of staff for President George W. Bush and current Fox News contributor, pointed to signals from Obama's aides.

“The Obama team is everywhere across the field and you don’t get the sense that there’s a lot of love and enthusiasm for Joe Biden as a candidate,” Rove said Tuesday. “Maybe it’s because they don’t think he can get it across the line, maybe it’s because they don’t agree with him, or maybe it’s because they dealt with him in the Obama administration and while they have a great deal of affection for him don’t think he has what it takes to be a presidential candidate and a victor.”

Obama has yet to endorse any candidate in the race, but Biden has said that it was his decision not to seek an endorsement from the former president.

At the same time, the mixed messages from Obama World do not seem to be hurting Biden at the moment.

A new CNN poll released Wednesday has Biden leading the pack with 28 percent, well ahead of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., with 17 percent, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., with 14 percent, and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg with 11 percent.

And a newly released Quinnipiac University poll of Democratic-leaning voters had Biden in first place with 24 percent, and way ahead of the other candidates on the question of who would have the best chance of defeating Trump."
169,Ben Shapiro,"Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who has risen to the top of the heap in early Democratic presidential primary polling in Iowa and New Hampshire, has come under serious sustained attack for the first time in his candidacy.

Buttigieg's early candidacy gained credibility thanks to the moderation he displayed compared with other Democrats. He quickly lost steam when he tacked to the left.

Now Buttigieg has swiveled back toward the center, launching a series of assaults on the radical plans of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and stealing her momentum in the largely white early primary states.

LIZ PEEK: BLOOMBERG RUN COULD HURT WARREN AND BUTTIGIEG — BUT MAYOR WOULD FACE UPHILL BATTLE

Normally, such political rises are attended by a spate of negative reactionary coverage, and Buttigieg's story is no different. The most effective attack on Buttigieg has centered around his complete lack of black support -- a crucial problem for a candidate whose party sees black voters as a near supermajority of primary voters in states like South Carolina.

Some of those attacks have focused on Buttigieg's less-than-stellar governance in South Bend, where crime rates have remained critically high and relations between the local population and police have been strained throughout his tenure.

But the latest attack is on Buttigieg's entire political mentality. This week, an article from Michael Harriot at The Root, titled ""Pete Buttigieg Is a Lying MF,"" trended on Twitter. What, exactly, was Buttigieg's lie? He suggested back in 2011 that not all educational outcome disparities between blacks and whites are attributable to systemic racism.

""The kids need to see evidence that education is going to work for them,"" Buttigieg stated (""whitely,"" in Harriot's adjective). ""You're motivated because you believe that at the end of your educational process, there is a reward; there's a stable life; there's a job. And there are a lot of kids, especially the lower-income, minority neighborhoods, who literally just haven't seen it work. There isn't somebody they know personally who testifies to the value of education.""

According to Harriot, this statement makes Buttigieg a ""lying motherf-----."" Why? Because majority-minority schools are underfunded compared with majority-white schools; because black students are ""disciplined more harshly than white students,"" as Harriot says; because black college graduates don't have as successful an employment record as white college graduates.

""Get-along moderates would rather make s--- up out of whole cloth than wade into the waters of reality,"" Harriot wrote. ""Pete Buttigieg doesn't want to change anything. He just wants to be something.""

But none of these three factors should explain the bulk of racial educational disparities. The black dropout rate from high school is far higher than that of white students, which has nothing to do with underfunded schools.

Black students, by best available data, misbehave in school more often than white students. Black students drop out of college far more often than white students, which has nothing to do with institutional discrimination. Adjusting for household income, black women actually overperform white women in terms of college attendance and income. Something else is going on.

What is going on? According to a 2018 study from researchers at Stanford, Harvard and the Census Bureau, young black men do best in areas with high levels of fatherhood. Lack of school mobility, largely due to entrenched interests preventing such mobility, doesn't help either.

Harvard's Roland Fryer formalized ""a particular peer effect, 'acting white,' which potentially contributes to the ongoing puzzle of black underachievement.""

Former President Obama similarly suggested an ""element of truth"" in the accusation that education is undervalued in many black homes, lamenting the attitude ""OK, if boys are reading too much, then, well, why are you doing that? Or why are you speaking so properly?"" A study from the Brookings Institution found that black students spend less time on homework than other racial groups -- by a long shot.

So, is Buttigieg a ""lying motherf-----"" for pointing out that not all disparities can be attributed to institutional discrimination? Of course not. But in the Democratic Party, such common sense represents political suicide.

TRUMP TRIES SHUCKING GIULIANI

CBS News: “President Trump tried to distance himself from his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani's efforts related to Ukraine on Tuesday in an interview with radio host Bill O'Reilly. …O'Reilly asked the president what Giuliani was, ‘doing in Ukraine on your behalf.’ ‘Well, you have to ask that to Rudy, but Rudy, I don't, I don't even know,’ said Mr. Trump. … Mr. Trump then denied that he had ever directed Giuliani to go to Ukraine on his behalf. However, in May the New York Times reported that Giuliani had planned to go to Ukraine that month, to urge the government there to open several investigations that could aid the president. … The president made it sound as though he did not necessarily have firsthand information about Giuliani's work in Ukraine, that he had ‘heard’ about it or ‘read that someplace.’”



Trump knew about whistleblower complaint before Ukraine aid released - WSJ: “President Trump was briefed about the whistleblower complaint prompted by his dealings with Kiev before the White House lifted a hold on more than $391 million in aid to Ukraine, according to people familiar with the matter. The president was briefed about the complaint in August by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and John Eisenberg, an attorney with the White House National Security Council, the people said. The complaint triggered the impeachment inquiry by Democrats in the House, which Trump has dismissed as a hoax. … The White House has defended the president’s actions, in part by saying there was no link between suspending the aid and the president’s request for investigations because the hold on the money was lifted in September.”



Like Clinton, Trump turns to Penn for impeachment advice - WaPo: “As President Trump’s White House battles impeachment, he turned to a familiar face last week: Mark Penn, one of President Bill Clinton’s top strategists. Penn visited the Oval Office for more than an hour last Monday, three people familiar with the meeting said, and provided polling data and impeachment advice for the president. Penn reassured Trump that he would not be removed from office, according to people familiar with the meeting, and encouraged him to travel the country as Clinton did when he was fighting impeachment over 20 years ago, officials said.”



Voters aren’t budging - Quinnipiac University: “Two weeks of public impeachment hearings in the news haven't hurt President Trump's popularity among American voters. While 40 percent of all registered voters approve of the job President Trump is doing, 54 percent disapprove. … The country remains closely divided on whether to impeach and remove President Trump from office. While 45 percent of American voters think President Trump should be impeached and removed from office, 48 percent don't think he should be. … Voter opinion on impeachment will be difficult to move as 86 percent say their mind is made up, while only 13 percent say they might change their mind.”



Dems see next week hearings as last chance to gain public support - Politico: “House Democrats have one final shot to drive up public support for impeachment, with a slate of hearings in the House Judiciary Committee beginning next week. But even Democratic lawmakers acknowledge public sentiment might be impossible to move in the weeks before an anticipated historic House vote on impeaching President Donald Trump. ‘I think people have made up their minds on this in a lot of ways,’ said Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), a member of the House Judiciary Committee. ‘But I think, frankly, what should drive us is the evidence and the facts and our oath of office.’ Many Democrats are skeptical that anything they do or say can further tick up backing for impeachment, keenly aware of polling this week showing that support has plateaued in the wake of an explosive set of House Intelligence Committee hearings that unearthed evidence suggesting an abuse of power by Trump.”



WARREN REELING

Quinnipiac University: “Former Vice President Joe Biden has retaken the lead in the Democratic primary race for president as Senator Elizabeth Warren's numbers have plummeted, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released [Tuesday]. Biden receives 24 percent of the vote among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, while South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg gets 16 percent, Warren receives 14 percent, and Sen. Bernie Sanders gets 13 percent. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who just entered the race, receives 3 percent as do Sen. Kamala Harris and Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Sen. Cory Booker, businessman Andrew Yang, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, and Sen. Michael Bennet each receive 2 percent. No other candidate tops one percent. Eleven percent are undecided. In an October 24 poll, Warren received 28 percent, Biden had 21 percent, Sanders was at 15 percent, and Buttigieg got 10 percent.”



Buttigieg continues to rise - CNN: “Former Vice President Joe Biden continues to lead the newly expanded field of contenders for the Democratic nomination for president, with Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont behind him in a close battle for second, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg joins them in double digits for the first time. Biden holds 28% support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who are registered to vote, followed by Sanders at 17%, Warren at 14% and Buttigieg at 11%. No other candidate reaches 4%, meaning the poll does not result in any changes to the lineup for the Democratic National Committee's December debate. A cluster of four candidates stand at 3%, including the latest entrant to the race, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He is joined by Sen. Kamala Harris of California and businessmen Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey have 2% each in the poll.”



Sean Trende: What is Bloomy doing? - Politico: “Will this work? Probably not. But Bloomberg can easily drop $500 million on this race and still live out the rest of his years quite comfortably. And there’s a chance that the stars will align and he becomes the next president of the United States. It isn’t a bad bet to make. Regardless, his best shot of making that happen is exactly the shot he is taking: Float above the fray by avoiding the debates and early states, define himself through ad buys elsewhere, and hope for a few lucky breaks in who his Super Tuesday opponents turn out to be.”



Meet the swingiest swing voters - NYT: “Midterm victories in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin gave Democrats hope of retaking the Rust Belt battleground states that handed the presidency to Donald J. Trump in 2016. Yet success in the midterms might not mean as much for Democratic presidential candidates as the party might think. Nearly two-thirds of voters in six battleground states who voted for President Trump in 2016 — but for Democratic congressional candidates in 2018 — say they intend to back the president against each of his top rivals, according to recent polling by The New York Times Upshot/Siena College. The results suggest that the party’s winning formula in last year’s midterms may not be so easy to replicate in a presidential election.”



THE RULEBOOK: DO OR DO NOT

“The question, therefore, whether this amount of power shall be granted or not, resolves itself into another question, whether or not a government commensurate to the exigencies of the Union shall be established; or, in other words, whether the Union itself shall be preserved.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 44



TIME OUT: THE HALFTIME REPORT DRESSING RECIPE

The best part about Thanksgiving dinner is the dressing and the best dressing is simple. Sausage, oysters, mushrooms, nuts and berries can only distract from what is a perfectly elegant American bread dish. So here’s how you do it. Cut a loaf of really good, day-old white bread into ½ inch cubes. Bake it in a 225-degree oven for about a 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until dry and crunchy. Place it in a large mixing bowl. Add ½ cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley, two tablespoons of finely chopped sage and a tables poon of finely (are you sensing a trend?) chopped thyme. Melt 10 tablespoons of the fattiest butter in a big skillet and then sauté until lightly browned 2 cups of small-diced sweet onion and 1½ cups of small-diced celery. Drizzle this deliciousness over your bread and herbs. Toss it well, adding two teaspoons of kosher salt and a teaspoon of finely ground pepper as you go. Then gradually add 1½ cups of broth, again tossing lightly. (I prefer to use turkey stock made from gizzards and giblets, but any good poultry stock will do.) Adjust the seasoning. In a small bowl, whisk together two large eggs and another cup of cool or room-temperature stock. Fold that gently but thoroughly into your bread bowl. Place the mixture into a well-buttered 13’x9’ dish, cover with foil and bake at 350 degrees for ~40 minutes and save the sausage for breakfast.



[Ed. note: If I think about what I would do for our republic if I had three wishes to employ, one of them surely would be used for a great awakening of local and regional news coverage. Maybe nothing so afflicts us today as a replacement of local concerns with national matters. Our attention rightly belongs where we live, work and love. We should care much more about the nature of our local government than the distant considerations of the federal leviathan. The government in Washington is a large, blunt instrument and national politics reflect those characteristics. Dealing with each other on the local level increases the chances that we will see our fellow citizens as individuals with complicated, varied views rather than faceless partisan enemies. Part of the reason for our retreat into dunderheaded national partisan politics has been the long slow death of local news coverage. The internet tipped over the huge, over-leveraged newspaper industry in a seeming flash, leaving behind a terrible void that national news coverage can never and should never fill. One of my favorite newspaper traditions has been for decades my hometown newspaper, the Wheeling [W. Va.] Intelligencer’s annual republishing of the same perfect Thanksgiving column by the late Adam Kelly, known to his readers as “the country editor.” I was privileged to have his son, Bob, a truly great newsman in his own right, as my mentor when I later learned my way around the press and politics in Charleston, W. Va. 20 years ago or so. We’ve kept that Thanksgiving tradition alive here in this note and encourage you to spend some time with Adam Kelly’s words. But the essence is in this paragraph: “Family and freedom are ordinary words … except for those who cannot now experience those blessings, and so, Lord, this day I give You thanks for the priceless privileges which are mine as an American citizen … The freedom to speak, to write, to think, without government interference or control; the right to worship You in any way I choose.” We need now to raise up and sustain a new army of Adam Kellys in newsrooms across the country, in big cities and little towns, to remind us of our blessings and to focus our attention on what needs to be put right where we live. If you count a free press as one of the blessings worth celebrating this Thanksgiving, make sure you’re backing it up. Support local news outlets with your time and money. We need to know each other better, and that’s a great place to start. Fox News Halftime Report is pausing for the holiday and will resume publication on Dec. 2. In the meantime, Brianna and I wish you and your families bounty and blessings, but most of all, the gift of gratitude, especially those facing adversity.]

TRUMP’S FLORIDA FIRST STRATEGY

WaPo: “President Trump’s raucous Tuesday night rally near Miami, billed by his campaign as a ‘homecoming’ extravaganza, followed his recent decision to move his formal residence from New York to Florida — and underscored the state’s importance to his reelection efforts as he grapples with the impeachment proceedings that threaten his presidency. Florida is now not only Trump’s home but also what Republicans hope is an emerging GOP bastion. His strategy in the state reflects his broader push to galvanize his core voters ahead of next year’s election by unleashing an incendiary defense of his conduct, be it on Twitter, cable news or in front of thousands. By rallying a capacity crowd at the 20,000-seat BB&T Center on Tuesday night, Trump tried to demonstrate broad and determined opposition to his impeachment.”



Set to rake bucks in Britain - Axios: “When President Trump visits London next week for the NATO summit, he'll also use his brief time on the ground there to raise big bucks for his 2020 campaign, according to an invitation reviewed by Axios and conversations with people familiar with the event. Details: The Dec. 3 fundraiser, which hasn't previously been reported, will be hosted by Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, co-chairman Tommy Hicks Jr., national finance chairman Todd Ricketts, and Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale, according to the invitation. The Trump team expects to raise $3 million from the event, according to a source familiar with the planning.”

“The year that is drawing towards its close, has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added, which are of so extraordinary a nature, that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever watchful providence of Almighty God.” – President Abraham Lincoln in the 1863 proclamation establishing the precedent for the Thanksgiving



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“‘American citizenship demands discernment and attentiveness.’ Truer words were never written. I suggest one other essential quality, honest self evaluation. For example, suppose a member opposing your side says or does something that rankles you. Ask yourself, if a member of my side said or did the same thing, would I respond the same way? One should also do the same exercise in reverse to evaluate speech and actions by members of one’s own side. I’ll call this the political Golden Rule.” – Bill Ciao, Bellingham, Wash.



[Ed. note: Boy-howdy, Mr. Ciao! Honest self-appraisal – that more-demanding cousin of gratitude – really is the thing. I hereby grant you the rank of brevet colonel in the army of the level-headed, Pacific Command. Happy Thanksgiving to you and yours.]

CNN: “What should have been a normal day at work took a turn for the surreal for one TV journalist, when he was relentlessly pursued by a pig -- live on air. Lazos Mantikos was in the Greek town of Kineta Tuesday to report on flood damage, but he ended up becoming the story himself when the female pig seemed to take a liking to him. ‘Good morning, we have an issue,’ said Mantikos on the ‘Good Morning Greece’ show from CNN affiliate ANT1. ‘Giorgos, can you hear me? We have a pig here that has been chasing us since this morning ... folks, sorry, I can't stand (still) because it's biting me.’ The segment begins with studio journalist Giorgos Papadakis introducing the reporter.”

The survey, conducted for Fortune by anonymous workplace social network Blind, shows that 81.6 percent of the tech giant's employees support Cook in his efforts to speak directly with Trump on issues that affect the company and help ""shape policy in Apple's favor.""

Separately, 8 out of 10 respondents said that it is ""fair that some of Apple's products have been exempted from U.S. tariffs on Chinese-made goods."" Cook has repeatedly lobbied the Trump administration to exempt Apple's products, including the iPhone, Apple Watch and Macs, from tariffs.

TRUMP ASKS APPLE CEO IF THE TECH GIANT COULD 'GET INVOLVED IN BUILDING 5G IN THE US'

Following his Nov. 20 tour of Apple's manufacturing plant in Austin, Texas, which has been open since 2013, Trump said he was looking at exempting the company from tariffs that have been placed on imports from China as part of the ongoing trade war between the two countries, according to Reuters. The president also asked Cook if the tech giant ""could get ... involved in building 5G in the U.S.""

In August, Fox Business reported that Cook told Trump that Apple's chief smartphone competitor, Samsung, is exempt from U.S. tariffs since its products are made outside of China.

Though there may be overwhelming praise for Cook in his efforts to persuade Trump, not everything he does has been viewed favorably. Only 30.9 percent of those responding to the Blind survey said they ""strongly agreed"" with their CEO participating in the Austin event, held during Trump's impeachment hearings. Twenty-three and a half percent said they ""agreed"" with Cook being there, 10.3 percent ""disagreed,"" 17.7 percent ""strongly disagreed"" and 18 percent were indifferent.

Blind's findings are from more than 100 Apple employees surveyed between Nov. 21 and No. 25, Fortune reported. The anonymous workplace social network confirmed respondents based on their Apple email addresses, noting that more than 50 percent of the company's employees on the social network identify themselves as engineers.

APPLE DELVES FURTHER INTO HEALTH AMBITIONS WITH NEW RESEARCH APP, HEALTH STUDIES

The two men have had a relationship seemingly since the start of Trump's presidency, one that has seemingly only grown over time.

In March, Trump said that Cook had “become a friend of mine"" during a meeting for the president's American Workforce Policy Advisory Board. Separately during that meeting, Trump mistakenly called Cook ""Tim Apple"" in a slip of the tongue. Cook later decided to have a bit of fun at the president's expense, changing the name of his Twitter account to Tim Apple.

The 58-year-old Cook is one of the few CEOs in America with a direct line to Trump, according to an October report in The Wall Street Journal. “He’s [Cook] a great executive,” The Journal quoted Trump as saying, with the president adding “[o]thers go out and hire very expensive consultants. Tim Cook calls Donald Trump directly.”

TIM COOK, IN APPARENT JAB AT TRUMP, CHANGES HIS NAME TO TIM APPLE

Trump has also tweeted directly to Cook, including once in October when he asked the Alabama native to bring back the iPhone's home button.

Silicon Valley, regarded as a hotbed for liberalism, has often been at odds with many of the Trump administration's policies, including its stance on immigration, climate change and trade.

Fortune, citing political donations website OpenSecrets.org, notes that Apple's own employees have donated more money to Trump's 2020 Democratic rivals — including more than $88,000 to Sen. Bernie Sanders, I.-Vt. and more than $68,000 to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D.-Ma. — than to Trump himself, at just $5,100.

Cook, on the other hand, has often spoken directly with Trump or one of his advisers, when issues such as climate change, trade policy or others affect the company.

During his January 2018 State of the Union address, Trump, who has repeatedly said “trade wars are good and easy to win,"" specifically mentioned that the Cupertino, Calif.-based company would invest $350 billion in the U.S. and hire an additional 20,000 workers.

In April 2018, Larry Kudlow, Trump's director of the National Economic Council, specifically mentioned that Cook loved the tax cuts the Trump administration enacted in 2017.

“He said it’s great for business,"" Kudlow told CNBC at the time. ""And Apple is going to be building plants, campuses, adding jobs, lots of business investment. That was the first point he made to President Trump.”

OBAMA TAKES VEILED SHOT AT WARREN AND SANDERS, WARNS 2020 DEMS AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO 'TEAR DOWN THE SYSTEM'

Perino was responding to a report from Politico saying Obama recalled to one candidate who came to him for advice how he himself had a bond with the voters that has since faded. He reportedly added: “And you know who really doesn’t have it? Joe Biden.”

Earlier this month, a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll showed former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg leading the field in Iowa with 25 percent support, a 16 percent increase over his numbers in the September version of the poll. Behind Elizabeth Warren (16 percent) came former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who each garnered 15 percent support.

The former White House press secretary said it's ""pretty clear that Biden doesn't have what it takes in Iowa,"" adding that the Democratic Party is divided into factions.

""They can't pull the coalition together from older people to younger people to African-Americans and Hispanics, white liberals, academics, climate change people,"" Perino said. ""They have all these different factions. And that's because they have created them""

""And there's no one right now who can pull them all together,"" Perino added, saying Obama is the only person that can try. ""The only person who thinks that they could do that is a person who won nationally twice, Barack Obama.""

First, there was the persistent criticism of Biden's campaign from Obama's inner circle. Then, there were the lingering questions over why ""44"" has not simply endorsed his former vice president. Now come reports that Obama has made discouraging -- even derisive -- comments about his candidacy.

BIDEN CLINGS TO OBAMA LEGACY AS CANDIDACY STUMBLES -- THOUGH EX-PRESIDENT, AIDES KEEP DISTANCE

""[Y]ou know who really doesn’t have it? Joe Biden,"" Obama said about a connection with voters, according to a recent Politico Magazine report. That remark reportedly was made to one of Biden's Democratic primary opponents.

An August New York Times report also cited a source who claimed that before Biden officially entered the 2020 race, Obama told him, “You don’t have to do this, Joe, you really don’t.”

That article came after Obama's former top strategist David Axelrod had harsh words for the former vice president. Axelrod warned that Biden “has sort of played into the caricature” of being mentally weak that President Trump has played on in the past. This, after Axelrod had questioned Biden's ""steadiness"" regarding an abortion policy flip-flop.

Axelrod also has described Biden as “confused” and suggested he looked like “part of the past rather than the future,” after a heated exchange during a June debate between Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.

The dismissive commentary from one of the chief architects of Obama's history-making 2008 presidential run is not helpful for a candidate who has latched his campaign to the Obama legacy -- routinely defending ObamaCare in the face of primary rivals vowing to pursue ""Medicare-for-all,"" and reminding voters of their bond. (In the category of kidding/not kidding, Biden once posted matching friendship bracelets on Twitter wishing the former commander-in-chief a happy Best Friends Day. Obama responded with a classy, ""Back atcha Joe,"" along with a GIF of him calling Biden the ""best VP America has ever had."")

Obama may think Biden was a great VP -- but that doesn't mean he sees him as president.

Karl Rove, former deputy chief of staff for President George W. Bush and current Fox News contributor, pointed to signals from Obama's aides.

“The Obama team is everywhere across the field and you don’t get the sense that there’s a lot of love and enthusiasm for Joe Biden as a candidate,” Rove said Tuesday. “Maybe it’s because they don’t think he can get it across the line, maybe it’s because they don’t agree with him, or maybe it’s because they dealt with him in the Obama administration and while they have a great deal of affection for him don’t think he has what it takes to be a presidential candidate and a victor.”

Obama has yet to endorse any candidate in the race, but Biden has said that it was his decision not to seek an endorsement from the former president.

At the same time, the mixed messages from Obama World do not seem to be hurting Biden at the moment.

A new CNN poll released Wednesday has Biden leading the pack with 28 percent, well ahead of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., with 17 percent, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., with 14 percent, and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg with 11 percent.

And a newly released Quinnipiac University poll of Democratic-leaning voters had Biden in first place with 24 percent, and way ahead of the other candidates on the question of who would have the best chance of defeating Trump."

But I'll listen to Bill Gates, who says nuclear is a vital energy source, especially if you want to cut carbon emissions.

Trump? Yeah, he's bad: we have the lowest unemployment in decades for blacks, women, Hispanics are doing better under Trump than Obama. And bodies aren't coming home in coffins.

What's your alternative?

175,Ben Shapiro,"Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who has risen to the top of the heap in early Democratic presidential primary polling in Iowa and New Hampshire, has come under serious sustained attack for the first time in his candidacy.

Telling the truth,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/ben-shapiro-pete-buttigiegs-big-mistake-telling-the-truth,"Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who has risen to the top of the heap in early Democratic presidential primary polling in Iowa and New Hampshire, has come under serious sustained attack for the first time in his candidacy.

Buttigieg's early candidacy gained credibility thanks to the moderation he displayed compared with other Democrats. He quickly lost steam when he tacked to the left.

Now Buttigieg has swiveled back toward the center, launching a series of assaults on the radical plans of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and stealing her momentum in the largely white early primary states.

LIZ PEEK: BLOOMBERG RUN COULD HURT WARREN AND BUTTIGIEG — BUT MAYOR WOULD FACE UPHILL BATTLE

Normally, such political rises are attended by a spate of negative reactionary coverage, and Buttigieg's story is no different. The most effective attack on Buttigieg has centered around his complete lack of black support -- a crucial problem for a candidate whose party sees black voters as a near supermajority of primary voters in states like South Carolina.

Some of those attacks have focused on Buttigieg's less-than-stellar governance in South Bend, where crime rates have remained critically high and relations between the local population and police have been strained throughout his tenure.

But the latest attack is on Buttigieg's entire political mentality. This week, an article from Michael Harriot at The Root, titled ""Pete Buttigieg Is a Lying MF,"" trended on Twitter. What, exactly, was Buttigieg's lie? He suggested back in 2011 that not all educational outcome disparities between blacks and whites are attributable to systemic racism.

""The kids need to see evidence that education is going to work for them,"" Buttigieg stated (""whitely,"" in Harriot's adjective). ""You're motivated because you believe that at the end of your educational process, there is a reward; there's a stable life; there's a job. And there are a lot of kids, especially the lower-income, minority neighborhoods, who literally just haven't seen it work. There isn't somebody they know personally who testifies to the value of education.""

According to Harriot, this statement makes Buttigieg a ""lying motherf-----."" Why? Because majority-minority schools are underfunded compared with majority-white schools; because black students are ""disciplined more harshly than white students,"" as Harriot says; because black college graduates don't have as successful an employment record as white college graduates.

""Get-along moderates would rather make s--- up out of whole cloth than wade into the waters of reality,"" Harriot wrote. ""Pete Buttigieg doesn't want to change anything. He just wants to be something.""

But none of these three factors should explain the bulk of racial educational disparities. The black dropout rate from high school is far higher than that of white students, which has nothing to do with underfunded schools.

Black students, by best available data, misbehave in school more often than white students. Black students drop out of college far more often than white students, which has nothing to do with institutional discrimination. Adjusting for household income, black women actually overperform white women in terms of college attendance and income. Something else is going on.

What is going on? According to a 2018 study from researchers at Stanford, Harvard and the Census Bureau, young black men do best in areas with high levels of fatherhood. Lack of school mobility, largely due to entrenched interests preventing such mobility, doesn't help either.

Harvard's Roland Fryer formalized ""a particular peer effect, 'acting white,' which potentially contributes to the ongoing puzzle of black underachievement.""

Former President Obama similarly suggested an ""element of truth"" in the accusation that education is undervalued in many black homes, lamenting the attitude ""OK, if boys are reading too much, then, well, why are you doing that? Or why are you speaking so properly?"" A study from the Brookings Institution found that black students spend less time on homework than other racial groups -- by a long shot.

So, is Buttigieg a ""lying motherf-----"" for pointing out that not all disparities can be attributed to institutional discrimination? Of course not. But in the Democratic Party, such common sense represents political suicide.

On the roster: Trump tries shucking Giuliani - Warren reeling - Time out: The Halftime report dressing recipe - Trump’s Florida first strategy - Look out Kermit!



TRUMP TRIES SHUCKING GIULIANI

CBS News: “President Trump tried to distance himself from his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani's efforts related to Ukraine on Tuesday in an interview with radio host Bill O'Reilly. …O'Reilly asked the president what Giuliani was, ‘doing in Ukraine on your behalf.’ ‘Well, you have to ask that to Rudy, but Rudy, I don't, I don't even know,’ said Mr. Trump. … Mr. Trump then denied that he had ever directed Giuliani to go to Ukraine on his behalf. However, in May the New York Times reported that Giuliani had planned to go to Ukraine that month, to urge the government there to open several investigations that could aid the president. … The president made it sound as though he did not necessarily have firsthand information about Giuliani's work in Ukraine, that he had ‘heard’ about it or ‘read that someplace.’”



Trump knew about whistleblower complaint before Ukraine aid released - WSJ: “President Trump was briefed about the whistleblower complaint prompted by his dealings with Kiev before the White House lifted a hold on more than $391 million in aid to Ukraine, according to people familiar with the matter. The president was briefed about the complaint in August by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and John Eisenberg, an attorney with the White House National Security Council, the people said. The complaint triggered the impeachment inquiry by Democrats in the House, which Trump has dismissed as a hoax. … The White House has defended the president’s actions, in part by saying there was no link between suspending the aid and the president’s request for investigations because the hold on the money was lifted in September.”



Like Clinton, Trump turns to Penn for impeachment advice - WaPo: “As President Trump’s White House battles impeachment, he turned to a familiar face last week: Mark Penn, one of President Bill Clinton’s top strategists. Penn visited the Oval Office for more than an hour last Monday, three people familiar with the meeting said, and provided polling data and impeachment advice for the president. Penn reassured Trump that he would not be removed from office, according to people familiar with the meeting, and encouraged him to travel the country as Clinton did when he was fighting impeachment over 20 years ago, officials said.”



Voters aren’t budging - Quinnipiac University: “Two weeks of public impeachment hearings in the news haven't hurt President Trump's popularity among American voters. While 40 percent of all registered voters approve of the job President Trump is doing, 54 percent disapprove. … The country remains closely divided on whether to impeach and remove President Trump from office. While 45 percent of American voters think President Trump should be impeached and removed from office, 48 percent don't think he should be. … Voter opinion on impeachment will be difficult to move as 86 percent say their mind is made up, while only 13 percent say they might change their mind.”



Dems see next week hearings as last chance to gain public support - Politico: “House Democrats have one final shot to drive up public support for impeachment, with a slate of hearings in the House Judiciary Committee beginning next week. But even Democratic lawmakers acknowledge public sentiment might be impossible to move in the weeks before an anticipated historic House vote on impeaching President Donald Trump. ‘I think people have made up their minds on this in a lot of ways,’ said Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), a member of the House Judiciary Committee. ‘But I think, frankly, what should drive us is the evidence and the facts and our oath of office.’ Many Democrats are skeptical that anything they do or say can further tick up backing for impeachment, keenly aware of polling this week showing that support has plateaued in the wake of an explosive set of House Intelligence Committee hearings that unearthed evidence suggesting an abuse of power by Trump.”



WARREN REELING

Quinnipiac University: “Former Vice President Joe Biden has retaken the lead in the Democratic primary race for president as Senator Elizabeth Warren's numbers have plummeted, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released [Tuesday]. Biden receives 24 percent of the vote among Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic, while South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg gets 16 percent, Warren receives 14 percent, and Sen. Bernie Sanders gets 13 percent. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who just entered the race, receives 3 percent as do Sen. Kamala Harris and Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Sen. Cory Booker, businessman Andrew Yang, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, and Sen. Michael Bennet each receive 2 percent. No other candidate tops one percent. Eleven percent are undecided. In an October 24 poll, Warren received 28 percent, Biden had 21 percent, Sanders was at 15 percent, and Buttigieg got 10 percent.”



Buttigieg continues to rise - CNN: “Former Vice President Joe Biden continues to lead the newly expanded field of contenders for the Democratic nomination for president, with Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont behind him in a close battle for second, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg joins them in double digits for the first time. Biden holds 28% support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who are registered to vote, followed by Sanders at 17%, Warren at 14% and Buttigieg at 11%. No other candidate reaches 4%, meaning the poll does not result in any changes to the lineup for the Democratic National Committee's December debate. A cluster of four candidates stand at 3%, including the latest entrant to the race, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He is joined by Sen. Kamala Harris of California and businessmen Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey have 2% each in the poll.”



Sean Trende: What is Bloomy doing? - Politico: “Will this work? Probably not. But Bloomberg can easily drop $500 million on this race and still live out the rest of his years quite comfortably. And there’s a chance that the stars will align and he becomes the next president of the United States. It isn’t a bad bet to make. Regardless, his best shot of making that happen is exactly the shot he is taking: Float above the fray by avoiding the debates and early states, define himself through ad buys elsewhere, and hope for a few lucky breaks in who his Super Tuesday opponents turn out to be.”



Meet the swingiest swing voters - NYT: “Midterm victories in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin gave Democrats hope of retaking the Rust Belt battleground states that handed the presidency to Donald J. Trump in 2016. Yet success in the midterms might not mean as much for Democratic presidential candidates as the party might think. Nearly two-thirds of voters in six battleground states who voted for President Trump in 2016 — but for Democratic congressional candidates in 2018 — say they intend to back the president against each of his top rivals, according to recent polling by The New York Times Upshot/Siena College. The results suggest that the party’s winning formula in last year’s midterms may not be so easy to replicate in a presidential election.”



THE RULEBOOK: DO OR DO NOT

“The question, therefore, whether this amount of power shall be granted or not, resolves itself into another question, whether or not a government commensurate to the exigencies of the Union shall be established; or, in other words, whether the Union itself shall be preserved.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 44



TIME OUT: THE HALFTIME REPORT DRESSING RECIPE

The best part about Thanksgiving dinner is the dressing and the best dressing is simple. Sausage, oysters, mushrooms, nuts and berries can only distract from what is a perfectly elegant American bread dish. So here’s how you do it. Cut a loaf of really good, day-old white bread into ½ inch cubes. Bake it in a 225-degree oven for about a 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until dry and crunchy. Place it in a large mixing bowl. Add ½ cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley, two tablespoons of finely chopped sage and a tables poon of finely (are you sensing a trend?) chopped thyme. Melt 10 tablespoons of the fattiest butter in a big skillet and then sauté until lightly browned 2 cups of small-diced sweet onion and 1½ cups of small-diced celery. Drizzle this deliciousness over your bread and herbs. Toss it well, adding two teaspoons of kosher salt and a teaspoon of finely ground pepper as you go. Then gradually add 1½ cups of broth, again tossing lightly. (I prefer to use turkey stock made from gizzards and giblets, but any good poultry stock will do.) Adjust the seasoning. In a small bowl, whisk together two large eggs and another cup of cool or room-temperature stock. Fold that gently but thoroughly into your bread bowl. Place the mixture into a well-buttered 13’x9’ dish, cover with foil and bake at 350 degrees for ~40 minutes and save the sausage for breakfast.



[Ed. note: If I think about what I would do for our republic if I had three wishes to employ, one of them surely would be used for a great awakening of local and regional news coverage. Maybe nothing so afflicts us today as a replacement of local concerns with national matters. Our attention rightly belongs where we live, work and love. We should care much more about the nature of our local government than the distant considerations of the federal leviathan. The government in Washington is a large, blunt instrument and national politics reflect those characteristics. Dealing with each other on the local level increases the chances that we will see our fellow citizens as individuals with complicated, varied views rather than faceless partisan enemies. Part of the reason for our retreat into dunderheaded national partisan politics has been the long slow death of local news coverage. The internet tipped over the huge, over-leveraged newspaper industry in a seeming flash, leaving behind a terrible void that national news coverage can never and should never fill. One of my favorite newspaper traditions has been for decades my hometown newspaper, the Wheeling [W. Va.] Intelligencer’s annual republishing of the same perfect Thanksgiving column by the late Adam Kelly, known to his readers as “the country editor.” I was privileged to have his son, Bob, a truly great newsman in his own right, as my mentor when I later learned my way around the press and politics in Charleston, W. Va. 20 years ago or so. We’ve kept that Thanksgiving tradition alive here in this note and encourage you to spend some time with Adam Kelly’s words. But the essence is in this paragraph: “Family and freedom are ordinary words … except for those who cannot now experience those blessings, and so, Lord, this day I give You thanks for the priceless privileges which are mine as an American citizen … The freedom to speak, to write, to think, without government interference or control; the right to worship You in any way I choose.” We need now to raise up and sustain a new army of Adam Kellys in newsrooms across the country, in big cities and little towns, to remind us of our blessings and to focus our attention on what needs to be put right where we live. If you count a free press as one of the blessings worth celebrating this Thanksgiving, make sure you’re backing it up. Support local news outlets with your time and money. We need to know each other better, and that’s a great place to start. Fox News Halftime Report is pausing for the holiday and will resume publication on Dec. 2. In the meantime, Brianna and I wish you and your families bounty and blessings, but most of all, the gift of gratitude, especially those facing adversity.]

TRUMP’S FLORIDA FIRST STRATEGY

WaPo: “President Trump’s raucous Tuesday night rally near Miami, billed by his campaign as a ‘homecoming’ extravaganza, followed his recent decision to move his formal residence from New York to Florida — and underscored the state’s importance to his reelection efforts as he grapples with the impeachment proceedings that threaten his presidency. Florida is now not only Trump’s home but also what Republicans hope is an emerging GOP bastion. His strategy in the state reflects his broader push to galvanize his core voters ahead of next year’s election by unleashing an incendiary defense of his conduct, be it on Twitter, cable news or in front of thousands. By rallying a capacity crowd at the 20,000-seat BB&T Center on Tuesday night, Trump tried to demonstrate broad and determined opposition to his impeachment.”



Set to rake bucks in Britain - Axios: “When President Trump visits London next week for the NATO summit, he'll also use his brief time on the ground there to raise big bucks for his 2020 campaign, according to an invitation reviewed by Axios and conversations with people familiar with the event. Details: The Dec. 3 fundraiser, which hasn't previously been reported, will be hosted by Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, co-chairman Tommy Hicks Jr., national finance chairman Todd Ricketts, and Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale, according to the invitation. The Trump team expects to raise $3 million from the event, according to a source familiar with the planning.”

“The year that is drawing towards its close, has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added, which are of so extraordinary a nature, that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever watchful providence of Almighty God.” – President Abraham Lincoln in the 1863 proclamation establishing the precedent for the Thanksgiving



FROM THE BLEACHERS

“‘American citizenship demands discernment and attentiveness.’ Truer words were never written. I suggest one other essential quality, honest self evaluation. For example, suppose a member opposing your side says or does something that rankles you. Ask yourself, if a member of my side said or did the same thing, would I respond the same way? One should also do the same exercise in reverse to evaluate speech and actions by members of one’s own side. I’ll call this the political Golden Rule.” – Bill Ciao, Bellingham, Wash.



[Ed. note: Boy-howdy, Mr. Ciao! Honest self-appraisal – that more-demanding cousin of gratitude – really is the thing. I hereby grant you the rank of brevet colonel in the army of the level-headed, Pacific Command. Happy Thanksgiving to you and yours.]

CNN: “What should have been a normal day at work took a turn for the surreal for one TV journalist, when he was relentlessly pursued by a pig -- live on air. Lazos Mantikos was in the Greek town of Kineta Tuesday to report on flood damage, but he ended up becoming the story himself when the female pig seemed to take a liking to him. ‘Good morning, we have an issue,’ said Mantikos on the ‘Good Morning Greece’ show from CNN affiliate ANT1. ‘Giorgos, can you hear me?

In addition to widespread poverty, insufficient health care and a host of other challenges, Native American communities in our country face persistent, egregious violence. In fact, Attorney General William Barr this week has done the country a badly needed service by pointing out that there is a virtual war against Native American women.

Before you think “war” is too strong a term, consider these facts.

ELIZABETH WARREN INTRODUCES BILL TO REVOKE MEDALS OF HONOR AWARDED FOR WOUNDED KNEE MASSACRE

According to The Associated Press, the Urban Indian Health Institute reported 5,712 indigenous women were murdered or went missing in 2016 alone. Of that staggering number, only 116 were listed in a U.S. Department of Justice database tracking such statistics.

Further, the National Institute of Justice estimated that 1.5 million Native American women have experienced violence in their lives – and more than half experienced sexual violence.

No American can be comfortable with a level of violence that affects more than 1 million women. It should be completely unacceptable that of the 5,712 cases of missing and murdered Native American girls, only 2 percent – one out of every 50 cases – makes it to the Justice Department database.

According to Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., who is himself a tribal member, 2016 National Institute of Justice reports reveal even more grim figures – estimating that more than four out of five Native American women have experienced violence, with more than half experiencing sexual violence.

As Cole put it: “Native women are more than one-and-a-half times more likely than White women to have experienced violence in the past year. Even more chilling, Native women face murder rates more than 10 times the national average in some parts of the country.”

Cole went on to point out that 96 percent of those who had been sexually assaulted were attacked by non-Native Americans.

Cole and others are taking steps to protect Native American girls and women.

As Cole wrote recently:

“I was proud to join with several of my House colleagues to introduce the Bridging Agency Data Gaps and Ensuring Safety (BADGES) for Native Communities Act. This bipartisan legislation addresses inefficiencies in federal criminal databases and increases tribal access to those databases.

“In response to the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women, the BADGES Act also rightly seeks to improve public data on those cases while promoting more efficient recruitment and retention of Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) law enforcement. Moreover, the legislation would provide tribes with resources to improve public safety coordination between their governments, states and federal agencies.”

Take a minute this holiday season while celebrating with family and friends and let your representative and your senators know that you want action taken to protect these vulnerable girls and women.

The survey, conducted for Fortune by anonymous workplace social network Blind, shows that 81.6 percent of the tech giant's employees support Cook in his efforts to speak directly with Trump on issues that affect the company and help ""shape policy in Apple's favor.""

Separately, 8 out of 10 respondents said that it is ""fair that some of Apple's products have been exempted from U.S. tariffs on Chinese-made goods."" Cook has repeatedly lobbied the Trump administration to exempt Apple's products, including the iPhone, Apple Watch and Macs, from tariffs.

TRUMP ASKS APPLE CEO IF THE TECH GIANT COULD 'GET INVOLVED IN BUILDING 5G IN THE US'

Following his Nov. 20 tour of Apple's manufacturing plant in Austin, Texas, which has been open since 2013, Trump said he was looking at exempting the company from tariffs that have been placed on imports from China as part of the ongoing trade war between the two countries, according to Reuters. The president also asked Cook if the tech giant ""could get ... involved in building 5G in the U.S.""

In August, Fox Business reported that Cook told Trump that Apple's chief smartphone competitor, Samsung, is exempt from U.S. tariffs since its products are made outside of China.

Though there may be overwhelming praise for Cook in his efforts to persuade Trump, not everything he does has been viewed favorably. Only 30.9 percent of those responding to the Blind survey said they ""strongly agreed"" with their CEO participating in the Austin event, held during Trump's impeachment hearings. Twenty-three and a half percent said they ""agreed"" with Cook being there, 10.3 percent ""disagreed,"" 17.7 percent ""strongly disagreed"" and 18 percent were indifferent.

Blind's findings are from more than 100 Apple employees surveyed between Nov. 21 and No. 25, Fortune reported. The anonymous workplace social network confirmed respondents based on their Apple email addresses, noting that more than 50 percent of the company's employees on the social network identify themselves as engineers.

APPLE DELVES FURTHER INTO HEALTH AMBITIONS WITH NEW RESEARCH APP, HEALTH STUDIES

The two men have had a relationship seemingly since the start of Trump's presidency, one that has seemingly only grown over time.

In March, Trump said that Cook had “become a friend of mine"" during a meeting for the president's American Workforce Policy Advisory Board. Separately during that meeting, Trump mistakenly called Cook ""Tim Apple"" in a slip of the tongue. Cook later decided to have a bit of fun at the president's expense, changing the name of his Twitter account to Tim Apple.

The 58-year-old Cook is one of the few CEOs in America with a direct line to Trump, according to an October report in The Wall Street Journal. “He’s [Cook] a great executive,” The Journal quoted Trump as saying, with the president adding “[o]thers go out and hire very expensive consultants. Tim Cook calls Donald Trump directly.”

TIM COOK, IN APPARENT JAB AT TRUMP, CHANGES HIS NAME TO TIM APPLE

Trump has also tweeted directly to Cook, including once in October when he asked the Alabama native to bring back the iPhone's home button.

Silicon Valley, regarded as a hotbed for liberalism, has often been at odds with many of the Trump administration's policies, including its stance on immigration, climate change and trade.

Fortune, citing political donations website OpenSecrets.org, notes that Apple's own employees have donated more money to Trump's 2020 Democratic rivals — including more than $88,000 to Sen. Bernie Sanders, I.-Vt. and more than $68,000 to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D.-Ma. — than to Trump himself, at just $5,100.

Cook, on the other hand, has often spoken directly with Trump or one of his advisers, when issues such as climate change, trade policy or others affect the company.

During his January 2018 State of the Union address, Trump, who has repeatedly said “trade wars are good and easy to win,"" specifically mentioned that the Cupertino, Calif.-based company would invest $350 billion in the U.S. and hire an additional 20,000 workers.

In April 2018, Larry Kudlow, Trump's director of the National Economic Council, specifically mentioned that Cook loved the tax cuts the Trump administration enacted in 2017.

“He said it’s great for business,"" Kudlow told CNBC at the time. ""And Apple is going to be building plants, campuses, adding jobs, lots of business investment. That was the first point he made to President Trump.”

In addition to widespread poverty, insufficient health care and a host of other challenges, Native American communities in our country face persistent, egregious violence. In fact, Attorney General William Barr this week has done the country a badly needed service by pointing out that there is a virtual war against Native American women.

Before you think “war” is too strong a term, consider these facts.

ELIZABETH WARREN INTRODUCES BILL TO REVOKE MEDALS OF HONOR AWARDED FOR WOUNDED KNEE MASSACRE

According to The Associated Press, the Urban Indian Health Institute reported 5,712 indigenous women were murdered or went missing in 2016 alone. Of that staggering number, only 116 were listed in a U.S. Department of Justice database tracking such statistics.

Further, the National Institute of Justice estimated that 1.5 million Native American women have experienced violence in their lives – and more than half experienced sexual violence.

No American can be comfortable with a level of violence that affects more than 1 million women. It should be completely unacceptable that of the 5,712 cases of missing and murdered Native American girls, only 2 percent – one out of every 50 cases – makes it to the Justice Department database.

According to Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., who is himself a tribal member, 2016 National Institute of Justice reports reveal even more grim figures – estimating that more than four out of five Native American women have experienced violence, with more than half experiencing sexual violence.

As Cole put it: “Native women are more than one-and-a-half times more likely than White women to have experienced violence in the past year. Even more chilling, Native women face murder rates more than 10 times the national average in some parts of the country.”

Cole went on to point out that 96 percent of those who had been sexually assaulted were attacked by non-Native Americans.

Cole and others are taking steps to protect Native American girls and women.

As Cole wrote recently:

“I was proud to join with several of my House colleagues to introduce the Bridging Agency Data Gaps and Ensuring Safety (BADGES) for Native Communities Act. This bipartisan legislation addresses inefficiencies in federal criminal databases and increases tribal access to those databases.

“In response to the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women, the BADGES Act also rightly seeks to improve public data on those cases while promoting more efficient recruitment and retention of Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) law enforcement. Moreover, the legislation would provide tribes with resources to improve public safety coordination between their governments, states and federal agencies.”

Take a minute this holiday season while celebrating with family and friends and let your representative and your senators know that you want action taken to protect these vulnerable girls and women.

ICE ARRESTS 90 FOREIGN STUDENTS AT FAKE MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY

In total, 250 students have been arrested in connection to the fake University of Farmington. When the university and associated arrests were reported on in January of 2019, federal prosecutors alleged the students had knowingly enrolled in the fake school in order to maintain their student visa status.

“Each of the foreign citizens who ‘enrolled’ and made ‘tuition’ payments to the University knew that they would not attend any actual classes, earn credits, or make academic progress toward an actual degree in a particular field of study,” the indictments read, according to The New York Times.

The Detroit News reported that Homeland Security agents started posing as university officials in 2017, but the university initially opened in 2015 as part of ""Paper Chase"" -- an undercover operation geared toward exposing recruiters engaging in immigration fraud.

Federal officials reportedly also arrested 21 people on visa fraud, using the fraudulent University of Northern New Jersey in 2016.

The vast majority (80 percent) of the arrests in Michigan resulted in ""voluntary departure"" from the United States, according to the Detroit Free Press. The remaining students either received an order for removal, contested their removal, or filed for relief.

While many progressive complaints didn't specifically blame the Trump administration, the incident highlighted how Trump has repeatedly been attacked for tactics used or supported by his predecessor. Ocasio-Cortez has also clarified that she opposed Obama's immigration policies.

One of Democrats' primary complaints about Trump is that he put ""kids in cages"" — a reference to the detention of undocumented minors attempting to cross the border.

Jeh Johnson, a former Homeland Security secretary under Obama, said the Trump administration hadn't invented the detention tactic.

Johnson said that chain-link fences or ""cages"" weren't ideal but were one of the ways authorities dealt with a mass immigrants that had to be transferred to Health and Human Services (HHS) within 72 hours. ""During that 72 hour period, when you have something that is a multiple -- like four times of what you're accustomed to in the existing infrastructure, you've got to find places quickly to put kids,"" he said before suggesting the alternative was putting them on ""the streets.""

Most recently, several media organizations were forced to make retractions after falsely attributing an Obama-era migrant child-detention statistic to President Trump.

Manfred Nowak, an expert from the U.N. Global Study on Children Deprived of Liberty, claimed that 100,000 migrant children were detained by the Trump administration and indicated that it was the ""world's highest rate"" of detained children. The following day, however, Nowak acknowledged that the cited number was from 2015, under President Obama.

“This is my third presidential campaign and I have never seen an organization treat its staff so poorly,” Kelly Mehlenbacher, then the state operations director for Harris’ campaign, said in the letter obtained by The New York Times. “While I still believe that Senator Harris is the strongest candidate to win in the General Election in 2020, I no longer have confidence in our campaign or its leadership.”

HARRIS AIDES BELIEVE GABBARD ATTACKS ACCELERATED 2020 WOES: REPORT

She went on to criticize the campaign in blistering terms for pushing staffers to move to Baltimore, only to let them go without notice.

“It is not acceptable to me that we encouraged people to move from Washington, DC to Baltimore only to lay them off with no notice, with no plan for the campaign, and without thoughtful consideration of the personal consequences to them or the consequences that their absence would have on the remaining staff,” the letter says.

Mehlenbacher has since joined former New York City Michael Bloomberg's campaign, joining as deputy chief operating officer. She had previously worked on Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign.

The letter forms part of an in-depth report, featuring interviews with dozens of current and former aides, by the Times. The article marks how Harris, once surging at the top of the polls, has since plummeted amid a reportedly dysfunctional and often headless campaign.

BLOOMBERG PILFERS TOP HARRIS CAMPAIGN AIDE

The article points to a campaign that has not been able to afford TV advertising and has struggled to handle attacks from other Democrats, such as Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii.

The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News, but campaign manager Juan Rodriguez issued a statement to the Times.

""Our team, from the candidate to organizers across the country, are working day in and out to make sure Kamala is the nominee to take on Donald Trump and end the national nightmare that is his presidency,” he said. “Just like every campaign, we have made tough decisions to have the resources we need to place in Iowa and springboard into the rest of the primary calendar.”

According to the RealClearPolitics average of polls for the nomination, Harris was in second place in early July, commanding an average of 15 percent of primary voters. But since then, she has declined quickly.

Now, RCP polls have her with an average of just under 4 percent — far behind candidates such as former Vice President Joe Biden (27 percent), Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. (18.3 percent), Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. (15.8 percent), and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg (11 percent)."
